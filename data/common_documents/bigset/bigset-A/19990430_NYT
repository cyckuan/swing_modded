SPORTS COLUMN: A MARCIANO DOCUDRAMA GETS MUCH OF IT WRONG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toward the end of ``Rocky Marciano,'' a coming Showtime
docudrama, the retired boxer flies to Denver on the final day of
his life to visit Joe Louis in a psychiatric hospital. When he
leaves, Marciano hands the hospital administrator a bag full of
cash to upgrade Louis' care.
</P>
<P>
   Heartwarming and dramatic, but false. It could not have
happened. The Denver bedside encounter between the two heavyweight
champions was concocted for a docudrama that only occasionally lets
truth stand in the way of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Louis was committed to the Denver hospital in May 1970,
suffering from emotional problems. Five months later, he returned
home. But Marciano died on Aug. 31, 1969. The fictional scene
serves as a counterpart to the docudrama's re-creation of
Marciano's emotional post-fight talk in Louis' dressing room after
Marciano knocked out his idol.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano died in a single-engine airplane crash in Newton, Iowa,
en route from Chicago to Des Moines. But the film never mentions
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's version of his last day, Marciano is seen in New
York, then Chicago. He plans to make a detour to Las Vegas for a
$25,000 appearance fee rather than go home to Florida. But he heads
for Denver when he sees Louis interviewed on television as he
enters the hospital. ``He definitely did not do a press
conference,'' said Joe Louis Barrow Jr., who was with his father
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Real life is often inadequate in docudramas. Fitting Marciano's
nearly 46 years into 100 minutes required omitting a lot, including
his beating Jersey Joe Walcott for the heavyweight title, but what
remained was still compelling enough to be nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   The film portrays Marciano's Dec. 30, 1949, fight against
Carmine Vingo, whom he pummeled into a coma, as his first bout at
Madison Square Garden (``Gardens,'' in a false marquee shot), but a
simple fact check reveals that he defeated Pat Richards in the
arena 28 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Marciano cuts short his honeymoon after his manager
arranges a fight with Louis three months hence. Actually, Rocky and
Barbara Marciano were married on Dec. 31, 1950, and he won six
times in 1951 before beating Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano discovers his punching power in the film when he decks
a boss who stiffed him on his pay for shoveling coal. In real life,
his skills became most apparent in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The film's version of his amateur career makes him look like a
pathetic Palooka _ ``the furthest thing from the truth,'' said
Everett M. Skehan, author of a Marciano biography. In one loss, he
said, Marciano was disqualified for kneeing Henry Lester, but the
film shows Marciano fleeing Lester like Groucho Marx speed-walking.
</P>
<P>
   The film places Marciano in the vise of Frankie Carbo, who
pulled many of organized crime's boxing strings in that era.
Marciano's son, Rocky Jr., said his father knew mobsters and
socialized with them, but he was not their ring dupe.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gilbert, who represents the Marciano estate, added:
``The Italian mob was proud of Rocky. Carbo was told to lay off
Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   The docudrama turns Marciano's cash obsession into comic book
silliness. In one scene his eyes light up at the sight of a quarter
on a floor. The film's last image reeks of simple-minded symbolism:
a sodden $50 bill lying on an airplane tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every scene was fictional, or the chronology was
wrong,'' said Rocky Marciano Jr., whose father died when he was 17
months old. ``It makes him look like a money-driven, rude,
second-rate fighter. It was very hard to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Rocky Jr., his father was parsimonious and mistrusted
banks. But that was not the sum of a life he has learned about from
his older sister and grandmother, who raised him after his mother
died when he was 6. ``He was gracious, and adored by a lot of
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Jr. said his family was not consulted on the project by
Columbia Pictures, or by MGM, which acquired the project from
Columbia and produced it for Showtime. Boxing officials at Showtime
were not asked to check the script for accuracy by MGM or the
Showtime entertainment unit. Marciano's brother, Lou, refused a fee
to help Showtime promote the film once he saw an advance copy of
it, Rocky Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   But one need not know of the Marciano family's ire to conclude
that the film makers failed at storytelling by not checking basic
facts and altering the truth when it did not conform to their
revision of the life.
</P>
<P>
   MGM did not explain its tactics in a statement, but insisted
that the film, which will have its premiere on May 15, ``captured
the extraordinary spirit and accomplishments of Marciano's personal
and professional life.'' &QL;

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
THE WOODLANDS _ David Duval's presence looms so large these days
that even his wannabes end up leading golf tournaments.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Booker laughed about stealing pages from the playbook of
golf's No. 1 player, but it was no joke what he did Thursday during
a two-hole, 4-under-par stretch that launched the PGA Tour rookie
into the lead of the Shell Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back eagles, including an ace at the 189-yard 16th hole,
staked Booker to a one-shot lead after the opening round at the
Tournament Players Course at The Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be David Duval out there,'' Booker said in
regard to how he handled the pressure of a rare day atop the leader
board. ``I was thinking, `How would David do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody did it better than Booker, whose 6-under-par 66 put
him in front of University of Texas product Omar Uresti, who had
shot a 5-under 67 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, those were the best rounds on a day that featured
excellent scoring opportunities. While more than half the field (87
players) shot par or better, nobody could post an embarrassingly
low score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course was as scoreable as I've ever seen it,'' said David
Sutherland, who was in a seven-man logjam at 68. ``That's the word
we use out here. Courses aren't `easy.' They're `scoreable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Semantics aside, Booker was his own man after a sluggish start.
Starting on No. 10, he was 1 over par after five holes, then had
lightning strike twice with the eagles as he went 6 under par in a
five-hole span. He sliced another stroke off par the rest of the
way and put himself in a dubious position. Leading any tournament
after one round means nothing. In Houston, it means even less. No
first-round leader has won this tournament since it moved to the
TPC 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it was that easy all the time,'' Booker said of his
eagles. ``But I'm a good player. I'm out there to shoot 66 every
time I tee it up.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least, Booker isn't a household name. He is a former
teaching pro at Warwick Hills in Michigan, the site of the Buick
Open. Booker saved his pennies and played the Nike Tour for the
past two years. He finished fourth on that tour's money list in
1998, which qualified him to play on the PGA Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got detoured,'' Booker said. ``When I finished college,
I started playing professionally and just didn't have any money, no
financial backing to take it to the level I wanted. So I decided I
was going to have to put the clubs up and go to work. I was a club
pro for four years to make enough money to feel like I could go out
and play.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of modest earnings on the Nike circuit, Booker
has hit it big the past two years. He finished in a fourth-place
tie at last year's Buick Open, a tournament he played via a
sponsor's exemption. Earlier this year, he led after the second and
third rounds of the Honda Classic before finishing in a tie for
third.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to go some to top what he did Thursday in a 30-minute
stretch of sensational ball-striking that saw him account for
one-third of all the eagles on the course. Despite recovering from
mild flu symptoms he has had the past few days, Booker hit driver
and 5-wood to 25 feet on the 521-yard 15th. The putt was the first
of several lengthy rolls that he would stroke into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Then he bombed in the 5-iron on the 16th, a dandy way to go from
1-over to 3-under in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   However, a bigger surprise than Booker's quick turnaround was
the fact nobody lit up the TPC.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the course was virtually defenseless, there were
lots of scores under par _ 58 to be exact _ but nobody went
nuclear. Still, if you weren't red, you were pretty much dead in
the first round. Behind the seven golfers tied for third at 68, 13
more fired 69s, including the intimidating likes of Steve
Elkington, John Daly, Jeff Maggert and Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of surprised nobody shot lower than they did,'' said
Hal Sutton, among the group at 68. ``I can't say enough good things
about the condition of the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, with ice-cream course conditions and only a light
breeze ruffling the trees, scores plummet like a breakaway
elevator. At the least, there's usually one or two really low
scores. Not so on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Uresti looked for the longest time like he would own the lead.
Numerous players fired at him after he had posted his early 67.
Sutherland, John Cook, Fred Funk and Cameron Beckman all got to
5-under during their rounds but fell back.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Uresti played more tournament golf than anybody else
on the PGA Tour, teeing it up in 35 events. Only a handful of
touring pros play more than 30 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Scaling back is one of his priorities. A few more rounds like
Thursday's, when he shot 32 on the front nine, might make playing
less often a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played more events than anybody, so I've been on the road
a lot,'' said Uresti, an Austin resident. ``That's why it's good to
be back in Texas. It feels like home, really. I love it here.''
</P>
<P>
   He would like it even better if he could camp out on the leader
board for the rest of the week.

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold got the
high-powered, semiautomatic pistol used in last week's high school
massacre with the help of a man who worked with them at a pizza
delivery store, law-enforcement officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a role in it,'' Sgt. Jim Parr, a spokesman for the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, said Thursday, noting that
the man they were interviewing had hired a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   If the co-worker acted as a middleman, linking two minors with
the owner of an automatic weapon, he could face charges as an
accessory to the crime of selling a handgun to someone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   If he had knowledge of the two young men's plans for mayhem,
charges could be stiffer. Klebold was 17 when he and Harris killed
themselves after slaying 12 students and a teacher. Harris turned
18 two weeks before the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lau, the owner of the store, Blackjack Pizza, said
he did not know anything about the investigation or whether a
current or former employee might have been involved in procuring
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Post reported Thursday that the pistol, a Tec-DC9,
went from its Miami manufacturer to Zander Sporting Goods, a
firearms wholesaler in Illinois, then to Just Guns, a suburban gun
store five miles north of Denver. The gun store closed about a year
ago, and the owner, Royce Spain, told The Post that a former
employee had sold the pistol for him at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the pistol, officials said three long guns, provided by
Robyn Anderson, who went to the prom with Klebold three days before
the shooting, were used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, 18, bought one or more of the long guns late last
year at the Tanner Gun Show, according to the Jefferson County
sheriff, John P. Stone. The sheriff said Ms. Anderson was a
witness, not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Tiffany Burk, has said that Ms. Anderson did not know
anything about Klebold's massacre plans and that during the
shootout she was caught in a school parking lot, where she cowered
under the seat of her car for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the only arrest in the case, police Thursday took into
custody a sales clerk at a local hardware store where the two young
men apparently bought bomb-making materials _ propane tanks, screws
and nails.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sowell, 50, was charged with making a false report to
authorities. The details of the charges were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
   Sowell has told reporters that he duplicated for the boys keys
marked ``do not duplicate.'' for the teen-agers. These keys are
believed to be master keys to the high school that Klebold gained
access to last fall when he was doing the lighting for a school
play.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to trace the guns comes as new details emerge about
the devastation wrought by the two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers who have toured the cordoned-off high school
said the killers walked from room to room, bombing the cafeteria,
blasting out computer screens in classrooms, heavily shooting up
administration offices and exploding a bomb that blew a hole in a
wall of the library.
</P>
<P>
   The young men had affixed abrasive strips to their trench coats
so they could strike matches to light their bombs. As fire alarms
blared and sprinklers sprayed, they strode through the chaos,
shooting with one hand and throwing pipe bombs with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The news that one or more of the guns was bought at a Denver
area gun show has put a spotlight on a corner of the gun trade.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the news, a recorded telephone message by the
organizer of a show that was to be held on Saturday, only 10 miles
from Littleton, said the show had been canceled ``due to the
politics in Denver at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun shows are held in the Denver area almost every weekend, and
buyers flock to them because they can buy guns anonymously from
vendors. Appealing largely to white, middle-aged men, vendors
advertise with signs that say, ``Cash and Carry'' and ``No
Paperwork, No Questions Asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, about the time Ms. Anderson apparently bought one
or more ``long guns'' at the Tanner Gun Show, area gun shows
experienced a surge in rifle and shotgun sales as buyers sought to
beat a Nov. 30 deadline. On that day, federally licensed firearms
dealers were required to expand mandatory background checks from
buyers of handguns to buyers of ``long guns,'' or rifles and
shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cash and a handshake,'' Bob Glass, owner of Paladin Arms
in Boulder, said of sales by unlicensed dealers at gun shows. ``An
underage buyer has a good chance.'' Defenders of the shows say they
give blue-collar gun owners an alternative to ``high end'' firearms
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the federal government estimates, roughly five
million people attended 5,000 gun shows, typically held in
convention centers, hotel meeting rooms or at country fair grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many come out to the Tanner Gun Show,'' said
Darrell Hare, president of the Denver Merchandise Mart, which has a
maximum occupancy of 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, after Denver experienced a rash of drive-by shootings,
Denver's City Council banned the sale of 33 assault weapons _
rifles, shotguns and pistols, including the Intratec Tec-DC9.
Because of the ban, gun shows are generally held in halls near the
first interstate highway exit outside of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Merchandise Mart, which hosts the Tanner Show nine
times a year, is six blocks north of the city. Most of the region's
gun shops, like ``Just Guns,'' the one linked to the Intratec sale,
are outside the city limits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last June, an aide to Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Denver, went to a
Tanner show at the Mart and bought a Chinese-made version of an
AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle for $450 in cash. According to a
transcript of the conversation released by the congresswoman, the
only question the seller asked the buyer, aside from dickering over
a price, was, ``Are you interested?''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Clinton included in his package of gun
control legislation a bill that DeGette has sponsored requiring
background checks at private-transaction gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, which is to hold its annual
meeting in Denver on Saturday, has long opposed such legislation.
Last fall, it pressured Denver to relax its assault weapon ban.
</P>
<P>
   After Denver officials refused, the association threw its
support in the state Legislature behind a bill that would have
pre-empted local gun control ordinances. The bill, which was
expected to be passed, was withdrawn last week after the shootings
in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators are trying to unravel the gun trail, more
details are emerging about the killers, and investigators said they
were setting up interviews with the parents.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a Juvenile Court magistrate admitted that the pair
fooled him in March of last year when they appeared before him on
charges of breaking into a car and stealing electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, `yes, your honor, no, your honor,''' John A. DeVita
said. ``They were appropriately dressed, nothing in their demeanor
that I can recall that was inappropriate. They didn't come all in
black.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on their demeanor and because they were first offenders,
the magistrate allowed the two to enter a juvenile diversion
program. They were to attend anger management classes, perform
community service, and promise not to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But within weeks of this court appearance, Stone said, Harris
started a diary that became a blueprint for a plot to blow up the
school. Late last year, about two months before the pair graduated
from the program, Ms. Anderson apparently bought one or more guns,
the sheriff has said.
</P>
<P>
   In a tape of the magistrate's interview with the boys and their
fathers last year, DeVita can be heard praising Wayne Harris,
Eric's father, for ``ratcheting back his curfew.'' Addressing the
retired Air Force officer, he said, ``Good for you, dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Eric can be heard meekly listing his household chores:
``Laundry, pick up the trash, vacuum, sweep the floors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you do that without being told?'' the magistrate asked
Eric.
</P>
<P>
   Eric replied, ``Yes, your honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the lack of red flags in the Harris-Klebold case,
DeVita said of the five-minute encounter: ``Both dads were there,
and that's pretty rare. Most of the time, it's moms only.''

ROLF LANDAUER, 72, PIONEER IN COMPUTER THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE JOHNSON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Rolf W. Landauer, who helped solidify the slippery concept
of information and bring it firmly into the mainstream of physics,
died April 27 at his home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   He died of brain cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information is inevitably physical,'' the kindly but irascible
Landauer often admonished colleagues. The ones and zeroes coursing
through a computer may seem abstract and ethereal, but, he told
researchers at every turn, information is rooted in the real world,
and must be understood by applying the no-nonsense laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rolf Landauer did more than anyone else to establish the
physics of information processing as a serious subject for
scientific inquiry,'' said Dr. Charles Bennett, his colleague at
IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A German-Jewish immigrant who came to the United States as an
exile from Hitler's Germany, Rolf William Landauer graduated from
Stuyvesant High School in New York and from Harvard University with
a degree in physics. He was a pioneer in the attempt to plumb the
limits of computers. In a universe ruled by the laws of quantum
mechanics and relativity, how fast and powerful can these machines
conceivably be?
</P>
<P>
   Engineers concern themselves with practical limitations of
squeezing more and more circuitry onto tiny chips. Landauer was
interested in theoretical limits: given that technology will
improve indefinitely, how soon will it run into the insuperable
barriers set by nature?
</P>
<P>
   Until Landauer's landmark work in the early 1960s, it was widely
believed that processing a single bit of information, each 1 or 0
of binary code, inevitably consumed some energy, placing a
fundamental constraint on computer power. Landauer showed, to many
people's surprise, that this was not true. As computer technology
becomes ever more efficient, calculations can be done with less
energy per computation.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still a cost. At some point, the bits must be
flushed from the computer's memory so that the machine can be reset
for another computation. It is then, when the information is
erased, Landauer demonstrated, that a certain irreducible amount of
energy is lost. This result, now called Landauer's principle, has
been described as ``the thermodynamic cost of forgetting.''
</P>
<P>
   While he initially assumed that all computers are saddled by
this loss from erasure, Bennett soon convinced him that it was
conceivable to design a reversible computer that would circumvent
Landauer's principle and operate with unprecedented efficiency.
When such a computer completed its task, one would essentially run
it backward, returning it to its initial state without discarding
information.
</P>
<P>
   Though reversible computing has remained mostly theoretical,
some of the concepts are being used to make more energy-efficient
laptops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rolf was an old IBM type who did things on the straight and
narrow,'' Bennett recalled. ``I was a scruffy hippie. He endured
that. Many people don't like their scientific ideas overthrown. But
he was very interested and eager to discover what this all led
to.''
</P>
<P>
   From his perch as an IBM fellow in Yorktown Heights, Landauer
became a kind of critic in residence, firing off acerbic but
friendly e-mail missives when he felt a colleague or a journalist
was overselling a new theory or not being vigilant enough in
weeding sense from nonsense. ``Landauer had a good nose for ideas
sexy enough to become fashionable but too grand and simple to be
useful,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Landauer was especially skeptical of the new
field of quantum computation, in which scientists are trying to
harness the behavior of subatomic particles to make extremely
powerful computers. These devices appear to work on paper, but
Landauer doubted that they would ever operate in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Current developments in the field won his grudging respect, but
he urged his colleagues to accompany their papers with the
following disclaimer: ``This scheme, like all other schemes for
quantum computation, relies on speculative technology, does not in
its current form take into account all possible sources of noise,
unreliability and manufacturing error, and probably will not
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Seth Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was with Landauer at a
conference on quantum computing in Helsinki, Finland. During his
talk on the potential of the new technology, Lloyd projected a
slide bearing that disclaimer. The audience, recognizing it as
vintage Landauer, laughed appreciatively.``I haven't put it in all
my papers,'' Lloyd said, ``but I use it in most of my talks. By
requiring that people be honest, he's done the field a great
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Landauer is survived by his wife, the former Muriel Jussim; a
daughter, Karen Walsh of Dublin; two sons, Carl of Oakland, Calif.,
and Thomas of Columbus, Ohio, and three grandchildren.

BURTON IN A LANDSLIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER AND PAUL HELMS  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ There's a good reason Jeff Burton, who sits atop the
NASCAR Winston Cup point standings, clinched first quarter voting
for the prestigious Driver of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, with 10 of 12 first-place votes, more than doubled the
point total for runnerup Jeff Gordon, 102-48. NHRA Winston Drag
Racing Series standout John Force was third. Through the first nine
Winston Cup races of the season, Burton leads Dale Jarrett and Jack
Roush teammate Mark Martin in the points race going into this
weekend's NAPA California 500 at the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has been very forceful in saying Burton, winner of six
races in 164 starts, is the best driver on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car knowledge, his car knowledge makes him the best,'' said
Martin. ``That sounds weird, but if you took a bucket of parts and
threw it out in the garage for all the drivers to put together,
he'd put together a winning race car before most. When you can do
that, you hold your future in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   CAMERON ON POLE: Austin Cameron was pleasantly surprised to see
what a little extra practice time can do. It meant a career-first
pole for Cameron in qualifying Thursday for the Winston West
California 200 at the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's lap time of 39.853 seconds with a qualifying speed of
180.664 mph edged Ken Schrader's 39.854 and 180.659 and put the
reigning Winston West Rookie of the Year in the front row for
Saturday's race. Cameron also set a California Speedway record,
beating Schrader's 1998 qualifying speed of 179.623 mph by a full
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just floating right now,'' Cameron said. ``I don't want to
get too excited because we still have a race to run. We have a race
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron said he was one of 10 Winston West drivers who came out
to Fontana last week for a practice session. He said the quick
times his car posted then gave him confidence for Thursday's
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming in we had a pretty good shot at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Chase and Rick Carelli finished third and fourth and will
start from the second row.
</P>
<P>
   FULL GARAGE: When Roger Penske built the California Speedway,
many questioned why he had enough garage spaces for 102 cars.
They're not asking that this weekend. The car count this weekend at
Fontana is more than 102 cars.
</P>
<P>
   There are 48 Winston Cup entries, almost 60 for the Busch Grand
National race and 40 in Winston West. What's a promoter to do? Put
them outside.
</P>
<P>
   All the Winston West entries are without a garage area, not an
unusual occurrence in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done this before,'' said series spokesman Kevin Green
about the open air pits. ``And it's not the first time our guys
have come in, unloaded and qualified in the same day.''
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION BILL: Bill Elliott, who stunned NASCAR in 1985 by
winning the initial Winston Million, can reach the $20 million mark
in Winston Cup career earnings this week at Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the McDonald's Ford just needs $32,451 this
weekend to join Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon in the exclusive
club. Now in his 24th season, it took Elliott eight seasons to win
his first million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did it all go?'' Elliott asked. ``It's sure a long way
from the $640 I earned at my first race (Rockingham, N.C. in 1976).
I never had a clue in the beginning that this sport would grow to
this level.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING GROOVY: Ernie Irvan has run four races over the Fontana
track, two each in Winston Cup and Craftsman Trucks. He's excelled
in the trucks, finishing fourth (1997) and second (U98).
</P>
<P>
   The Salinas native is confident fans will see side-by-side
racing all weekend. ``You can definitely run two-wide,'' said
Irvan, who drives the M&AMP;Ms Pontiac and co-owns the Federated Ford
with Boris Said behind the wheel. ``The groove changed from the
very bottom to where you can run a little higher, similar to
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it starts to get like the way it is designed, we are
going to see some good racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan also believes rule changes concerning spoilers will create
more downforce, which will result in quicker times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track records are probably going to fall. If that is the case,
we are going to race better too.''
</P>
<P>
   LEADING DRIVER: Who's the all-time mileage leader in competitive
events at the California Speedway? Would you believe Michael
Waltrip?
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of the two racing brothers, Michael has driven
1,592 miles in four events. He has competed in both Winston Cup
races (highest finish was 11th in the 1997 inaugural) and both
Busch Grand National races (highest finish was fourth in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Second in mileage is Terry Labonte, who has driven in five of
the nine races sanctioned by NASCAR. Labonte has driven in two
Winston Cup and International Race of Champions along in addition
to the first Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   His best finish was second in the 1997 California 500. Dale
Jarrett and Randy LaJoie have also raced five times on the Fontana
track. Outside of IROC competition, Jarrett's best finish was
eighth in the 1997 California 500 while LaJoie was 10th in the 1997
Busch race.

EDITORIAL: NEW JERSEY'S TROOPER SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 30:
</P>
<P>
   The racial profiling and drug interdiction offenses at the New
Jersey State Police keep looking worse and worse. It was outrageous
when state troopers were found to be stopping and searching a
disproportionate number of black and Hispanic motorists on the New
Jersey Turnpike in an effort to intercept illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out that the State Police have enlisted hotel
workers along the turnpike to spy on guests and report behavior as
common as speaking Spanish. This civil liberties nightmare has all
the earmarks of a program that has spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it can only be welcome that the federal Department of
Justice has decided that there are grounds to file a civil suit
against the State Police for racial discrimination, and that New
Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero has agreed to negotiate a
settlement. The two-year investigation by Justice initially focused
on the practice of singling out motorists for stops and searches
based on their skin color. Given the mounting evidence of improper
State Police operations, it is imperative that Justice use this
hammer to demand a thorough overhaul that will root out the
institutional racism that seems to permeate the agency.
</P>
<P>
   For years, blacks and Hispanics have complained that they have
been subject to illegal racial profiling by state troopers _ and
for just as many years, New Jersey officials vehemently denied that
such practices existed. Only last week did Verniero and Gov.
Christie Whitman finally acknowledge those patterns of
discrimination after Verniero issued a report on highway stops and
searches.
</P>
<P>
   This week The New York Times' David Kocieniewski reported on the
little-known hotel-motel program operated by the State Police's
drug bureau. The program, begun in the early 1990s, recruits motel
workers, mostly along the New Jersey Turnpike, to inform on guests
who might be drug traffickers. The program trains the workers to
report to police on travelers with certain characteristics, such as
having Florida license plates or paying with cash. The troopers
would look through credit card receipts and guest registries
without guest permission, and would even offer rewards for tips
that lead to arrests. Although police officials deny that racial
profiling is used, several hotel workers who have gone through the
training say they were told to look upon Spanish-speakers with
greater suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Given the agency's proven use of race-based criteria in traffic
stops, it is hard to believe that race would not be used in the
hotel program as well. But whatever the case, the hotel operation
offers a disturbing window into the police agency's philosophy. In
the name of crime-fighting, the agency has created a vast
surveillance network that engulfs large numbers of innocent hotel
guests. Verniero's office says it is reviewing all drug
interdiction programs. The fact that this program has been in place
for nearly a decade without a review shows how much institutional
reform is needed.

TEXAS: DEMOCRATS SAY BUSH IS WAFFLING ON GUNS  
 NEVADA: ANOTHER SENATE RACE HEATING UP  
 CALIFORNIA: DEMOCRATIC FEUD RAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Colorado school shootings, just about
every presidential candidate, announced and otherwise, has voiced
an opinion on what should be done to control such violence,
including whether there should be more gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopefuls have spoken and then moved on to other
issues, with little debate, even though the proposed solutions
differ widely. But down in Texas, a state with its own special
history when it comes to firearms, Gov. George W. Bush, the leader
of the Republican pack, has sparked sharp debate with his take on
the need for new laws, especially those on gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Bush is waffling, trying to duck a real stand for
as long as possible, a charge they have leveled at him on other
issues, as have some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the shootings, the House Public Safety Committee
in the Texas Legislature killed a bill that would have required a
background check on every person seeking to buy a gun at any of the
500 or so gun shows and gun flea markets held in Texas every year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the next day where he stood on the bill, the governor, who
committee members said had previously taken no stand, said he
favored background checks. The statement led state Sen. Royce West
of Dallas, a Democrat who is sponsoring a similar measure, to
challenge Bush to work to revive the House measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given his popularity in Texas, he has the power to resurrect
that bill,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor countered that the bill was ``flawed,'' but offered
no specifics, and argued that in any case there was not enough time
left in the legislative session to pass it. Then he suggested that
perhaps Congress should take up the matter.
</P>
<P>
   What did West think of a call for federal intervention by a
Republican presidential hopeful? ``I'm not going to get into
presidential politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsor of the House bill, Rep. Debra Danburg, a
Houston Democrat, did not hesitate to jump in. ``Smells like
presidential politics to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the editorial page of the San Antonio Express-News
opined: ``Gun control has a new sense of urgency. And Governor
Bush, who soon may find a new sense of urgency in his life, must
decide where he stands on this controversial issue. Bush's waffling
does not bode well for a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Senate Race Heating Up in Nevada
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Richard H. Bryan of Nevada announced in mid-February
that he planned to retire next year, he jolted Democratic hopes for
regaining control of the Senate, or at least reducing the
Republican majority. Hardly any Democrat up for re-election looked
more like a sure winner. So with Bryan out, how is the race shaping
up?
</P>
<P>
   Of the Democrats thinking about jumping in, the strongest
appears to be the state attorney general, Frankie Sue Del Papa. Not
only is she a proven vote-getter in a statewide race, but many
state and national Democratic leaders are pushing her candidacy,
hoping to scare off all other Democrats, heading off a primary that
would be divisive and would chew up campaign money badly needed in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the strongest candidate appears to be
John Ensign, the former congressman who came within 428 votes of
unseating a Democratic veteran, Harry Reid, in last year's Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans are considering the race, raising the
possibility of a costly, divisive primary. Most prominent among
them is Rep. Jim Gibbons, who represents the largely rural Second
Congressional District and who says he will make a decision by
early summer. He is not as well known as Ensign and would probably
have trouble matching Ensign's campaign organization and money. But
political pros do not count him out.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent poll on the race, conducted last weekend by the
Mason-Dixon organization for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, found
Ensign leading Ms. Del Papa 45 percent to 40 percent in a general
election match-up, with 15 percent of voters undecided. In a Del
Papa-Gibbons match-up, the contest was a dead heat, with each
candidate getting 42 percent of the vote and 16 percent of the vote
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks at this point as if it will be as hot a race as it
was last year,'' Brad Coker, the poll director, told the
Review-Journal, referring to the 1998 Reid-Ensign contest.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which covered 631 registered voters and had a sampling
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, did not test Ensign and
Gibbons in a theoretical Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Feud Boils in California
</P>
<P>
   The feud rages on between California's two top elected
officials, Gov. Gray Davis and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. The two
Democrats pledged a partnership when they took office last January,
but that was before Davis rejected Bustamante's strong suggestion
that the state not appeal the court decision killing the statewide
proposition mandating an end to state aid for illegal immigrants,
most of them Hispanic. Bustamante is the state's highest elected
Hispanic official.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the latest: Top Bustamante aides on Monday got a message
from the governor ordering them to give up their nine coveted
parking places near the Capitol. Construction crews needed the
space, the message said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bustamante people complained that they were being punished
for their boss' opposition to the aid proposition. The governor's
people flatly rejected the complaint _ and the order stands.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the president pro tem of the State Senate, the
ever-ready-to-brawl John L. Burton of San Francisco, weighed in,
siding with Bustamante in a hearing over whether to build a new
Governor's Mansion. His take: ``I can support a Governor's Mansion
if there are parking places for a lieutenant governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

FORMER EXECUTIVE SUES ALLIEDSIGNAL OVER FIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former officer of AlliedSignal Electronic &AMP; Avionics Systems
in Olathe, Kan., has sued the company, alleging he was fired for
exposing improper accounting practices that led to big executive
bonuses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Douglas J. Boe filed the lawsuit this week in U.S. District
Court in Kansas City, Kan., against AlliedSignal's Olathe
subsidiary and the parent company in Morris Township, N.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the allegations of improper bookkeeping, Boe
contends the company violated the Americans With Disabilities Act
by firing him in part because of a mental disability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe is seeking actual damages in excess of $75,000 and punitive
damages in excess of $10 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal is aware of the lawsuit but does not comment on
litigation as a matter of policy, said John Bernaden, a spokesman
for AlliedSignal EAS in Olathe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Boe also declined to comment Thursday beyond the
lawsuit's contents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe's lawsuit follows a recent companywide restructuring at
AlliedSignal that included the layoff of 150 midlevel managers at
the Olathe facility. The facility, which has 1,500 employees and is
the headquarters of AlliedSignal's electronic and avionics
division, also brought in a new president earlier this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Boe's lawsuit, AlliedSignal hired Boe in May 1995
as division controller and director of finance. He was transferred
to AlliedSignal EAS in July 1996, which at the time was in Lenexa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, the suit says, Boe became concerned about some of
AlliedSignal's financial practices, including the violation of some
generally accepted accounting principles. Violating those
principles would put the company in violation of Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Boe's concerns dealt with restructuring reserves after
AlliedSignal's 1994 acquisition of Sundstrand Data Control Inc.
Sundstrand was a competitor whose operations were consolidated into
AlliedSignal's electronics and avionics division. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe ``believes that these accounting practices were employed so
that Allied could `make the numbers' for the purpose of satisfying
Wall Street's expectations and triggering massive executive
bonuses,'' the lawsuit says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal's most senior executives would not have been
eligible for millions of dollars in personal bonuses if generally
accepted accounting principles had been followed, according to
Boe's allegations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe refused to sign documents attesting to the propriety of
AlliedSignal's financial practices for 1996 and the first quarter
of 1997, the lawsuit says. In April 1997, AlliedSignal informed Boe
that he was being investigated for the allegedly improper financial
practices that he had brought to his supervisor's attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Boe began seeing a psychiatrist as a result of
mental anguish he was suffering because of his employment
situation, according to the lawsuit. After taking a medical leave
of absence in July 1997, Boe was diagnosed with a permanent mental
disability known as bipolar affective disorder, a manic-depressive
condition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe was assessed by his doctor as well as company doctors as
being fit to return to work in January 1998. However, despite
saying he was willing to transfer to another facility or
department, Boe was never brought back to work by AlliedSignal and
was fired in June 1998, the suit says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boe's lawsuit alleges a wrongful discharge, contending the
company fired him because he was a whistle-blower and because of
his mental condition. The latter allegation, if proved true, would
be in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, according
to the lawsuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal moved into its $40 million Olathe facility in
September, celebrating with a ribbon-cutting attended by the
company's chairman and chief executive officer, Lawrence A.
Bossidy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, who at the time headed AlliedSignal EAS, was
replaced earlier this year by Frank Daly, who came from
AlliedSignal's plant in Redmond, Wash. &QL;

HOW WILL LAKERS REVIEW RAMBIS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The calendar shows three games left in the regular
season, and an uncertain future after that point for the Lakers,
whose postseason prospects have to be considered shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly uncertain is the future of coach Kurt Rambis, thrust
into the job on an interim basis Feb. 24 when Del Harris was fired.
When the season ends, whether in the first round in two weeks or in
the Finals in June, Rambis' performance will be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   That review will be based on a season in which the rookie coach
had to weather the Dennis Rodman fiasco, a major trade and an
insane, compacted schedule that allowed for almost no practice
time.
</P>
<P>
   A fair basis on which to evaluate a coach?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as long as you understand that there are expectations
that a team can have, as long as those expectations are real,
that's a judge of whether a coach can bring the best out of a
ballclub,'' Rambis said. ``Does he have the time to do that? Does
he have the willingness of players to listen to him? I know the
players listen to me, I know the players want to do the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no practice time to get anything accomplished. I
don't care what anybody says _ you can't tell players to do
something and expect them to do it without going over and over and
over it again in practice to build up those consistent habits. And
that's something that interim coaches in any situation don't have a
lot of time to do. And especially in this situation, with this
season, because there is no practice time.''
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times this season, the Lakers had
back-to-back practices this week, and they were regarded as their
two best sessions this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had practices like that all year long, I know we'd
be far above where we are right now,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he's letting himself off the hook, nor
will he say he's entirely satisfied with his own performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the type of person I am. I'm never satisfied with
what I've done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Passing fancy: Kobe Bryant is oft-criticized as a me-first
player, but the statistics show otherwise. He's second on the team
in assists, averaging 3.7 per game before Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has led or tied for the team assists lead in 16 games
this season, including six times in a recent eight-game span. He
had five by halftime Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way that's gonna help us grow, help us be a better
team,'' Bryant said. ``Kurt is always on me about being a great
all-around player. That's what I'm trying to do. That's what I'm
trying to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been more of accepting a different challenge,'' he
said. ``I'm just getting better at it. The more you do something,
the better you get.''

 &HT;    Mom charged with abandonment
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer and Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ Tina Marie Cornelius knew her son and
daughter were injured but abandoned them in a creek anyway,
authorities charged Thursday _ the same day that mourners sang
``Jesus Loves Me'' at a funeral for the children.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius ``observed Amanda and Dominick when they were injured
and lying in the creek bed or ditch,'' according to court papers
filed Thursday in Williamson County. She told an investigator
``that she left the children . . . and thought they were alive when
she left. She indicated she did not go back to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators who found Cornelius in Corpus Christi on Wednesday
brought her back to Georgetown, where she was charged with two
counts of abandoning a child. She remained jailed Thursday night in
lieu of $200,000 bail and faces up to 20 years in prison on each
count if convicted, said Williamson County District Attorney Ken
Anderson. A grand jury will consider additional charges, Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious crime, and it needs to be thoroughly
investigated, so that if any additional charges are filed, that
they will stand up in court,'' Anderson said. ``There is no time
now to be rushing into judgment or making snap decisions or doing
something out of an emotional reaction to a very emotional
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies have said Amanda Lee Miller, 3, was suffocated and her
brother, 2-year-old Dominick Cornelius, died of a fractured skull.
They were found April 19 in Brushy Creek south of Hutto. The court
documents did not say _ and authorities would not discuss _ who
injured the children or took them to Brushy Creek or when they were
taken. Sheriff's investigators have said they believe the bodies
were left in the creek near County Road 137 within hours of being
discovered by a Round Rock couple on an afternoon picnic.
</P>
<P>
   The break in the search may have come Tuesday, after Cornelius
went to a Corpus Christi welfare office to check about benefits,
according to Mauricio Alaniz, a Corpus Christi man who said he
spent almost five days with Cornelius before her arrest. Alaniz
said investigators started questioning his relatives about
Cornelius within hours of her trip to the welfare office, where she
used his mother's address and his sister's phone number. Alaniz
said Cornelius tried to change the personal identification number
for her Lone Star Card, which is used to purchase food and receive
other welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, law enforcement officers arrived at his
mother's home, saying they were looking for Cornelius in connection
with a child abandonment case, Alaniz said. They found her the next
day at the apartment of one of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would not discuss the specifics that led them to
Corpus Christi and Cornelius' arrest, but Anderson said the lead
came from basic investigative police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There . . . was some very, very boring, very tedious police
investigative techniques that are used to locate people in very
short periods of time,'' Anderson said. ``It was one of those
techniques that actually led us to where she was. It's just one of
those old-fashioned police things that they do occasionally that
actually pays off and most of the time it doesn't, but that's why
we do it routinely.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherron Heinemann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of
Human Services, said the agency's investigations unit cooperates
with law enforcement in ``specific situations'' when agencies make
inquiries into a recipient. She declined to say whether the
department had been contacted by the FBI or Williamson County law
enforcement agencies about Cornelius. She also declined to comment
on whether Cornelius had applied for a Lone Star Card.
</P>
<P>
   From Austin to the bay
</P>
<P>
   According to several witnesses, Cornelius danced at an Austin
topless bar, Expose(accent), on April 20 _ the day after her
children were found. Alaniz said Cornelius told him she arrived in
Corpus Christi on April 21 or 22 and spent a few days on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz, 31, said he met Cornelius at a carnival April 25 _
Saturday _ and said they spent time at a motel and at the homes of
his friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz said Cornelius told him she had suddenly decided to leave
Austin after a spat with her boyfriend. So he said she packed up
her bags, got in her car and headed south on Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in San Antonio, saw a sign for Corpus Christi and took
that route,'' Alaniz said. ``I just thought she was looking for a
new life. . . . She said she liked me and wanted to stay here and
get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Becky Alvarado, 30, met Cornelius and said Thursday,
``I asked her how you could just pick up and leave like that. I
mean, she had no job, no friends, no money. She had nothing here.
And she said, `You've got to think positive.' Those are her exact
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius sold $400 worth of mechanic's tools at a pawn shop for
$40, Alaniz said. Cornelius had been taking mechanics classes in
Austin before dropping out earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz said that Cornelius told him she was adopted and had no
family. Later, after he heard from relatives that Austin officers
wanted to question Cornelius, ``She mumbled to herself, `I don't
know if they are dead or alive.' She said that three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz said he found a box Cornelius left at his sister's
apartment. In it, he and his sister said, were photos of two
children, a pair of black baby shoes, and a purple infant hat.
Alaniz, who said he was questioned by Texas Rangers and Corpus
Christi police for about four hours, said he turned those items
over to police.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning Cornelius for several hours at the Corpus
Christi Police Department, investigators brought her back to
Georgetown late Wednesday night, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Children's funeral
</P>
<P>
   News of the abandonment charges against Cornelius answered only
some of the questions that have been asked by her family, said
Raelee Cornelius, a cousin in Big River, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's horrible. I don't know why she or anybody would
do that,'' she said. ``She's my cousin. It's difficult to think
about. She's a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Cornelius lived with her cousin's family in the months
following Amanda's birth, Raelee Cornelius said.
</P>
<P>
   About the time charges were being filed against Cornelius, two
tiny white caskets draped with pale pink roses stood at the front
of the Cook-Walden/Chapel of the Hills funeral home near U.S. 183
in Williamson County, where about 80 people filled the pews. A
double-heart shaped arrangement of white carnations and photographs
of the children flanked the gold-trimmed caskets.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, artwork by the children, including a sheet of
construction paper with Amanda's name spelled out in macaroni, hung
on the wall, next to a collection of photographs of the toddlers
laughing and playing.
</P>
<P>
   As the service began, a small choir sang a capella arrangements,
including ``Mr. Golden Sun,'' one of Amanda's favorites, and
``Jesus Loves Me,'' which the little girl liked to sing with her
step-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Some wept quietly during the service, which drew family, friends
and workers from the Briar Patch Children's Center across the
street, where the children had attended day care. A few uniformed
deputies stood at the back of the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Phil Ware of Westover Hills Church of Christ thanked
the Williamson County Sheriff's Department and the day-care center
for their compassion, and told the audience the children were now
someplace where they were safe and loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amanda and Dominick have made us better because we all know
that they deserved better,'' Ware said. ``In that sense, the length
of Amanda and Dominick's lives extends far beyond the length of
their days.''

GORDON SETS THE STANDARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG PADILLA  
 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Jeff Gordon might not have the Winston Cup points
lead, but he definitely hasn't lost his intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The driver who has set the standard for all others on the NASCAR
circuit is constantly thinking of what he can do to further
establish his dominance, barely taking time to have a little fun at
a local arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was at another one of those public relations stops
Thursday, delighting a crowd of chanting onlookers as he rallied in
the closing laps to defeat fellow NASCAR drivers Jeff Burton, Ward
Burton, Mike Skinner and Bobby Labonte at, of all things, a NASCAR
video game.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon spun out late in the 20-lap race and fell into last
place, it looked like racing's Wonder Boy just having another
bad-luck afternoon that has plagued his season. But as the crowd
began chants of ``Gordon, Gordon ...,'' the two-time defending
NASCAR points champion began to weave his way through traffic for
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be a sign of things to come for Gordon, who is fifth in
the points standings despite winning two of the first nine races
this season?
</P>
<P>
   All Gordon could really think about afterward were the two
crashes and the blown engine that have spoiled three real races
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is try to get top-five (finishes) and try to win
races,'' Gordon said, apparently uninspired by his video-game
heroics. ``We have pressure on ourselves to win every race, or we
won't win the championship. We have run our own races and get the
top fives and wins every once in a while. But we cannot afford to
have problems like we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon expressed a little jealousy over the good luck of points
leader Jeff Burton, who had white smoke pouring out of his car
Sunday as the field approached the starting line of the DieHard 500
at Talladega, Ala. But at full speed, Burton's car ran well enough
to finish 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here (Burton) is, and it looks like he's blowing up on the
first lap,'' Gordon said. ``Then he comes back, and everything is
fine. These are the things you have to work out to win the
championship. Those are the things that aren't going our way, and
that's just the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon frets, Burton just plans on taking things as they
come. He and Gordon are the only NASCAR drivers to win two races
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pressure is on the team that came in as favorites,''
Burton said of Gordon. ``The No. 24 team is not the only team to
beat for the championship, though. He's the favorite, but he's not
the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   If he as the only one, Gordon wouldn't mind. In fact, he would
welcome it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be the guy that everybody is chasing,''
Gordon said. ``(Dale) Earnhardt has been there, (Bill) Elliott has
been there, (Richard) Petty has been there. That's were you want to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not there right now (this season), and I want to be. It's
early in the season, though, and we still have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   If last season is a fair indicator, Gordon's spot in fifth place
is actually a positive. He was fifth at the same time last season
and cruised to the points championship with a strong second half.
It was a point that Gordon's crew chief , Ray Evernham, made sure
his driver understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good about keeping me positive if I ever get down,''
Gordon said. ``We won 10 races after the (Coca-Cola) 600 in May, so
I think we're fine. We have only won three races up to May. Racing
wins are what we look for.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory in Sunday's California 500 at California Speedway
would give Gordon two victories in the race's first three years.
Gordon won the first race in 1997 and was fourth last year. It
would also give him three victories by the beginning of May and put
him on the same pace he was last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good track, but it's hard to say what will happen this
weekend,'' Gordon said. ``I feel good about the performances we've
had. I feel it's a good track for us. We should be able to finish
in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory should also stop the, `What's wrong with Gordon?'
questions. For most drivers, just winning the Daytona 500, as
Gordon did to start the season, would be enough to consider it a
good season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a year like we had last year, it's real easy to
look at this season and say, `You're having a bad year,''' Gordon
said. ``We've had two wrecks and a blown engine that have been
horrible for us. We're looking at it and saying, `It's unfortunate,
and we're not having a great year but yet, we're fifth in points.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're setting there going, `How in the heck are we fifth in
points?'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has been a good-luck season after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 24 team, they run good, they make their own luck, a
and you can make your own luck, too,'' said Bobby Labonte, who is
one spot ahead of Gordon in the points standings. ``You look at
their team and figure the luck they make is their own because they
are competitive week in and week out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Gordon is till dealing with a little self
doubt. And it could be enough for other drivers to move in and grab
the title that Gordon has held for three of the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team right now is performing excellent,'' Gordon said. ``I
feel like we're competitive and in better position than we have
been team-wise in along time. It doesn't help that I've destroyed
two cars. That doesn't help. That will leave you behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep this where we run good for two races and crash,
we'll never rebound. You have to have good fortune to win the
championship.''

PAYTON GIVES SONICS CASE OF SUPERSTAR-ITIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Members of the splendid Los Angeles Lakers teams of
the 1980s not only shared five championships but an almost
universal disdain for their star center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   The aloof, often sullen Abdul-Jabbar was the apparent opposite
of sweet-faced, ever-smiling Detroit Piston leader Isiah Thomas,
except that Thomas was even more disliked on his team and around
the league.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 champion Sonics watched in dismay the following year as
star guard Dennis Johnson became what coach Lenny Wilkens termed a
cancer, trading him to the Phoenix Suns for Paul Westphal, whose
foot injury made his Sonic career 36 games and the trade the worst
in club history.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest jerk of the 1977-78 season? Elvin Hayes, who also helped
the Washington Bullets win the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird often went days without speaking to some of his
Boston Celtic teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Most basketball fans know that as much joy as he brought to
fans, Michael Jordan was pure hell on many of his teammates, as
well as franchise staffers. Jordan once so infuriated mild-mannered
Steve Kerr in practice that he punched the demi-god.
</P>
<P>
   This is life at the top of the NBA, as well as all major sports.
Medical clinics abound with cases of severe chappings that occur
among those around ultracompetitive superstar athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Not always, but a lot more than most fans know.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the sexist joke about women? ``Can't live with 'em,
can't live without 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Change it to superstar jocks, and the saying is much more apt.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have an acute case of superstar-itis. It isn't new,
really.
</P>
<P>
   Losing, however, is.
</P>
<P>
   The combination erupted Wednesday in Portland when Gary Payton
flashed his barely dormant anger after a 35-point loss in which he
contributed seven points.
</P>
<P>
   Although Payton now claims he was having a private conversation
with his agent, he is far too savvy to claim obliviousness to the
media hordes swarming the locker room when he said loudly, ``I
don't care about this (expletive) no more. I'm tired of this.''
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the remarks are only intriguing. But in context of
the long-building boil over the worst Sonic season in a decade,
fueled partly by the private grumblings of Payton and his agents
about the club's direction and his future, the tantrum was
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   His agents, brothers Aaron and Eric Goodwin, have been careful
to buff Payton's often belligerent image, which is fine by the
Sonics, who need all the help they can get to compensate for a
slapdash team and atrocious, post-lockout NBA hoops that have left
KeyArena one-third empty at times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no disguising the fact that Payton frequently can
be a pain in the butt to friends, teammates, staffers and media, as
well as John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   But since he's also the toughest guy who's ever worn Sonic
green, as well as among the most talented, and since everybody on
the team and within organization is afraid of him, the man goes
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Without Shawn Kemp to share headlines and without coach George
Karl to attract attention, Payton's ego and sense of entitlement
are unchecked and overwhelm any judgment he may have about the
consequences of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has indeed made an effort to be publicly diplomatic,
mostly by being either bland or unavailable to media. And given how
much of the burden he has borne this ghastly season, he rates some
slack.
</P>
<P>
   But Payton risks burning up his basketball capital with reckless
self-indulgence, particularly when he's been lousy in two of the
last three games, not to mention being sub-par in up to 10 more
games this short season.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the Portland debacle was when the Sonics most
needed leadership. They are desperate to win their last four games,
starting Friday night against Denver, to avoid the humiliation of
missing the playoffs a year after they won a division title with 61
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the organization spent the day furtively
spin-doctoring, which included a rare practice-facility visit from
owner Barry Ackerley, whose mere presence testifies to the fact
that the stakes are higher than a mere playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   The departures of the popular Kemp and Karl have already robbed
the Sonics of sizzle. Stories of Payton's discontent, coupled with
poor personnel decisions and poorer play, further jeopardize the
sellouts and suite sales that have kept the Sonics in the black and
KeyArena off the taxpayers' backs.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's outburst comes not long after his acid blistering of
teammate Vin Baker during a practice. While Baker's play improved
immediately thereafter (before his latest injury), damage was done
to their friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are on decent terms, one Sonic insider put it this
way: ``Gary went too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal on Thursday made a similar point a different way:
``Gary's greatest strength (ultra-competitiveness) is his biggest
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   However mercurial his play and volcanic his temperament, the
Sonics can't get along without Payton. But getting along with him
would be a lot easier if he breaks with the superstar stereotype
and considers consequences ahead of his actions.

5 EIGHTH GRADERS CHARGED AFTER TALK OF BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They seemed the most unlikely of conspirators: five
eighth graders in an accelerated academic program who shared a love
of computers and never had so much as a blemish on their
disciplinary records.
</P>
<P>
   But their conversation about blowing up their Brooklyn middle
school during commencement exercises in June, overheard late in the
school day on Wednesday by at least three girls, sounded menacing.
And so one girl reported what she heard to a dean at their school,
McKinley Intermediate in the Bay Ridge area.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, one boy was found to be carrying handwritten
notes, on unlined white paper, that diagramed a series of crude
explosive devices, believed to have been copied from the Internet
or a computer disk. In the margins, and in a piece of notebook
paper found on a second student, were the names of a dozen students
and three teachers, preceded by phrases like ``knock him out cold''
or ``kill.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials said on Thursday that the plot might well never
have been consummated, and that no bomb-making materials were found
in initial searches of the student's classrooms or homes. But no
one was prepared on Thursday to label the plans a hoax or a prank.
The students' words, at least, were strong, and these are acutely
tense times in the corridors of the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when schools in more than a dozen states have reported
intercepting plans for attacks loosely modeled on the one that left
15 people dead in Littleton, Colo., last week, officials at
McKinley were leaving nothing to chance. Rather than handle the
matter behind the closed doors of the principal's office, with a
stiff punishment of detention, the school immediately called in the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The five students, all friends and all 13, were arrested just
after the last bell on Wednesday and charged with second-degree
conspiracy, a felony. However their cases are resolved _ they are
to be tried as juveniles in Brooklyn Family Court _ aides to
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said that they would probably not be
permitted back at McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb instructions, according to someone who saw them,
contained lists of chemicals like aluminum powder, magnesium and
Ajax that could be used to make a ``chlorine fuse bomb'' or an
explosive with ``American MK 85 firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make napalm,'' someone scribbled at one point. ``Ask if
you need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no bombs were found, McKinley had the distinct feel on
Thursday of a school that had undergone an attack, not dodged one:
wading through a phalanx of perhaps 20 police officers, at least 20
guidance counselors and psychologists fanned out into classrooms.
By the end of third period, every student who showed up for class
had had some form of counseling, as had their teachers and many of
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators were heartened that attendance was high:
they said that 82 percent of the school's 1,250 students showed up
for classes on Thursday, only 10 percent fewer than on an average
day. Some students in the eighth grade, though, reported classes
that were half full.
</P>
<P>
   Outside McKinley, a high-performing junior high school that
sends one out of four eighth graders to selective high schools like
Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech, the mood wavered from anxiety to
relief to disbelief that a collection of students generally
dismissed as ``nerds'' would have pursued such plans to the point
of putting them to paper.
</P>
<P>
   Though the authorities withheld the identities of the five
suspects because of their ages, their names had raced through the
eighth grade on Thursday as if in a game of telephone. ``He's so
nice,'' Nataliya Shpits, 13, said of one suspect. ``He's the
sweetest guy. I can't believe he'd be involved in something like
this. He used to sit next to me in Spanish class.''
</P>
<P>
   Though neither the police nor the city's Corporation Counsel,
which prosecutes cases in Family Court, offered any motive on
Thursday, a number of students said that the suspects had absorbed
an inordinate share of teasing, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Cuevas, 13, said he had been told by someone who saw a
copy of the ``hit list'' that his name ranked near the top. He was
hardly surprised. He said that once or twice he had smacked one of
the suspects on the back of the neck. ``Like this,'' he said,
pulling his index and middle fingers together. ``I also do a
wrestling move called the spear on him,'' Charlie added. ``It's
like a tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Beladi, 13, said that although most of the suspects had
simply withstood such attacks, one boy in particular had responded.
``He'd write on his tray in the cafeteria, `The end is near,'
`pain,' and `death.'''
</P>
<P>
   All five boys were participants in an elite advanced placement
program, in which they took courses for high school and, in some
cases, college credit, school officials said. ``They're good
kids,'' said Vincent Grippo, the superintendent of Community School
District 20, where the school is situated.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that school and law enforcement
officials should be commended for treating the matter as seriously
as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was serious,'' the mayor told reporters.
``Planning like that is in and of itself very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that it would be up to the authorities to
determine ``exactly how far they had gone, how far they were
willing to go.''

   SEATTLE _ Dawn was setting in on the party for the ages, and
David Segui, never comfortable as a wallflower, hadn't had any fun.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners first baseman shared a laugh with designated hitter
Edgar Martinez as the M's batted in the eighth inning Thursday, but
it was nervous laughter. Every Mariner batter besides those two had
gotten a hit by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very funny,'' Segui said. ``I want to get a hit no
matter what, but you definitely want to join in on the party.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the eighth, Raul Ibanez singled. Martinez
followed with a hit. Then Segui dropped a single to center, scoring
Ibanez and breaking the Mariners' single-game record for runs
scored.
</P>
<P>
   The M's treated every thousandth fan to a run at the Kingdome. A
crowd of 22,078 saw their team punish the Detroit Tigers, 22-6,
breaking by three the previous club record for runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners trailed, 6-1, before putting up 21 unanswered runs.
Eleven came in the fifth inning, setting another M's mark. A grand
slam by Ken Griffey Jr. capped the fifth, and he added a solo homer
in a six-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' said third baseman Russ Davis, who had five runs
batted in. ``It's a good time. You don't want to be on the other
side of it, though, and we've taken our share of lumps like that.
But it's good, because we haven't been hitting as a team like we're
capable of. It was nice to see everyone come out and swing the bats
like that. There was no giving up until the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   The early innings showed no signs of what was to come, and even
the historic fifth started off routinely. With one run in and a man
on first, the slow-footed Martinez hit a sharp grounder to third
baseman Dean Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have drawn it up any better,'' said Tigers manager
Larry Parrish _ except Palmer bobbled the ball, losing the double
play, allowing a run and cutting Detroit's lead to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to paraphrase Rick Rizzs, everybody scored.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Dave Mlicki walked Segui to load the bases. Reliever
C.J. Nitkowski walked pinch-hitter Jay Buhner, bringing the M's
within two. Another reliever, Mel Rojas, hit Davis, making it 6-5.
A Tom Lampkin sacrifice fly evened the score at 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the M's had five runs in the inning on only two
hits. Two singles, a walk and a Griffey slam later, they had their
11 runs. Rojas stayed on to allow 11 runs, the most by any reliever
since the Chicago White Sox' Tom McCarthy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Nitkowski, who faced just one batter, who took the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' he said. ``I pitched just as bad as everyone else
did _ I just didn't do it for as long. The wheels just came off for
one day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, for once, had some wheels of their own. New
leadoff hitter Brian Hunter started the game with an infield
single, drew several pickoff throws as he took a lead, then stole
his first base of the year. He would add two more hits, both in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was with the Tigers when they beat the M's Monday and
Tuesday, holding Seattle to just one run. He was traded Wednesday
in time for the Mariners' 8-6 victory, and with the win, Hunter had
a series sweep. He's glad to be in Seattle, and not just because
the proximity to Vancouver, Wash., allowed him to drive home in
time for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing against these guys, you see how hard they hit the
ball,'' said Hunter. ``It really is incredible. It's a lot better
to be on the same team, because it's almost funny. I laugh at it, I
really do. It's sick _ they hit the ball so hard. Instead of having
to hold it in and put my head down, you can laugh at it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow newcomer Rafael Bournigal, who had two doubles and tied a
career high with three RBI, was another joyous parade participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had so much respect for these guys when I played
against them,'' said the shortstop, signed Tuesday from the Texas
Rangers' Class AAA team. ``I would always look at the way they hit
for some tips. It's just great to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone got in on the act. Second baseman David Bell hit his
sixth home run. Outfielder Matt Mieske hit his second. Buhner got
up only twice before leaving with a pulled hamstring, but he had a
double.
</P>
<P>
   All that hitting, and starting catcher Dan Wilson missed it. He
had the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we were swinging the bats and scoring runs, you want
to be out there,'' Wilson said. ``But there will be more days like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 23 years of the Mariners, there never had been one like
that before.

PATRIOTS OWNER REFUSES TO RULE OUT MASSACHUSETTS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (rk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The owner of the New England Patriots, Robert
K. Kraft, refused a demand Thursday night by Gov. John G. Rowland
of Connecticut that the team reject a last-minute stadium offer
from Massachusetts, but Kraft said he would continue working with
Connecticut for now.
</P>
<P>
   The men left the Capitol by opposite entrances at 11:30 p.m.,
after a tense meeting that lasted nearly four hours. The ambiguous
outcome was a bitter disappointment for Connecticut officials, who
had repeatedly implored Kraft to make a public statement about his
stadium plans as the rival bid by Massachusetts began to
crystallize in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   But these officials said Patriots executives had always begged
off, saying they were concerned about offending someone.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft went into Thursday night's meeting with his own concerns.
Consultants to the Patriots have determined that Connecticut cannot
have the environmental problems with the site solved within the
project's budget or in time for the stadium to be ready for the
2002 season, according to officials involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's target for finishing the project had already
slipped one year from 2001, and further delay imperils the state's
contract, according to the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials shuttled in and out of the talks in the
governor's office, looking alternately annoyed and worried.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Kraft left open the possibility that he would
accept the offer from his home state. ``Our goal has always been to
play in a stadium in downtown Hartford in the year 2002,'' he said.
``That was the spirit of our discussion tonight, and as usual it
was very frank and candid.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and Rowland made brief statements but refused to take
questions. Rowland said, ``My commitment has not changed. The
Patriots' commitment to play here in 2002 has not changed.'' As he
left, Kraft ignored a question about what would happen if that
deadline could not be met.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts and the
leaders of the state Legislature there said they had agreed on a
$70 million subsidy package in an effort to keep the Patriots in
Foxboro, just south of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Although the offer was far less generous than Kraft's signed
contract with Connecticut, it gave him the chance to remain in a
major market and avoid disrupting his team's fans.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, according to his aides, had become ``fed up'' with the
uncertainty bred by Kraft's silence, which organizers of the
Massachusetts effort had taken as encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Rowland essentially ambushed Kraft by arranging
a meeting at the Capitol and then summoning television cameras to
wait outside his office.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Rowland's office was announcing a news
conference with Kraft, Patriots officials said they believed that
the meeting was to be private and that no statement was planned.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was to begin at 3 p.m., but Kraft was more than two
hours late. He came by chartered airplane, and his staff cited
mechanical delays. At one point, the governor called Kraft's Boston
office and offered to meet him halfway, but Patriots officials
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland then left the Capitol on what his staff called personal
business, and Kraft had to wait more than an hour for him.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft ignored questions as he entered the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting, according to his aides, Rowland had planned to
demand a ``definitive statement'' about the Patriots' stadium
plans. Otherwise, the aides said, the governor would be convinced
that Kraft was looking for a way to remain in Foxboro.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Kraft has a chance to break his contract with
Connecticut without paying a penalty. That will be 30 days after
Connecticut supplied a report showing its progress in preparing the
stadium site.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both states said they would be surprised if Kraft
walked away from his Connecticut deal before the Massachusetts
offer had been enacted by the Legislature.

IN THE AFTERMATH OF LITTLETON, COPYCAT THREATS AND CONCERNS FOR
SCHOOL SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS for new 2nd, 21st and 22nd grafs on developments in New
Jersey school district)  (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 14-year-old boy was charged with murder in Canada, five
Brooklyn youths were accused of conspiracy, a pipe bomb was found
in an Oklahoma school and school districts across the nation were
on heightened alert on Thursday as bomb threats, talk of hit lists
and fears of more violence in the wake of the Littleton, Colo.,
massacre continued to ripple outward.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, all schools in the Hillsborough district in
Somerset County were ordered closed for Friday after several
students received E-mail messages warning: ``If we think what
happened in Colorado was bad, wait until you see what happens at
Hillsborough Middle School on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine days after the horrific shootings at Columbine High School,
there were new reports of threats, of schools evacuated, of police
officers patrolling in hallways, of young people being arrested or
suspended on suspicion of plotting to blow up their schools or to
kill or maim their classmate-enemies.
</P>
<P>
   As the last of the victims' funerals unfolded in Littleton on
Thursday, many Americans were talking about school safety, gun
control, the effect of violence in movies and video games and a
disturbing series of crimes that could have been touched off by
malicious or disturbed copycats.
</P>
<P>
   But actual violence and real bombs have been rare,
law-enforcement officials and educators say, and what has been
stalking the schools is an inordinate fear of death _ largely
fueled by the terrible images of Littleton _ that has reached
epidemic proportions in a nation that seems to have no choice but
to overreact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to react to every little thing now because we can't
separate the real from the imagined,'' said Pat Lewis,
superintendent of the school district in Coalinga, Calif., where
two boys were arrested this week for saying they wanted to blow up
their schools. ``We take no chances. Safety comes first.''
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere of extraordinary tension, daily calls from
worried parents have soared in thousands of schools across the
country; teachers have begun to lock classroom doors after tardy
bells; guards are being posted in schools at night to watch for
skulduggery, and dark trenchcoats like those worn by the killers in
Littleton are being banned, with violators suspended or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the strains, people with real or fanciful grudges have
taken advantage of the tragedy by making anonymous bomb threats by
phone, by leaving apocalyptic notes in school bathrooms or on the
Internet. Some websites have foretold widespread school attacks for
Friday, the anniversary of the death of Adolf Hitler. Authorities
have said they had to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, teen-agers have been branded as snitches for voicing
suspicions or telling of overheard threats, while students have
been arrested for casual remarks made on a school bus, or threats
mumbled in response to a teacher's reprimand. Most students have
been warned in recent days that even joking about bombs and guns
will land them in a police station.
</P>
<P>
   But in a nation with some 50 million students in 108,000 public
schools in which violent deaths have been extremely rare and
declining for years, the turmoil and anguish in the aftermath of
the killings in Colorado appeared to be necessary, both as a
precaution and a catharsis, some law-enforcement officials and
education experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Littleton, less than 1 percent of the schools across
the country have experienced a violent death on campus in the last
seven years,'' June Arnette, associate director of the National
School Safety Center, in Westlake, Calif., said. ``You're talking
about numbers too small to generalize.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added: ``Since Littleton, there has been a ripple
effect. Schools everywhere are in a panic mode, receiving bomb
threats, threats of terrorist attacks. Nobody can ignore those
things. Whether or not schools are safe is not the issue. It's the
perception of safety at this point that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools were still the safest place for kids outside the home,
Ms. Arnette said, but she added: ``We did witness what happened at
Columbine and we can't feel we're totally insulated. We can't hide
our head in the sand and say it's not going to happen here, so
let's not become complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the rational of school and law-enforcement
authorities in dozens of states and thousands of school districts
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego area, where one suburban high school was
evacuated because of a bomb threat on Thursday, police officers
were on patrol in and around 560 schools with 461,000 students, and
school administrators said they were taking Internet threats on the
anniversary of Hitler's death seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, daily calls to a state Education Department safety
hotline have jumped 40 percent since the Littleton killings,
officials said. Some have told of students wearing black trench
coats, but most have told of students bullying or using threatening
language or of notes, some containing purpored hit lists of people
to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something going on all around the state,'' said Jeff
Hodges, the school safety coordinator for the Georgia Department of
Education. ``We have kids taking advantage of a tragic situation.
You have to follow up and take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond, Ill., a town of 450 near the Wisconsin border,
Police Chief Charles E. Weidner said a 17-year-old was suspended
from school, and might be expelled, for talking about making a pipe
bomb. ``Don't come to school on Monday, you're too pretty to die,''
the youth told a girl. As the story spread, the police received 10
calls about the boy, and a bomb squad swept through his school and
home, finding nothing harmful. ``The kid was very apologetic,'' the
chief said. ``I feel sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of more serious threats in the Chicago area.
At a private school in suburban Oak Lawn, a 15-year-old was
arrested after telling two girls he was going to kill the principal
and a student and plant bombs in the school. He was arrested on a
juvenile misdemeanor charge. Rumors of a planned shooting led to
the cancellation of a pep rally at another school, in Carol Stream,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In Taber, Alberta, a town southeast of Calgary, a gunman too
young to be identified was charged with the murder and attempted
murder of two 17-year-olds Wednesday in an incident eerily like the
Colorado killings. And in Enid, Okla., a pipe bomb was found in a
school bathroom, though no one was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In Hillsborough, N.J., all of the district's schools were
ordered closed as a precaution for Friday _ and possibly into next
week _ after students received E-mail threats against a middle
school, School Superintendent Robert Gulick said. No bombs were
found, but officials said the schools would not reopen until the
source of the e-mail messages could be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are serious stressful times,'' Gulick said in a letter
to parents. ``We ask that each family use this opportunity to have
a serious discussion with their children. Please reassure them that
safety at school is our number one priority.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, N.Y., five 13-year-old boys, all eighth-graders who
were charged on Wednesday with conspiracy to blow up the McKinley
Junior High School, were released to their parents. The boys were
overheard discussing a bomb plot, and, after being turned in by a
fellow student, were found to be in possession of a bomb-making
manual, though no explosives were uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   But in Fairport, N.Y., near Rochester, the police said they
confiscated gunpowder, propane and bomb-making books at the home of
a 12-year-old sixth grader who they said had been plotting for some
time to blow up his middle school. The boy was suspended, but is
unlikely to face criminal charges because ``it isn't illegal for a
kid or an adult to possess any of the equipment or items he had,''
Police Chief Brian Page said.
</P>
<P>
   In Danforth Junior High School in Wimberley, Texas, where four
eighth-grade students were charged last week with plotting to blow
up the school, life was beginning to return to normal, despite the
presence of a bomb-sniffing dog in the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody overreacted,'' Megan Baker, 15, a ninth-grader,
said. ``I think it was just the wrong time. People would have let
it go if it hadn't happened so soon after the thing in Colorado.''

CELTICS BEAT HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ They were cool. Almost too cool. You wanted to know if
the Celtics realized what they had done. You wanted to know if they
had grasped their season sweep of the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers haven't done that. Neither have the Hawks nor 76ers,
playoff teams all of them. But the 19-28 Celtics went to Miami
Arena Thursday night, won, 107-96, and can now talk trash about the
Heat to their buddies. They can say, ``They've got a bunch of
scrubs on that team; we own them. Check our (3-0) record.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one did that Thursday night. Nope. They were cool. Why
not gloat?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play it this way,'' Dana Barros explained.
``Otherwise you would say, `Look at them getting all excited about
beating Miami.' You know, like we didn't expect to win. So, we've
got to show some pride.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed after he said that. He was near a stat sheet that
showed his 27 points, 8 assists, and 5 steals. That sheet also
showed Paul Pierce's career-high 31 points (although it did not
point out that two of Pierce's three blocked shots were on 3-point
attempts, which rarely happens). And then there was Ron Mercer's 19
points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Really, everyone wearing green and everyone associated with
players wearing green had a right to be excited. Not just because
they beat the Eastern Conference's top team three times. But they
dropped 31 points on Miami in the first quarter and a staggering 40
in the third. That's right: 40 points. On April 10, the Bulls came
here and scored 49 points in 48 minutes. The Celtics managed 40
points in 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since we started passing the ball, we are a different
ball club,'' Rick Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because good passing leads to open shots which,
inevitably, leads to good shooting. The Celtics took seven
3-pointers in that decisive third quarter and made them all. We are
not talking about ambiguous, his-foot-was-on-the-line 3-pointers,
the kind that are replayed from 10 angles. One of Pierce's 3s was a
25-footer. And then there was a 24-footer by the rookie. Damon
Jones threw in a 24-footer. When the Heat started to get a little
too close, Jones and Pierce made eye contact and, ``Damon told me I
should go back door if they played that way. They did, and the pass
was right there.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The pass was there and Pierce jammed it through the
hoop. The high point of the quarter was an 89-68 Boston lead. There
were a few smiles on the Boston bench after that _ and some boos
for the Heat _ but the Celtics aren't going to get too excited.
</P>
<P>
   They should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply thought we had our heads handed to us,'' Heat coach
Pat Riley said. He wasn't finished: ``We just could not stop
them.'' And: ``Their perimeter people actually kicked our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Barros made Hardaway look like a CYO All-Star trying to keep up
with a pro. The King of the Crossover Dribble often had his dribble
destroyed by Barros, who forced him into nine turnovers. Afterward,
Barros said Hardaway probably did some things that he wouldn't do
in 100 games. Hardaway agreed. He also had a message for the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be excited,'' he said. ``They deserve it. They
played harder than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Pitino took on the cool demeanor of his players,
saying that the 3-0 mark against the Heat doesn't mean much,
Hardaway knows better. He knows Riley. He knows that when Riley
sees green he sees red as well as Red. He knows that a loss to
Boston in 1999 is just as bad as one in 1989 or 1984, even if
Boston Garden and its allegedly rigged showers have gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' Hardaway said. ``Pat will have us ready for them
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, all Riley could do was watch the Celtics shoot
with no fear. Alonzo Mourning was on the bench wearing glasses and
a very stylish suit. He has a fractured orbit in his right eye. For
the 15,200 fans here, that meant they had to watch P.J. Brown at
center.
</P>
<P>
   It was a close game for a while (52-51 at the half) because
Clarence Weatherspoon was posting up at will, good for 17
first-half points. But The Spoon, who was a Celtic for a few days
in the summer of '97, had only 2 points the rest of the night.
Neither he nor anyone else could recover from that crazy third
quarter. The lead was cut to 6 midway through the fourth, when the
Heat offered everything they had. But less than a minute later, the
Celtics had the lead back up to 11.
</P>
<P>
   A win over the Heat? 3-0. Pitino over Riley. This is a big deal,
right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's a big deal,'' Pierce said, saying what his
teammates were feeling. ``They are at the top of the division and
we've beaten them three times, so there is no doubt we have the
potential to be in the playoffs.''

MINOR OUT FOR SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Celtics coach Rick Pitino said Thursday night that Greg
Minor is most likely out for the season. The guard caused both team
trainers to head to the court when he grabbed his right hip and
fell in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very serious injury,'' Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics won't be sure how serious it is until this
afternoon. They took X-rays of the hip Thursday night but, trainer
Ed Lacerte explained, ``because he's in a fair amount of pain, it's
difficult to do a complete evaluation on him here.'' The X-rays
showed that somehing was happening with the hip, but Lacerte said
the specifics are unclear because ``you have to get the muscle in
the area to relax so you can put him through some testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor was sent to New England Baptist Hospital Thursday night.
He will have an MRI, CAT scan, and X-ray this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Replays of Minor's fall showed that Dan Majerle was nearby, but
it didn't appear that Majerle and Minor collided. Since the
Celtics' injury list is already full, the team will not make any
roster moves for the final three games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anything left after that?
</P>
<P>
   The Heat should have known it was going to be a long night when
Walter McCarty threw in a lefthanded, 11-foot hook shot in the
first quarter. Shortly after the shot, official Hue Hollins
approached Cedric Maxwell at the scorer's table and said,
``Lefthanded?'' . . . There were some boos from the Miami Arena
crowd, but one of the biggest cheers was for legendary Dolphins
coach Don Shula, who attended the game . . . Alonzo Mourning's
injury and the Heat's poor start forced Pat Riley to revise his
policy. He had said that he would play only eight players for the
rest of the season; he wound up using nine. One of them, though,
was not former Celtic Marty Conlon . . . There was a minor
commotion in the fourth quarter. Keith Askins fouled Paul Pierce
hard at about the same time Terry Porter began jawing with Vitaly
Potapenko. Askins was given a technical . . . Pitino was pleased
with Ron Mercer's 19-point, 7-rebound, 6-assist night. ``He had
some open 17-footers and passed them up to somebody else for a
3-pointer,'' the coach said. ``And that's the first time I've seen
that out of him.'' Mercer also played more minutes than anyone on
the court (45) and attempted more shots (20) . . . Heat fans
weren't just groaning about the 107-96 loss to the Celtics Thursday
night. When Indiana beat Charlotte, it nearly guaranteed that the
New Yorkers would get into the playoffs. (The Knicks now lead the
Hornets by 1 1/2 games and own tie-breakers.) If the Knicks wind up
in the eighth spot and the Heat remain first, guess which teams
will meet in Round 1? The teams also play Wednesday, the last day
of the regular season.

LAKERS EARN IMPRESSIVE WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Memo to the LAPD: Call off the missing persons
search. Turns out the Lakers are alive and well. And living large.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing a recent trend toward inexplicably uninspired play,
the Lakers pounded the Portland Trail Blazers, owners of the NBA's
best record, into submission Thursday night at the Forum for a
108-89 rout that ranked with the best all-around performances
they've had this season.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry scored a season-high 22 points off the bench,
making 6 of 8 attempts from 3-point range, and Shaquille O'Neal
scored a game-high 38 points as the Lakers defeated the Blazers for
the first time in three tries.
</P>
<P>
   The victory guaranteed the Lakers no worse than a fifth-place
seeding in the Western Conference playoffs and a definite date with
the Houston Rockets in the first round. With the Rockets losing to
Dallas, the Lakers also moved within a half-game of Houston for the
fourth seed, and home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   With the way the Lakers have played the last few weeks _ running
up a 2-6 record and a pair of three-game losing streaks, routinely
dropping games by double digits and surrendering 100-plus points _
the commanding victory was as sorely needed as it was surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that marathon team meeting two days earlier got a few
things ironed out after all. Everything changed, and there was no
mistaking it.
</P>
<P>
   You could see it in O'Neal's grim-reaper expression and his
punishing 22-point first half. You could see it in O'Neal's dive
over the press row for a loose ball on offense, and in Derek
Fisher's diving, rolling snare of another on defense. It was
evident in spindly Travis Knight's tug-of-war steal from the burly
arms of Arvydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   And you could see it in the return of the Lakers' fast break,
left for dead during the recent slump but good for eight points in
the first half _ including a behind-the-back pass from Kobe Bryant
to O'Neal for a dunk and a 270-degree spinning jam from Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, O'Neal even made 14 of 17 free throws to go with 12-of-19
field-goal shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it was everything coach Kurt Rambis expected after the
Lakers' marathon team therapy session Tuesday and two days of
intense practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect more energy and enthusiasm. I definitely expect
that,'' Rambis said. ``That will take care of a lot of things and
get us headed in the right direction. When the fatigue sets in and
the adrenaline wears off, though, we still have to play better
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   An improved showing against the Blazers was not entirely
unexpected. After all, this was the third meeting in 17 days, and
in two previous defeats, both in Portland, the Lakers had cut their
loss margin from 27 points to six. It seemed to be only a matter of
time before they made up the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that we had made improvement (between the first two
games). We did a lot of things we talked about doing,'' Rambis
said. ``I thought we made steps in the right direction up until we
went to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the start that the Lakers had rediscovered
something in their recent pair of intense practices. For the first
time in eight games they led at halftime, and by a healthy nine
points, 54-45.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, wearing a predatory expression from the opening tipoff,
slammed home 22 points in the half, three points better than his
entire game at Houston three days earlier. But the entire lineup
looked re-energized as the Lakers made 51.3 percent of their shots
and a rejuvenated defense held the Blazers to 39.5 percent
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Stoudamire staked Portland to a quick 5-0 lead to open the
game, and it looked as though it might be another one of those long
nights. But the Lakers kept their heads, even as the Blazers took
as much as a seven-point lead, 31-24, early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then some invisible switch was flipped, and the Lakers quickly
morphed into the Lakers of old. A 10-2 run, fueled by a 3-point
play and a dunk from O'Neal, gave the Lakers the lead, 34-33.
Portland stayed within a point until the Lakers put together a 13-5
run _ with 3-pointers from Derek Fisher and Glen Rice and four
points from O'Neal _ to finish out the half.

IHOP EARNINGS SOAR IN 1ST QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- IHOP Corp. on Thursday reported a 40 percent
increase in earnings for the first quarter and set a 2-for-1 stock
split.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the number of franchisees and higher prices
charged for related equipment boosted the bottom line, according to
its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had its infrastructure set up,'' said Mike Smith, a
restaurant analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in Kansas City, Mo. ``As
operations grow, the checks get bigger but they don't have to hire
more people to open more envelopes.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant chain blew away Wall Street's earnings estimate
of 53 cents and Smith's own forecast of 59 cents.
</P>
<P>
   IHOP closed at $47, up $3.1875 or 7.3 percent on volume of
190,500 shares, more than seven times its 30-day average.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net income of $6.6 million (or 65 cents a
diluted share) on revenues of $61.3 million. Last year, earnings
were $4.7 million (47 cents) on sales of $55.64 million.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues reflect performance at company-owned eateries plus
income IHOP gets from its franchisees. It's not the same as
systemwide sales, which are sales at company and franchised
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Systemwide sales rose by 9 percent to $270 million for the
quarter compared with a year ago. Same-store sales per restaurant
dropped by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Same-store sales are those at stores open for at least a year.
Analysts consider it a better gauge of performance than overall
sales, which includes new restaurants that skew results more
positively.
</P>
<P>
   Smith expects growth at IHOP to return to more typical levels
for the rest of the year. He believes the first quarter was
unusually strong.
</P>
<P>
   He has had a ``buy'' recommendation on the stock for years,
which he explains as a rating for good companies that are not
overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both recommend ``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   IHOP will split its stock May 27. The split applies to
shareholders of record as of May 13. The company will have 20
million shares after the split.
</P>
<P>
   IHOP Chief Executive Richard Herzer said on CNBC that the
company's shares are held by large institutional investors who
aren't selling shares, prompting the chain to declare a stock
split.
</P>
<P>
   The company wants to increase the number of shares available to
the public.

LOBBYING GROUP SEEKS TO DEFEAT MANAGED CARE BILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California's main HMO lobbying group proposed an
industry reform package Thursday in a preemptive strike against
more than 150 managed care bills working their way through the
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, presented in San Francisco at a gathering of
industry officials, encompasses many of the changes under
consideration by state lawmakers. But the plan falls short of
calling for HMO liability, or the right of patients to sue their
health plan for malpractice, which critics say is key to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the association's reform list is the creation of a new
agency to regulate managed care, removing the responsibility from
the Department of Corporations. ``We're not saying who it should
be,'' said Walter Zelman, president of the California Association
of Health Plans, ``but it shouldn't be the Department of
Corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   The DOC has a broad mandate, including the regulation of
securities firms and other financial institutions. A new body
should be set up ``to regulate HMOs and only HMOs so people know if
they have a problem this is who they should call,'' Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the health plan group's proposal: guaranteeing
independent, external review of medical necessity decisions;
streamlining grievance procedures; and requiring that only
physicians or other qualified medical personnel be permitted to
deny care. ``Only a doctor should be able to deny what another
doctor has requested,'' Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   The association said it recognized the need for reform,
admitting it has lost the trust of consumers. But Zelman said the
more than 150 health bills under consideration by the Legislature
offer a pell-mell approach to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, managed care critics said Thursday's proposal
falls short and is an attempt to head off more stringent steps
being considered in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gesture,'' said Jamie Court, head of the patient
advocacy group Consumers for Quality Care. ``It may help a little
but doesn't include the one thing they need _ the leverage to force
HMOs to approve costly necessary treatments or face legal damages.
This is all carrot and no stick. If there's one thing we've learned
it's that the HMO industry does not behave without sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled Legislature also appeared
reluctant to endorse the industry plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction is one of skepticism because this is a
reform proposal coming from within an industry that has
historically attempted to obstruct reform measures,'' said
Assemblyman Martin Gallegos, D-City of Industry, who chairs the
Assembly Health Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me they're simply jumping on the train that's
already left the station,'' Gallegos said.

YANKEES BEAT RANGERS, 5-3
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Early on Thursday afternoon, a veteran member
of the New York Yankees _ the team with the $84 million payroll and
the 24 championships and the rich tradition for organization _ was
asked this: ``Who is going to manage your team Friday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he replied, after a lengthy pause.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees' interim chaos didn't involve two ailing men with
deep roots in baseball and even deeper emotions, the situation
might have seemed comical. But it is bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, the interim manager, said he will continue running
the Yankees until Joe Torre returns to the dugout, probably
sometime in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   This declaration comes less than 24 hours after he held an
impromptu team meeting following Wednesday's loss and sadly told
his players that he intended to retire after Thursday night's game
against the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the confusion had little effect on how the Yankee
players go about their jobs. Ramiro Mendoza held off the Texas
Rangers for eight innings and earned a 5-3 victory, getting 17
ground-ball outs in the first seven innings with his dynamic
sinking fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, opened the game
with the team's first inside-the-park home run in nearly three
seasons: his line drive skipped past center fielder Tom Goodwin and
rolled to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, seeing immediately that he had a chance to circle the
bases, sprinted the rest of the way, going across the plate with a
headlong dive and then returning to the dugout to catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez put the game a bit further out of reach in the
third inning by banging a three-run home run _ his third in two
days _ off the 39-year-old Mike Morgan, who entered the game with a
4-0 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 14-6, and Zimmer, who had intended to fly home
to New York on Friday, will instead accompany them to Kansas City,
where they will play a four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who is recovering from prostate cancer surgery and had a
checkup in St. Louis on Thursday, will have breakfast with Zimmer
on Friday. Whenever Torre returns to his post as the Yankees'
manager, Zimmer says he is ``going home'' to tend to his painful
right knee, which may have to be replaced. Zimmer would not say
that he will retire or that he will quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going home,'' he said. ``I don't know what that means,
except that I'm going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation is required for a great deal of what has occurred
within the Yankees' organization since Torre was told of his
prostate cancer. With his knee hurting badly, Zimmer had
arthroscopic surgery and was recovering in bed at his Florida home.
When it was determined Torre had cancer, the Yankees' principal
owner George Steinbrenner went to Zimmer's home and all but dragged
him out of bed, telling him he was needed to manage the team.
Zimmer, 68 years old and deeply loyal to the many friends he's made
in his 51 years in baseball, agreed to fill in despite his pain.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmer and Steinbrenner clashed over the handling of Hideki
Irabu at the end of spring training and, as a result, Zimmer
publicly chastised Steinbrenner, who promised that Zimmer would be
autonomous. Since then, the two have barely spoken, while the
Yankees have won 14 of their first 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Some former Yankee managers would have preferred that
Steinbrenner remain out of touch, but Zimmer, who is sensitive and
likes to feel appreciated, has been bothered that Steinbrenner has
not called him, according to others in the organization. When
Zimmer was asked whether it was true, he declined comment, adding
that he has had 51 years in the game and didn't want to burn any
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``George has been good to me,'' Zimmer said, generally. ``He
don't call me. He can do what he wants. In the meantime, I'll do
what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the pain in Zimmer's right knee has worsened. He
had another magnetic resonance imaging test on the joint Wednesday,
and late in the afternoon, a doctor reconfirmed that Zimmer's knee
is in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer will try wearing a new brace once it is delivered in the
next few days, and if that doesn't work, Zimmer intends to have his
knee replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer has said for the better part of a month that if his knee
continued to hurt, he would retire once Torre came back. He
mentioned this to his wife, Soot, Wednesday afternoon, but at that
time he apparently had no plans of saying anything to the players.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game churned his emotions: the Yankees had a 4-1
lead, and in the middle innings, others say, the first base coach
Jose Cardenal made a suggestion in the dugout to Orlando Hernandez,
who was pitching. Zimmer told Cardenal to leave Hernandez alone,
and an argument flared for perhaps 10 seconds. (Cardenal on
Thursday denied that he had any argument with Zimmer. ``Zim and I
are friends,'' Cardenal said, smiling)
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went on to blow the lead and lose, 8-6, and as the
team trekked into the clubhouse, Zimmer decided to tell the players
that he would retire after Thursday night's game, after 51 years,
and he called a team meeting. ``Last night I had a feeling when the
game was over,'' Zimmer said on Thursday. ``Something hits you and
you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, however, had not informed Brian Cashman, the Yankees'
general manager, of his intentions, nor had he spoken in specific
terms with Torre about Torre's timetable. After returning to the
hotel late Wednesday, Zimmer called Torre, who told him that
although he would join the Yankees in Kansas City, he wanted to
acclimate himself to travel for a while before taking over. Cashman
did not know of Zimmer's post-game meeting until Thursday morning,
when he was called by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   In telling the players he was retiring before speaking to Torre,
Zimmer acknowledged, he may have ``jumped the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Zimmer's plans are both clear and fuzzy. He will manage the
Yankees until Torre comes back, and then he will go back to his New
York home.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will rest his knee and then return, Zimmer is not
certain. But Zimmer fought back tears repeatedly when speaking with
reporters on Thursday, and sounded like someone ready to end a long
and loving relationship with baseball.  &QL;

ANGELS ROMP   17-1
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Andy Sheets hit a first inning grand slam and helped
the Angels overpower Toronto 17-1 Thursday night at Edison Field
before 18,346 fans.
</P>
<P>
   For the Angels the win marked a smooth finish to an otherwise
tough four-game series with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike their previous wins this week, no last minute
heroics were required. Anaheim relied instead on the long ball, and
got home runs from Sheets, Randy Velarde, Tim Salmon and Troy
Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   From the first pitch, Angels took to beating up on Blue Jay
starter Roy Halladay. He came into the game with a 2-0 record and a
0.00 ERA. By the time he was taken out after pitching just 2 1/3
innings, Halladay had given up 11 runs, all earned, on nine hits.
He took the loss and dropped to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill got the win for the Angels to improve his record to
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks began early as it seemed that Halladay couldn't
find the plate in the first inning. On those rare occasions when he
did, he got nailed.
</P>
<P>
   It started innocently enough with a walk to Orlando Palmeiro.
Second baseman Velarde followed up with a hard shot down the third
base line and into the corner for a double that scored Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mo Vaughn came to the plate and knocked in Velarde with a
single. Darrin Erstad, Glaus and Matt Walbeck subsequently reached
base, loading them for Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets responded with a grand slam. The third of his career and
the Angels' third this season. In his second at bat of the inning,
Palmeiro reached on a single. Velarde flied out to center to end
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson began things for the Angels in the third with a
lead off double. Halladay then walked Walbeck. Palmeiro's single
drove in Anderson. Velarde brought home three runs with a homer,
and put an end to Halladay's outing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the inning wasn't over. Toronto reliever Steve Sinclair was
able to get Vaughn to strike out, only to give up a solo home run
to Tim Salmon to make the score 12-0
</P>
<P>
   Toronto got their first run on the board when DH Kevin Witt
homered off Hill in the top of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Hill began to weaken in the fifth. He gave up walks to Shannon
Stewart and Alex Gonzalez and Tony Fernandez to load the bases with
two outs. He got out of the inning when Mark Dalesandro flied out
to Anderson to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels put one more on the board in the bottom half of
the inning. After Palmeiro was hit in the back with a Sinclair
fastball, Velarde reached on a walk. Vaughn singled to drive in
Palmeiro for the Angels' 13th run of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the sixth, Erstad led off with a double. Glaus brought
him home with a towering 430-foot home run to run the score to
15-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh a Salmon double off reliever Dan Plesac with two
out brought home Velarde for the Angels' 16th run.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets came up with bases loaded and no outs in the eighth and
sacrificed home Glaus from third for his fifth RBI of the night.

<P>
   They're still awfully big, though. Too big for the Rockets, it
appears.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Don Nelson may be the master of weird basketball
science, but his use of 7-6 Shawn Bradley as, to quote Rudy
Tomjanovich, ``a goalie'' was sound strategy by any measure.
Bradley, whose wingspan is roughly that of a B-52, tends to be a
disruptive defensive force even when he's simply standing around.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, better make that a deadly force.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bradley's bony, oversized knees, which are about
chest-high to a normal person, almost destroyed Charles Barkley's
hip two years ago. Now, he has added Hakeem Olajuwon to his list of
innocent victims. Olajuwon's left thigh was the loser in a
collision with the humongous fella in the second quarter, and he's
going to feel the painful consequences through whatever's left of
the season, playoffs included.
</P>
<P>
   Dream went on to play the entire third period in hopes of
getting the damaged muscle to loosen up, but the minute he sat
down, it went into a spasm. He returned for only 21 seconds of the
final quarter and was later led to the locker room to start
treatment. Trainer Keith Jones has been charged with working
miracles on him.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctor Walt Lowe called the contusion high up on Olajuwon's
leg a ``deep one'' and conceded there was ``almost no chance''
Hakeem would risk playing against Utah tonight _ as if this eagerly
awaited Western Conference showdown would have been of much real
consequence even with both teams at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   There are apparently no important games anymore, not when
everybody can woof up the joint on any given night. Even the Jazz
had dropped four of six before thumping Golden State in Salt Lake
City on Thursday evening. As for the Rockets, when you can't begin
to handle a Dallas at home, worrying about potential postseason
strategic matchups and thinking about delivering messages to your
fellow, ho-ho, elite teams seems rather silly.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rockets may yet turn themselves around and win another
world championship _ their second one four years ago sprang from a
similarly lackluster regular-season finish _ they've given us no
reason to believe it's going to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mavs wreck you twice on your own floor in a nine-day
span, you aren't exactly primed and ready for the playoffs. Bear in
mind Nelson's lads have won only four road games all season.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any solace in Dallas 91, Houston 81, it's that the
Rockets at least revealed momentary bursts of hustle on defense,
something they hadn't done in the last Mavericks defeat or
subsequent losses to the Clippers and Suns over the weekend. Rudy T
gave his lads bonus credit for effort, but maybe he was just being
nice because he was tired of griping about their lack of same.
</P>
<P>
   How depressed could Tomjanovich have been by such a step
backward after having his spirits buoyed by the blowout of the
Lakers on Monday night?
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, still a minus-11 to .500 despite winning three in
a row, are going nowhere next week except back on vacation after
what amounts to a 90-day work year. Yet they won the second and
third quarters against the Rockets by a 25-point margin.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to paint a happy face on such a fact when the
second season is less than two weeks off. But all right, let's hear
Tomjanovich try to nonetheless. He made the effort. The least we
can do is listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was good,'' he said. ``I thought we played good.
They didn't sneak up on us this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course they didn't, Rudy. The Mavs had led by as many as 26
points here on April 21. Who could forget such an ambush?
</P>
<P>
   And if the Rockets' defense was so good, why did they manage
just three steals? Dallas, in turn, picked Houston's pocket 12
times, and the Rockets' 16 turnovers (compared to the Mavericks'
season-low six) led to 18 points for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-point game, that can be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of problems, Dr. Lowe suggested only half-kiddingly
that the league require Bradley to start wearing knee pads, for the
protection of those around him. He has the most dangerous body
parts since Bill Cartwright retired his elbows.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably prudent to stay as far away from Bradley as
possible, particularly so close to the playoffs. Barkley, however,
took a no-fear posture and grabbed a game-high 16 rebounds, five
more than the guy who stands a foot taller than him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're scared,'' Barkley said, ``get a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Rockets have one. Antoine ``Big Dawg'' Carr
figures to replace Olajuwon tonight, guaranteeing several
delightful run-ins with his old friend, Greg Ostertag. At least
that should be worth the price of admission, no matter how dreary
the proceedings may be otherwise.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Perhaps the Rockets had not taken the Mavericks lightly last week
after all.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nah, they did. That is what made their latest loss to the
Mavericks so troubling, and far more frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   With that warning and their postgame self-flagellation to drive
them, the Rockets went after the Mavericks on Thursday night with
newfound respect and energy, and still struggled even to be
competitive, losing 91-81.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets lost more than just a second home game to the
Mavericks, their fourth Compaq Center loss to a Texas rival this
season. Their lead over the Lakers has been shaved to a half-game
for the home-court advantage in their now-certain first-round
playoff matchup with the Lakers, with the Rockets hosting the Jazz
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets also lost the comfort of last week's
didn't-play-hard alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't sneak up on us this time,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said, taking no joy from the realization. ``We were prepared. Our
defense was a lot better. We ran the break better. We couldn't
score on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' defense was much better, but nothing special,
especially before Tomjanovich called off the double teams and chose
to live with the Rockets' inconsistent but more effective basic
man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, their offense betrayed them. The Rockets never solved
the Mavericks' traps. And with Mavericks giant Shawn Bradley
patrolling the paint, they got next to nothing inside.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley caught Hakeem Olajuwon with a knee to the left
thigh, he left Olajuwon able to play just 12 minutes in the second
half and score only second-half two points. The injury rendered
Olajuwon, who has not missed a game this season, questionable for
tonight against the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But more than even that concern, the Rockets found themselves
flailing helplessly behind a decided and traditional also-ran with
the Jazz looming tonight and the playoffs in just 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for us to play the way we're playing this
close to the playoffs,'' said Rockets guard/forward Sam Mack, who
was asked to carry the Rockets' offense through much of the fourth
quarter. ``We have to turn it up and turn it up fast. We don't have
time to waste.''
</P>
<P>
   But with four losses in their past five games, the Rockets seem
to be losing time. If Thursday's performance is to be believed,
their defense might not have been as poor as in last week's losses,
but it was far from good enough to make a playoff run, or at this
point to believe it will turn around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready for this game,'' said forward Scottie Pippen,
who had 16 points and six assists to lead the Rockets. ``We didn't
shoot the ball particularly well. The defense we played was in
spurts. We are struggling to pick up our defensive intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a concern to us. We know teams are coming in and
scoring a lot of points against us. We have to increase our
defensive intensity. We're not playing good basketball lately, and
we're not playing enough defense to beat teams down the stretch. We
have to come out and see what's important to our ballclub, which is
to come out every night and play really aggressive defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're allowing teams to come at us instead of being
aggressive. We're letting them drive down our throats. We're not
going to go too far if it doesn't pick up. We're not going to just
flip a switch and it will all be on and everything will be working
as it should.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Rockets' problems might have been less
troubling, if only because they were unique to playing Bradley and
the Mavericks. For most of the night, the Rockets were sloppy
against the traps, ineffective inside and off-target outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was coming,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We worked on it.
We walked through it. We scrimmaged against it. We knew, `This is
where our shots are coming from.' The way that they scrambled out
there and used Bradley as a goalie, really, was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   But down by 14, the Rockets came out firing in the fourth
quarter and made a run. Mack and Cuttino Mobley nailed consecutive
3s, but the Rockets did not begin to make a move until they turned
up some defensive heat and worked for better shots.
</P>
<P>
   Mack took over. He missed his next two shots, but when he began
to use quick moves to free himself for jumpers, he scored eight of
the Rockets' next 10 points, interrupted only by a Pippen steal and
drive to a layup.
</P>
<P>
   But as quickly as Mack had heated up, he cooled down, missing
three consecutive shots. The Rockets went instead to Charles
Barkley inside, who scored four quick points.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Trent drove for four quick fourth-quarter points during
Mack's run, finishing with 20. And with 52.1 seconds left, Michael
Finley hit a fadeaway from 22 feet at the shot-clock buzzer, to
match Dirk Nowitzki for a game-high 22 and push the lead back to
10.

ANGELS ROMP TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ As if attempting to erase the demons of the past week,
the Angels came out swinging Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the team closed out a wild four-game series
with Toronto on a high note _ a 17-1 win before 18,346 fans at
Edison International Field.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have come at a better time for manager Terry
Collins, who watched his team battle back for a win Monday, lose
big Tuesday, then squander a 10-run lead Wednesday, only to be
saved by an eighth-inning Mo Vaughn home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real different type of game where all our players
were swinging the bats,'' Collins said. ``It was the kind of game
we needed to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a loss by the Texas Rangers to New York, the win
puts the Angels two games behind in the American League West. This
weekend the team will face the Chicago White Sox in another
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike their previous wins this week, no last-minute
heroics were required. Anaheim relied instead on the long ball,
getting home runs from Andy Sheets, Randy Velarde, Tim Salmon and
Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill went seven innings for the Angels and got the win to
improve to 1-1 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I beat Toronto and it's a good
feeling,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's near-fiasco wasn't too far from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you think about that,'' Hill said. ``Maybe that's
why I walked eight guys.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first pitch, the Angels offense took to beating up on
Blue Jays starter Roy Halladay. He came into the game with a 2-0
record and a 0.00 ERA. By the time he was taken out after pitching
just 21/3 innings, Halladay had given up 11 runs, all earned, on
nine hits. He took the loss and dropped to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks began early as it seemed that Halladay couldn't
find the plate in the first inning. On those rare occasions when he
did, he got nailed.
</P>
<P>
   It started innocently enough with a walk to Orlando Palmeiro.
Second baseman Velarde followed up with a hard shot down the
third-base line and into the corner for a double that scored
Palmeiro. Then Vaughn came to the plate and knocked in Velarde with
a single. Darin Erstad, Glaus and Matt Walbeck subsequently reached
base, loading them for Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets responded with a grand slam, the third of his career and
the Angels' third this season. In his second at-bat of the inning,
Palmeiro reached on a single. Velarde flied out to center to end
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson began things for the Angels in the third with a
leadoff double. Halladay then walked Walbeck. Palmeiro's single
drove in Anderson. Velarde brought home three runs with a homer and
put an end to Halladay's outing.
</P>
<P>
   But the inning wasn't over. Toronto reliever Steve Sinclair was
able to get Vaughn to strike out, only to give up a solo home run
to Salmon to make the score 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto got its first and only run on the board when DH Kevin
Witt homered off Hill in the top of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Hill began to weaken in the fifth. He gave up walks to Shannon
Stewart, Alex Gonzalez and Tony Fernandez to load the bases with
two outs. He got out of the inning when Mark Dalesandro flied out
to Anderson to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels put one more on the board in the bottom half of
the inning. After Palmeiro was hit in the back with a Sinclair
fastball, Velarde reached on a walk. Vaughn singled to drive in
Palmeiro for the Angels' 13th run of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the sixth, Erstad led off with a double. Glaus brought
him home with a towering 430-foot home run to make it 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, a Salmon double off reliever Dan Plesac with two
out brought home Velarde for the Angels' 16th run.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets came up with the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth
and sacrificed home Glaus from third for his fifth RBI of the
night.

BLEAK PICTURE OF KIDS, GUNS PAINTED BY STUDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Seventy-nine percent of people murdered by children
die by gunfire and most of the time the victims know the killer,
according to the Children's Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In a report titled ``The State of America's Children,'' released
Friday, the fund said guns are widely available to children in
their homes, through ``straw purchasers'' and on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Wright Edelman, founder of CDF, urged churches and
families to unite to give young people a sense of stability and
belonging _ and push for gun control, health insurance, child care
and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are guns the only unregulated consumer products in
America?'' Edelman asked during a session at CDF's national
convention in Houston. ``We regulate toy guns and teddy bears, but
we do not regulate a product that kills 4,600 children a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelman urged support for legislation that would limit the
availability of guns and make safety devices mandatory. She
applauded Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans and four other cities that
have filed lawsuits seeking to force gunmakers to pay the costs of
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those suits also seek to force the industry to adopt
some gun-sales measures and to put locking devices and other safety
devices on guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to grieve about Littleton. We must do
something about regulating this very dangerous product,'' Edelman
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the fund's report, gunfire kills a child every two
hours. In most cases, it says, children are murdered by adults, but
nearly a third of the 4,600 deaths _ 1,309 during 1996 _ are
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends domestic-violence counseling and conflict
resolution centers in schools and pushes a series of gun control
initiatives adopted in Los Angeles, which it says resulted in a 30
percent decline in homicides in the first six months of 1998 while
homicides in the surrounding county declined only 1.6 percent over
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Those initiatives included limiting the number of handguns that
could be bought by an individual to one per month, a measure aimed
at stopping ``straw purchases'' by individuals who resell guns to
minors, criminals and others not legally able to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   The report says Texas ranks second only to California in the
number of children killed by guns, and more children died of
self-inflicted gunshot wounds here than in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Children have little trouble obtaining guns because they can
borrow or buy them. The report says 40 percent of American families
have a gun in the home.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady Law permits individuals to forgo instant criminal
background checks if they buy firearms from gun show exhibitors,
many of whom are not licensed to make retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Anderson, 18, reportedly bought two shotguns and a carbine
at a Denver-area gun show that were used by Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold in last week's deadly assault at their Littleton, Colo.,
high school.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, tried unsuccessfully to
have state law changed to require instant background checks for
people who buy guns at gun shows. President Clinton made a similar
proposal in the wake of the shootings at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances of the youngsters are the victims in 54 percent of
cases; 10 percent of the time it's a family member, and 36 percent
are strangers, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Children are more than twice as likely as adults to be
assaulted, robbed or raped _ and 30 percent of the time the
perpetrator is a schoolmate, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman also pleaded with lawmakers nationwide to increase
funding for programs to ensure the safety and well-being of
children, such as after-school programs, child care, education and
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Although she said Texas has made some strides in education, she
criticized the state for its high child-poverty rate and lack of
initiative in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Tops on Edelman's ``to-do'' list for Texas legislators is
increasing the number of children covered under the federally
funded Children's Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
   Signed into law in 1997, CHIP provides health insurance for the
children of the working poor. Edelman said Texas ranks last _
behind every state and the District of Columbia _ in the percentage
of children covered by health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Texas House moved a step closer to establishing
a state-supported children's health insurance program to help
low-income residents under age 19. The House unanimously approved
the plan, which now goes back to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman said the age of each child in the family should not
determine individual income cutoff levels for CHIP eligibility.
That could mean that an 11-year-old would be insured, while a
13-year-old sibling would not, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, she said, also ranks near the bottom in the percentage of
mothers who receive no early prenatal care and in the percentage of
children _ 1.5 million, or 26.9 percent _ who are poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to invest in other people's children if we want to
protect our own,'' she said.
</P>

LAKERS IMPRESSIVE IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Confetti rained on the Great Western Forum floor
Thursday night, celebrating the Lakers' greatest victory since...
</P>
<P>
   OK, stop the ticker-tape parades and banner-raising ceremonies.
It was, after all, just one win, and not even a playoff game at
that. But the confetti was real, albeit an accidental spill from
the rafters in the second quarter. Or maybe it was just an omen.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly seemed appropriate. The Lakers reversed their
recent trend toward inexplicably uninspired play and pounded the
Portland Trail Blazers in a 108-89 rout that ranked with the best
all-around performances they've had this season.
</P>
<P>
   With the way the Lakers played the last few weeks _ running up a
2-6 record and a pair of three-game losing streaks, routinely
dropping games by double digits and surrendering 100-plus points _
the commanding victory was as sorely needed as it was surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable. It was fun to watch too,'' a hoarse coach
Kurt Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Fun, as in watching Robert Horry score a season-high 22 points
off the bench, making 6 of 8 attempts from 3-point range. And fun,
as in watching Shaquille O'Neal pound the Blazers for a game-high
38 points. Fun, as in the Lakers finally defeated the Blazers for
the first time in three tries.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, the victory guaranteed the Lakers no worse
than a fifth-place seeding in the Western Conference playoffs and a
definite date with the Houston Rockets in the first round. With the
Rockets losing to Dallas, the Lakers also moved within a half-game
of Houston for the fourth seed and home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed themselves what they're capable of doing when they
do play hard, when they put a maximum effort into it and when they
play as a team,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   They got there with a 52.9 percent shooting performance and a
team effort that was reflected in their 29 assists, seven from Kobe
Bryant. They got there as well with a season-high 11 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that marathon team meeting two days earlier got a few
things ironed out after all.
</P>
<P>
   Everything had changed, and there was no mistaking it.
</P>
<P>
   You could see it in O'Neal's grim reaper expression and his
punishing 22-point first half, which staked the Lakers to a 54-45
halftime lead _ their first halftime lead in eight games. You could
see it in O'Neal's dive over press row for a loose ball on offense,
and in Derek Fisher's diving, rolling snare of another on defense.
It was evident in spindly Travis Knight's tug-of-war steal from the
burly arms of Arvydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   And you could see it in the return of the Lakers' fast break,
left for dead during the recent slump but good for eight points in
the first half _ including a behind-the-back pass from Bryant to
O'Neal for a dunk and a 270-degree spinning jam from Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, O'Neal even made 14 of 17 free throws to go with 12-of-19
field-goal shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired or desperate, maybe both, the Lakers are alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a glimpse. There's more to come,'' Horry said with a
grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's really saying much good about the Lakers right now,''
J.R. Reid said, ``but we're just trying to play, not worry about
what other people's expectations are. Just get it done
ourselves.... Guys are ready, we're focusing in now, we know it's
crunch time, and this is what it's all about.''
</P>

   An improved showing against the Blazers was not entirely
unexpected. After all, this was the third meeting in 17 days, and
in two previous defeats, both in Portland, the Lakers had cut their
loss margin from 27 points to six. It seemed to be only a matter of
time before they made up the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked out butts,'' Reid said. ``We've been getting our
butts kicked the last couple weeks, guys have gotta be tired of it.
Tonight was just an opportunity for us to try to get our
self-respect back.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the Blazers had such respect. ``We lost to an L.A.
team that shouldn't beat us,'' J.R. Rider said. ``They're not the
Laker team of old, so they shouldn't beat us.''

 DISCOVERY OF PARASITES IN FROGS MAY SOLVE ENVIRONMENTAL PUZZLE  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A parasite that favors the hindquarters of
tadpoles may be a key culprit in one of the most troubling
environmental puzzles of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren in Minnesota helped set off nationwide alarms in
1995 when they discovered gross deformities in frogs during a field
trip with their teacher.
</P>
<P>
   All told, reports of missing, malformed or extra limbs have been
reported in 36 species of amphibians from 42 states.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators responded by first looking into such possible
causes as pesticide runoff, microbial infection and depletion of
the ozone layer, which protects against ultraviolet radiation that
can scramble DNA in frog embryos. Now, there is evidence
implicating a different suspect _ the lowly trematode, a parasitic
flatworm no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In two papers released Friday in the journal Science,
researchers said that even the most horrible-looking deformities
may be a natural element in worm survival strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The trematode carries out one stage of its reproductive cycle in
the gut of predatory birds that dine on frogs. By damaging the
hind-limb buds when the amphibians are sprouting legs, the worm
seems to turn frogs into sitting ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we suspect is that those frogs with the deformed hind
legs are more likely to get eaten by a predator,'' said Pieter
Johnson, a research associate at Claremont McKenna College and lead
author of the companion study.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who began his research as an honors thesis at Stanford
University, surveyed 35 ponds in California's Santa Clara County
from 1996 to 1998, finding four with severely abnormal Pacific tree
frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Water tests failed to detect pesticides or other pollutants, and
frog eggs collected from the ponds developed normally in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The four ponds turned out to be the only ones among the 35
checked which had populations of a certain aquatic snail that also
serves as a host of the suspect flatworm.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's experiments produced clear evidence that the
trematodes produced the same types of deformities in the lab as
were seen in the wild. Even more striking, the parasites invariably
headed for the hindquarters of the infested tadpoles, forming cysts
near the limb buds.
</P>
<P>
   Just how that can produce deformed limbs is uncertain.
Researchers said it could be simply mechanical displacement of the
limb-bud cells, but another possibility is advanced biological
warfare: The parasites may produce a chemical that mimics a growth
factor involved in frog-leg growth.
</P>
<P>
   Separate field experiments led by Stanley Sessions, a
developmental biologist at Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y., found
evidence corroborating previous lab results suggesting trematodes,
rather than a class of chemicals known as retinoids, were almost
certainly the cause of a certain type of hind-limb deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution may explain why some frogs have other problems, such
as matching deformities affecting limbs on both sides of their
bodies. But only the parasites fit the evidence in some of the more
startling cases of frogs with mismatched, missing or extra legs.
</P>
<P>
   Pollutants may be the root cause if it turns out that frog
deformities are in fact becoming more common, as many experts
suspect. Robert Drewes, a prominent frog specialist at the
California Academy of Sciences, keeps a 20-year-old specimen of a
six-legged bullfrog from Fresno on a shelf in his San Francisco
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that these kinds of anomalies have always occurred,''
he said. ``The question is whether they are increasing at a higher
frequency, and if so, what may be causing that.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be due to a naturally occurring cycle, but the cycles may
also be disrupted by such factors as fertilizer runoff, which may
affect the water inhabited by frogs in ways that favor the
naturally occurring parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing declines in amphibian populations around the world
are still unexplained. Many factors are suspected, including the
introduction of alien species that could be driving frogs into
waters more heavily infested with parasites. Just what's at play is
``a genuine scientific controversy'' that will not be settled by
the latest round of research alone, said David Wake, a professor
and curator of herpetology at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   While the frog debate rages on, many scientists have focused
their attention on the astonishing lifestyles of the parasites
examined in the latest studies.
</P>
<P>
   At an early stage of their development, the trematodes emerge in
huge numbers from the bodies of aquatic snails, creating clouds of
wiggly creatures known as cercariae.
</P>
<P>
   Each cercaria has a chemosensory apparatus it must use to sniff
out a tadpole within about 12 hours. When they find the
hindquarters of the tadpoles, the worms go into a resting state,
forming cysts that seem designed not to kill the host outright, but
rather produce a freakish, slow-moving morsel for whatever
predatory bird happens to wade by.
</P>
<P>
   The cysts dissolve in the digestive tracts of the birds, after
which fresh supplies of worm eggs are produced. If the bird should
defecate in water containing sufficient hordes of snails, the cycle
can start anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trematode life cycle is a wonderful thing,'' Sessions
said, adding ``It seems custom-made to produce frogs with deformed
legs.''

 MARS ONCE HAD VERY HOT CORE, INTENSE MAGNETISM IN CRUST  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprising evidence from a spacecraft flying in orbit around
Mars suggests that the planet was once much like Earth is today _
with a hot dynamo at its core, intense magnetism in its crust and
massive continental plates adrift on its surface.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a possibility that deep rifts cleaving the beds of
early Martian oceans between the continents harbored primitive
life, said some of the astonished scientists as they speculated
about the implications of their findings.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence reported Thursday comes from the discovery of a
series of broad magnetic stripes frozen in the rocky Martian
surface and stretching halfway across the planet. The stripes were
detected and measured by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft now
orbiting from pole to pole to create the first high-resolution map
of the entire planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty incredible observation, and we're all blown
away,'' said planetary astronomer David Mitchell at the University
of California's Space Sciences Laboratory in Berkeley, a member of
the spacecraft's magnetometer team.
</P>
<P>
   The report on ancient Martian magnetism is being published
Friday in the journal Science, and it indicates that Mars was much
different when it first formed from the dust and gas surrounding
the early sun about 4 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Early Mars must have had a molten, iron-rich core that acted as
a dynamo to create a major planetary magnetic field, like the Earth
has now, according to Mario Acuna of NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center _ the principal investigator of the magnetometer project
aboard the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The planet's north and south magnetic poles must have reversed
themselves every few thousand years as the hot internal dynamo
rotated, he and his colleagues believe. The dynamo cooled down and
died after no more than a few hundred million years, the
researchers have inferred from the remaining surface evidence,
leaving remnants of the magnetism frozen in the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of a series of broad bands of magnetism _ each
about 20 miles wide and more than 1,600 miles long _ was a total
surprise because it means that Mars in its earliest times was much
more like Earth is today than previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, the discovery about 40 years ago of similar bands of
magnetism at ``spreading centers'' between the vast continental
plates of crust on the ocean beds was the epochal confirmation of
the long-held but then still-controversial theory that Earth's
continents have been ponderously moving and reforming during eons
of geologic time.
</P>
<P>
   That tectonic motion is responsible for some of the Earth's most
furious activity _ its catastrophic earthquakes and its furious
volcanic eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Molten magma from the earth's interior constantly wells up in
the vents at those spreading centers to move the continents even
now, and the magnetism frozen in that material bears witness to the
fact that Earth's interior dynamo is still active.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, the earliest days of Mars may also have been
marked by a hot rotating dynamo in its interior and by epochs of
continental drift and intense magnetism _ although it most likely
ended when the dynamo cooled and died some time before 3.9 million
years ago, according to the scientists monitoring the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Mars today, Mitchell noted, the planet reveals
striking differences between its northern and southern hemispheres.
The northern half, with its vast smooth plains, lies well below the
average height of the planet's entire surface, and appears much
younger than the highlands of the southern hemisphere, which are
heavily scarred with impact craters and wide channels.
</P>
<P>
   But across the southern hemisphere, the Global Surveyor
spacecraft found the broad bands of magnetism akin to Earth's,
which appear somewhat like the bar codes on grocery packages.
</P>
<P>
   The particles of magnetism, generated by the interior dynamo
billions of years ago, were frozen into the rocks as they cooled
from a molten state, and in each band discovered by the spacecraft,
the magnetism points alternately north and south _ evidence that
polar reversal occurred on the planet just as it has done  &LR; for
millions of years on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence left on Mars of the kind of sea-floor
spreading that still occurs on Earth, because the Red Planet's
surface was so furiously churned up by impacts from huge meteorites
and asteroids during its early days. And Mitchell said Thursday he
does not think it's likely that ``hydrothermal vents'' beneath the
oceans ever existed on Mars to harbor living organisms as they do
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But to Norman F. Ness of the University of Delaware's Bartol
Research Institute, the idea is not at all impossible. ``It seems
an inevitable conclusion that sea-floor spreading could have
occurred during the earliest history of Mars,'' Ness said, ``and if
so, it could have produced deep-sea vents that were able to harbor
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Acuna too speculated that the early days of Mars saw oceans with
deep seabed vents where life might have existed and fossils might
eventually have been churned up to the fractured surface during the
long years of meteorite bombardment.

 CAMPBELL TO FILE SUIT OVER KOSOVO CONFLICT  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., plans to file a
federal lawsuit Friday to force the Clinton administration to
either declare war against Yugoslavia or withdraw U.S. forces from
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing forward with his argument that the White House has
failed to abide by the Constitution and the War Powers Act,
Campbell will bring his legal action two days after the House on
Wednesday rejected two measures that would have done the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by about 10 other lawmakers, Campbell's suit will seek to
compel President Clinton, under Article I of the Constitution, to
halt U.S. military engagement in Yugoslavia because no declaration
of war exists. The suit will also charge that the administration is
in violation of the Vietnam-era War Powers Act, which prohibits
military action without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has defined the military operation in Yugoslavia
in such terms as an ``armed conflict'' rather than a war, and also
argues that, in any event, Clinton is operating under the authority
granted to him in the Constitution as commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for the suit are murky. Campbell acknowledged that
the Supreme Court has traditionally ``dodged the issue of war.''
But he said the judge who might hear the case, U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene, was generally favorable to a similar case brought in
1990 by former Representative Ron Dellums, a Democrat from Oakland,
against President George Bush during his commitment of U.S. forces
to the Persian Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Greene ruled that the case had not yet reached the
``constitutional impasse'' necessary for the judicial branch to
intervene because the House had not voted on the matter. But Greene
ruled favorably on several other grounds, including recognition of
Dellums' standing to bring the case, and ruling that the courts
could not refuse to decide the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush eventually secured congressional approval, but he had begun
assembling troops before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the House votes _ which he forced by invoking the
War Powers Act _ cleared the way for his lawsuit and mostly
buttressed his case.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's resolution to declare war was overwhelmingly rejected
by the House, 427 to 2. Had Congress declared war, his suit would
have no grounds; but the House vote now clears the way to go ahead
with his legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's measure calling for an immediate military withdrawal
of U.S. troops from the region was also rejected, 139 to 290, which
he acknowledged hurts his argument for compelling a withdrawal
because Congress passed up a chance to demand that the troops be
sent home.
</P>
<P>
   But the House also, to wide surprise, rejected by the narrowest
possible vote _ 213 to 213 _ a Democratic alternative that would
have shown symbolic support for the administration action in Kosovo
by authorizing the air war, now in its fifth week.
</P>
<P>
   And the House passed, 249 to 180, a Republican alternative that
requires Congress to approve any commitment of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The votes to require congressional approval for ground troops
and the failure to authorize the air war aid his case, Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the House had authorized the bombing, the president would
have won in any lawsuit, but it did not,'' Campbell said. And
although the vote to require approval for ground troops is ``not
legally significant,'' in Campbell's view, ``it is powerful in
showing Congress has grave reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' refusal to support the conflict does not
mean they are unwilling to pay for it. Thurday, a day after they
refused to support NATO's mission in the Balkans, House Republicans
sought to add billions of dollars to the emergency appropriations
bill that will pay for the U.S. role in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee approved a $12.9 billion
spending bill that contains about $7 billion more than Clinton was
asking for. Republicans said the extra money is needed to beef up a
military that was in a depleted state even before the Yugoslavia
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution invests Congress with the sole power to declare
war, but ever since World War II, presidents have ignored the
requirement, relying instead on their constitutional authority as
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   During his arguments to the House, Campbell, a former professor
of constitutional law at Stanford University, cited an
authoritative source on the Constitution holding that the framers
``did not want the wealth and blood of the nation to be committed
by a single individual.''

 WHITE HOUSE LOOSENS `DOLPHIN-SAFE' TUNA RULES  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration relaxed standards for
``dolphin-safe'' tuna Thursday, deeply dividing the nation's
environmental groups and earning the enmity of two Democratic
California lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daly announced that mature tuna
caught by large, encircling nets could now be considered
dolphin-safe, a departure from rules that prevailed for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will allow Latin American fishing fleets _
particularly those of Mexico _ to sell tuna that was banned in the
United States under dolphin-safe rules adopted in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups say the new standard will help
international efforts to protect dolphins and other marine life.
But others say it will lead to more dolphins being killed as they
get caught in nets.
</P>
<P>
   Most major tuna processors in the United States _ including
processors of Chicken of the Sea, Starkist, and Bumblebee brands _
said they will require suppliers to provide tuna caught under the
old rules.
</P>
<P>
   The change follows a congressionally mandated study by the
Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service that
concluded there is no definitive proof that encircling mature tuna
with large nets results in significant dolphin mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, only eastern Pacific tuna caught by
encircling schools of juvenile fish or by laying nets under piles
of floating debris could be considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins typically school with large, mature tuna, shunning
younger fish. And while tuna typically hang under floating logs and
mats of seaweed, dolphins don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that the old rules were allowing the
destruction of great numbers of juvenile tuna, and that's bad for
the tuna stocks,'' said Scott Smullen, a spokesman for the
fisheries service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were also huge amounts of by-catch _ nontarget species
like sharks, billfish and sea turtles _ coming up with nets set on
debris,'' said Smullen. ``The average was seven to 15 tons of
by-catch'' each time the net is cast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smullen said that increased vigilance among the tuna boats has
greatly reduced dolphin mortality, and that even tougher
regulations will be applied under the new labeling requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international fleet now has a stake in playing by the
rules,'' he said. ``We're going to have observers on every boat.
We've already gone from 133,000 dolphin kills in 1986 to 2,000 last
year, and we believe we can ultimately bring it down close to
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The new labeling requirements _ which will go into effect in the
fall _ have split the nation's environmental community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be seen as consumer fraud,'' said Mark Berman, a
spokesman for Earth Island Institute, a San Francisco environmental
organization that has long lobbied against fishing methods that can
harm marine mammals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to once again allow the slaughter of thousands of
dolphins,'' Berman said. ``The only standards that truly protect
dolphins are the old ones, and we'll continue to fight for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said processors of 90 percent of the tuna sold in the
United States will continue to abide by the old rules. ``We're not
going to see dolphin-deadly tuna in this country again, no matter
what Commerce does.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gerry Leape, the ocean campaign coordinator for Greenpeace
U.S., said the new regulations are appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreign fleets have already voluntarily reduced their
dolphin kills greatly,'' Leape said. ``They're entering into a
binding agreement to reduce them even further. And they've agreed
to extremely tough regulations on sustainable tuna quotas and
by-catch reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   Leape said the U.S. consumption of tuna has dropped dramatically
in recent years, meaning that American consumers no longer have the
power to dictate terms on tuna fishing methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need these international agreements if we're going to
continue to make progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and Rep. George Miller, both California
Democrats, have denounced the new rules, claiming they are based on
faulty science. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Daly, Miller
argued that there is no evidence that dolphin populations are
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's spokesman, David Sandretti, said, ``Given the amazing
success of the old rules, she simply feels there is no need to
change them.''

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 World Rights 
 By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. and JOSHUA SPARROW, M.D.  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The massacre in Littleton, Colo., is a national tragedy. It is
also a national indictment. It should not be seen as just a high
school tragedy or a breakdown in preventive care for two disturbed
teen-agers. It is an urgent call to our country for help.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episodes of teens and preteens murdering their
classmates have sent a message that our nation is in deep trouble.
We are a violent society. How many more young lives must be lost
before we finally face this?
</P>
<P>
   We are all asking: ``Why did this have to happen?'' We don't
know for sure what drove the two teens in Colorado, but we do know
that there is no other country in the world where anything like
this schoolyard bloodshed has happened so often. It is time we
looked at what sets us apart and whether we are harboring risk
factors here that we must address before tragedy strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   To start, no other country in the industrialized world tolerates
such easy access to guns. We are paying for this with our
children's lives. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S.
youths is 12 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries
combined, according to a recent study. For firearm-related
homicides, the rate is 16 times higher. Added now to this menace is
easy access to bomb plans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had to have been
profoundly disturbed to have done what they did. But if we hadn't
made it so easy for them, maybe they would have started by slashing
tires or throwing bricks through school windows _ and maybe
somebody would have noticed before lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Access to violent television and video games has also exacted
its price. As far back as the early '60s, Albert Bandura, a
psychology professor at Stanford University, demonstrated that
after being exposed to violence on television, young children will
spontaneously introduce new aggression into their play. If a child
spends hours shooting a virtual gun at a virtual human target _ the
goal being to splatter virtual brains, intestines and blood on the
screen _ isn't it common sense that at some point the taboo against
this behavior will be eroded?
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold belong to the first generation of children
who grew up from the beginning with such games and with the new
permissiveness for televised violence. If we can't change the
television and toy industries, we certainly can hold ourselves as
parents responsible to know _ and to say no. Do you know what your
own children are watching?
</P>
<P>
   To do their jobs, though, parents need more support than they
are getting. Families today are dealing with more stress than ever
before. Often both parents need to work full-time, and very few
workplaces can be seen as family-friendly. Parents are struggling
to get home in time to discipline, to model values for their
children with their own behavior and to foster self-acceptance in
their children.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that families can't do all of this on their own. When
will we stop clinging to this outdated notion and take some steps
toward helping parents and children?
</P>
<P>
   Without paid parental leave in the first months of a child's
life, most parents cannot afford the ``luxury'' of caring for their
infant at this critical stage when attachment to other human beings
is first set in motion. We can no longer risk depriving children of
this early basis for intimacy and eventually self-esteem. We are
facing the cost of raising children whose sense of self and
connection to others is too tentative to withstand the taunting of
later years.
</P>
<P>
   When parents do notice signs of trouble, they often can't turn
to a professional for help because they lack adequate health
insurance to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to avert future tragedies, we will have to include
these and other ways of supporting parents in a new definition of
community.
</P>
<P>
   When children reach the school years, they need a community more
than ever. The school day ends at 2 or 3 p.m., leaving several
unsupervised hours every day for children of working parents.
Children need either longer school days or afterschool activities _
in community organizations, church groups or schools _ that
continue until at least 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris have taught us that children also need a
community to provide them with opportunities for acceptance in as
wide a range of activities as possible, so that they will not have
to seek out acceptance and affirmation in racist hate groups and
cults.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are an integral part of the solution, and we are asking
them to do much more than ever before. Yet we can't expect them to
do it if we don't provide them with the means they need. We must
revive our children's respect for their teachers by demonstrating
our own _ and show that we mean it by providing the funds and
support that teachers deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Our schools can no longer tolerate bullying or hatred based on
differences. Teachers must help children take pride in the
activities in which they excel, channel their creative energies
constructively and find acceptance within themselves and from their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, like families, are where children learn _ more from
action than from words _ what our society's values are. Do we even
know what these are anymore?
</P>
<P>
   By neglecting our children, our families, our communities, we
are teaching our children that money, power and aggression come
first. If we really have given in to ``every man for himself,''
then this is what our children will learn. We will deserve, more
than they, the human jungle they will inherit.
</P>
<P>
   We must face what has changed in our world, what must change and
what must be preserved. We have known about most of these risk
factors _ and what to do about many of them _ for years. We should
now turn our outrage into a resolve to act. Many of the solutions
are within our reach.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy in Colorado is a call to arms for us all _ not to
the firearms which increasingly are being recognized as one part of
the problem, but to human arms which can envelop the families who
are raising angry, neglected children. We need to respond to this
call to arms with the embrace of community, workplace and society
at large.
</P>
<P>
   We must help families nurture their young safely and
responsively, modeling our altruism, accountability and caring _
before these values are lost.

<P>
   The massacre in Littleton, Colo., is a national tragedy. It is
also a national indictment. It should not be seen as just a high
school tragedy or a breakdown in preventive care for two disturbed
teen-agers. It is an urgent call to our country for help.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episodes of teens and preteens murdering their
classmates have sent a message that our nation is in deep trouble.
We are a violent society. How many more young lives must be lost
before we finally face this?
</P>
<P>
   We are all asking: ``Why did this have to happen?'' We don't
know for sure what drove the two teens in Colorado, but we do know
that there is no other country in the world where anything like
this schoolyard bloodshed has happened so often. It is time we
looked at what sets us apart and whether we are harboring risk
factors here that we must address before tragedy strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   To start, no other country in the industrialized world tolerates
such easy access to guns. We are paying for this with our
children's lives. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S.
youths is 12 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries
combined, according to a recent study. For firearm-related
homicides, the rate is 16 times higher. Added now to this menace is
easy access to bomb plans on the Internet.

MISUSING SCRIPTURE FOR NARROW GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pinched and pernicious spirit of religious exclusivity made
a recent appearance in Alabama, and it's instructive to see what
this new effort to misuse the Bible reveals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago a court there stopped an effort to create a
small town in which organizers wanted to use the Ten Commandments
and the teachings of Jesus as their only laws. There would be a
voluntary mayor, with the 600 residents of the new city of
Brooksville composing the city council. Citizens would provide
their own protection through some kind of community watch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judge was fortunate. He was able to throw out this
boneheaded bid on grounds unrelated to its theological naivete
because representatives of the 160 people who signed a petition in
favor of forming the town (versus 380 against) failed to meet even
the minimum standards state law requires for an incorporation vote.
But he said they can try again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One special bit of oddness was that none of the supporters
showed up for the court hearing, though 20 opponents did. Beyond
that, the Associated Press reporter who covered the event in nearby
Decatur was unable to find the four men behind the incorporation
effort, despite trying to contact them at home and work. Maybe
they've moved to one of the Middle East theocracies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A possible insight into what motivates them, however, came from
the mayor of Priceville, a small town within which much of what
would become Brooksville now is located. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One of their big issues,'' says Mayor Melvin Duran, ``is that
we won't let them shoot guns off their back porch.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe that's all there is to this. But let's not easily
dismiss the group's proposal that the Bible be the only lawbook.
The Bible has been misunderstood and abused in countless ways for
centuries. Because Jews and Christians view scripture as God's
word, the Bible often has become a weapon to beat others into
submitting to some narrow theological view. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Disclosure: As a mainline Christian, I believe that the Bible
is God's authoritative word for my life and an unparalleled witness
to God's creating, saving and sustaining action. But I'm not among
the literalists, who argue that every word in the Bible is
historically and scientifically inerrant.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One problem with designating the Ten Commandments and Jesus'
teachings as the only laws is trying to take what was written long
centuries ago and apply it to today. It can be done, but not
without serious study. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when one of the Ten Commandments says in the King James
Version of Deuteronomy 5:17, ``Thou shalt not kill,'' Jews and
Christians must decide whether that's meant as an eternal and
inclusive prohibition against killing humans (including those in
prison for murder), quail, ants, germs and goldfish or whether it
means something short of that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Jesus tells a rich young ruler in Luke 18:22 (of the New
Revised Standard Version) to ``sell all that you own and distribute
the money to the poor,'' is he also giving that order to Christians
today? Or is he speaking a larger truth for which his counsel to
the ruler is just the vehicle? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A similar question must be asked of the Jesus teaching that says
if your eye causes you to sin pluck it out, and if your hand is
similarly guilty, cut it off. Will the people of Brooksville
mutilate themselves to atone for their inevitable sins or, instead,
will they be selective about which teachings of Jesus to take
literally? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of ``Theology Today,'' the Rev. Eugene
Peterson, whose popular paraphrase of the New Testament is called
``The Message,'' has a wonderful essay about the Bible called ``Eat
This Book.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only when we ingest the Bible through rigorous interpretative
study, he says, can it form us into truly spiritual people.
Christians, he says, ``do not simply learn or study or use
Scripture; we assimilate it, take it into our lives in such a way
that it gets metabolized into acts of love. . .'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub for folks who want to create Brooksville. They
are using scripture for narrow purposes. Ultimately, sacred writ
doesn't allow that, for not only do we read it, it reads us. In
that way God's word (not unlike the way the Bible says God's spoken
word created the world) forms people who can live together in
healthy community without needing to hide behind theocratic walls
of fear. &QL;

 &HT;    IN EUROPE, HIGH-FLYING SUPPORT FOR NATO AIR STRIKES GETS SHAKIER

<P>
   DRESDEN, Germany _ Theodore Rieger remembers Europe's last war,
particularly two days near the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:30 on the night of the first day, dazzling flares
began floating down from the sky over Dresden's baroque spires and
towers. It became bright as day, bright enough for people on the
ground to see the bombay doors open on the bellies of the aircraft
above.
</P>
<P>
   In two waves, more than 750 British warplanes dropped more than
2,600 tons of explosives and phosphorus, heating the city center to
nearly 1,800 degrees. The inferno sucked the oxygen from the nearby
air, causing hurricane-force winds.
</P>
<P>
   Just after noon the next day, more than 300 American B-17s came
to finish the work with 771 tons of explosives. Nearly 40,000 men,
women and children were killed during the attacks of Feb. 13-14,
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as Florence on the Elbe, the destruction of Dresden
was so complete that officials at the end of the war wondered if it
wouldn't make more sense to bulldoze its remains rather than trying
to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, my wife and I lived,'' says Rieger, then a worker in
a munitions factory. ``But we were the lucky ones.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, these two days have revisited Rieger, now 92.
</P>
<P>
   Each night he watches the war in Yugoslavia on television. Each
morning, he switches on the radio for updates. Through the day he
reads newspapers seeking meaning to what he has heard and seen.
</P>
<P>
   The news is breaking his heart. ``When I see what is happening
today, I ask myself again and again, 'Is there no other way?''' he
says during a visit to a meeting place here for elderly people.
``Can't people learn anything? Don't they remember?'' he asks. His
gray-green eyes, magnified by powerful glasses, go still. ``I have
to admit that I doubt the human race.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Europe's political leaders express unusual resolve in
their commitment to bring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
heel, people in the streets and cafes are not so homogenous in
their views as the war progresses through its second month.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, NATO's attack has enjoyed widespread support. People
who live in the alliance's countries support the attack by a
two-to-one margin, polls show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Europeans also express profound regret over the war and
concerns about where it is leading them -- including fresh fears of
a confrontation between Russia and the United States or a even
third world war.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface of support for NATO rests considerable
uneasiness over the prospect of invading Yugoslavia with ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial majorities in Germany, Italy and Greece oppose a
land war, a reality that could force leaders into the unenviable
position of choosing between the imperatives of NATO solidarity and
political viability.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the scale among big European powers are
Britain and France. Majorities in both countries favor sending in
the tanks and troops, polls show.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Jacques Bousquet made coffee for his first
customer for the day at his cafe in Boulogne-Billancourt, a Paris
suburb. ``You know, nobody wanted this,'' he says, filling a small
white pitcher with hot milk for the coffee. ``Maybe there should
have been more talking, maybe there should have been more
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this diplomacy was going nowhere, nowhere,'' he says. ``If
NATO did not act, it would be as a joke. Now I don't think
Milosevic is laughing. Maybe a few thousand tanks and NATO soldiers
would make laugh a little less.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bousquet -- repeating a sentiment often expressed
in France -- says he would be happier if Europe weren't so
dependent on the Americans. ``This is for Europe to sort out, no?''
he says. ``The Americans are the only superpower, and Europe is
weak -- so I guess we have no choice. But one day, will America
rule the world?''
</P>
<P>
   He responds to his own question with a groan.
</P>
<P>
   Such misgivings seem to nag at France, which long has had a
love-hate relationship with the United States. ``The Americans are
our allies,'' the leftist news magazine L'Evenement du Jeudi said
in a recent editorial. ``But they must not become our bosses, our
brains, our memories.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, these concerns have not dampened French enthusiasm for
the NATO attack. ``I think the shift in French public opinion has
been noticeable and I would even say spectacular,'' said Dominique
Moisi of the French Institute for International Relations. ``The
key element is probably the images of refugees on French television
and a kind of humanitarian reaction: We can't allow that to take
place.''
</P>
<P>
   With strong support at home, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has been the most hawkish of NATO leaders. His ministers mince no
words in their daily assault on Milosevic, whom they portray as a
mini-dictator in the mold of a fledgling Adolf Hitler. One poll put
support for a ground war in Britain, which has been struggling for
its identity in post-Cold War Europe, at 54 percent -- second only
to France. Indeed, people in Britain seem impatient with NATO for
taking so long to roll the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that if NATO's major powers decide to
invade Yugoslavia, the shakier members will howl but not stand in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect any country to exercise a veto if the U.S.,
U.K. and France are ready to go in,'' said Michael Clarke, the
director of Defence Studies at King's College in London. ``The fact
of the matter is that I cannot imagine that Germany would be
opposed, but Germany would be divided.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such a division could be perilous to the fragile young
coalition government of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
Left-wingers among Schroeder's Social Democrats for weeks have
urged NATO to end its bombing campaign. The junior coalition party,
the ecologist Greens, also are deeply divided on the issue and
would need little impetus to pull out of the coalition causing the
government to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's tenuous hold on power at home is often seen as the
driving force behind his efforts to find a way end the war. In
early April, Germany floated a peace plan, which fell short of U.S.
demands, and Schroeder has taken an assertive role to engage Russia
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who was an anti-war activist in the 1968 student
uprisings in Europe, has held his government together by arguing
that Germany's interest in NATO is more important than the
country's concerns about the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd expect Schroeder to continue doing what he has done,''
Clarke said. ``He'll tell the other parties that they cannot gamble
with NATO's future.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Opinions in Germany, which is engaged in its first military
action since World War II, tend to be colored by history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people had done something similar against Hitler in 1933,
much would not have happened,'' said Angela Brauer, a partner in a
Berlin yachting school, who supports the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Brauer, as with many others interviewed, sees an analogy between
the Nazi's treatment of Jews and the Serb forces' treatment of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. ``In the beginning of the '30s, Germany
started isolating the Jews, and nobody did anything,'' she said.
``The same would have happened to the people in Kosovo if NATO had
not reacted.''
</P>
<P>
   She would support a ground war, but she is in a minority. More
than 60 percent of Germans oppose a ground war. Opinion in the
formerly socialist east tend to be more solidly against the war,
while people in the west tend to share closer feelings to those of
France and England.
</P>
<P>
   Across Germany, opponents of the war have taken to the streets,
but the demonstrations have been peaceful -- so far. In mid-April,
between 7,000 and 10,000 people held a silent march here in Dresden
against the war.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Among NATO's allies, only Greece has virtually unified public
opinion. Unfortunately for NATO, it's against the war.
</P>
<P>
   Greece already has ruled out its participation in a ground war.
``Greece will not participate in a ground intervention and will
even disapprove of it,'' Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou
said in an interview published Thursday in a Paris daily newspaper.
``We are uncertain of the effectiveness of such an operation. No
one thinks NATO would be unable to win, but the consequences would
be terrible for the co-existence of the people of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Greeks worry about being entangled in a wider Balkan war and
find kinship with Serbs as fellow Christian Orthodox, whose leaders
often promote age-old paranoia about losing ground to Muslims and
bowing to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek government has so far managed to balance dissent by
stressing its obligation to NATO and its desire to improve
relations with the rest of Europe. Greece is eager to please the
Western European powers with an eye toward being admitted to the
Euro club with its single currency and unified monetary system.
</P>
<P>
   However, with NATO attacks continuing and talks of ground troops
being heard more and more, tensions in Greece are rising, making
the task for the government even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the opposition turned violent. In Athens, a woman was
killed and a man was seriously injured Tuesday in a bomb attack on
a hotel by a leftist group protesting NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, hundreds of Greek railway employees and Communist
Party members in the port city of Thessaloniki briefly detained a
train carrying NATO tanks and British soldiers to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes are unsettling reminders of the region's bloody past
and ancient conflicts that sparked the first world war and went
essentially unresolved after the second. People also find it ironic
that the confrontation that never materialized during the Cold War
-- a direct fight between the United States and Russia -- could be
unleashed by the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high probability that Russia will become more
involved,'' said Domitilla Sagramos, a Russia expert at King's
College in London. ``Russia may become even more involved almost
involuntarily -- the way NATO is being moved to consider a ground
war it didn't expect at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five years after the end of the last European war, Dresden
is still rebuilding. Scaffolds stand around over the ruins of the
Church of Our Lady, whose great dome once dominated the city's
silhouette. In 1993, the city began a 13-year campaign to rebuild
the church.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Matthius Griebel also remembers the Dresden
firebombing, but he interprets its lessons differently.
</P>
<P>
   He views the war in Yugoslavia as an attempt to stop the kind of
forces that could lead to a wider European war or a world war, and
by implication, more Dresdens.
</P>
<P>
   He was 8 during the bombings and remembers huddling with his
mother and three brothers and sisters in their cellar as thunderous
explosions rocked the city.
</P>
<P>
   He feels pangs of sympathy when he sees the children cowering in
Belgrade, but he sees the other children, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Serbian family that has to go into the cellar every night
is terrible, but what about the people in the refugee camps, with
no papers, no possessions and worried that they will never go
home?'' asks Griebel, now the director of Dresden's city museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for it all is sitting in a fine drawing room in
Belgrade with fine furniture and fresh flowers,'' he said. ``The
reason is Milosevic.''

 &HT;    What passed for news Ohio man's most `traumatizing' experience
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The news choppers soared. The print reporters
scribbled. The neighbors came out on their porches to say, ``He was
quiet,'' ``He was a loner,'' and ``He seemed like a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In what almost seemed like a cosmic commentary on news in the
modern age, it turned out to be turkey skin, the suspected ``human
remains'' that preoccupied Dayton press and police for the better
part of Monday. The most probed and photographed turkey skin in
poultry history, but turkey skin nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bob Shepas, 48, upstanding citizen and homeowner,
sweated under the intense glare of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal started about 5 p.m. Monday, shortly after Shepas
came home from work. A couple of guys from Roto-Rooter had been out
the day before to take care of a sewage backup in his basement.
</P>
<P>
   When a water department truck pulled up, he hoped workers had
come to inspect the sewage problem. Next thing Shepas knew, police
cruisers and TV news trucks converged on his Shroyer Park home.
</P>
<P>
   Shepas works as a mental health counselor and has a master's
degree in counseling, but he was about to witness human nature in
bizarre new configurations.
</P>
<P>
   Police presented a search warrant and asked Shepas to come
downtown to answer a few questions. It was surreal: How could this
be happening? Roto-Rooter workers, it turns out, tipped off police
after finding the turkey skin. The men told Shepas they suspected
it could be human remains, but he wasn't worried; the gunk looked
like chicken skin to him. So he made light of it, played along,
cracked a joke or two about throwing the bones out the back window.
</P>
<P>
   Now police tape blocked access to a nearby street, and TV crews
broadcast top-of-the-hour reports from ``the grisly scene.'' The
experience ``was traumatizing, overwhelming _ an all-pervasive
feeling of dread and amazement,'' Shepas said. ``So much manpower,
money and effort was being expended to follow up such a flimsy
lead. I understand the community is a little paranoid since the
Kettering girl disappeared, but this was a very blatant
overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   A detective or two could have accomplished the job, Shepas said:
``Instead, they just brought out the whole cavalry.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, ``My neighbors said nice things about me to
the press, and the people who know me have been very supportive,''
Shepas said. ``That has been a blessing to know I'll have people
who will stand by me in this kind of storm.''
</P>
<P>
   It was from TV, not police, Shepas said, he learned the case was
closed. His clothing hasn't been returned. ``I'm still in the
dark,'' he said. ``I've heard nothing from the police about the
status of the case. My house is trashed. There has been no
followup, no apology, no nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dayton police spokeswoman Carol Johnson, ``This poor man, I
do understand his concern. We did have a responsibility to follow
up any possibilities. Everybody is doing what they're supposed to
do, and unfortunately he got caught in the middle of this mess.''
Johnson said the police department owes Shepas some ``closure and
an explanation for why we did what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the media coverage, Shepas shrugged, ``It's a daily
entertainment package, and they call it the news.''
</P>
<P>
   All this over globs of turkey skin _ nothing even from his own
kitchen _ that backed into his sewer.
</P>
<P>
   Shepas doesn't cook.

 &HT;    I hereby resign from the Information Age
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Last winter, when we were planning our
nearly monthlong excursion to Australia, New Zealand and the Fiji
Islands, my wife came up with what she thought would be an easy and
economical way to stay in touch with folks back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you get your laptop rigged for e-mail?'' she
suggested. I have a laptop computer I use to write and transmit my
column to the newspaper when I'm out of town.
</P>
<P>
   I was reluctant to accept her suggestion. For months, and
despite public ridicule, I had refused to be caught up in the
electronic mail craze. I was perfectly content to communicate
through the post office by what S.J. Overstreet derisively refers
to as ``snail mail.''
</P>
<P>
   After checking the cost of overseas telephone calls, I agreed to
sign on with America Online. Barbara Allison, who must have gone to
Georgia Tech, agreed to install the necessary software in my
laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara assured me I would have no trouble sending or receiving
e-mail in a foreign country. All I had to do when we got to our
hotel room in Sydney, or wherever, was plug in and let the computer
dial the preinstalled local access number. It wasn't that simple.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign countries electrical outlets and telephone jacks
aren't the same as ours. You need adapters. After an afternoon of
telephoning and walking streets, I located adapters that let me
connect without causing a major electrical explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The laptop made a few growling noises and then started talking.
``I'm sorry. The number you have dialed has been changed. Please
hang up and try again.'' By the time I got the new access number,
at a cost of several calls, we were finished with Sydney and on the
way to Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we were introduced to a phenomenon called the
Internet Cafe. They are all over Australia and New Zealand. When
you buy a large cup of coffee you can use the house computer for
free e-mail. If you don't want coffee you can e-mail for an hour
for about $3.50 in American dollars. I was happy to catch our
granddaughter online in Fayetteville for a back-and-forth chat, and
even happier to give up on the laptop.
</P>
<P>
   While we were away, everybody I know and many I don't found out
I was on e-mail. They sent humorous messages to each other
commenting on my belated emergence from the Pony Express era. They
sent copies of their messages to me.
</P>
<P>
   E-mailers, I discovered, compile lists of hundreds of other
e-mailers. When one sends an e-mail, a single keystroke forwards
the message to everyone on the lists, and finds its way to all the
other lists. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of e-mails are soon
flying back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks I've received jokes, poems, book excerpts,
travelogues and Bible passages from folks I haven't heard from
since Harry Truman was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted from sorting e-mail on the off-chance an important
message might slip through, I was agreeable when my wife suggested
a few days' R&AMP;R in St. Simons.
</P>
<P>
   I carried the laptop along to write my column and transmit it
back to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   When I sat down to write, strange things happened. A paragraph
suddenly disappeared. Mystery messages popped on the screen.
Halfway through, a large America Online icon, in multicolors,
superimposed itself over my prose. ``Welcome!'' declared the laptop
voice. ``You've got mail.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't want mail. I wanted to finish my column and go to the
beach. I shut the machine and took a walk. Sometimes these things
will fix themselves if left alone.
</P>
<P>
   When I tried to crank the laptop the next morning, nothing
happened. I pushed the restart button. A light flashed. The
normally blue screen turned half yellow and half black. The
keyboard didn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   I telephoned Dave McLean, the newspaper's computer guru, to see
if he could tell me what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think my e-mail may have done it?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happens all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I retreated to an old and long discarded Wal-Mart typewriter,
dug out of a closet. It still works. Consider this my formal
resignation from the world of e-mail, the Internet, Web pages,
access numbers and other hindrances of modern technology.

</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ Dispatches from dreamsville: A playground in
the woods One of an occasional series in which readers share with
Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray their memories of growing
up in small-town America. Back then, or at least the way we
remember it, life was like a dream. ``My mother died in 1942 when I
was a year old. In 1944, Daddy and my Cherokee stepmother and I _
red-haired and freckle-faced _ moved from Texas to our 10-acre farm
in Clay County, Fla. My four half-brothers were born during the
next 10 years. Our nearest neighbor lived a couple of miles away,
so we entertained ourselves. We had radio, but no TV until the late
1950s. A railroad track ran along our piney woods farm. We'd wave
to the train engineers, and they'd wave back. Mom said that
whenever a train was late during the night, we children would wake
up because we had not heard the train whistle in our sleep.''

<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ In my school, any jock caught
pushing around a weaker student would be challenged by other jocks.
Jocks were not bullies. We were the good guys. To act as bullies or
hoods would screw up a good thing. Is it possible that these
black-clad Trenchcoat Mafia killers were modern-day hoods who
attempted to bully and terrorize other students with their Nazi
swastikas and talk of guns and killing? (Rowland Nethaway is senior
editor of the Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ Here's a wild suggestion: Try
being a role model yourself instead of expecting other people to do
it for you. As much as we all hate to admit it, the problem isn't
outside influences that affect our children, but the influences we
give our children from the inside. (Latham, Marshall News

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ There's a book us white folks need to read but
black folks can skip. Black folks already know why there's such a
grotesque disproportion of their young men in prison. And, no, it's
not because African Americans are natural-born crooks; that's
talk-radio tripe. It's in good part because the relentless
inequities of the criminal justice system are geared, however
unintentionally, to produce that disproportion. The book is ``No
Equal Justice.'' It is by David Cole. He brings a disturbing _ and
what ought to be an urgent _ message. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVES THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ We began the '90s in hot pursuit of one
dictator, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, but did not succeed in ridding the
world of him. Already, we had Panama's Manuel Noriega in a Miami
jail, nabbed by U.S. troops who actually invaded Panama by the
thousands to get their hands on him. But there are so many more
despots to pursue. Libya's Moammar Khadafy is one, Syria's Haffez
Assad another and Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic another;
Milosevic being the present focus of attention. (Howard Kleinberg

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The news choppers soared. The
print reporters scribbled. The neighbors came out on their porches
to say, ``He was quiet,'' ``He was a loner,'' and ``He seemed like
a nice guy.'' In what almost seemed like a cosmic commentary on
news in the modern age, it turned out to be turkey skin, the
suspected ``human remains'' that preoccupied Dayton press and
police for the better part of Monday. Meanwhile, Bob Shepas, 48,
upstanding citizen and homeowner, sweated under the intense glare
of suspicion. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED FOR SATURDAY.

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ There's a book us white folks need to read but
black folks can skip. Black folks already know why there's such a
grotesque disproportion of their young men in prison. And, no, it's
not because African Americans are natural-born crooks; that's
talk-radio tripe. It's in good part because the relentless
inequities of the criminal justice system are geared, however
unintentionally, to produce that disproportion. The book is ``No
Equal Justice.'' It is by David Cole. He brings a disturbing _ and
what ought to be an urgent _ message. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVES THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ We began the '90s in hot pursuit of one
dictator, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, but did not succeed in ridding the
world of him. Already, we had Panama's Manuel Noriega in a Miami
jail, nabbed by U.S. troops who actually invaded Panama by the
thousands to get their hands on him. But there are so many more
despots to pursue. Libya's Moammar Khadafy is one, Syria's Haffez
Assad another and Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic another;
Milosevic being the present focus of attention. (Howard Kleinberg

   WARNER-ON-WOOD _ ATLANTA _ Drew Langsner, the North Carolina
guru of green wood working, is out with a handsome new book called
``The Chairmaker's Workshop.'' One should not be misled by the
generality of the title. I have often mentioned that chairmaking is
really the most difficult and exacting of all areas of
furniture-making. I have nothing but admiration for chairmakers,
and even more for ones like Langsner who do it the hard way _

   RELIGION-GUNS _ The images from Littleton, Colo. _ like those

challenges for people of faith who live in a society that says
freedom requires access to firearms. There is a mystique about
firearms apparent at today's meeting of the National Rifle
Association in Denver and earlier this year when more than 1,400
exhibitors displayed their wares in the Georgia World Congress
Center at the industry's largest trade show. Guns evoke passion and
raise moral dilemmas, such as those being played out in debates in
Colorado over concealed weapons and those in Georgia about
Atlanta's plan to sue gun manufacturers. The debates also go on
among people of faith. We explore the issue. (GWhite, Atlanta

   TORAH-PURCHASE _ One hundred twelve years ago, a Jewish

panels of heavy goatskin parchment sewn together with catgut. As
the synagogue doors parted in Sanaa, the jubilant crowd paraded in,
never dreaming their sacred text would one day enter something
called cyberspace, destined for Austin. An interesting reader about
how a small congregation found its historic Torah on the Internet

 &HT;    Who were the bullies?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The motive behind the massacre at Colorado's
Columbine High School is being attributed to a feeling of ostracism
by the two young killers who especially hated the school's
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   As a former high school jock, I have a hard time relating to
this experience.
</P>
<P>
   These two teens went to a huge suburban school. I went to a
small-town school. The times have changed. Still, some things
surely remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   At my school, the students would assemble in the gym at the
beginning of each school year to get our marching orders for the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
   There were no student handbooks. In the days of manual
typewriters and hand-cranked mimeograph machines, it was a lot
easier to call an assembly to pass along information.
</P>
<P>
   We were told everything the administrators, teachers and coaches
thought we needed to know.
</P>
<P>
   During these introductory assemblies, the coach would talk about
the athletic prospects for the coming year, which, with hard work
and student body support, would be good.
</P>
<P>
   The coach would introduce the players for the coming season's
football team. We had been sweating through full-pad practices for
weeks before school started. We felt that we deserved the applause.
</P>
<P>
   As a jock who played every sport every year, I often felt that
the attention given to athletes was out of proportion to any actual
importance. Not that I complained, of course.
</P>
<P>
   I recall taking the field and looking at the band members
dressed in silly-looking uniforms, the cheerleaders dressed in
considerably better-looking uniforms and all the students and
adults in the stands. I couldn't figure it out. Didn't these people
have something better to do?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us on the field got to play a game, which often was
fun. What all those other people were doing, I wasn't sure. Not
that I complained.
</P>
<P>
   The two young gunmen at Columbine High School evidently hated
jocks because jocks picked on them.
</P>
<P>
   I can see why some people and fellow students would think that
jocks get too much attention. I felt the same when I was a jock.
</P>
<P>
   Honor students like my brother, who was elected to head a
national scholastic honorary society, were never cheered during an
assembly for acing a test. No glory for brains.
</P>
<P>
   There were cliques even in small-town schools. But if jocks
could be considered a clique, they would not have been the ones who
picked on weaker students.
</P>
<P>
   The three basic social groups in my 1950s-era high school were
jocks, hoods and brains. There was some overlap with the jocks and
the brains, but very little with the hoods.
</P>
<P>
   Hoods seldom had the guts or the ability to play sports. But
hoods had plenty of courage when it came to pushing around weaker
students. Jocks protected weaker students from bullying hoods. It
was our pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   In my school, any jock caught pushing around a weaker student
would be challenged by other jocks. Jocks were not bullies. We were
the good guys. To act as bullies or hoods would screw up a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than black trench coats, the hoods in my school wore
black leather motorcycle jackets with the collars turned up. They
also wore black steel-toed engineer boots and their hair slicked
back in greasy duck tails.
</P>
<P>
   They liked to hang out together in groups, smoke and try to look
and act tough. The acting-tough part included picking on weaker
students.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that these black-clad Trenchcoat Mafia killers
were modern-day hoods who attempted to bully and terrorize other
students with their Nazi swastikas and talk of guns and killing?
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day jocks, however, can't stop bullets and bombs.

   PROSTITUTES-CRIME (San Francisco) _ The San Francisco Police
Department has created a new investigative unit to deal exclusively
with crimes against prostitutes. The Crimes Against Prostitutes
unit, believed to be the first of its kind in the nation, is
designed to focus on violent predators who attack prostitutes as
well as dealers who supply them with drugs and pimps who often
force them to stay on the street. By JIM HERRON ZAMORA.
</P>
<P>
   LOS-SIETE (San Francisco) _ Seldom has a single gunshot echoed
so long and so far. The bullet that killed San Francisco Police
Officer Joseph Brodnik, 30 years ago Saturday, took a life and
ruined a family. It also sparked a political movement and changed
the way a Latino community thought of itself. By EMILY GURNON.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-BUDGET (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Higher salaries, bonuses and
huge stock market earnings among some California taxpayers will
pump an estimated $3 billion in taxes into the state treasury,
prompting lawmakers to salivate over how to spend the windfall. By
ROB SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   LACKLAND-AFB (San Antonio) _ The Air Force in August will seek
private bids to take over base operations at San Antonio's Lackland
AFB, a move that could affect more than 1,600 civilian jobs. Most
jobs at the base, known as ``The Gateway to the Air Force,'' would
transfer to the private sector in a cost-cutting move, although an
unknown number of jobs also could be eliminated. By DAVID
HENDRICKS.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-LAWSUIT (Houston) _ Three people from Houston have filed a
federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Texas law
that prohibits the direct shipment of wine to a Texas residence
from out of state. The law also prohibits the transportation of
more than three gallons of wine across the state line. By ED ASHER.
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLICS-DEATH-PENALTY (San Antonio) _ The National Federation
of Priests' Councils is urging bishops and priests to convey to
parishioners that the death penalty is wrong. ``Sadly, many
Americans _ including many Catholics _ still support the death
penalty out of understandable fear of crime and horror,'' says
Daniel Misleh, a policy adviser with the U.S. Catholic Conference.

<P>
   BARBECUE-TEXAS (Lockhart, Texas) _ To call Edgar Schmidt a
latter-day King Lear might seem ridiculous. He was, after all, the
owner of a barbecue joint. But then again we're talking about
barbecue, more specifically Central Texas barbecue, arguably the
best in the state, which to most around these parts means the best
in the world. By THADDEUS HERRICK.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ A reader has a question about plants
with holes in the leaves. The readers asks, ``Will you tell me why
insect is attacking my crops? By KATHY HUBER
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ To encourage employees to stay,
employers are offering ``staying bonuses.'' They're especially
popular, sometimes called ``pay to stay,'' when one company buys
another and critical people must be kept. They're also used to meet
deadlines for projects such as the millennium bug. By L.M. SIXEL.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Notebook computer design is
beginning to have a greater effect on desktops. Since space is at a
premium in most homes and workplaces, a smaller desktop system has
appeal for many people. Here's a look at a desktop system that
closely resembles a portable PC, and an excellent portable that
could easily replace many home desktops. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-ONLINE (Undated) _ A reader discovers another problem
with duplicated file names in Windows 98 _ ``ghost drivers'' in the
Device Manager. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   RETAILERS (San Francisco) _ If you think clothes all look alike
and the same stores are on every corner, it's not your imagination.
Just 10 companies control nearly half the U.S. clothing sales,
according to a report by The NPD Group, a market research firm. By
VICTORIA COLLIVER.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-CHILDREN (Undated) _ From books children learn about real
people who influence _ in tiny or giant ways _ their young lives.
Many of those books fill community and school libraries, waiting
for a school assignment on the explorers or the Revolutionary War
or American Indians. Some parents relegate biographies and other
books about real people to assignments. What a shame. Biographies
and stories about real people can inspire children. By JANE P.
MARSHALL.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-PUNK (Undated) _ It's 1985, and guys like Stevo
(Matthew Lillard) of ``SLC Punk!'' have all but had it with the
commercial dilution of punk's squalid grandeur. So what's he doing
soapboxing near the information kiosk in a Salt Lake City mall? He
delivers an impassioned, intermittently funny soliloquy into a
low-angled camera. He's fired up, but neither Stevo nor the film
acknowledges that he's ranting from within the bastion of his
contempt. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-ELECTION (Undated) _ Of the many vividly evocative
truths to surface in ``Election,'' the one that gives the most
pause comes during the student body candidates' debate. Tammy
Metzler (Jessica Campbell), school weirdo and darkhorse
presidential candidate, tells Carver High's adolescent electorate
that the contest is more or less only about the candidate's egos
and putting a victory on their college application. They should
vote for her: She doesn't want to go to college. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   TV-COLUMN (Undated) _ May sweeps is becoming less about the big
network blockbuster _ because they don't know how to do it right
anymore, or maybe no one cares _ and more about cliffhangers and
the end of old stalwarts. Like on May 19, when ``The Nanny''
mercifully leaves the airwaves. The world is finally free of Fran
Drescher. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Timing can be everything in
love, and so it is at Audubon Canyon Ranch. Show up in mid- summer,
fall or winter, and well, you'll not only find the gate locked, but
nothing beyond worth trying to get a peep at anyway. But arrive now
. . . the gate is open, and beyond? Well, let me tell you about the
birds and the bees. Especially the birds. By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ iMacs sure get them good product
placement. Whenever we see one on TV, we look over our shoulders
proudly at ours. We halfway expect him to be looking at his brother
on TV, too. We've decided it's a him because he's bluish. The color
is important. When you tell people you have an iMac, they always
ask what color you have. We got bluish because that's all they had

<P>
   CLINTON-WAR (Watsonville, Calif.) _ Hitherto, war has meant
sacrifice. And the men who led people into war had to convince them
that it was worth the sacrifice. The Clinton Doctrine changes all
that. Now war will mean only a willingness to kill _ not a
willingness to die. No sacrifice, other than financial, is
required; therefore, no soldiers or citizens need to be convinced.

 &HT;    Chairmakers earn a seat at the head of the class
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Drew Langsner, the North Carolina guru of green wood
working, is out with a handsome new book called ``The Chairmaker's
Workshop.''
</P>
<P>
   Published in hardback by Lark at $35, one should not be misled
by the generality of the title.
</P>
<P>
   I have often mentioned that chairmaking is really the most
difficult and exacting of all areas of furniture-making. A chair
must withstand more abuse than any other piece of furniture, yet it
is expected to look graceful and serene.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, it's a failure if it isn't comfortable. Thus I have
nothing but admiration for chairmakers, and even more for ones like
Langsner who do it the hard way _ taking the thing right out of the
tree.
</P>
<P>
   There is scarcely an tool or an evolution in all of woodworking
that is not required to build a Windsor chair from green wood.
You'll need the tools of the tree-cutter _ chainsaw, ax, peavey and
cant hook _ and the river's tools: wedge, sledge, glut, froe and
maul.
</P>
<P>
   For preparing all the pieces, and shaping those which are not to
be turned, you'll need a drawknife; perhaps several in different
sizes and shapes. Drawknives are not as easy to find now as they
once were. They are, however, still just as hard to use. An expert
can do wonderful things with a properly sharpened drawknife, but
there is a definite learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   The use of a drawknife requires a shaving horse, and I don't
recall ever seeing a ready-made one. You'll have to build one
yourself, but it's not a big deal. You'll also probably want a
heavy leather apron so as not to disembowel yourself while you're
learning to use the drawknife.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the hollowing and the inshave and the travisher,
required for shaping the concave seats of the Windsor chair.
Langsner devotes a page to the making of a travisher, which is used
for the final finish work. Then you have the tools for making
mortises _ you can use an electric drill here _ and more arcane
tools for forming tenons, both straight and tapered.
</P>
<P>
   Langsner provides instructions on making several other useful
tools, including a tapering plane and a type of bow saw that allows
the blade to be rotated to any angle. Since most Windsow chair
rungs and spindles are turned, you'll need a lathe and basic
spindle-turning tools.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these chairs also involve bent wood, so you'll have to
make a steamer and learn to bend the stuff. Fortunately, the pieces
are generally small enough so as not to require an army to get the
job done.
</P>
<P>
   Langsner's book is absolutely comprehensive. It covers various
styles and techniques, and how to deal with mistakes.

NO SPRING IN SOX' STEP IN APRIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It would be foolish to condemn the Red Sox for
failing to duplicate the drama of last April, when they won nine
games with late-inning comebacks, seven in their last at-bat,
including Mo Vaughn's theme-setting walkoff grand slam in the home
opener.
</P>
<P>
   That was baseball at its unscripted best, with improbable
scene-stealers like The King, Jim Leyritz, and where-have-you-gone
Midre Cummings hitting dramatic home runs while the marquee names,
Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra, produced nightly as the Sox raced to
an 18-8 record, setting a club record for wins in April.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing to expect the unexpected on a nightly basis.
It's quite another to wonder, with justification, where all the
excitement has gone so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   Come-from-behind wins? As the Red Sox close out the month Friday
night in Oakland, trying to stay above the break-even point with an
11-10 record, they can point to only one victory so far in which
they trailed. That was the opener, April 5 in Kansas City, when the
Royals jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first inning, an advantage they
held for exactly two more Sox at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other times this season, Sox opponents have scored first,
and the Sox have lost all seven.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the Sox ran off 14 wins in 15 games, including two
seven-game winning streaks. This April, the Sox reeled off wins in
their first five games, on the road against Kansas City and Tampa
Bay. Since then, they're 6-10, and have won back-to-back games just
once, last weekend against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, this was supposed to be the soft part of the
schedule, with the Indians the only team with a better-than-.500
record among the Sox opponents in the first 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   But already, the Sox have lost three in a four-game series
against the expansion Devil Rays _ in Fenway Park, no less _
followed that by dropping two of three to the Tigers in Detroit,
and needed Wednesday's 9-4 win to avoid being swept by the Twins in
the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   After returning home from a four-game set this weekend with the
A's, the Red Sox will confront a stretch that includes two games
against the AL West-leading Texas Rangers, a three-game reunion
next weekend with Mo, six games against the Yankees, seven games
against the Blue Jays (who at the moment are ahead of the Sox in
the AL East), and three more games with the Indians, this time in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain the difference from one April to another? Let's
count the ways:
</P>
<P>
   --Run production: Everybody knew that the Sox would miss Mo, but
the dropoff has been precipitous. Last April, the Sox scored 138
runs in 26 games, an average of 5.3 a game. This month, the Sox
have scored 83 runs in 21 games, 3.9 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who hit two home runs for the Angels Wednesday night
(and no Sox player has homered twice in a game so far), had a huge
April last year, batting a team-best .364 with a team-high seven
home runs and 21 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Only Garciaparra had more RBIs last year at this time; he had
22, with five home runs and six stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar's numbers so far this season: no home runs in 56 at-bats,
six RBIs, two stolen bases. Garciaparra had his fewest RBIs in a
month since becoming a regular; even last May, when he missed 16
games with a separated shoulder, the Sox shortstop still drove in
eight runs. Of his 16 hits so far this season, 13 have been
singles.
</P>
<P>
   That trend can't continue, though it reflects on how completely
Sox opponents have targeted Garciaparra, in the absence of Vaughn,
as the one player they will attempt to neutralize at all costs.
Garciaparra will adjust, but it may take time.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Jose Offerman has picked up some of the slack, batting
.349 with 29 hits and 16 extra-base hits, all team-leading figures.
But last April, the Sox had four players who had scored 15 or more
runs in April, led by John Valentin's 19. With one game left to be
played, only Offerman (12) and Troy O'Leary (11) are in double
figures in runs, while Valentin, who scored 113 runs in 1998, has
just seven so far.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary leads the club with six home runs; no one else has more
than two. At this rate, the Sox will finish with 115 home runs, or
an astounding 90 fewer than they had last season. The Tampa Bay
Devil Rays ranked last in the league last season with 111.
</P>
<P>
   --Batting with runners in scoring position: Don't blame
Offerman; he's batting .455 (5 for 11) with runners in scoring
position, while Jeff Frye (.385), Mike Stanley (.357), Garciaparra
(.353), and Damon Buford (.333) have done their share.
</P>
<P>
   But take seven other batters in the Sox lineup _ O'Leary, Jason
Varitek, Valentin, Trot Nixon, Darren Lewis, Reggie Jefferson, and
Donnie Sadler _ and their combined average with runners in scoring
position is .168 (20 for 119). Lewis, who has been dropped from the
No. 2 spot in the order, is batting just .120 (3 for 25) in RISP
situations.
</P>
<P>
   --Pitching: As proud as the Sox are of their pitching to date _
a league-leading ERA of 3.62, a full point below the league average
of 4.75 _ the difference from a year ago isn't as marked as the
drop in offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox bullpen, for example, has four saves; Tom Gordon had
three wins and nine saves by himself in April last season. Bret
Saberhagen and Pedro Martinez are off to great starts, just as they
were a year ago; but Tim Wakefield (1-3, 7.36 ERA) hasn't had this
bad a month in nearly two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   --Injuries: Garciaparra has been slowed by elbow and hamstring
injuries. Gordon has been MIA for two weeks and counting with an
elbow injury that remains worrisome, as has catcher Scott
Hatteberg. Saberhagen, who didn't miss a start last season, is
missing one Friday with shoulder problems, a constant concern.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sox can take comfort in anything, it's that no team has
separated itself from the pack, not even the Yankees. The Orioles
are a bust, Vaughn was part of the injury epidemic in Anaheim, the
Mariners lost Alex Rodriguez, and every team short of the Yankees
has obvious flaws. Whether the Sox can overcome theirs to keep pace
with the better teams is a question that was left unanswered in
April.

<P>
   CROIX-DES-BOUQUETS, Haiti _ The latest sign that U.S. troops are
increasingly in danger from the very people they're here to help
came abruptly at dawn on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of soldiers had assembled near the front gate of the
American military compound known as Camp Fairwinds for an early run
in the already steamy Haitian heat.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, gunshots rang out.
</P>
<P>
   Within 20 minutes, unidentified gunmen separated from the
Port-au-Prince compound by a barbed wire fence had sprayed the area
twice with a flurry of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the gunmen's aim was lousy, and no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But the commander of U.S. troops in Haiti, Col. Charles Morris,
said it wasn't the only brush with danger American soldiers have
faced in Haiti, where growing violence and instability pose
significant threats.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Cox Newspapers last week, Morris
recommended the United States end its permanent deployment in
Haiti, echoing concerns expressed last February by the commander of
American forces in Latin America, Gen. Charles Wilhelm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is more unstable now than it was six months
ago,'' said Morris, who has commanded the troops here since last
fall. ``Incidents of violence are up.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments made by Wilhelm -- and echoed now Morris --
concerning the quiet peacekeeping mission not far off Florida's
shore come as congressional Republicans step up their attacks on
President Bill Clinton's conduct of the war in Kosovo, a place some
4,700 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The comments also present a major challenge to a foreign policy
that Clinton administration officials have held up as an example of
the way in which U.S. military forces can be used to help resolve
instability and ethnic conflicts in the post-Cold War period.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there's mounting opposition to the U.S. presence here,
where the Parliament has passed a law ordering foreign troops off
Haitian soil -- although it has not been enforced.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, key Republicans portray the mission in Haiti as a
failure and have called on Clinton to remove the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our soldiers are down there with giant bull's-eyes on their
backs, and they need to be pulled out, and right now,'' said U.S.
Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee. ``This is supposed to be a peacekeeping mission yet
these folks are at risk in an increasingly dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Clinton administration has yet to present a clear
exit strategy in Haiti or immediate plans for the withdrawal of
troops.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, Clinton ordered 20,000 U.S. troops to Haiti
to remove a brutal military dictatorship and restore President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has often hailed the mission as a foreign
policy triumph. Since 1994, the United States has poured $2.2
billion into this tiny Caribbean nation to promote economic
development and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the U.S. troops withdrew after a year, some 500
soldiers remain in Haiti, mostly performing humanitarian duties
such as drilling wells, building schools, and providing medical
care, at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of $22 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the troops are a stabilizing force
and a ``visible manifestation'' of U.S. support for Haiti's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sort of signal would it send if we pulled the troops out
now?'' asked one State Department official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But about 175 of the soldiers do nothing but protect the other
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And many work quietly in safe, rural areas -- generally chosen
because of their isolation -- where most Haitians don't see them.
</P>
<P>
   In the rural community of Merger, just outside Port-au-Prince,
about 21 U.S. soldiers stand guard outside a small church in which
29 other soldiers provide medical care to sick Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to make sure nothing happens to the medics,'' said
one guard, Pfc. Jay Webb of Statesboro, Ga. ``Most of the people
out here though are pretty nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in recent months, a wave of crime, politically
motivated shootings, and allegations of police brutality have swept
over Haiti as politicians struggle to restore the government after
a 22-month political impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more people who are armed here than there used
to be,'' Col. Morris said. ``You see people walking on the streets
with weapons in their trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   President Rene Preval tried to resolve government gridlock by
dissolving the Parliament in January and appointing a new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But civil unrest has only swelled.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a spate of violence has rocked Port-au-Prince since
April 20, when a youth activist named Michelange Philistin(CQ) was
fatally shot, allegedly by police.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, three Haitian legislators who had taken
refuge in the Chilean Embassy here after receiving death threats
fled for the United States with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the atmosphere became so tense in January that he
was forced to upgrade so-called ``threat conditions'' at the
American military compound.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has cut back on liberties for the soldiers,
restricting where they go, and requiring them to travel in large
groups.
</P>
<P>
   He's closed one of only two entrances to Camp Fairwinds, and
erected several walls of sandbags, behind which soldiers could
duck.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly U.S. troops are confined to their heavily fortified
military compound, an insular environment complete with a weight
room, a swimming pool, an all-you-can-eat mess hall and
air-conditioned plywood barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the protection of U.S. forces is his top priority,
but it's a job that's not as easy as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, he said U.S. soldiers have been fired upon. He
also said that they've been increasingly threatened -- sometimes by
various political factions -- particularly on local radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what American soldiers do and where they go,'' said
one ominous-sounding warning from a caller opposed to the U.S.
presence.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Wilhelm, who leads the U.S. Southern Command,
told the defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee
that troops have been unable to establish stability and that he
feared for their safety in an increasingly volatile country.
</P>
<P>
   He recommended the United States discontinue its permanent
presence in Haiti, and replace it with periodic visits to sites
mostly outside Port-au-Prince, where most unrest occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, key Republicans asked Clinton to withdraw the
troops.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 22 letter to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Clinton said
he is committed to reducing the U.S. presence in Haiti, but offered
no timetable for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he'd approved a modest reduction in force strength
last August, although officials at the U.S. Southern Command say
the number of troops has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to the military's new fiscal plan, the U.S.
presence in Haiti will remain constant throughout the year 2000 as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts on Haiti argue that the time for withdrawal has
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The troops are not in any position to prevent Haitian society
from falling apart,'' said Jocelyn McCalla, executive director of
the New York-based National Coalition for Haitian Rights. ``They
are a token presence that is not even appreciated by the Haitian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said many of the tasks performed by U.S. soldiers could
be performed by U.S. aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said it's disappointing that the U.S. military has
almost no contact with the Haitian government.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a representative of the Haitian government has yet
to attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the opening of a
U.S.-built facility -- despite countless invitations -- even a
recent opening for a completely rebuilt elementary school within
view of the National Palace.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Ira Kurzban, the Haitian government's Miami-based legal adviser,
said Haiti does appreciate U.S. efforts to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the issue of the continuation of foreign troops in Haiti,
in light of its history, has always been a sensitive subject,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Haitians resent the last U.S. occupation of Haiti between
1915 and 1934, which some say left the country even more unstable
than before, and so are wary of the current U.S. presence as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't know what these troops do in Haiti that the
Haitians themselves can't do,'' said Micha Gaillard, a leader of
the socialist National Congress of Democratic Movements in Haiti.
``Not much of anything as far as I can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sgt. Joseph Riddle of Columbus, Ohio, one of 50 Marines
putting the finishing touches on a five-building school compound
southeast of Port-au-Prince, said the troops are making a
difference, at least in the lives of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are really going to appreciate this school,'' he
said. ``All of us really are doing everything we can to help.''

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 World Rights 
 By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. and JOSHUA SPARROW, M.D.  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The massacre in Littleton, Colo., is a national tragedy. It is
also a national indictment. It should not be seen as just a high
school tragedy or a breakdown in preventive care for two disturbed
teen-agers. It is an urgent call to our country for help.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episodes of teens and preteens murdering their
classmates have sent a message that our nation is in deep trouble.
We are a violent society. How many more young lives must be lost
before we finally face this?
</P>
<P>
   We are all asking: ``Why did this have to happen?'' We don't
know for sure what drove the two teens in Colorado, but we do know
that there is no other country in the world where anything like
this schoolyard bloodshed has happened so often. It is time we
looked at what sets us apart and whether we are harboring risk
factors here that we must address before tragedy strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   To start, no other country in the industrialized world tolerates
such easy access to guns. We are paying for this with our
children's lives. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S.
youths is 12 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries
combined, according to a recent study. For firearm-related
homicides, the rate is 16 times higher. Added now to this menace is
easy access to bomb plans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had to have been
profoundly disturbed to have done what they did. But if we hadn't
made it so easy for them, maybe they would have started by slashing
tires or throwing bricks through school windows _ and maybe
somebody would have noticed before lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Access to violent television and video games has also exacted
its price. As far back as the early '60s, Albert Bandura, a
psychology professor at Stanford University, demonstrated that
after being exposed to violence on television, young children will
spontaneously introduce new aggression into their play. If a child
spends hours shooting a virtual gun at a virtual human target _ the
goal being to splatter virtual brains, intestines and blood on the
screen _ isn't it common sense that at some point the taboo against
this behavior will be eroded?
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold belong to the first generation of children
who grew up from the beginning with such games and with the new
permissiveness for televised violence. If we can't change the
television and toy industries, we certainly can hold ourselves as
parents responsible to know _ and to say no. Do you know what your
own children are watching?
</P>
<P>
   To do their jobs, though, parents need more support than they
are getting. Families today are dealing with more stress than ever
before. Often both parents need to work full-time, and very few
workplaces can be seen as family-friendly. Parents are struggling
to get home in time to discipline, to model values for their
children with their own behavior and to foster self-acceptance in
their children.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that families can't do all of this on their own. When
will we stop clinging to this outdated notion and take some steps
toward helping parents and children?
</P>
<P>
   Without paid parental leave in the first months of a child's
life, most parents cannot afford the ``luxury'' of caring for their
infant at this critical stage when attachment to other human beings
is first set in motion. We can no longer risk depriving children of
this early basis for intimacy and eventually self-esteem. We are
facing the cost of raising children whose sense of self and
connection to others is too tentative to withstand the taunting of
later years.
</P>
<P>
   When parents do notice signs of trouble, they often can't turn
to a professional for help because they lack adequate health
insurance to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to avert future tragedies, we will have to include
these and other ways of supporting parents in a new definition of
community.
</P>
<P>
   When children reach the school years, they need a community more
than ever. The school day ends at 2 or 3 p.m., leaving several
unsupervised hours every day for children of working parents.
Children need either longer school days or afterschool activities _
in community organizations, church groups or schools _ that
continue until at least 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris have taught us that children also need a
community to provide them with opportunities for acceptance in as
wide a range of activities as possible, so that they will not have
to seek out acceptance and affirmation in racist hate groups and
cults.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are an integral part of the solution, and we are asking
them to do much more than ever before. Yet we can't expect them to
do it if we don't provide them with the means they need. We must
revive our children's respect for their teachers by demonstrating
our own _ and show that we mean it by providing the funds and
support that teachers deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Our schools can no longer tolerate bullying or hatred based on
differences. Teachers must help children take pride in the
activities in which they excel, channel their creative energies
constructively and find acceptance within themselves and from their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, like families, are where children learn _ more from
action than from words _ what our society's values are. Do we even
know what these are anymore?
</P>
<P>
   By neglecting our children, our families, our communities, we
are teaching our children that money, power and aggression come
first. If we really have given in to ``every man for himself,''
then this is what our children will learn. We will deserve, more
than they, the human jungle they will inherit.
</P>
<P>
   We must face what has changed in our world, what must change and
what must be preserved. We have known about most of these risk
factors _ and what to do about many of them _ for years. We should
now turn our outrage into a resolve to act. Many of the solutions
are within our reach.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy in Colorado is a call to arms for us all _ not to
the firearms which increasingly are being recognized as one part of
the problem, but to human arms which can envelop the families who
are raising angry, neglected children. We need to respond to this
call to arms with the embrace of community, workplace and society
at large.
</P>
<P>
   We must help families nurture their young safely and
responsively, modeling our altruism, accountability and caring _
before these values are lost.

   To be sure, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had to have been

own children are watching?
</P>
<P>
   To do their jobs, though, parents need more support than they
are getting. Families today are dealing with more stress than ever
before. Often both parents need to work full-time, and very few
workplaces can be seen as family-friendly. Parents are struggling
to get home in time to discipline, to model values for their
children with their own behavior and to foster self-acceptance in
their children.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that families can't do all of this on their own. When
will we stop clinging to this outdated notion and take some steps
toward helping parents and children?
</P>
<P>
   Without paid parental leave in the first months of a child's
life, most parents cannot afford the ``luxury'' of caring for their
infant at this critical stage when attachment to other human beings
is first set in motion. We can no longer risk depriving children of
this early basis for intimacy and eventually self-esteem. We are
facing the cost of raising children whose sense of self and
connection to others is too tentative to withstand the taunting of
later years.
</P>
<P>
   When parents do notice signs of trouble, they often can't turn
to a professional for help because they lack adequate health
insurance to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to avert future tragedies, we will have to include
these and other ways of supporting parents in a new definition of
community.
</P>
<P>
   When children reach the school years, they need a community more
than ever. The school day ends at 2 or 3 p.m., leaving several
unsupervised hours every day for children of working parents.
Children need either longer school days or afterschool activities _
in community organizations, church groups or schools _ that
continue until at least 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold and Harris have taught us that children also need a
community to provide them with opportunities for acceptance in as
wide a range of activities as possible, so that they will not have
to seek out acceptance and affirmation in racist hate groups and

</P>
<P>
   Schools are an integral part of the solution, and we are asking
them to do much more than ever before. Yet we can't expect them to
do it if we don't provide them with the means they need. We must
revive our children's respect for their teachers by demonstrating
our own _ and show that we mean it by providing the funds and
support that teachers deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Our schools can no longer tolerate bullying or hatred based on
differences. Teachers must help children take pride in the
activities in which they excel, channel their creative energies
constructively and find acceptance within themselves and from their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, like families, are where children learn _ more from
action than from words _ what our society's values are. Do we even
know what these are anymore?
</P>
<P>
   By neglecting our children, our families, our communities, we
are teaching our children that money, power and aggression come
first. If we really have given in to ``every man for himself,''
then this is what our children will learn. We will deserve, more
than they, the human jungle they will inherit.
</P>
<P>
   We must face what has changed in our world, what must change and
what must be preserved. We have known about most of these risk
factors _ and what to do about many of them _ for years. We should
now turn our outrage into a resolve to act. Many of the solutions
are within our reach.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy in Colorado is a call to arms for us all _ not to
the firearms which increasingly are being recognized as one part of
the problem, but to human arms which can envelop the families who
are raising angry, neglected children. We need to respond to this
call to arms with the embrace of community, workplace and society
at large.
</P>
<P>
   We must help families nurture their young safely and
responsively, modeling our altruism, accountability and caring _
before these values are lost.

<P>
   The massacre in Littleton, Colo., is a national tragedy. It is
also a national indictment. It should not be seen as just a high
school tragedy or a breakdown in preventive care for two disturbed
teen-agers. It is an urgent call to our country for help.
</P>
<P>
   The recent episodes of teens and preteens murdering their
classmates have sent a message that our nation is in deep trouble.
We are a violent society. How many more young lives must be lost
before we finally face this?
</P>
<P>
   We are all asking: ``Why did this have to happen?'' We don't
know for sure what drove the two teens in Colorado, but we do know
that there is no other country in the world where anything like
this schoolyard bloodshed has happened so often. It is time we
looked at what sets us apart and whether we are harboring risk
factors here that we must address before tragedy strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   To start, no other country in the industrialized world tolerates
such easy access to guns. We are paying for this with our
children's lives. The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S.
youths is 12 times higher than in 25 other industrialized countries
combined, according to a recent study. For firearm-related
homicides, the rate is 16 times higher. Added now to this menace is
easy access to bomb plans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had to have been

CLINTON DROPS A BOMB ON STATESMANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANK BARDACKE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATSONVILLE, Calif. _ The war in the Balkans is a serious
departure from other wars, a frightening glimpse of the future and
a moral disaster with only a few semi-precedents in the brutal
history of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of what is now being called the American
Age, air power has promised to protect the killer from the killed.
</P>
<P>
   Death delivered by air started small in the colonies. The
British (with Churchill in the lead) tried to bomb Africans and
Arabs into submission. Mussolini similarly terrorized the
Ethiopians. Franco and the Nazis brought the experiment to Europe,
where air power was used against the Spanish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   But in these _ and other, early trial runs _ bombs were meant to
work in conjunction with troops on the ground. The fire bombings of
Dresden and Tokyo, for all their horror, were done in the midst of
a war involving millions of soldiers, and with some risks to the
pilots. The nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated
the technological possibility of producing massive destruction
without any danger to airmen. But the technology was primitive and
blunt.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, after the North Vietnamese had won, Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and President Richard Nixon fought for a
``decent interval of time'' before their takeover by dropping bombs
all over Southeast Asia from essentially invulnerable B-52s. But
they needed the coordinated efforts of South Vietnamese soldiers to
replace the withdrawing American ones.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, a new technology of air power was first proudly
displayed, but President George Bush _ still wedded to the past _
mobilized and used ground troops, and successfully convinced the
United Nations and Congress to support war.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the Clinton Doctrine. No ground troops will be
deployed, and there will be no formal policy debate _ neither in
the United Nations, in the Congress nor in the country. The waging
of war is now executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   We should have seen it coming. But we were distracted by all the
Lewinsky, tail-wagging-dog arguments. Clinton bombed Sudan,
Afghanistan and Iraq with no commitment of ground troops and no
significant attempt to get any kind of mandate to support his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   We thought the bombs were only an attempt to distract attention
from his domestic troubles. No, they were the beginning of his new
approach to war.
</P>
<P>
   But the policy had not yet been perfected. Clinton still tried
to get the nation to support the bombs. He sent a team of people on
the road to engage in debate. The town hall demonstrations in
Columbus, Ohio, made him revise that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there will be little attempt to convince any ordinary
person that the war policy is justified. There is no need. After
all, none of our boys or girls will be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton told the military families in one of his few formal
speeches in defense of his actions, ``America takes care of its
own.'' That's the extent of statesmanship and eloquence. Then, at
the end of disaster, will come a splendid apology.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine is consistent with Clinton's character. By
now we know him well. He is willing to kill, but not to die.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thinks he can finesse war just as he finesses everything
else. The logic that allows you to smoke but not inhale, to enjoy
fellatio but not have sex, fits perfectly with the notion that a
country can fight a war without soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And since Clinton has no sense of personal sacrifice and little
concern for history, he is incapable of the grand rhetoric which
earlier leaders have used to mobilize their countrymen. But he is
very good at apologizing. He is the perfect man for the new war.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments that justify any war have always been bloody and
brutal. They involve horrific calculations of ends and means, a
dark calculus of lesser and greater evils. But on occasion, they
have been convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Within those global arguments, however, has always hidden a
smaller, ethical consideration. A soldier's willingness to kill was
matched by his willingness to die.
</P>
<P>
   It is a version of Kant's categorical imperative; it provides a
measure of moral symmetry to war. The Clinton Doctrine shatters
this ethical foundation of soldiery, and makes any larger calculus
of a just war that much more difficult to believe. When we kill
from a safe distance we lose all moral perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the national concern, whipped up by television flacks,
for three captured American soldiers in the face of the awesome
human misery provoked by our policy. Yellow ribbons, which used to
be an expression of support for soldiers who risked their lives,
now become a sordid measure of our moral idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   We will reap the consequences of such an ultimate denial of the
humanity of others. Our daily estrangement from each other will
intensify; our internal violence will spiral upward.
</P>
<P>
   Our gated communities are already matched by a gated morality,
where people think only of their own interests and safety, while
they let the security guards deal with the threats from without.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Doctrine will make it all worse. Soon no one will
understand that old-time phrase ``the moral equivalent of war.''
What could it have meant? War will bring no one together, will
create no communal feelings, will be just another annoying,
expensive government policy.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one good thing about the Clinton Doctrine: It
probably won't work.
</P>
<P>
   Air power _ even technologically advanced air power _ has not
been able to win wars. It certainly is not winning the war in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a war could be won from the air if everything on the
ground were destroyed, if in the logic first uncovered by Tacitus,
the lasers make a desert and the politicians call it peace.
</P>
<P>
   But, surely, those of us in the United States, those of us in
whose name the Clinton Doctrine is being deployed, will not allow
that to happen. Surely?

CATHOLIC GROUP PRESSES OPPOSITION TO DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUZANNE HOHOLIK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Opposition to the death penalty is an issue all
priests should preach from the pulpit to their congregations.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message the National Federation of Priests' Councils
sent Thursday as part of their week-long conference in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Misleh, a policy adviser with the U.S. Catholic
Conference, said the nation's bishops and priests need to convey
the message to parishioners that the death penalty is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, many Americans _ including many Catholics _ still
support the death penalty out of understandable fear of crime and
horror,'' he said. ``We hope they will come to see, as we have,
that more violence is not the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people, mainly priests and bishops, attended the
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The statement of the U.S. Catholic Conference administrative
board echoes remarks made by Pope John Paul II during his visit to
St. Louis in January. The pontiff called for an end to the death
penalty and clemency for a convicted murderer in Missouri who was
awaiting execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human life must never be taken away, even in the case of
someone who has done great evil,'' Pope John Paul II said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   After the pope's appeal, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan commuted
Darrell Mease's death sentence to life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Catholic Conference officially has opposed the death
penalty since 1976, the same year capital punishment was reinstated
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a controversial issue. Many Catholics support the death
penalty to the tune of 70 percent,'' Misleh said. ``A lot of hearts
and minds need to change. We're hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing the hearts of American Catholics will require a strong
message from priests and bishops to the faithful, who often receive
clerics' views in opposition to abortion, said Bud Welch of
Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finding that all bishops believe the death penalty is
wrong, but we need them to say it in a statement that it is
wrong,'' said Welch, who travels the country talking about ending
executions. ``We're their flock. In the past, the bishops haven't
shown leadership on the death penalty and I think they should.''
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong critic of capital punishment, Welch changed his mind
briefly after the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
in Oklahoma City, where his daughter, Julie, and 167 other people
were killed in the 1995 attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw them (defendants Timothy McVeigh and Terry
Nichols), I said `What's the point of a trial? Let's fry them,'''
he said. ``I honestly would have killed those two men in the month
after the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Welch only wants for the pair to spend the rest of their
lives in prison. McVeigh was sentenced to death by injection on
murder and weapons charges. Nichols was convicted of conspiracy and
involuntary manslaughter and will spend life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Along with opposition to executions, Misleh added that priests
also need to provide help for crime victims through education,
advocacy and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be a community set on preserving life,'' he said.

THE INTERNET IS HERE, AND IT'S BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There he was, an exact twin of our new child,
and he had a role on the amusing new ABC sitcom ``Norm.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just a bit part, but what do you expect for a little guy
who's only 10 months old? He sat on a desk in an office, just as
another of his brothers had sat on a desk in the NBC sitcom ``Just
Shoot Me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a talented and cute little family, the iMacs, and their
cyberlogical parents down in Cupertino sure get them good product
placement. Whenever we see one on television, we look over our
shoulders proudly at ours. We halfway expect him to be looking at
his brother on TV, too.
</P>
<P>
   We've decided it's a him because he's bluish. The color is
important. When you tell people you have an iMac, they always ask
what color you have. We got bluish because that's all they had the
first week they came out.
</P>
<P>
   We're suckers for cute. We almost got one of those new VW bugs,
too. The iMac looks as if it could grow up into a VW bug, but thank
God it won't. It's cheaper and it can take you more places. You
just have to admit you're not a geek and you don't care if you have
a non-macho computer.
</P>
<P>
   Man, the world really has changed since the days of pocket
protectors. Computer geeks are macho. They're as aggressive as
jocks and as snobby as preppies _ and often richer.
</P>
<P>
   They're still geeks, though, so the hell with them, except when
you want them to come over and debug your VW bug computer.
</P>
<P>
   This is how technophobic I am, or used to be: The iMac sat on
the table looking cute for most of the past year before I used it.
My wife drove it around the Internet, learned how to paint with it,
made business cards with it and wrote stories on it.
</P>
<P>
   She played a heck of a lot of Nanosaur.
</P>
<P>
   I made excuses about having to use terminals at work. The real
reason I'm technophobic is because of the computer course I had to
take 30 years ago. It involved FORTRAN and punch cards I always got
mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   Until a week ago, when I started mainlining on-line, I liked the
idea of the computer revolution, the way a citizen of Moscow in
1917 might have liked the idea of a revolution, but not the idea of
interfacing with Bolsheviks.
</P>
<P>
   Last cloudy weekend, the iMac called to me. I answered its siren
beep and started surfing the Net. Sorry, geeks, we technophobes are
out there stumbling among you. And some of us know grammar even if
we don't know code.
</P>
<P>
   Here are three good reasons to be late coming to the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   _ One: You're too old to want to join a conversation group with
any of the anonymous idiots spouting off on every topic under the
icons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two: You know exactly what you want to read. You can skip the
conspiracy sites, the hate sites and the sites with bomb-making
instructions _ the sites always covered in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three: You don't have to wait hours for graphics to download
the way you used to on AOL. Now you just get flashing ads for
hardware and software. And books.
</P>
<P>
   If you avoid the lame amateur sites, you can get in all kinds of
places for free. My wife regularly goes down to Stanford
University, without having to drive, and checks out papers by
academics. It's just like grad school without the pretense of
showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend I read the Times of both New York and London. I
went to the Library of Congress. I looked up Charlie Trotter, just
to see if his precious cooking show really was from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   I read my cousin Steve's rock reviews in the Boston Globe. I
checked out hotels in New York, the Associated Press wires, and
spied on dozens of exhibitionistic people and chickens on various
Webcams.
</P>
<P>
   OK, those Webcams were lame sites. I have to admit I'm a voyeur
who likes to skulk around in my kiddie car of an iMac and its AOL
automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of using my iMac, the downside is becoming
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   I like the Internet, but I'm still not so sure about e-mail. For
one thing, the Serbs can bomb me at home. They don't bomb with what
you'd call pinpoint accuracy, and they use spam instead of high
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   In the news biz we call this pro-Serb propaganda ``Yugospam,''
and it's been flooding the e-mail networks of newspapers. I didn't
get too much, but at least one newspaper address was hit by 200
megabytes of Yugospam, including a single e-mail of 2.3 megabytes.
Just for comparison, ``Moby Dick'' is 1.3 megabytes, and that
includes one bite that swallowed Ahab.
</P>
<P>
   I can't believe I'm talking about megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   The other potential downside of my iMac is e-commerce. I made my
first purchase on the Net, a round-trip ticket to New York.
</P>
<P>
   After I made the electronic reservation, I immediately called
Delta to see if it worked. The ticket agent said everyone calls
after booking their first e-flight.
</P>
<P>
   A flick of the mouse, and you can get all the ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   Punch in the credit card number, and you're done. Really done.
</P>

SOUND THE ALARM! BETTER YET, SET IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Recently, I lost all the programs that I had
downloaded. I had a free program that made my computer make my
phone ring at any designated time. I wanted to tell my girlfriend
about this because she has trouble getting up in the morning, but I
haven't been able to find it anywhere since I brought my computer
back up. Can you help me?
</P>
<P>
   _ Busy Signal
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BUSY: You may be interested in a little technological
innovation that fundamentally changed the way civilization
developed. Its inventors called it ``a clock,'' but you can be sure
the marketing division is hard at work coming up with a snappier
name that focus groups everywhere will love. Something like
``Timemaster SX 2000'' would be my guess.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Clock 2.0 had an amazing enhancement that may solve your
problem. It actually combines an alarm and a clock! I forget what
they called the finished product, but I'm sure marketing will come
up with something infinitely more memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Stop over-teching. Maybe your girlfriend has trouble getting up
because she can't bear the thought of facing another day with
somebody who thinks it's way cool to turn a $3,000 computer into an
alarm clock. Alarm clock! Yes, that's what they called it. I knew
I'd remember it sooner or later, even though ``Sleepender X9'' has
been growing on me.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I hate these here 'puters, but I need to ask
someone with intelligence (?). I suffered a severe crash and had no
choice but to reformat the hard drive. Ever since, I can't run a
disk scan. The message is that some other program is running. There
is nothing running, unless the gremlins are working overtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Downtown Donna
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DOWN: That's not a gremlin. That's just Bill Gates. He
forgot to wear his lifts.
</P>
<P>
   I know you reloaded from a recovery CD-ROM provided by your
computer manufacturer rather than the Win95 original CD. My guess
is that your original crash hammered your machine a lot harder than
you thought, making even the recovery disk goof up. Or maybe it
loaded stuff you really don't need.
</P>
<P>
   Windows can have all sorts of stuff going on behind the scenes.
Usually, the only way you know about it is if you have a bunch of
dinky little icons in the System Tray in the lower right corner of
your screen. If you've got more than a volume control there,
something else is running.
</P>
<P>
   In Win95, go to the ``Startup'' folder in Programs and see if
anything is loading. Or try un-installing everything you don't need
from the ``Add/Remove Programs'' icon in the Control Panel. See if
anything is on the ``Load'' or ``Run'' lines at the top of the
Win.ini file. But don't go messing with the Registry (which is
where these things are probably loading) unless you know what
you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   You nuked the computer once. Do it again, but buy Win98 and
customize the installation to fit your needs.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: We're so close to the year 2001, yet so far
away from HAL 9000. Would you address that?

   DEAR STARRY: It can only be attributable to human error. There's
one big problem with visionaries like Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley

SWEEPS DREAMS ARE UPON US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How's this for the cosmic stars lining up
perfectly: It's sweeps, and ``Cops'' is celebrating its 400th
episode Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that _ you guessed it _ the episode involves a domestic
disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   March 3, 1987. That was the debut of ``Cops,'' which has spawned
many imitators, but is still the king. This show's conception and
ongoing run says all you need to know about America and television.
</P>
<P>
   May sweeps (the period when ratings are taken for television
stations) is becoming less about the big network blockbuster _
because they don't know how to do it right anymore, or maybe no one
cares _ and more about cliffhangers and the end of old stalwarts.
Like on May 19, when ``The Nanny'' mercifully leaves the airwaves.
There will be a big United Nations celebration at the conclusion.
The world is finally free of Fran Drescher.
</P>
<P>
   Except in syndication.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, say goodbye to ``Mad About You.'' Whoops, our
mistake, you already waved goodbye two season ago, when it was
``Mad at You.'' They never should have had that baby.
</P>
<P>
   We won't be watching the teary finale unless Paul Reiser and
Helen Hunt address the camera and tell the truth: ``We're sorry for
making our sitcom into a drama. We know you were looking for
laughs. And we also apologize for being so self-absorbed. Thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Also going off the air that night: ``Melrose Place.'' Talk about
a show that overstayed its welcome by about four years. ``Melrose''
is about as must-see as ``Matlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Going, going, gone: ``Home Improvement'' calls it quits on May
25. Of this year _ not 1992. That was when it was creatively dead,
in case you were confused.
</P>
<P>
   Where is all this bitterness coming from, you ask? Where is the
usual sunny delight? Answer: If you don't stay diligent, then a
network like CBS thinks it's fine to air ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine
Woman: The Movie'' on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   To which we say: No. That's not allowed. If you cancel a show,
you don't bring it back as a two-hour movie.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, a miniseries on ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfieffer''?
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide put Calista Flockhart on the cover and basically threw
soft slabs of butter at her, using the spotlight to dismiss as
meaningless the attention tabloids pay to her weight and other
issues, and saying that she is, in her words, ``fierce.'' Her show
is on Fox. Rupert Murdoch owns Fox and TV Guide. You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Religious broadcaster Pax TV is turning the brilliant show
``Ballykissangel'' into its own version, ``Hope Island.'' This
could be a trend. Take existing shows and then sand them down for
the family values crowd.
</P>
<P>
   We can just see it: ``Cops'' becomes ``Ministers of Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Pax is also delivering some specials, and they have, curiously,
a Fox tone to them: ``The Bible's Greatest Secrets Revealed.'' And:
``The Bible's Greatest Miracles: The Proof!''
</P>
<P>
   We only wish that were a joke. What will be next on Pax:
``Lazarus! Caught on Tape!'' ``Mary Magdalene Like You've Never
Seen Her Before!'' ``When Pharaohs Attack!'' ``World's Deadliest
Burning Bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for ``South Park'' are down. Way down. We could have
told you that months ago. That show's done. Long live the
``Powerpuff Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Something to think about when you're upset about not getting a
raise at work: You're not alone. Kevin Sorbo, star of ``Hercules:
The Legendary Journeys,'' is threatening a walkout. That could open
the door for De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   Hercules wants a pay hike. Mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   You want underappreciated? King World Productions gave the green
light to another year of the ``Roseanne'' talk show and a lot of
affiliates booed.
</P>

CLINTON CAN BUILD A LEGACY BY MAKING WAR ON VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton this week uttered what could have been, and
still could be, words to build a legacy on: ``We have to redefine
the national community so that we have shared obligation to save
children's lives, and we've got to get out of this crazy denial
that this won't make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, those words are merely associated with Band-aid
proposals sparked by the school shooting that left 15 people dead
in Littleton, Colo. Adults _ most obviously parents _ would face
federal charges for letting minors possess guns that are later used
in shootings. Sales at gun shows would be banned.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking gun shows is good, but is far from a direct attack on
handguns. And anyone who has considered the concept of parent
responsibility in tragic cases realizes that there can be no clear
court definition of such responsibility. It is not only liberals
saying this, but even family-values conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if a kid drives the family car into a crowded store?''
asked Robert Knight, director of cultural studies at the Family
Research Council. ``Should the parents be held liable? You have to
look at it case by case. Not every parent is negligent because a
kid has turned out to be a bad apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows there is no one answer for the tragedy. But
instead of searching for clues, we get copouts like this from House
minority leader Richard Gephardt: ``The answer will not be found in
state legislatures or in the halls of Congress. The answer lies
somewhere in the hopelessness and the hateful hearts of the
children who have lost their way.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, then we have already succumbed to the nihilism
that afflicted Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Evidence of that was
last week when Clinton sent Vice President Al Gore _ instead of
himself _ to Colorado to deliver a forgettable speech. We know
Clinton must watch Kosovo, but throughout much of the 1980s and
'90s, 5,000 children a year died from gunfire, a pace giving us
more bodies at home than lost in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   No American president has behaved as if this carnage was as
important as saving ethnic Albanians. Littleton offers Clinton that
chance. It gives him a chance for a lasting legacy.
</P>
<P>
   No issue is as ready to be dealt with across political lines.
Ending violence requires big government and family values. It
requires parental vigilance and government funding to encourage a
sense of community. It requires individual responsibility to
identify the Eric Harrises and Dylan Klebolds among us and a
collective responsibility to say that handguns, which make violence
so much more fatal, are no longer acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The centrist Clinton gained office in 1992 professing to get
beyond ``the brain-dead politics'' of Democrats and Republicans. So
far, centrism has meant minimal vision. But now, with suburbs
waking up to the idea that wealth does not guarantee safety or
community, no time is better for the biggest of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   If we really love children, there is no reason to settle for a
United States where kids are 12 times more likely to die from
gunfire than in the rest of the developed world. Clinton can start
by doing what Britain and Australia did after similar tragedies. He
can ban or dramatically restrict new handgun sales and devise a
buyout plan for the weapons already out there (hunters can have
their rifles, but only during hunting season).
</P>
<P>
   On the violence-in-culture front, the president could start
treating the producers of violent movies, television shows, and
video games the way we treat tobacco. Make it clear that they are
an adult product. Banish all TV shows where people die from
violence to past the 10 or 11 p.m. news.
</P>
<P>
   Tax the makers of violent video games so such games become more
expensive and less attractive. Give violent movies an R rating
instead of PG-13. We consider it mandatory to ask teen-agers to
abstain from sex. We should include violent shows as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could use Littleton to an ironic advantage. It would be
a perfect opportunity to press for popular support to give schools
the tools to turn cliques into communities. Clinton, to his credit,
has proposed tripling the federal budget for after-school grant
programs to $600 million. But he needs much more, since only 5 to
10 percent of middle school students have access to such programs.
No one wants the government to be a nanny. This is to help schools
and civic organizations hire people who can nurture youth while the
parents _ or parent are working.
</P>
<P>
   Violence runs so deep in the American blood that no president up
to now has had the courage to wage an all-out war on it. But we are
at a crossroads. Cities are suing gun makers. Missouri just voted
down concealed handguns. The once invulnerable National Rifle
Association is rapidly isolating itself with its inflexible defense
of gun ownership and by stubbornly going ahead with its Denver
convention, near Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, a politician who always wanted the maximum applause
for minimal risk, the opportunity has never been better to create a
lasting legacy. The community he wants to redefine is sick of guns.
It is coming out of denial. All the community needs is a president
who is dedicated to making a difference.

ABC DERBY CLOSEUP CAMERA IS A LATE SCRATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC has scrapped plans to use a camera mounted on a car that
would have driven along Churchill Downs' inside turf track during
the Kentucky Derby, citing its inability to test the equipment and
the chilly reaction it received from Derby officials.
</P>
<P>
   The camera would have provided viewers with a closeup of the
race. ABC director Craig Janoff said the most dramatic images would
have occurred in the back stretch, where the wide-open field of 20
steeds will jockey for position. Similar devices have been used in
Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will still have plenty of images of the 125th Derby. It
plans to use 40 cameras. One camera that will not be used is the
jockey-cam, a 1-pound camera attached to a jockey's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Derby officials were hesitant to use it again. ``Some of the
horsemen certainly have their superstitions,'' Janoff said. ``They
don't want anything unusual or different on their jockeys or
thoroughbreds.''
</P>
<P>
   The car-mounted camera had caused a certain amount of pause
among the thoroughbred community. Some of their concerns might have
been assuaged had ABC been able to test the equipment. But rain
prohibited the network from experimenting.
</P>
<P>
   ABC remains undaunted in its pursuit of visual enhancements. ``A
lot of our innovations weren't approved the first time around,''
said ABC producer Curt Gowdy Jr. ``There's no disappointment. We
will just keep moving forward.''

NICK ZITO THINKS HE HAS TWO FOR THE ROSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Can a late-bloomer win the Run for the Roses?
Nick Zito is coming into Saturday's 125th running of the Kentucky
Derby with two budding stars, Stephen Got Even and Adonis, but both
are question marks because of a lack of seasoning. Stephen Got
Even, who appears the more talented of the two, has raced only four
times, while Adonis has gone to the post on just six occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I preach patience,'' said Zito. ``I tell the owners to be
patient. Patience is the key to horse racing. This game will humble
kings. You try to put the sport in perspective. All you can do is
work hard and hope to have the opportunity to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Got Even, a son of the powerful A. P. Indy, who this
year was one of the nominees to the Hall of Fame, is owned by
Stephen Hilbert, president of a financial services company in
Indianapolis, and will be ridden by Chris McCarron. Stephen Got
Even will break from post No. 4 and is 12-1 in the morning line.
Adonis, a son of Chris S., is owned by Ernie Paragallo, a New York
investment banker who specializes in buying yearlings and
2-year-olds and reselling them, and will be ridden by Jorge Chavez.
Adonis will start from No. 1 and is 30-1 in the line, but was
considered good enough to avoid the five-horse mutuel field.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two horses had what we call `2-year-old problems,' ''
said Zito. ``Horses go through growth stages and they get things
that slow them down, like bucked shins (inflammation of the tendon
sheath over the leg bone), and so forth. Stephen Got Even is a big
horse, and it's tougher with big horses. When you're dealt cards in
this game, you can't throw them back in. You're dealt a certain
hand, and you have to deal with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Got Even has won all three of his starts this year, most
recently an impressive score in the Gallery Furniture at Turfway
Park March 27. In the Gallery, he ran his last quarter in :23 4/5,
an outstanding move, but the five-week gap between the Gallery and
the Derby is not considered ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five weeks is neither good nor bad for him,'' said Zito. ``All
I know is that he's won his last three, all of those races have
been spaced, and he's a great horse. I was a little surprised by
the ease with which he won the Gallery, but, knowing he was a great
horse, I was not that surprised. We're enjoying every moment with
him. We're really pleased with the position we're in. We haven't
missed a day of training with either horse since January. Stephen
Got Even has met the challenge as well as any horse I've ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Zito, 51, that's saying a lot since Zito also
trained both Strike the Gold, who won the Derby in 1991, and Go for
Gin, who won the Rose Run in 1994. ``Stephen Got Even is a
tremendous athlete, he's ripped,'' continued Zito. ``He's a
physical specimen. He's in the same league as my two Derby winners.
This is a big-league bred horse (out of Immerse, a Cox's Ridge
mare). It's just wonderful what he's been able to do. He's done
what any great horse does.''
</P>
<P>
   No horse has won the Derby without having run as a 2-year-old
since Apollo in 1882. A streak of 117 years will get a trainer's
attention, and it is almost an unwritten rule that a conditioner
with a top 2-year-old colt will try to get at least one race into
him before he turns age 3.
</P>
<P>
   Zito saw to it that Stephen Got Even and Adonis each made one
start last year, debuting them both on the same day. ``They both
ran Nov. 28 at Aqueduct,'' he said. ``Stephen Got Even finished
second (in the second race), and Adonis finished fifth (in the
ninth). It has always been on my wish list to start all of my
2-year-olds in August at Saratoga, but you have to do what you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Bob Baffert, who is trying to become
the first trainer to win three consecutive Derbys, has the horses
to beat in General Challenge, likely entrymate and top filly
Excellent Meeting, and Prime Timber. But Zito will take his best
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baffert's try at a triple is quite something,'' said Zito.
``It would be an amazing feat. He's in a great position with the
1-2 finishers in the Santa Anita Derby (General Challenge and Prime
Timber). But I like our position, too. We have two wonderful
horses, and they've each won a major prep (Adonis won the Wood
Memorial at Aqueduct April 10). It's three days before the race, my
horses are in great shape and you can't ask for more than that. Of
course, you have to be lucky, too. Things have to go just right. I
think the other trainers know what kind of horse Stephen Got Even
is. But, we have to see (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   This Derby is full of good horses who are grinders. They fight
hard every step of the way, but they lack brilliance. If Stephen
Got Even is, indeed, a ``great'' horse, as Zito says, then he will
win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the season The Groom is Red, owned by Celtics coach
Rick Pitino and trained by Zito, was considered a serious Derby
contender. He had won the Champagne Stakes at Belmont as a
2-year-old, but he has been unable to do much since. Hovever, Zito
has not given up. ``He's doing fine,'' said Zito. ``He's healthy
and we're looking at the Peter Pan (May 23 at Belmont Park) and the
Belmont Stakes. I think he'd have a shot at the Belmont distance (1
1/2 miles).'' Pitino has purchased some nice young horses. ``He's
got some 2-year-olds we really like,'' said Zito. ``He's got five
2-year-old colts, and one filly.''

FOR LONG TERM, MOVE OUT MONEY MARKET, GOLD FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 02, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both public school teachers. Through 403(b)
and IRA accounts, we have been able to accumulate a portfolio
slightly in excess of $1 million to augment our retirement. I
retired last June at the age of 58 and my wife will retire at age
55 in June of the year 2002. It is our plan then to take
distributions from our savings at the rate of 5 percent per annum,
with the balance of the funds going to our heirs upon our deaths.
My wife will be receiving a pension from the state retirement
systems, and I am currently receiving pensions from the U.S.
government and the state retirement system. Our problem is that we
are not sure as to the proper distribution of our holdings. We have
always managed our own portfolios and have been relatively
aggressive in our investment choices. Although we are somewhat
concerned with protection of principal, we do not want to be left
behind by any expanding market either. Our current holdings are all
with Fidelity, and they are distributed thus: money market, 21
percent; Dividend Growth, 21 percent; Fidelity fund, 14 percent;
Equity Income, 11 percent; Aggressive Growth, 6.7 percent;
Retirement Growth, 6 percent; bond funds, 7.6 percent; Japan Small
Company, 4.3 percent; Convertible Securities, 3.3 percent; Capital
and Income, 2.3 percent; Select Gold, 1.5 percent, and a trading
account representing 2 percent. Are there any recommendations you
would make?
</P>
<P>
   R.L., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. Given your purposes, this portfolio doesnt need much
tinkering. I would suggest only one definite change, and a couple
of changes you might -- or might not -- want to make.
</P>
<P>
   As I'll bet you have already guessed if you have read very many
of these columns, the definite change involves the money market
position. Given that you make it clear that you view this as a
long-term portfolio, designed to deliver your desired income stream
for the balance of your life and then to pass to your heirs, the
money market holding is much too conservative for my taste. I would
move the entire position into intermediate-term bond funds such as
Mortgage Securities, Intermediate Bond or Government Securities
funds. Ifyou feel strongly that you want an ultra-conservative
holding to represent a bedrock for this portfolio, at the minimum
you could move to Fidelity Short-Term Bond fund, although I would
prefer the intermediate-term funds for a long-term portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I view the small position in the Select Gold fund with a
jaundiced eye. I tend to view precious metals funds with favor only
as short-term trading positions for people who believe big changes
loom in the gold markets on a fairly near-term basis. If you look
at the long-term records of this fund -- a 9.52 percent five-year
average annual loss and a .39 percent average annual loss over a
decade -- you'll see what I mean. So unless you fall into the
category of a person who believe gold is about to take a big jump,
I'd cash out of this one, moving the entire proceeds into the
Capital and Income (or junk bond) fund. (And if you do believe that
gold is about to leap forward, your position is too small to do you
much good.)
</P>
<P>
   The effect of these two moves would be to take the fixed-income
side of the portfolio to a level somewhere in excess of 35 percent,
compared to a current level around 34 percent. (I can't be more
precise because your stated allocations add up to 100.7 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, I wish I saw a little more diversification on
the stock side. With the assumption that your trading account is
dominated by large-cap domestic stocks, I come up with less than 10
percent of the portfolio that represents a diversification away
from either large-cap stocks or fixed-income issues. I suggest you
establish some representation in the small-cap universe, and also
take a position in the excellent Fidelity Select Health Care fund,
drawing the cash to make these moves from any one of your three
large-cap balanced funds -- Dividend Growth, Fidelity Fund, and
Retirement Growth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your column of April 4 you mentioned that Vanguards GNMA
fund, in which I have some money, carries some risk. I am
interested in knowing what the risk would be so I may act
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   B.R., Encinitas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Most fixed-income funds carry three kinds of risk. First
comes credit risk -- the chance that the institution or people who
stand behind the borrowings might default on the payments. Second
comes interest rate risk; this is the chance that interest rates
might rise, causing the value of the fixed-income securities you
hold to fall. And third is prepayment risk, which is the chance
that the borrower might prepay the loan -- usually at a time when
it is to the borrowers advantage and your disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Ginnie Mae funds carry no practical level of credit risk. The
portfolio of a GNMA fund is made up of securities representing
bundles of federally guaranteed mortgages. The government not only
stands behind the principal payments on these mortgages, but also
the interest payments. Thus the only real level of risk here is
that the government either reneges on its promise or goes bust. To
my view, thats fantasy, not risk.
</P>
<P>
   Interest risk is another story. While the government guarantees
payments of interest and principal on these bonds, it cannot and
does not guarantee their market value. Like other fixed income
holdings, the value of GNMA securities reacts inversely to interest
rates, which means their value rises as interest rates fall, and
their value declines as interest rates rise. When interest rates
make large or sudden jumps, these funds can follow suit, showing
very substantial gains or losses. Worse, this market behavior often
occurs when investors are only worried that interest rates might
change.
</P>
<P>
   If you look over the long-term results of your fund, you can see
the results for 1994, when the fund lost .95 percent; during that
year there were no substantial changes in interest rates, but there
was a lot of worry that there might be; accordingly the fund was
pushed into the red (albeit not as deeply as the average 4.02
percent loss for its intermediate-term government bond fund peers).
Typically when interest rates turn around, or when people stop
worry about them, the GNMA funds make up the lost ground. Thus in
1995, when it appeared rates would remain stable, Vanguard GNMA
came back with a 17.04 percent total return, effectively making up
for the lost ground of the year before. Such behavior is why I
never recommend GNMA funds for short-term holdings; they work best
only when the owners can take a long-term view and ride out the bad
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The third element of risk is prepayment risk. Since the
individuals who have taken these mortgages can prepay at any time,
the owners face the risk that falling interest rates, which should
have caused their holdings to rise in value, will have a different
effect -- causing the mortgage borrowers to refinance, thus sending
the portfolio manager out to replace the prepaid mortgages with new
securities. When that happens he or she is faced with the
possibilities of either buying replacement securities with lower
yields or paying a premium price to buy securities with the same or
better yields -- either way bad for the funds shareowners.
</P>
<P>
   The whole question of duration is a complicated one for GNMA
owners and fund managers. Although these securities are backed by
traditional mortgages with maturity dates ranging from 15 to 30
years, the common experience of mortgage lenders is that the
average mortgage is paid off in about seven or eight years. Thus
when we consider prepayment risk for GNMAs, it's the risk that
lower rates will cause prepayments to go beyond the normal level.
</P>
<P>
   But you can take consolation in this: When interest rates are as
low as they are now, its pretty unlikely that rates could fall far
enough to make refinancing attractive to very many mortgage
borrowers. Moreover, when you view that prepayment risk, consider
also that GNMA funds tend to yield about one half of one percent
more than a comparable government-securities fund which doesn't
carry the prepayment risk. Thus, you are being paid an extra return
for bearing this risk.
</P>
<P>
   In summary, the risks that GNMA funds carry make them poor
short-term investments unless you are a market pro, but they are a
fine conservative holding for a person with a long-term viewpoint
-- say 10 years or more -- and with the stomach to ride out the
bumps. And bear in mind, when the bumps come, it doesn't mean the
income stream stops -- the interest checks keep rolling in through
good times and bad. Thus I consider GNMA funds a fine investment
for people seeking a steady and solid income stream -- and Vanguard
GNMA is one of the best of the group.

   Q. The painter painted the outside of my windows so heavily that
they are painted shut, and I can't open them. I can't make them
budge from the inside, and cannot get to the outside frame because
the aluminum storms were closed after painting. How in the world
can I open them before I croak from the heat?
</P>
<P>
   TOO HOT in Dorchester
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah yes, the window that has been painted shut. The paint that
oozed between sash and jamb may not have dried completely in those
tight spots, making it hold the sash even more, almost like glue.
But never fear, there are answers, but none easy.
</P>
<P>
   On the inside, you can take off the side stops, the thin strips
of wood nailed or screwed onto the jamb, and which are holding the
bottom sash in place. With these stops off, you can wiggle the
bottom sash back and forth (toward you and away from you), to break
the paint bead, allowing the window to open. This is the easiest
and least complicated way to do it, but doesn't always work.
</P>
<P>
   The other way: Remove the aluminum storms. It is a simple matter
of removing the screws along the window's border, and pulling it
off carefully, breaking the caulk that was applied when the windows
were installed.
</P>
<P>
   With this access, with a utility knife, cut the paint bead
wherever the sash and the jamb meet. Insert a pry bar under the
sash, between sash and sill, and pry up. Pry with two bars, to
prevent the sash from slanting and getting even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the sash free, scrape off the paint where it
seeped into the joints. Let the remaining paint dry.
</P>
<P>
   Before putting storms back in place, scrape off caulk left on
the wood casing (frame), apply a fresh bead of caulk on the face of
the casing on three sides of the opening, then apply the storm,
using the original holes for the screws; this will allow proper
positioning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house has a full set of wood storm windows that really are
not working wery well; they leak and they are the very devil to
take down and put up twice a year. The house is 80 years old. Would
it be acceptable to replace those wood storms with aluminum triple
track ones? The main windows seem in pretty good shape, so I don't
think it is necessary to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   RUTH SHASSMAN, West Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It certainly would be acceptable, in fact desirable,
especially since the main windows are intact and presumably well
weatherstripped and glazed. Putting up new, high quality aluminum
storms will cost you a little more than $100 per window. Do not opt
for the $30 or $50 bargains sold in larger lumber stores; they do
not work very well. The top grade aluminum storm (painted brown or
white) is, in my opinion, Harvey Industries' True Channel,
virtually airtight. They are usually installed by contractors, but
you can order them custom made (to fit your windows) through any
local lumber store, and install them yourself. However, the
installation charge is minor, so you might as well have someone put
them up for you.
</P>
<P>
   That $100 or so per window for new quality storms is half to a
third the cost of replacement sash for your main windows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The reglazing of my bathtub is very nice, but the plumber
scratched it. My husband painted the scratches with a latex epoxy
paint, but it is a little yellowish against the pure white of the
regazing. How can we disguise the scratches?
</P>
<P>
   DOROTHY SHUSTER, Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Try to find the reglazers so they can do the repairs. Short
of that, you could sand the scratches ever so slightly, and apply a
white appliance patch-up enamel. Apply very thin coats and hope for
the best.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am siding my house with white cedar shingles, which I like
better than red. I also like stains; is there any difference in
staining red or white cedar? If I let the white cedar weather to
that silver color and don't like it in a few years, can I stain it?
</P>
<P>
   J. B., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can stain over weathered white cedar, and I suggest
you use a semitransparent stain; the color is your choice. Only one
coat is needed, and in five years you can do it again; only one
coat at time. The advantage of white cedar in this case is that you
will get no cedar bleed through the stain; cedar bleed is the
depositing of the color (of red cedar) on the stain by water.
</P>
<P>
   Staining red cedar is different. If you stain it a light color,
those brown stains can occur. One way to fix this is to apply a
dark stain; you may still get the stains but they won't show.
Another way to avoid the cedar bleed is to apply an oil-based
primer, then a stain; but the stain must be a solid color stain;
two coats are needed. There is a risk in this latter technique; a
primer and solid color stains can peel; not as much as paint, but
still the possiblity is there.
</P>
<P>
   So you have a lot of choices, some with problems, some not. The
choice is yours.

DUBAI SHEIKH BRINGS DIFFERENT STYLE TO LOUISVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ His words were not sparse, but neither were
they generous, when Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum stood outside Barn
45 in the chill morning air at Churchill Downs Thursday and
explained why he was here.
</P>
<P>
   The media who had gathered around the Sheikh knew exactly why he
was here; simply because he was rich enough to do it. No more and
no less. But skepticism dripped from the American questioners.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Mohammed will have two horses in Saturday's Kentucky
Derby, Worldly Manner and Aljabr, and neither has raced this year
in the American definition of a race. Questioner after questioner
attempted to educate the Sheikh that this race, this Kentucky
Derby, cannot be won this way.
</P>
<P>
   English bookmakers have quoted odds of 5-1 on Worldly Manner
because the Sheikh is so respected there; here in Louisville, the
Sheikh's two horses will have odds of 15-1 or more because
Americans know American ways of training horses; the Sheikh's ways
could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done this often,'' said the Sheikh. ``We have brought
horses from Dubai to the (European) classics and they have done
well.'' Very well, to be precise, as Godolphin Stable horses have
been among the most successful in Europe for years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the memory is still fresh in Louisville of how the
Sheikh brought in his Swain for the Breeders' Cup Classic last
November, and Swain _ who finished third by less than a length _
lost a race he should have won if European jockey Frankie Dettori
had kept a straight run through the Churchill Downs stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have taken the Sheikh to task for supposedly hiding his
Derby horses, but he said gently that this was not so. California
trainer Richard Mandella agreed, saying he saw Worldly Manner and
Aljabr race in a private race the Sheikh put on days before the
Dubai World Cup in March ``and the caliber of that race was
excellent, up to the standards of top'' American races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect what Mandella said,'' said the Sheikh. ``Why do
people say they can't see your horses training when all the World
Cup people who were there (for the Dubai World Cup) were there to
see the (private) race. Why do they say they didn't see?''
</P>
<P>
   That private race, the Sheikh went on, ``was lacking only the
crowd. We made everything just like a race, but because we didn't
have the crowd, we had to put in the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Mohammed is a member of one of the richest families in
the world, the ruling family of oil-rich Dubai of the United Arab
Emirates. Money does talk, but seldom in these circumstances. From
time to time, mused Alistair Donald, the English head of the
International Racing Bureau, the Sheikh had been questioned in
formal press conferences, but seldom, if ever, like this. By an
American horde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born on a horse,'' the Sheikh said, clad in a dark blue
sweater, the dark blue of his family's Godolphin stable. Godolphin
is a major force in European racing, but on the first weekend of
every May, to the Sheikh's chagrin, he would be in Newmarket,
England, for the 2,000 Guineas, the first race of England's Triple
Crown, followed by the Derby at Epsom and the St. Leger at
Doncaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I wanted to be here for the Kentucky Derby,'' said
the Sheikh, pronouncing ``derby'' as the English do _ as in
``darby.'' ``I would ask my trainer, `Why don't we go to this great
race? The Kentucky Derby?' I've had 56 trainers, and I would ask
them why would they not come to Kentucky, and they would say, `No,
no, no' . . . all they cared for were the European classics.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, his words were generous, as the Sheikh opened up to
disclose his dream. He had videotapes of all the Kentucky Derby
races ever filmed, and he would watch them over and over, even
learning the words of ``My Old Kentucky Home.'' ``The sun shines
bright on my old Kentucky Home . . . Yes?'' said the Sheikh. ``It's
very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was when Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum spoke of The Horse,
the animal who so long has meant so much to Arabia, that his words
flowed. Yes, said the Sheikh, the thoroughbred was created when
Allah himself blew upon the South wind and from the South wind the
thoroughbred was formed. And Arabia had the world's best horses for
hundreds of years before the West had seen even one.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of when he was a student at Cambridge University in
England 25 years ago, and one day he decided to go to the sales at
Newmarket and buy some horses. And when he returned to his
lodgings, ``the mother in the house where I was living asked me,
`Why do you go and buy horses?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It had been trying enough ``just to go to the sales ring, and
they had said to me, `Who are you? Where are you from? Give me your
card. Give me your address' and all of that.'' And it was worse
when he returned from the sales ring because the mother in the
house where he was staying said he was too young to know horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she didn't know where the (thoroughbred) horse is
descended from. She was only able to go back to Eclipse (a great
English horse of 125 years ago). And they said to me, `Why are you
buying horses. Why don't you stay in your tent with your camel?' ''
</P>
<P>
   To the English, to Europeans, to Americans, it is an accepted
fact that all thoroughbreds are descended from one of three horses
_ the Godolphin Barb, the Byerly Turk, and the Darly Arabian, three
stallions who the English say were imported to England in the
mid-1700s. Arabs argue the three sires were purloined.
</P>
<P>
   `` `No, no, no,' '' the Sheikh recalled saying to the woman in
the house where he was living. ``All the horses are descended from
horses I have back home. They were surprised . . . there were
arguments for three months. I said to them, `If you can find just
one (thoroughbred) horse in the world who is not descended from an
Arab horse . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is so because horses were so beloved in Arabia, so necessary
for survival in Arabia, the Sheikh said. Even before the Crusades
when Europeans discovered these horses, ``in Arabia a man would
travel as far as 1,000 miles just to breed his horses to a top
sire. For safety reasons, they needed good horses in Arabia, they
needed good horses to run away (from enemies), to disappear
sometimes or to fight. The blood of these horses of Arabia, when
they mix it with European horses, it became the thoroughbred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab loves the horse. He loves the falcon, he loves the
dog, the Saluki and when he has only a little bit of food, first
they give it to the horse and then they give it to the children.
It's the life of an Arab.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum will have his two horses in
the Kentucky Derby, and he will have two horses in the 2,000
Guineas at Newmarket. On Sunday in Newmarket, he may have as many
as three horses in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket, the first race
of the English Triple Crown for fillies.
</P>
<P>
   And he would not speak of how he enticed jockey Jerry Bailey to
ride Worldly Manner, when Bailey might have had his pick of many in
the field. The rumor is that the Sheikh guaranteed Bailey some
$75,000, which the winning jockey will receive. ``This is
private,'' said the Sheikh when delicately asked of the rumor. ``We
don't talk about money.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would talk on and on about horses, about how he decided
last year to come to the Derby and how he will return here next
year and four or five more years with Godolphin horses to attempt
to win ``this great race.'' If he fails after five years of trying,
maybe ``we will change our mind about this race.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he should win, ``then I will fly over the moon,'' said
the Sheikh. He may be worth billions, he may fly jets and
helicopters and be vital to his government, but most of all, he is
as much in love with The Horse as any Arabian of the last 1,000
years. His stable has trainers all throughout Europe, but it is the
Sheikh who does much of the training; and, of course, ``I have the
final word on training.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his horses have been belittled for their preparation and
talent. Ah, but it is not the first time, said the Sheikh. ``We did
well at the sales until we brought in experts,'' he quipped. ``And
it is when we brought in the experts to tell us what to do that we
went down.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the Sheikh has learned a lesson as old as Arabia. An
Arab does not have to be told when a horse is a horse.

MILOSEVIC THE MENACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The most enduring lesson of politics is this simple nostrum:
If you wait long enough, you eventually find yourself on the same
side of some issue with folks you've bitterly opposed on others.
</P>
<P>
   Today is such a day. I rise to align myself with the editorial
page of The Wall Street Journal on the issue of one Milosevic,
Slobodan, archfiend of the Kosovo Crisis. Thursday's editorial
rationale for the elimination of Milosevic's reign over his fellow
Serbs is a clearheaded summing up of this dreadful manipulator's
disgraceful record.
</P>
<P>
   For a dozen years he consolidated his power with methods
Stalinesque. He seized the Kosovo issue by the rhetorical throat in
1987, and the dozen years since have now culminated in the
uprooting of more than a million Albanian Kosovars.The editorial
aims to justify the newspaper's previous call for ``the ouster of
Slobodan Milosevic from the Serbian government.'' Here in one
paragraph is the argument that trumps isolationist calls to
forswear military intervention out of the conviction that the
Balkan peoples are always at each others' throats, and we should
steer clear of the carnage:
</P>
<P>
   ``The passing conventional wisdom is that these primitives,
after living for generations as neighbors and intermarrying, woke
up one morning and decided to kill each other over ancient wrongs.
Close attention to the history of the region since the fall of
communism, for example by European leaders and publics now
supportive of a military response, shows quite a different picture.
To wit, that of Slobodan Milosevic assiduously fanning the flames
of national and ethnic hatred for his own advantage, and reaching
new heights of cruelty and duplicity in dealing with his neighbors
and world leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me not lapse, after doffing the cap in the Journal's
direction, into a recounting of instances where I've parted company
with that crew over yellow rain, Clinton, Starr, blah blah. And I
will bite this quivering lip before amplifying any suggestion that
if Clinton had not been preoccupied with saving his butt from Starr
and the Journal's motorcycle gang of Clinton-haters, the president
might have done more to prevent the ethnic cleansing debacle.
</P>
<P>
   No one in leadership in the West fully comprehended the
depravity of Milosevic. We are all chastened by the emergence of
this mass murderer, inciter of mass rape, and nationalist scourge
of Biblical scope. Many in the West oppose the NATO bombing. Like
Clinton, Tony Blair, and the other heads of state linked in the
NATO coalition, I think it inescapable that we respond to the
sacking of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Blair mentioned early on, in responding to a parliamentary sally
claiming the NATO bombing actually worsened the situation, that
some 2,000 Kosovars had perished before the first NATO ordnance
landed. The Journal editorial recounts Milosevic's persistent
bloodletting through 10 long years of more or less uninterrupted
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan reminds me of the loopy Knight in ``Monty Python and
the Holy Grail,'' whose belligerent swordplay is incapable of
protecting him from the enemy's retaliation. Whiff, goes an arm;
off comes a leg; zap, there goes another arm; the remaining limb is
next excised. What's left is a silly torso-less head mouthing empty
threats, oblivious to his diminished estate.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has whittled his own people down to a rogue state,
diminished in area, numbers, reputation, economy, and moral
respect. For the Serbs to rally to his cause, to don their target
stickers and shout defiance at Western TV crews, to proclaim
innocence and beg pity for their plight, leaves the most important
piece of the puzzle missing still. Why are the Serbs not mindful of
their leader's persistent violations of norms of civilized
behavior? Can they be ignorant of the depradations against the
Albanian Kosovars?
</P>
<P>
   For every Serb civilian killed by an errant NATO bomb, there are
a hundred dead Kosovars. For every Serb family deprived of housing
by some of NATO's inevitable ``collateral damage,'' there are a
thousand refugees evicted by Serb bayonets. For every Serb
homestead damaged by NATO warplanes, there are hundreds of Kosovar
homes looted and burned by Serb marauders.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot sustain a modern society, like the Europe that was
envisioned last New Year's Eve, with the introduction of the Euro,
and the consolidation of economic and governmental power that it
represented, with a Hitlerian regime pillaging the Balkans.
Milosevic had to be stopped. The nascent democracy movement in
Serbia had next to no success; the force had to come from outside
the Serb community.
</P>
<P>
   The war is not pretty. The West has inherited the dispossessed
Kosovars, a million strong, and the cost of restoring them to some
semblance of a secure lifestyle will be extremely expensive. But
the alternative _ allowing this crackpot to destabilize every
entity around him _ was costlier still.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal is right: the departure of Milosevic from the scene
is much to be desired. He may not be indicted yet, but he is a war
criminal. He and his ghastly lieutenants should not be welcomed in
any civilized country unless wearing handcuffs. And should a lucky
piece of NATO ordnance find him some night as he sleeps, so much
the better.

ON-LINE, FIDELITY TOUTS RELIABILITY INSTEAD OF FLASH

 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments wants to be the Volvo of the on-line
brokerage world.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston company's new ad campaign, launched this week, is
built around the theme of reliability. The not-so-subtle point is
that in a field where other on-line brokers may be fly-by-nights or
have computer systems that fail, Fidelity is the one you can count
on to execute your trades safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a reliability record other competitors
don't,'' says Stephen Cone, head of marketing at Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a question: Is being Volvo the right image to have
in a business where many of the customers would seem to be Corvette
types? Competitors like E-Trade and Ameritrade are bombarding the
airwaves with edgy, irreverent ads that make fun of the traditional
financial establishment. In one Ameritrade ad an embarrassed jogger
admits to friends that she still invests in mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave Fidelity? ``Their strength, their brand,
is also a challenge,'' says Alex Stein, a principal with Gomez
Advisors, a Concord consulting firm. ``Fidelity is identified with
trust: `You can rely on us to manage your investments.' That is
very different from the message you want to send to on-line
investors who tend to be confident and self-directed customers.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line investing is exploding. In a research report, US Bancorp
Piper Jaffray said that electronic trading volume climbed 49
percent in the first three months of the year. The same report
found that the industry added another 1.2 million accounts in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is participating in the boom, and its own numbers are
even rosier than those in the Piper Jaffray report. With 2.8
million accounts and more than $200 billion in assets, Fidelity is
already the nation's second-largest discount broker. Charles Schwab
is far and away the leader. Most surveys place Fidelity further
back in the pack when size is measured by daily on-line trades.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Fidelity customers were making 25,000 trades a day;
today they are making 80,000. More than 70 percent of the trades
are executed electronically, up from 20 percent two years ago.
According to Cone, Fidelity is signing up 20,000 new brokerage
customers a week, 60 percent of whom already do business with
Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firms that track on-line brokerage generally give
Fidelity high marks. In a recent survey of electronic traders
conducted by Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., Fidelity was
selected as best in the industry. Fidelity scored highest in a
category called confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are one of the few brokers who have yet to have a major
computer failure,'' says Michael Gazala, a Forrester analyst.
Gazala says customers also appreciate the fact that they can
contact Fidelity by phone or in person if there is ever a computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester found that Fidelity was most popular with what it
called ``long-term investors.'' People who think of themselves as
traders, especially active traders, preferred Suretrade and Datek,
two low-cost competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Fidelity is stuck with the fuddy-duddies like us
while all the young and cool investors flock to the competition?
</P>
<P>
   No way, says Cone. ``It's a fantasy that you have to be young
and hip to use the Internet,'' he says. ``The Internet is widely
used by people in all age groups.'' Fidelity's own numbers show
that an equal percentage of customers in all age groups trade
electronically. In fact, says Cone, it is the youngest customers _
those in their 20s _ who are most likely to want some human help in
executing their trades.
</P>
<P>
   Cone says Fidelity's biggest problem in brokerage is its fame as
a mutual fund company. ``It's a challenge when you are so well
known for one thing to get known for something else,'' he says. The
fact that Fidelity is privately held, not publicly traded, also has
hurt, says Cone, because the company is often left out of stories
that focus on the big run-up in stock prices of competitors like
E-Trade and Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   The current campaign should help raise Fidelity's profile. The
television ads produced by Hill Holliday are short and punchy. The
best one, a 15-second spot, flashes the words: ``On-line trading is
like the Old West.'' Then you hear the sound of guns going off
followed by the words: ``The slow die first.'' The tag line for the
ads is, ``Every second counts,'' suggesting that you need someone
reliable to handle the job.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity won't say how much it will spend on advertising, but
Cone concedes it will be much less than the estimated $150 million
E-Trade is expected to spend over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Says Cone, ``We will have to be smarter.''

<P>
   BOSTON -- Stig Leschly still remembers the rejection his
business plan got when he entered a Harvard Business School
competition last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judges wrote that I had little business experience, none
of it relevant to starting an Internet company, that my idea was
not unique and the financial opportunity not large enough to
attract investment,'' said the 29-year-old Danish-born
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, he ignored the judges' advice and formed
Exchange.com, an Internet company that brings together buyers and
sellers of rare or out-of-print books and old music recordings.
</P>
<P>
   This week Leschly got sweet revenge when Amazon.com, the
nation's largest Internet bookseller, said it will acquire the
company for a reported $200 million in stock, making him a
multimillionaire in barely seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the dizzying market for Internet startups, the speed
with which Leschly went from tinkerer to tycoon is startling.
Barely seven months after starting the firm with one employee in a
leaky warehouse, Leschly's alliance with Amazon.com catapults him
to the forefront of the fast-growing on-line collectibles business.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive said the
acquisition was ``a win for Amazon.com customers because it further
increases our selection of rare and obscure items.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bezos nor Leschly would disclose the precise amount
until the acquisition closes next month. Exchange.com was one of
three companies that Seattle-based Amazon.com said it was buying
Monday for a total of $645 million in Amazon stock.
</P>
<P>
   Leschly is ``remarkable for his age, both in his intellect and
his vision which will help build the management team at
Amazon.com,'' said George Conrades, the former chairman of BBN Inc.
and a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, whose $4.5 million
investement launched the company.
</P>
<P>
   Polaris' funding help attract $8.5 million more from Accel
Partners, a Silicon Valley venture firm; the Washington Post Co.;
and individual investors including Mitch Kapor, the founder of
Lotus Development Corp., plus Leschly's family. Leschly's father,
Jan, is chief executive of SmithKline Beecham PLC, the large
pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father thinks the Internet is a town in Minnesota,''
chuckled Leschly, whose mother is a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Leschly, whose only trace of Scandinavian heritage, besides
azure blue eyes and ash-blond hair, are the clogs he wears around
his spartan Cambridge office, said he got the idea to start the
company in May 1997 while still a student at Harvard University,
where he was pursuing both law and business degrees. Leschly
graduated from Harvard in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A music lover with a penchant for Louis Armstrong records,
Leschly said he was in a used record store in Cambridge when he
picked up a copy of Goldmine, a trade publication for buying and
selling old vinyl records and used compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   Having just obtained an Internet account, he had begun to
realize that the World Wide Web was a way of bringing people and
products together. Leschly said he saw an opportunity that could
appeal to collectors while also helping dealers who often travel
the country to reach customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want an old Charlie Parker jazz recording or the B-side
of a Rolling Stones disk that, for example, may have only been sold
in Japan, you could find them on the 'Net rather than blindly
calling up record dealers,'' Leschly said. He also envisioned the
same concept appealing to secondhand and antique booksellers, and
other dealers of collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing $75,000 from his family and friends, he rented space
in an aging warehouse in Allston with a leaky roof and began to put
together a business plan along with a prototype of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, he and Sri Rao, a software designer who previously
worked at Firefly, the Internet company acquired by Microsoft Corp.
last year, obtained $2 million from Polaris Ventures to build their
on-line marketplace to bring together music buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no charge for buyers to browse the company's database
of 9 million books _ double the size of Amazon.com's listings _ and
three million record listings. Buyers can telephone or e-mail the
seller, who lists the price, shipping costs, and form of payment.
After the transaction, Exchange.com collects up to 8 percent of the
purhcase price from the seller. Leschly said the average book price
is in the $35 range, although one leatherbound first edition of
``Winnie the Pooh'' by A.A. Milne is available for $2,000 while
some vinyl records go for $16 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the power of eBay and realized I had to move fast,''
said Leschly, referring to the spectacular growth of the Internet
auction house, whose stock price has risen almost tenfold since
October. The San Jose, Calif.-based eBay now has a market value of
almost $27 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing narrowly on old music and antique books Leschly has
attracted nearly 3,000 dealers, who every evening update their
inventory on Exchange.com's two Web sites, MusicFile or Bibliofind
_ the latter acquired by Leschly in January.
</P>
<P>
   One music seller, Edward Smith of The Record Finder in Glen
Allen, Va., says using Exchange.com has turned the business focus
around from relying on storefront sales and a limited market to
reaching a worldwide audience using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all but closing our `real world' store and selling
music solely on line through our company's mail-order catalog,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of creating the book software, Leschly learned of
Bibliofind, a struggling Internet exchange service for buyers and
sellers of antique books that was run out of Great Barrington by
its founders, Michael and Helen Seltzer. The middle-aged couple
realized the technical demands and the capital required to enhance
the site were more than they could handle and sold Bibliofind to
Exchange.com.
</P>
<P>
   As for Leschly, he now has a new challenge. Under the Amazon.com
agreement, he must relocate the Cambridge company to Amazon.com's
Seattle headquarters within the next two months, which also means
uprooting about 25 of the 31 employees. For a boy whose family
emigrated from Denmark to Princeton, N.J., when he was 9 years old,
the move is no big deal. But ``it's a touchy situation with my
girlfriend,'' Leschly said.

AUDUBON RANCH ABOUNDS WITH AVIAN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUDUBON CANYON RANCH, Calif. _ Timing can be everything in love,
and so it is at Audubon Canyon Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Show up in midsummer, fall or winter, and well, you'll not only
find the gate locked, but nothing beyond worth trying to get a peep
at anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But arrive now ... the gate is open, and beyond? Well, let me
tell you about the birds and the bees. Especially the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Especially great blue herons, great egrets and snowy egrets.
</P>
<P>
   The feature show at Audubon Canyon Ranch is romance for these
huge, beautiful birds, from start to finish, from the first shy
calls to kicking junior out of the nest. In the middle comes
courtship, building a home, making some babies, hatching them, then
sending them off for future education, and it is happening from now
through early July.
</P>
<P>
   Checking in this week, so far there are nine blue heron nests
here, one with chicks already, and also 14 nesting pairs of egrets
in various stages of courtship, including a few just making eyes at
each other, and wondering, ``Is that the one?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a perfect spot to watch all this _ that is, an official
viewing point to see all kinds of shenanigans and mind-lightening
foolishness in the nests high in redwood trees, just across the
canyon. To reach it requires about a short but steep walk, usually
about 20 minutes for most. The ranch guides always provide spotting
scopes.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon Canyon Ranch is located on the Marin Coast off Highway
1, with the entrance 3 1/2 miles north of Stinson Beach. There is
no entry fee, though a small donation is requested. It has become
one of the most popular outdoor classrooms in the San Francisco Bay
area, with about 5,000 youngsters making the trip here each year.
It is open now to the public only on weekends and holidays through
July 1, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and reserved for visiting students on
weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a great trip for anybody. And though bird-watching
doesn't flip everybody's pancake, here you not only get to see
large and regal herons and egrets but get to see them in action.
</P>
<P>
   The great egret is snow white and thin, and is about 4 feet
tall. Its cousin, the snowy egret, is also pure white, but about
half the size. From the near-perfect vantage point at the ranch,
you can watch them across a canyon doing their thing in giant nests
atop redwood trees. It can be a spectacular show that you will
never forget.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with a nervous glances from afar, then proceeds with a
few tentative squawks. If you watch this closely, there are times
the egrets just seem to look at each other for a spell, as if they
are trying to figure out if this is the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, somebody has to make a move, or nothing happens,
right? End of movie. What often occurs here is that Mr. Egret will
make a cautious overture, offering a single twig to its potential
mate, as if asking, ``Do you wanna?'' If there is no response,
well, no deal. But if Ms. Egret gets a twig of her own and offers
it in return, the silent answer is, ``Yes, I wanna,'' and off they
go to make a nest, often starting with those first two twigs.
</P>
<P>
   That is what is happening here now for the egrets, and there
appears to be plenty of ``I wannas.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nearby blue herons look like something right out
of Jurassic Park, like pterodactyls lifting off with their huge,
labored wing beats, their wingspans ranging to seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   With their young hatchlings in the nests, ma and pa heron often
will make trips to nearby Bolinas Lagoon for food. Upon return of a
parent, Junior will grab its beak, which triggers a motor response,
where the undigested goodies are regurgitated all over the nest.
</P>
<P>
   What could be more fun for Junior and his brothers and sisters
than to pounce on the treats and gobble them up as if it's their
first meal? Well, in some cases, it is their first meal.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, what's for lunch? As spring progresses, and the
young birds gain size, strength and feathers, the viewing evolves
to another tradition that might be called ``Bon Voyage'' or
``Goodbye Maybelline.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in mid-June, you can see the young birds standing in
the nests, practicing stroking their wings as if simulating the
flying experience. They are already big, and it is like watching
Mark McGwire take practice swings in the on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, you may even see them stray out on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   But then they look down. They see the ground down there about
100 feet below and figure, ``Nah, back into the nest. Say, Mom,
when's dinner?''
</P>
<P>
   At first, mom puts up with it. Then she gets a little irritated.
Then she gets angry, and it's time for the heave-ho.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, the adult herons often just kick the kids right
out of the nest with a push. The youngsters quickly discovers that
gravity wins. They have about 10 seconds to figure out how to fly
before the ground suddenly arrives. Since bird skeletons are
extremely rare on the forest floor, that must be enough time to
figure out the correct behavior response. Wish my kids could learn
that fast.

HE'S LIBRIAN TO THE RICH AND FAMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To call him Bill Gates's librarian would be missing the point.
For the past several years, rare-book and manuscript expert Kenneth
Rendell has been assembling one of the most astonishing collections
ever put together. And yes, his client is the Microsoft chief
executive, who keeps many of the treasures in his lakeside trophy
home outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell has never discussed his relationship with Gates _ but
he's left plenty of hints lying around. Wired magazine recently
reported that Rendell ``builds entire collections'' and ``will buy,
install, monitor, and update'' a complete library. The magazine
didn't mention Gates, but in a 1997 interview with The Seattle
Times, speaking from his home on the windward side of Maui, Rendell
more or less confirmed that his frequent trips to Seattle come at
the behest of Gates. (Other meta-rich Microsofties, including
in-house ``visionary'' Nathan Myhrvold, are also Rendell's
clients.)
</P>
<P>
   What a commission! Gates loves ``The Great Gatsby'' and has
procured four first editions. (There's a quote from ``Gatsby''
emblazoned above the library's shelves.) The private-school grad
also seems to favor preppy romances. He has first editions of J. D.
Salinger's ``The Catcher in the Rye'' and John Knowles's Phillips
Exeter-based homoerotic classic, ``A Separate Peace.'' Not to
mention some way serious stuff: Isaac Newton's workbooks and
Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Leicester, which Gates acquired at
auction five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of a former bank building in South Natick, Mass. _
he uses the vault to store valuables _ Rendell has built an
impressive empire that includes an East Side Manhattan gallery and
a world-class private collection of World War II memorabilia. He
experiences sporadic bursts of fame. Rendell played a leading role
in debunking Newsweek's bogus Hitler ``diaries,'' and more recently
he was identified as one of the dealers asked to authenticate the
fake Marilyn Monroe-John F. Kennedy ``correspondence.'' (He
didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   But Rendell doesn't want to become famous as Bill Gates's
librarian _ yet.

   The National Geographic Traveler magazine and Web site
(ngtraveler.com) has a quiz called ``Where's Melissa?,'' which
challenges readers to divine the whereabouts of peripatetic travel
scribe Melissa Rossi. Latest clue: ``Small taverns in this city's
suburbs announce the arrival of `Heuriger,' the year's new wines,
by hanging a pine branch above their doors.'' But because the
magazine is edited well in advance, the readers are trying to guess
places Rossi has been. Right now, she's in Jamaica Plain (a Boston
neighborhood), bored out of her mind and awaiting her next
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   I like everyone I don't know very well, and Ms. Rossi certainly
qualifies. She's been on the lam for the past few years, mainly
avoiding Seattle, where she wrote a nightclubs column for the
Seattle Weekly under the name Babs Babylon. Things got hot for her
in Gatesville when she published a book entitled ``Courtney Love:
Queen of Noise; A Most Unauthorized Biography.'' Before the book
came out, grunge-rock goddess Love was hoping Rossi would undo the
damage of a Vanity Fair profile that accused the singer of taking
drugs during her pregnancy. That proved not to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Love is now raising her daughter in Los Angeles, and Rossi is
writing her next book, tentatively titled ``Global Party Crasher.''

Roland Merullo puffs ``Miracle'' on the Amazon.com site, without
revealing their entanglement.) John Katzenbach's just-published
``Hart's War,'' a courtroom thriller in a World War II prison camp,
is getting good reviews, as will, I suspect, ``Ladies' Man,'' the
forthcoming novel from PH diva Elinor Lipman.

PAUL MAURICE COMES OF AGE BEHIND THE BENCH

 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In his view, the glasses are strictly a concession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wear them behind the bench, and this is the first year
I've done it,'' says Paul Maurice. ``The boss wants me to, and you
don't want to piss off the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Not when the boss sees them as a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wears the glasses behind the bench because he should,''
says Jim Rutherford. ``He can't afford to lose another eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice resisted for three years, but what's the use in arguing
with the high command? He is in fact virtually blind in one eye,
and besides, the boss is old enough to be his father. Of course,
that's not much of an achievement; most of his peers are old enough
to be his father.
</P>
<P>
   Just turned 32, the baby-faced Maurice has established seniority
as the youngest head coach in the National Hockey League. And one
thing the glasses don't do is make him look any more grizzled. ``I
wish some team would hire somebody younger,'' he sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Not much chance of that. Maurice has held the unwanted
distinction for four years, ever since Rutherford, the Carolina
Hurricanes' president-general manager and Maurice's patron since
his teens, created shock waves _ and much skepticism _ by placing
him in charge of an NHL bench. The bench was in Hartford at the
time, and Maurice, not yet 29, didn't think he had any business
telling the Whalers what to do: ``The first day on the job, I turn
the corner in the locker room, and the first player I see is Brad
McCrimmon, who started playing in the NHL when I was in seventh
grade.''
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out that the father figure knew best.
</P>
<P>
   That's been evident in the first round of the Stanley Cup
playoffs. Not only does Maurice have the Hurricanes locked in a
surprising 2-2 tie with the Bruins in their best-of-seven Eastern
Conference quarterfinal, but he has conducted himself with the
aplomb and savvy of an old hand, not a postseason novice. More than
anything, Maurice seems to be enjoying this experience to the
ultimate.
</P>
<P>
   But self-deprecation is as much his calling card as youth. He
insists that his apparently supreme comfort level is a convenient
mask _ like the one he wishes he'd been wearing when an errant puck
struck him in the right eye during a junior exhibition game,
costing him his central vision, effectively ending his playing
future, and accidentally starting him on a path toward a coaching
career at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly isn't a party,'' he says. ``I'm learning as
much as I can going through it. Every day isn't Christmas. My worst
time of game day is 2 or 3 o'clock. I go through every bad thing
that can happen, worry about whether I've got the right guys in the
right places. That's when my stomach is in knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the reason I'm enjoying this series is that a big part of
my job that other coaches have to go through is already done in the
locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   This is typical Maurice. He deflects the accolades for the
Hurricanes' robust, hard-nosed approach to his assistant coaches _
Tom Webster, his onetime junior coach; Randy Ladoceur; and Steve
Weeks. And he credits owner Peter Karmanos and Rutherford with
having brought in the type of veteran players _ seven of whom are
at least as old as their coach _ to facilitate off-ice chemistry.
Ron Francis, Gary Roberts, Kevin Dineen, Keith Primeau. People like
that. The more input they provide, the easier it is for Maurice to
recede into the background, to exert unobtrusive authority. He
hates being front and center, though his glib, ultracasual public
demeanor belies that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I told you how uncomfortable I am having a story done on
me?'' he says. ``It's the kiss of death, man. I've got two little
kids to support, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   He's smiling as he says that, but there is a germ of truth to
the sentiment. ``My job right now is to make myself small,'' says
Maurice, closing his thumb and forefinger together to indicate what
he'd like to have you believe is his tiny place in the scope of
things. ``I don't want to take the credit away from them'' _ he
gestures to the players' dressing area and the assistants' office _
``because they're the ones who deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   That diffidence may be a handy device, but it borders on the
ridiculous. The fact is that the once wretched Whalers have become
the hard-charging Hurricanes, champions of the Southeast Division,
playoff entrants for the first time in seven springs. And Maurice
hasn't been an innocent bystander.
</P>
<P>
   ``His poise, character, and leadership are special,'' says
Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The boss first noticed those traits in his role as director of
hockey operations for Compuware, the software giant Karmanos
founded at age 29 before branching out from thinkpads into junior
hockey and eventually the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rutherford who selected Maurice in the Ontario Hockey
League junior draft 15 years ago. He was a bit concerned at the
time because Maurice didn't show for the draft and Rutherford
wondered whether he had opted to play college hockey instead.
</P>
<P>
   No need to worry. The defenseman from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario,
hadn't attended the draft because he didn't know there was a draft.
``I was playing Midget house hockey,'' says Maurice. ``I saw my
picture in the local newspaper one day, and it said I was a draft
prospect. I said, `What's this all about?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's the type of blithe approach Maurice took to hockey,
making his lightning ascendancy even more unlikely. He wasn't
committed to the game as a career; it was a nice recreational
pursuit while he studied finance at the University of Windsor,
where he is one semester shy of graduating. ``I promised my parents
I'd get a degree,'' says Maurice, the son of career teachers and
the brother of a surgeon and a mechanical engineering student. ``I
just didn't say when.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his father, Denis, and mother, Dolores, had encouraged
him to accelerate his educational endeavors as a youngster so that
he could explore other avenues when hockey beckoned. ``I have been
blessed with wonderful parents,'' he says. ``They encouraged me to
do what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he didn't consider hockey his calling. ``My father asked
me once at 18 if I'd considered coaching,'' recalls Maurice. ``I
don't know if he thought he saw something in me or whether he'd
seen me play and thought I sucked.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, playing was not a long-term option. The eye injury
before his first junior season with the Windsor Spitfires had
robbed him of all but his peripheral vision, meaning an NHL career
was out of the question, even though the Philadelphia Flyers made
him the last selection in the entry draft when Maurice was 18.
``No. 252,'' he says. ``They're still bragging about that. Of
course, when I did get to the NHL and looked around at the players
on the ice, I realized I never would have made it with two good
eyes.''

CROWDED HONG KONG WORRIED BY PLAN TO ADMIT MIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Hong Kong is Earth's most crowded place, a territory
one-third the size of Rhode Island, with seven times the
population. And it may soon have to open its borders to 25 percent
more people, an influx that could put an unbearable strain on this
prosperous but jam-packed city.
</P>
<P>
   Locals were up in arms Thursday over a government announcement
that more than 1.6 million people _ nearly one-fourth of Hong
Kong's population of 6.8 million _ will be allowed to move here
from mainland China over the next 10 to 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a place more congested than this, where
everyday life demands elbowing through packed subways and
overflowing sidewalks amid forests of towering housing projects.
The World Bank this week ranked Hong Kong the world's most densely
populated area, with 6,375 people per square kilometer _ compared
with 29 people per square kilometer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hong Kong has always been a city of immigrants. Successive
waves of mainland refugees from the 1949 Communist Revolution,
1950s famines, and the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and '70s
built Hong Kong from a relative outpost into a global
manufacturing, trading, and financial capital. Today it boasts one
of the highest per-capita incomes in the world _ higher than its
former colonial master, Great Britain _ and the second-largest
monetary reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's greatest challenge since it returned to Chinese rule
in 1997 may not be the threat of losing its political freedoms, but
the difficulty of maintaining its prosperity and quality of life
while accommodating a new flood of migrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visualize a future where every inch of space is crowded with
people,'' said Fiona Szeto, 24, a public relations executive.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that the real problem is not the sheer number of
prospective arrivals, but that the government does not have a plan
for accommodating them. After all, Hong Kong was barely inhabited
when colonizers arrived in 1851; half of today's residents are
migrants from China, and the other half are descendants of earlier
immigrants. And although much of Hong Kong is park land or zoned to
forbid building, only 16 percent of it has been developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio talk shows and certain people are making too big a deal
of this,'' said Leo Chung, 25, a financial analyst. ``A lot of us
think Hong Kong is a refugee city, built by people who sneaked
across the border. We can afford to accommodate these new people.
And it's not just an economic issue, it's a legal issue and a moral
issue. These are children of Hong Kong people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's post-colonial constitution, the Basic Law, grants
any child of a permanent resident the right to live here. A January
appeals court ruling held that even illegitimate children and
children born before their parents acquired Hong Kong residency
have that right.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a huge waiting list of prospective immigrants from
China, it is common for families to wait 20 years or longer to be
reunited. Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ruled three months ago
that that was unfair, and that all eligible children must be
allowed to emigrate within a ``reasonable period.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling angered local authorities and mainland officials who
fear too many migrants could ruin a city that Beijing wants to
maintain as a showcase of free enterprise and a funnel for
investments to flow into communist China.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate that more than 1.6 million are eligible migrants is
based on a government survey of 10,000 local households. The survey
estimates there are 692,000 mainland children of current Hong Kong
residents, and another 983,000 children of people who will become
residents within seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers questioned the figure Thursday, noting that
it far exceeds previous estimates. After both the 1991 and 1996
census, the government said there were about 320,000 children of
Hong Kong residents living in China.
</P>
<P>
   Many social workers and liberal politicians said the government
is trying to whip up panic so that people demand that the court
overturn its ruling or that China limit residency rights. Legal
scholars warn that overturning a court ruling would violate
judicial independence, and that amending the constitution is a
slippery slope; residency rights could be cut today, political
freedoms could be curtailed tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no avoiding the fact that if the government's new
estimates are true, a crush of migrants will create tremendous
challenges. Already, 150 Chinese migrants enter Hong Kong each day,
and 44 children enter the school system. There is a six-year wait
for public housing, even with 50,000 new units being built a year,
and the government estimates the number of people on waiting lists
would triple with the new migrants.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at 6.2 percent, the territory may not have
jobs for the expected migrants. Seventy percent of the eligible
children have been waiting so long to come here that they are now
adults, and about half of them have a high school education or
less. Fewer than 10 percent are professionals, according to Regina
Ip, the secretary for security.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Sau-lan, a legislator, said the government was
``irresponsible to present the problem without any solutions.'' Ho
said schools with a Hong Kong curriculum could be built over the
border in nearby Shenzhen; some 200,000 domestic worker jobs held
mostly by Filipino women could be phased out to make way for
Chinese maids, and housing could be built on Lantau Island, which
is five times the size of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Hong Kong offers greater freedoms and human rights
than China, she said, it will remain a magnet for mainland
immigrants. ``At the end of the day, Hong Kong is just a city; we
can't absorb all of China. The answer lies in the democratization
of the mainland. Right now we have one country with two systems. We
need one country with one good system.''

pull out. Many have picked areas where the local government
supports business, regardless of broader upheaval in Russia. In St.

   RAC-DERBY-BET (Lexington, Ky.) _ At least for two minutes on
Saturday, Dallas Keen, Akiko Gothard, Dallas Stewart, Scotty
Schulhofer and Elliott Walden, will be linked together in the 125th
running of the Kentucky Derby. Their horses _ Valhol, K One King,
Kimberlite Pipe, Lemon Drop Kid and Ecton Park _ have been lumped
together in the race's mutuel field. For horse racing aficionados
that means Churchill Downs oddsmaker Mike Battaglia determined
these five horses were the least likely to win in a crowded
20-horse field. The horses are grouped that way out of necessity _
the Churchill tote board can handle only 14 betting interests. For
casual fans, however, necessity means sort of a Sam's Club bargain
opportunity. Think of it as buying in bulk _ a $2 bet on No. 14 in
the program brings five horses for the price of one in one of the
most wide-open fields in Kentucky Derby history. By Joe Drape.

BRITAIN SHEDS JUNIOR PARTNER STATUS WITH US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Once mocked in UN quarters as the ``little
poodle'' of US diplomacy for its slavish obedience to US foreign
policy, Britain, it seems, is shedding its status as America's
junior partner on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   While the personal relationship between British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and President Bill Clinton remains strong, Britain has
demonstrated an increasing determination to go its own way, even if
it means clashing with its trans-Atlantic ally.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington finds itself following as often as leading, as
Britain asserts leadership in global trouble spots, from Kosovo to
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair has attracted attention for pressing Washington to
deploy ground troops, Britain has struck out on its own in other
areas. Britain paved the way for Washington's first face-to-face
talks with Libya in nearly a decade. And in recent weeks, London
has demonstrated rare independence on its Iraq policy, spearheading
an effort to dismantle the UN Special Commission, the weapons
inspection unit responsible for disarming Baghdad, and to replace
it with a new inspection team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of agreement between the US and Britain
from a strategic standpoint, but tactically the Brits are going
more and more their own way,'' said James Placke, a former US
diplomat who tracks Iraq and Libya for Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. ``Until recently, British people I talked to would
accuse Blair of being a Clinton lapdog. I haven't heard those
comments for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that Britain is filling a vacuum left by an
administration preoccupied with the domestic political agenda and
distracted by a year of political scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the British-American relationship resembles a mature
marriage in which each partner has a unique identity and opinion.
Whatever the case, it remains clear that the vaunted ``special
relationship'' will be tested as the two allies grapple with some
of the most vexing challenges of the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's activist foreign policy team has been received with
ambivalence by the Clinton administration, but its skill has
impressed many in the US foreign policy establishment. Some have
portrayed Blair as a liberal version of Margaret Thatcher, the
conservative British prime minister who urged President George Bush
not to ``go wobbly on me'' on the eve of the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``True leadership comes from the gut. You know what you have to
do and you do it,'' said Allan Gerson, a senior analyst at the
Council on Foreign Relations, who tracks Libya. ``I think Blair has
that; he's been operating from the gut and Clinton has been playing
catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerson and other observers say that London played the lead role
in laying the groundwork for Libya's handover of two suspects in
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy allowed the administration to gauge public reaction
to the idea of holding a trial in the Netherlands under Scottish
law before officially embracing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a big player and the government needed us to go along
with it,'' said George Williams, the president of the Victims of
Pan AM Flight 103, an association of victims' families that
ultimately backed the trial. ``If not, they wouldn't have been able
to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   While US officials ultimately followed Britain's lead on Libya,
they have been reluctant to endorse British maneuvering over Iraq
policy. Although Britain's warplanes continue to accompany US
fighters on bombing raids in the no-fly zones of northern and
southern Iraq, London has shown a greater desire than Washington to
reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opposition from Washington, Britain and the Netherlands
introduced a proposal into the UN Security Council earlier this
month to create a new weapons inspection unit to replace a UN arms
control unit that was recently tainted by revelations that it was
used as a cover for US spying.
</P>
<P>
   The British proposal, designed to break an impasse in the
15-nation Security Council, would enable Iraq to more easily import
essential humanitarian goods and permit foreign investment in
Iraq's devastated oil infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, so far, has exhibited little interest in
compromising with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials say that Britain's departure from US policy on Iraq
reflects a fundamental clash of interests.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the United States is seeking greater freedom to
use military force against its adversaries, Britain is seeking to
preserve a role for the Security Council, where it is one of five
countries with veto power, in overseeing international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brits came to the conclusion long before the US that
UNSCOM will never go back into Iraq, but they wanted to keep the
ball moving,'' a senior UN official said. ``They realize that their
seat on the Security Council maintains their status in the world as
a major power.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's assertiveness has developed quietly, but steadily,
since Blair came to power in May 1997, after a landslide victory
over the conservatives. With a strong mandate, he has exercised
influence even in the most remote parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Britain has dispatched military trainers to
rebuild a defeated national army in the former British colony of
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the Balkans that Britain is taking its greatest
risks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, on the eve of the NATO anniversary
commemoration, Blair and Clinton held their own summit in which the
British prime minister made a case for deploying ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually accused of subservience to big cousin Bill, Blair had
this time reversed the role,'' The Observer, the London newspaper,
saidthis week. ``By the end, Blair had become the crusading hawk of
the NATO alliance, called by some in Washington last week `the
leader of NATO.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Blairite,'' said Ivo Daalder, the former chief Balkans
specialist at the US National Security Council, now at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are very interested in foreign policy and they
want to do the right thing. They are making the decisions that the
United States is not willing to take,'' Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   Daalder also recalled that NATO began its hunt for war criminals
in Bosnia shortly after Blair came into power. On July 10, British
SAS commandos made their first arrest of Bosnian war criminals. The
man apprehended was the former police chief of Prijidor, Simo
Drljaca. Then, one of the region's architects of ethnic cleansing,
Milan Kovacevic, was sent to The Hague to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the late summer of 1997, Britain decided at a Cabinet-level
meeting that the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo could be solved only
through military means. Britain urged the United States to threaten
air power and to be prepared to use ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which mirrored the thinking of the Clinton
administration's most hawkish Cabinet member, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, received a chilly response from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to us and we turned them down flat on the ground
troops,'' said Daalder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the British may have the last word. While the White House
and Pentagon continued to insist that the air war will prevail
alone, President Clinton said last week that he supported NATO's
decision to draw up contingency plans for a ground war.

IN ALBANIA, US TROOPS AWAIT WORD FROM NATO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS, Albania _ Knee-deep in Balkan spring mud and surrounded
by heavy, offensive weaponry, the US soldiers at the airport base
here are in the same boat as the Albanian refugees they are
defending and the Yugoslav enemy they are trained to defeat:
waiting for someone in NATO to make the decision to go to a ground
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the actual people it happens to, the indigenous
people'' who hang around the air base looking for temporary work,
said Army Lt. Timothy Wolfe, 26, as he stood by a Bradley Fighting
Vehicle. ``It gives you a sense of why you are here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always looking forward to the opportunity to do what we
are trained to do,'' Wolfe said, when asked about the possibility
of a ground war. ``So I would say, yeah, it's always exciting to
think about the possibility of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the thousands of US soldiers holed up about 16 miles
from the capital of Tirana will actually get around to doing it _
waging a ground war against the Yugoslav Army _ is still an open
question here.
</P>
<P>
   Many local Albanians, anxious to destroy the regime of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and to return the Kosovar refugees who
are clogging private homes and public spaces here, are hoping US
and other NATO troops will head over the border and finish the job
against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the troops, planes, missiles and tanks
stationed at the headquarters for Task Force Hawk are simply
waiting for the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots are always chomping at the bit,'' said spokesman Capt.
Martin Downie. ``They're ready to go at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the two airmen who survived this week's explosion of the
Apache attack helicopter are ready to go back on the job, their
colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   The two unnamed pilots ``brushed themselves off'' after the
Monday night crash which destroyed the aircraft, and are ready to
take off again, said Capt. Mark Arden.
</P>
<P>
   The infantry forces stationed at Rinas are less enthusiastic
than their flying colleagues, but ready to go if ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some anxiety here,'' said Sgt. Darnell McKinney, 25.
``But we're trained for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to the refugees,'' he added. ``I read an
article about a little girl being molested, and my heart was full
of rage and anger. I can't believe this is actually happening,''
McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always anxious to do your job, but given what our job
is, you don't want to rush into anything,'' Wolfe said. The
infantry would prefer that the air campaign be completed _
``destroying as much as possible'' of Milosevic's artillery _
before the troops go in, Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   US military officials won't say how many troops are at the base,
and how many have moved to other posts, such as the
Albanian-Kosovar border. A total of 5,350 troops have been okayed
for the mission, and ``they continue to flow in,'' Downie said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the reason the troops and Bradley Fighting Vehicles
are here is to provide protection for the Apache helicopters and
their crews. But the vast array of weaponry viewed by a small group
of reporters at the base seems like overkill for the guarding of a
couple of dozen helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have spotted some weaponry up north, where some
shelling has been reported from the Serbian side of the border.
Downie refused to confirm the sightings, but said the munitions
``need to go where they need to go. It's not all going to be at the
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the troops are left to conduct dress rehearsals
for a show that may never arrive.
</P>
<P>
   They fly helicopters, and take the Bradleys out for spins in the
mud. They maintain planes and other vehicles. About 500 are
involved in getting humanitarian supplies to refugees elsewhere in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to basically wait it out'' until NATO makes the big
move, McKinney said. ``We're good at waiting it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A bomb scare Thursday held up civilian and military air traffic
for awhile, but so far, no explosive has been found.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb-sniffing dog noted ``something suspicious'' in a civilian
truck filled with gravel that was driven onto the base, said Maj.
Tom Dolney, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A second dog was sent in, and the animal also found something
wrong, so the military sent in a special robot to detect explosives
in the gravel, he said. Air Force and Navy personnel were moved
from the area as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials wouldn't speculate on the nature or source of
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there are a lot of lawless groups in Albania who aren't
too thrilled about NATO being here,'' Downie said. ``This is an
offensive operation. It's as close to combat as we've gotten.''

SHADOW CAST ON PROVIDENCE REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Even with the sculpted footbridges and
soaring glass towers, the polished turrets and old-world canals cut
into the heart of downtown, the rebirth of Providence was never
just about a facelift.
</P>
<P>
   It was about a soul-lift.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the cosmetics of this city's $2 billion, go-for-broke
push towards urban revival, there has always been a deeper yearning
to shake the reputation long stamped on this New England pocket _
for mob hits, back-room deals, and rampant corruption from the
governor on down.
</P>
<P>
   But memories of that dark past resurfaced powerfully Wednesday,
when federal agents stormed into City Hall offices for records and
arrested two top tax officials on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   In an investigation whose very name echoes the big money and big
crime long tied to this town, officials all but promised that
Operation Plunder Dome will widen beyond the two officials. Staring
straight into a bank of cameras, the US Attorney for Rhode Island
urged others involved in corrupt dealings to come forward.
According to the federal complaint, over 100 video and audio tapes
provide evidence of recorded bribes or extortion payments with
several other city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, along the terraced plazas of the city's new waterfront
park, many in the lunch-time crowd said the momentum of rebirth was
too strong to be derailed by two aging members of a tax review
board.
</P>
<P>
   But as news of the scandal churned around the city offices and
public walks of the capital, others said there was real fear over a
developing investigation that could spread in any direction _
including to the inner circle of Mayor Vincent A. ``Buddy'' Cianci,
a man who has sought to reshape his own troubled past in the mirror
image of a transformed city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what to think because right now, no one
knows whether these are bad apples or if the entire barrel is
spoiled,'' said Darrell West, a political science professor at
Brown University and a city resident. ``There is incredible
positive momentum for the city right now. But every time a scandal
like this comes along, it revives memories of the old Providence,
and that is the real danger the city faces right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Those memories harken back to a time when Providence was best
known as the regional seat of the New England mafia, and where
legendary mob shootings on Federal Hill underlined the authority of
La Cosa Nostra. Back then, today's pulsing downtown Kennedy Plaza
was an overgrown, abandoned park space edged by a decaying hulk of
a train station.
</P>
<P>
   And Providence was a place where a parade of state political and
financial leaders fell in a never-ending drama that grew
increasingly familiar and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The scandals brought down two chief justices of the state
Supreme Court, a Superior Court judge, the mayor of Pawtucket and
former governor Edward DiPrete in a web of extortion and bribery
deals that climbed into the millions of dollars. In a signature
Providence moment, the case of DiPrete evoked an image of a chief
executive who combed through a restaurant dumpster to recover a
$10,000 bribe he accidentally threw away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the scandal nearly swallowed Cianci: 21 of his
underlings were convicted on corruption charges. Cianci remained
untouched by that investigation. But in 1984, he resigned after
pleading no contest to charges he beat his estranged wife's lover
with an ashtray and a fire log.
</P>
<P>
   But many residents say the days of shame are behind them, and
they credit a mayor whose stunning political comeback ushered in an
undeniable urban revival.
</P>
<P>
   Vibrant with restaurants, walkways, a new convention center and
a new mall, the city emerged as a bold rival to Boston, capturing
the attention of NFL officials who chose the city over Boston as
host to the 1997 AFC Conference Championship game at Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the city has burst onto the national scene as the
setting for the hit movie ``Something About Mary,'' and a
critically acclaimed TV series, called simply ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard even for me to imagine what it was like, because it
was so old and dirty. It was like, who would want to come to
Providence?'' said Deb Wendoloski, who lives in Cranston but works
as an insurance examiner in the capital. ``I think the city has
shaken its old image. You have people in other cities who are
copying what Providence has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing other residents and employees around the city,
Wendoloski said corruption was not unique to Providence, and lurks
in every large city.
</P>
<P>
   But others said that Providence's peculiar knack for tainted
city business would continue to cast a shadow over its gleaming
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many buildings you build or what you do to the
city, some things are constant here,'' said John Rector, who owns a
new, upscale grocery in the center of downtown. ``There's
corruption at City Hall.''

SUBDUED NRA SHIFTS GEARS AS GUN CONTROL CALLS GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ To herald its annual convention here this weekend, the
National Rifle Association plastered this city with billboards of
its rifle-bearing president, actor Charlton Heston, and the almost
biblical injunction: ``Join me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a rollicking revival meeting, coming on
the heels of an expected triumph over Colorado gun-control
measures. Instead, that hoped-for victory has evaporated and the
billboards have vanished. The NRA will meet Saturday with nothing
to celebrate, unwelcome guests in a city angry about gun violence
and griefstricken by the Columbine High School massacre, just 10
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The rare defensive crouch by the normally aggressive NRA is the
clearest of many signs that momentum has shifted, for the moment at
least, in the debate on gun control. Already, several states have
sprung into action, moving to tighten access to guns or backing
away from the gun-rights' agenda. Now, the question for advocates
on both sides is whether the Columbine shootings, for all the
horror they caused, for all the questions they raised, will be
remembered as marking a seismic shift in the debate or a mere
hiccup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something different about this event, whether it was
just the scope of it, the firepower that these kids had, or the
fact that we all watched it on television,'' said Kristen Rand,
director of federal policy for the Violence Policy Center, a
gun-control organization in Washington. ``The focus on gun control
seems to be more immediate and more lasting than in previous school
shootings and other deadly gun events.''
</P>
<P>
   Also raising the volume, she said, are reports at least one of
the guns used in the murders was purchased at a gun show, where
weapon sales involving unlicensed dealers and private buyers can
occur outside regulatory safeguards, Rand said. A top priority
among gun control advocates is to use the Columbine killings as
Exhibit A in closing that loophole.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of gun-owners' rights said they expect the
anti-gun fervor to quickly fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine is obviously an enormously beneficial short-term
tactical advantage to the gun ban groups,'' said David Kopel of the
Independence Institute, a conservative think tank in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the brevity of that advantage is underscored by the fact
that President Clinton politicized this tragedy even while funerals
are still going on,'' he added. ``The fact that he couldn't wait a
week until the children were buried indicates what a very small
window of opportunity this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopel said he believes it will soon dawn on Americans that, as
tragic as the shooting was, making new laws would not change a
thing. Gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had already broken
something on the order of 20 existing laws, he said, ``and to think
they wouldn't have perpetrated the crime if they had to break one
more law is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, the deaths of 12 students and one teacher,
serious injuries to a dozen other students, as well as the suicides
of Harris and Klebold, have sent a shiver of reaction through state
legislatures. Some have taken quick action on stalled gun-control
bills and others have quietly pulled back measures favored by
gun-rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, the Littleton shootings have refocused the
Clinton administration. The president last week offered a
milti-pronged gun reform package _ including a three-day waiting
period, a crackdown on gun shows, and a measure to place blame on
adults whose guns are used by children. However, its fate is
uncertain in the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments are also lining up to join the list of cities
that have followed in the path of anti-tobacco activists by suing
gun makers and dealers for the damage caused by firearms. Detroit
this week became the seventh city to file suit, and at least a
half-dozen others, including Boston, are considering legal action
as well. Colorado Gov. Bill Owens added his voice to the chorus,
saying he would veto a bill that would have barred local entities
from suing gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling indicator of the public mood is the reaction
seen by Richard Feinberg, who runs an Internet gun-dealing site
from his Norton, Mass., home. He said sales have skyrocketed,
yielding his best week in memory. Feinberg said he sold roughly 40
guns, most of them paramilitary-style weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid the gun-control types are going to take
their gun rights away from them because of what happened, so
they're rushing to buy them now,'' Feinberg said. Another factor,
he said, was ongoing fear among some that the end of the millennium
could be a time of social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are frightened of our government, I guess because our
government doesn't trust them,'' Feinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the biggest surge of gun-control sentiment has
been in Colorado, a state usually viewed as being squarely in line
with the gun-owning tradition of the West.
</P>
<P>
   First, lawmakers here withdrew a bill to eliminate most local
gun regulations, notably Denver's ban on assault weapons. The NRA
had expected that bill to be passed in time for its convention, so
manufacturers and dealers could display the hottest new forms of
firepower. Now, with the law still on the books and the fear that
any gun show would be a public relations disaster, the NRA weapons
exhibition has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Equally damaging to Second Amendment activists, the shootings
derailed an expected victory for the NRA's ``right-to-carry''
agenda, legislation that would have allowed licensed Colorado gun
owners to carry concealed weapons. The expected passage of that law
had been seen by the NRA as a chance to rebound from its
disappointment two weeks ago in Missouri, where $3.7 million in NRA
spending was not enough to convince voters to lift that state's
concealed weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, the Colorado governor, had supported lifting the
concealed weapons ban, but the bill was pulled from consideration
after the shootings. Few here expect it to be reconsidered anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happened over the last year or so, with all the
school shootings, not just Columbine, the American people have
grown angry,'' said Joe Sudbay, director of state legislation at
Washington-based Handgun Control Inc. ``I don't think they'll be
silent anymore, and I think they'll start demanding that
legislators respond to them and not the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states have, in fact, responded to the shootings by quick
legislative action. One day after the carnage, Arizona's governor
vetoed a bill that would have prevented localities from filing gun
suits; a similar bill in Florida that had been expected to pass was
pulled off state House calendar, though it is moving ahead in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the legislature killed a bill that would have closed
the gun show loophole, but Republican Gov. George W. Bush later
said Congress should do so on a national basis.
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki moved to toughen penalties for gun
crimes, and Illinois Gov. George Ryan backed a move to require
parents to store guns with trigger locks or in locked cabinets to
prevent access by children.
</P>
<P>
   But not all states are moving in the same direction. One day
after the shootings, the Nevada Assembly voted to take away local
governments' right to sue gun makers. And, with the gun lobby
retaining deep-rooted ties to key state legislators, there is a
strong likelihood at least some of the tabled measures will be
revisited when the furor dies down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't change anything long-term,'' said Michael Yacino,
executive director of the Gun Owners Action League, based in
Northborough, Mass. ``People will realize that we need to focus our
attention on criminal behavior, and as we saw by what happened out
there in Colorado, if we were to blame just guns, then we'd also
blame propane tanks and matches and other things these killers
created.''
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, Clinton's package includes calls for
background checks on all gun sales, including those at gun shows;
raising the legal age for handgun possession from 18 to 21 in most
cases; and holding adults responsible when children use their
firearms to cause injury or death, in cases when the adults
knowingly or recklessly allowed the child access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can pass it all if the American people want it badly
enough,'' Clinton said when announcing the package. ``And we don't
need to go through another Littleton for the American people to
want it badly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican leaders in Congress quickly characterized
the proposals as a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction that
would not solve the problem. They urged a focus on the media and
broader cultural issues, as well as a broad look at the causes of
teen violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control activists also noted pessimistically that not even
the fatal shootings of two US Capitol police officers last summer
was seen by Republican leaders as a clarion call for greater gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   NRA officials said they will have no comment about the anti-gun
surge until Saturday's meeting. In a letter to the reported 2.8
million members, Heston and another NRA leader said the group
wanted to show sympathy and respect to community. ``Our spirits
must endure this terrible suffering together, and so must the
freedoms that bring us together,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Mayor Wellington Webb had asked the NRA to cancel its
convention altogether, even offering to reimburse the group for any
losses. NRA officials declined, saying they are required to hold an
annual members' meeting by the New York state law under which the
group is organized.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scaling back the convention from three days to
one, the NRA scrapped a planned reception for US Rep. J. C. Watts
of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House and a
sometime spokesman for the NRA. Saturday's session will feature
just two scheduled speakers, Heston and NRA executive vice
president Wayne LaPierre.
</P>
<P>
   The convention had been expected to attract 22,000 NRA members
and pour $18 million in the local economy. City and tourism
officials said they had no idea how many would show up. An anti-gun
rally outside the convention promises to win nearly as much
publicity, and possibly as much support, as the NRA meeting itself.
</P>
<P>
   As for the NRA conventioneers who do find their way to Denver,
in the place of billboards with Heston, they will find public
service ads touting the American Red Cross.

 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUINCY, Mass. _ Carmin Karasic is having what she calls a
``happy moment,'' a kind of buoyant exhilaration about a small
technological achievement. She has just received an e-mail from a
friend in Holland who translated a computerized voice file from
Japan into a format Karasic can listen to on her computer in
Quincy. The voice is part of her new installation, which will be on
view at the Attleboro Museum next month as part of the Boston
Cyberarts Festival. ``It's so cool!'' she says, barely containing
her enthusiasm. ``It's so amusing. I never would have thought to
include a computer speaking Japanese, but hey, it's a cyber arts
festival, so why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, happy moment,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 45-year-old programmer turned digital artist is
having plenty of joyous moments these days. She's no longer afraid
that the FBI may show up at her house because of her work with a
group of ``hacktivists'' who made headlines last year for their
controversial demonstrations in cyberspace. She's no longer walking
around feeling like an artist trapped in a technical manager's body
_ and wardrobe, for that matter. Over the past four years, she has
transformed herself from a white-collar programmer into a
free-spirited artist pioneering work in the wild frontier of
cyberspace. She maintains the sort of egghead reverence for
technology that is common among engineers _ she still rhapsodizes
when she encounters a beautiful piece of code or a clever
application _ but she combines it with artistic passion and an
almost uncontainable sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   That combination is evident as she bounds up the stairs of her
Quincy home, blue braids flying, leading a visitor on a tour of her
``humble studio.'' First, she provides the technical specs: This
rather untypical atelier features a 300-megahertz Pentium computer,
a printer, a scanner, a Web camera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the tour of the art, which proceeds rapidly with
the click-click of the mouse. ``This one is called `Gossamer
Goddess Morphs Into Cyberspace,' '' Karasic says, displaying a
digital self-portrait. ``It's me sitting in this world _ flesh
space, as I call it _ and then crossing into cyberspace, morphing
to the point of really just these electric blue tendrils. It's
really about how you can project whatever you want in cyberspace,
and I think that's a good thing. I think people are more than just
one person, and it's good to find a venue where you can experiment
with the other yous and find other ways to express yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, exactly what Karasic has been doing since
she left her technical career to pursue art. She's experimented
with on-line performance art, using her Web cam and her keyboard to
participate remotely in on-line happenings taking place in, say,
Linz, Austria. In one performance, she adopted a persona at her
desktop in Quincy and communicated with a Finnish artist typing
away at an arts conference in Austria. The experience was another
``happy moment'' _ but why? ``I was obviously alone, and I didn't
know how many people were watching,'' she says. ``But there is a
sense of being on the cutting edge, making history, doing something
that may or not be recorded. I don't know. There's an excitement.
It felt good to be doing something so new and so now.'' A pause.
``And it's just so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that Karasic was frustrated with her
work _ not that it wasn't cool, but it was just so corporate. A
self-described Army brat, she dreamed of becoming an artist when
she was growing up in cities all over the world while her father
pursued a career in the military. ``I loved it,'' she says of her
peripatetic youth. ``I still have wanderlust.'' But her interest in
art was curtailed when a professor at Trenton State College
discouraged her in the early '70s. Around that time, she met her
husband, Dave, and dropped out of college. (They have two children,
Leedah, 15, and Geoffrey, 11.) She later earned a degree in
computer science from Suffolk University in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   That degree led to a fast-paced technical career with jobs as a
systems analyst at Polaroid Corp. and Lotus Development Corp. and,
ultimately, a managerial position at Fidelity Investments. In the
early days of her career, when it was rare to find women of color
in lead technological positions, she often broke gender and color
barriers. ``Oh God, really, it took years before I wasn't the only
black person,'' she says. ``There were some women, but often I was
the only nonwhite person. I felt I always had to prove myself, but
it's been a good experience. I was very good at what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But something was missing. One morning in 1995, Karasic heard a
feature on National Public Radio about digital artists. ``I was a
high-level manager at Fidelity Investments, and I remember sitting
in the car until the interview was over. I was getting goose bumps.
I thought, `I am a digital artist trapped in a Fidelity manager's
body.' I went skipping into the office smiling from ear to ear. No
one ever smiled there, and people said, `What are you so happy
about?' I just said, `I'm going to be a digital artist. You're
going to hear about me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That particular ``happy moment'' changed her life. Karasic made
a vow to spend 30 minutes a day working on the transition; within a
year, she had met many local artists working with technology and
had landed an artist-in-residence slot at the Do While Studio, a
Boston technology atelier. She quit her job at Fidelity and took on
part-time work testing computer software.

 BOSTON: ... two good eyes.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One good eye meant that junior hockey was the limit of Maurice's
playing horizons. He tried to cling to it as long as possible,
remaining with Windsor as an overage player, one of the few times
he's been senior man in the locker room. But midway through his
fourth season, the Spitfires were forced to make a personnel
decision because of junior limits on overage players. Maurice was
the casualty. ``Jim and Tom Webster cut me off at the knees,''
Maurice says with a laugh. ``There's no other way to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shield of humor he often employs, Maurice was deeply
wounded at the time because he desperately wanted a shot at the
Memorial Cup, emblematic of junior hockey supremacy, and the
Spitfires were a top contender. They gave him a couple of options _
they could work a trade with Oshawa, where he could end his playing
career, or he could stay with Windsor as a 21-year-old assistant to
Webster. He chose the latter, but again, there was no grand design
to his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a fun way to stay in hockey and make a
little money while I was at university,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford saw more to it than that. ``Paul had been our captain
since his second year,'' he recalls. ``As I got to know him as a
person and player, I felt he was someone I wanted to bring into our
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the long haul. Maurice considers his two major achievements
``being born to the parents I have and being taken in by Compuware
as if I were family.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken in and moved up. In a hurry. Compuware acquired an OHL
expansion team, the Detroit Junior Red Wings, in 1988, and five
years later, at age 26, Maurice became head coach. In his second
season, he took the Wings to the Memorial Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got blindsided. By now, Rutherford was running the
misbegotten Whalers for Karmanos, and he handed an assistant's job
to Maurice. Who went kicking and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a junior head coach at 26,'' he says. ``I was in no
hurry to be an NHL assistant. When he asked me, I thought, `Wow,
what a huge step that would be.' I didn't think I had a lot to
offer Paul Holmgren (Hartford's head coach). Then I thought about
it a little more and I figured I'd have time to develop, that I
wouldn't be expected to make a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case for long. Twelve games into the 1995
season, Holmgren was cashiered despite a 5-6-1 record _ lofty by
Whaler standards _ and Rutherford again turned to Maurice. Who
again needed a great deal of persuading.
</P>
<P>
   On the night Holmgren was fired, Rutherford sat down at his
kitchen table with Maurice into the wee hours. ``He said he wanted
to be an NHL coach someday but that he wasn't sure that was the
time,'' recalls Rutherford. ``He was in no rush to be a head coach.
He listened to me and finally said, `If that's what you want.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford had emphasized to Maurice that NHL head jobs aren't
everyday items, that he could turn down the offer at 28 and still
be waiting for another at 58. But that wasn't the deciding
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being drafted by Compuware had been a huge factor in my
life,'' says Maurice. ``When people treat you that well . . .
Taking the job was a matter of common sense. I thought they had a
master plan for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The clincher came the next morning in the parking garage beneath
the Hartford offices when the arriving Maurice encountered the
departing Holmgren. ``He'd heard I didn't want to take the job,''
says Maurice. ``He told me, `You'd be crazy not to.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Maurice wondered whether he'd been crazy not to say
no. ``I was trying to figure out which door to walk into in each
building that first year,'' he says. ``They'd ask me, `What time do
you want the plane to leave?' I'd say, `How the (expletive) should
I know?' I was just happy to be on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that was the larger issue of how the boy boss would be
regarded by players he'd watched as a kid. ``I thought about how
people would take him because of his age,'' says Rutherford. ``It
was something we had to watch for.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice, too, was wary. ``I'm sure they were saying, `Who's this
kid?' '' he says. ``I know that's what I would've been saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Those misgivings turned out to be more anxiety than reality,
according to Maurice, and Rutherford concurs. ``When we did our
end-of-the-year reviews and sat down with each player
individually,'' he says, ``every one of them felt Paul should be
the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment wasn't always widespread. Maurice, who is in the
final year of a contract that pays him $300,000 this season, had to
develop a deaf ear and a thick skin during the first three years on
the job, when the Whalers/Hurricanes just missed the playoffs each
time. ``After three years of must-win games, of seeing myself fired
so many times in print,'' says Maurice, ``I've grown immune to it.
I don't worry about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was enduring calls for his youthful head, Maurice had
to deal with the major disruption caused by Karmanos's acrimonious
departure from Hartford for a region where the customer base can't
necessarily tell a hockey puck from a chaw of tobacco. For good
measure, the Hurricanes have been forced to become transients in
their own home, playing in Greensboro and practicing 75 miles away
in Raleigh, where their new arena is being completed. ``It took us
a year and a half just to develop a game-day routine,'' says
Maurice.
</P>
<P>
   But he considers that upheaval almost his salvation. ``The fact
of the matter is, if we'd stayed in Hartford, I wouldn't have
survived,'' he says. ``I don't think you can miss the playoffs
three years in a row in the same city and survive. The media won't
let you.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no risk of that now. As much as he might want to
downplay his role, Maurice has overseen the development of a team
of grit and promise. Even he grudgingly acknowledges, ``I think
I've done a little better job each year.''
</P>
<P>
   After an extended baptism under fire, he's got about everything
he could want. Though he probably wouldn't mind a few gray hairs.
To enhance the look with the glasses.

   TAKE-BOS  
 QUINCY, Mass.: ... computer software.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around that time, she hooked up with a few artists who had
founded the Electronic Civil Disturbance Theatre. That connection
led to notoriety: Her prophecy about being recognized came true,
but the public attention came first for her political activity
rather than her art endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the group call themselves ``hacktivists,'' people
who engage in political activism in cyberspace. Using a program
called Floodnet (written by Karasic), the group staged 10 on-line
``sit-ins'' last year to support the efforts of the Zapatistas in
Mexico. Floodnet enables a user to repeatedly request access to a
targeted Web site, such as sites run by the Pentagon and the
Mexican government, bogging down the server and potentially denying
access to other users.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karasic views the Floodnet attacks as a kind of performance art
similar to demonstrations in ``flesh space.'' ``If we had a civil
disturbance at Neponset Circle, you wouldn't be able to get to my
house,'' she explains. ``But you wouldn't think that those people
should be arrested. A sit-in means that someone is going to be
inconvenienced. We're trying to push the limits of political
interaction on line.''
</P>
<P>
   But others question that logic. An FBI representative says that
the use of Floodnet could be a federal crime, since it is illegal
to intentionally block access to an Internet server.
</P>
<P>
   The Floodnet project is over for now _ and Karasic seems a bit
relieved. ``Hacktivism got all the attention, and we, as
individuals, got lost,'' she says, noting that her son worried that
law enforcement officials might drive up and arrest her. ``The
artwork got lost, dimmed by all the media attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the art is center stage. Karasic is director of the
on-line gallery for the cyber arts festival, a wide-ranging event
at venues all over the region for the next two weeks. Her work will
be featured in two group shows at the festival, one at the
Bromfield Gallery and the other at the Attleboro Museum. The
Attleboro piece is based on Samuel Beckett's ``The Lost Ones,'' a
tale about 200 people who march around and around in a cylinder,
trapped for eternity. Beckett's characters repeat a single refrain:
``For the passion to search is such that no place may be left
unsearched.'' The installation will have an audio component of
overlapping voices repeating those words in different languages,
including the computer speaking Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, all of Karasic's art has been created to be
exhibited solely in cyberspace, in e-zines and on-line galleries.
``The Lost Ones'' marks a breakthrough. ``It's the first piece I've
done in flesh space,'' she says. ``It's different from Internet
performance art. People can walk up to it; it's tactile. You don't
have to be in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   The materials for the project are all over Karasic's house. In
the living room, she is constructing a giant cylinder out of wire
mesh fencing. She is building 200 miniature figures that will line
the periphery of the cylinder; they're made out of decidedly
low-tech material. ``It's Crayola modeling clay,'' she says. At the
center of the cylinder, viewers will see a computer that depicts
the same scene using a virtual reality program.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can identify with it without any knowledge of
computers,'' Karasic says. ``It's a cylinder. It's so primitive.
People are comfortable with it. It's almost like a temple in a way.
I'm not trying to say it's a religious experience, but I think it
talks to people in a way that is subconscious but also physical.
When you're working in cyberspace, you're talking about technical
stuff. If people have baggage about the computer, it can be a
negative experience. This is different.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And digital art _ cool as it is _ can be somewhat alienating to
the uninitiated. ``I hate to say it, but in a way, it's elitist.
First of all, you have to have this,'' Karasic says, fingering her
keyboard. ``You can't go the library and say, `I want to be part of
an Internet performance that's going to take place at midnight in
New York.' And you also have to understand enough to know how to
use the technology. And on top of that, it's kind of weird and
offbeat. People don't understand what's going on, and most people
go, `What are they talking about?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyberarts Festival is aiming to bring the esoteric into the
mainstream. And that's a good thing, says Karasic, who is on the
festival steering committee. Her son is more enthusiastic about her
cyber career now that she's being recognized as an artist rather
than a hacktivist. ``I'm a typical suburban mom out here in
Quincy,'' she says, laughing. ``My son says that his friends look
at my blue hair and my weird clothes and he just says, `Oh, my mom
is an artist.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The weird clothes _ mostly black on black, clunky boots, a bit
of leather _ came with the career switch. ``I couldn't have blue
hair at Fidelity,'' she says. But she wears her new identity
naturally, proving her own maxim that people have more than one
persona.
</P>
<P>
   All the attention, however, is daunting. ``It's freaking me
out,'' she says. ``Someone warned me that it can be bad if it moves
too fast, but what can you do?'' After all, it wasn't that long ago
that Karasic was walking the corporate walk. The art world is not
exactly the most inviting place for newcomers, but in a short time,
she completely rewrote her professional story. How did it happen?
Karasic mulls it over, then comes up empty, her face displaying a
look of wordless wonder.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, she zaps off an e-mail, using her favorite
medium to communicate a response she couldn't come up with in flesh
space. ``It is such a new frontier, that there are no rules,
traditions, standards, or gatekeepers,'' the e-mail says. ``So I
have become something of an authority, simply by combining my tech
skilz, living in cyberspace, and linking with artists who have
established themselves in cyberspace. Oh, and the New York City
digerati tend to like me _ that helps a lot . . .'' Another happy
moment, that.

WE BANDS OF ANGELS 
The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the
Japanese 
By Elizabeth M. Norman 
Random House, 327 pp., illustrated, $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As images of desperate Albanian refugees and NATO bombs sear the
senses, readers of ``We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of
American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese'' cannot help
being struck by an eerie feeling of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years ago, war generated the same horrific tales of
lives mangled and torn apart, and in writing about nurses trapped
in the Philippines during World War II, Elizabeth Norman captures
its gritty, surreal texture with as much eloquence as the best
writers on the Balkan front lines. And Norman, having spent eight
years interviewing nurses who were still alive in the 1980s, gives
us an even richer, more nuanced picture of war than today's hurried
correspondents can.
</P>
<P>
   A registered nurse herself, and a historian of nursing, Norman
tells the story of Bataan with authority, compassion, and an
unusually clearsighted view of the American military. She hooks
readers from the start by beginning her tale in the fall of 1941,
when war seemed a distant rumor for the military personnel
stationed in the Philippines. Life there was halcyon, Norman
writes, ``with Filipino houseboys, maids, chefs, gardeners and
tailors looking after every need . . . cocktails and bridge at
sunset, white jackets and long gowns at dinner, good gin and
Gershwin under the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 7, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and hours
later, the bombs began to fall on American military bases in the
Philippines. Until then, very few of the 99 Army and Navy nurses
had seen combat duty and they ``found themselves almost overwhelmed
by the slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman is adept at sketching the nurses caught in the carnage:
Helen ``Cassie'' Cassiani, a farm girl from Bridgewater, Mass.,
whose Italian parents immigrated to the United States around the
turn of the century; Ruth Marie Straub, a quiet Jewish woman from
Milwaukee whose diary entries provide the most compelling snapshots
of the horror and deprivation these women were to go through; and
Red Harrington, a spirited woman who had been abandoned as an
infant and raised by a farming couple in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   She weaves the life histories of these and other women into her
larger tapestry, creating an often gripping narrative. Ruth Straub,
for instance, is one of the first nurses to suffer a tragic loss;
on the troop transport over to Manila she had met an Army pilot who
wanted to get married in the Philippines. She convinced him to wait
until the war was all over, but he was one of the early casualties
of the Japanese bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Straub, however, doesn't find out about his death until days
later, and she is devastated by the news: ``It doesn't seem to be
true. They took me back (to the hospital) as a patient. Luminal
(the sedative phenobarbital) every four hours. Why, why, why. . . .
Others have carried on bravely, and I must too. Glen would want
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Straub does carry on, and she is among the 51 Army and Navy
nurses who are trucked into the densely wooded peninsula of Bataan,
on the southwest coast of Luzon Island, to help care for the
retreating American force. Norman creates a vivid picture of the
Bataan jungle and the primitive open-air conditions doctors and
nurses labored under as they cared for the growing number of
wounded soldiers, in the face of constant bombardment by the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some wards looked like tropical greenhouses, with beds set
between trees and under palm fronds, a tangle of vines hanging
close overhead. . . . At nights, (the nurses) worked under blackout
conditions, using flashlights or kerosene lamps painted blue. . . .
Wild pigs would brush against their legs, and geckos, those small
lizards with suction-cup feet, came diving out of the trees. One
night a nurse hiking between beds was smacked in the forehead by a
snake swinging from a branch.''
</P>
<P>
   For these nurses, the worst tragedy was being forced to abandon
hundreds of wounded soldiers on Bataan while they, solely because
they were women, were evacuated across the bay to the volcanic
island of Corregidor, where an underground maze of tunnels had been
built into the rock. They later learned that at least a third of
the men left on Bataan died during the infamous Bataan death march
to Japanese prisoner-of-war camps.
</P>
<P>
   Life for the surviving nurses, of course, was no picnic, either
on Corregidor or back in Manila, where most of them eventually
ended up after being captured by the Japanese. Many of them
suffered the effects of severe malnutrition, and had to watch as
men, women, and children around them starved to death from
inadequate rations as the war drew to a close.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint with ``We Band of Angels'' is that Norman
doesn't know how to end her story. Instead of stopping at the end
of the war, with the nurses getting a heroines' welcome back in the
States and then promptly being forgotten, she insists on
chronicling their lives up to the present, in dry, almost
footnotelike prose. For some reason, Norman is not able to capture
the drama of ordinary life with the same vivid brushstrokes she
uses in describing war. As a result, the story of one of World War
II's most dramatic but little-known chapters finishes with a
disappointing fizzle.

NICE MIX OF LOVE, LARCENY IN GLOSSY `ENTRAPMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ENTRAPMENT 
Directed by: Jon Amiel 
Screenplay by: Ron Bass, William Broyles 
Starring: Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will
Patton, Maury Chaykin 
Running time: 112 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some language, sensuality, violence and drug
content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' is a silly millennial heist movie that gets by on
its high gloss and the star power of Sean Connery and Catherine
Zeta-Jones. Her sexy turn opposite Antonio Banderas in ``The Mask
of Zorro'' has certainly earned her a shot as an art thief who
agrees with Connery's veteran lone wolf and wary partner in crime
that the only way they can work together is to have no personal
involvement. After they tune up by removing a valuable Chinese mask
from a castle, they get really serious about stealing $8 billion
from a bank in Malaysia during a window of opportunity provided by
a Y2K computer security check.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledge their age difference in what, considering the
circumstances, is pretty droll style as Connery glumly recalls
reveling in money when it was something you walked away with, not
something you downloaded. You've got to love Connery. No facelifts,
no hairpieces, no lying about his age (he's 68) except in the film,
when he endearingly tells Zeta-Jones his character is 60. Like it
would make a difference. Like his lordly and luxury-loving
character isn't going to wind up falling for this woman who brags
of her seductive capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Connery in the '90s is something like Cary Grant in the '60s, a
little creaky, but still dripping with style. He's still more than
game as he chases swag and the glamorous woman he tries to persuade
himself he swore off. Unlike Grant, he also projects warmth and
ruggedness, so what's not to like? As for Zeta-Jones, Connery knows
what he thinks audiences will like. As one of the film's producers,
and the one calling the shots, he photographs at length her pretty,
leotard-clad butt twisting its way through a cat's-cradle of laser
beam alarms not once, but twice, once in rehearsal at his baronial
castle, and again for real.
</P>
<P>
   They may spend the film telling themselves it's not about love,
but about larceny. But of course it's about both. It's also about
our relying on Connery to have enough taste and discretion to
handle the inevitable sex in a dignified yet plausible way. It's a
thing he does lately by allowing his vulnerability to the aging
process to show. In contrast to Zeta-Jones's radiant physical
confidence, he allows the incursions of time to show in little
telltale ways, like the occasional shortage of breath or shortfall
of panache when they're dangling from a steel support beam hundreds
of feet above the street.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the film's strokes are provided by others _ Will
Patton's off-center FBI man, Ving Rhames' even more off-center
gadget supplier, Maury Chaykin's over-the-top decadent fence. But
in the end, ``Entrapment'' is about the savvy packaging of sexual
allure and Connery's canny way of looking sadder but wiser while
acknowledging with rueful little grunts and glances the hold it
still has on him. ``Entrapment'' is a throwback to Hollywood's
glory days, not so much in its glamorous thief routines, as in the
kind of information so authoritativiely conveyed by an big aging
star persona.

A THUMBS-DOWN TO SLACKER HORROR SPOOF `IDLE HANDS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
IDLE HANDS 
Directed by: Rodman Flender 
Screenplay by: Terri Hughes, Ron Milbauer 
Starring: Devon Sawa, Seth Green, Elden Henson, Jessica Alba, Fred
Willard, Connie Ray, Viveca A. Fox, Jack Noseworthy 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: R (horror violence and gore, pervasive teen drug use,
language and sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Roger Corman drudge Rodman Flender and his young lead,
Devon Sawa, bring all the energy and twice the gore they need to
``Idle Hands,'' their would-be horror goof, but only about half the
material. The result is an anemic take on slacker obliviousness. It
at least gets off to a comically outrageous start as Sawa's stoned
dropout, Anton, doesn't even notice that his parents have been
slaughtered in Halloween-themed style. Or that he's the one who did
it. Well, not him exactly. The film is based on the premise that
Anton's left hand doesn't know what his right hand is doing until
it does too much.
</P>
<P>
   Demonic possession is the reason Anton's right hand has been
doing wrong. After he realizes what it has been up to, he spends a
lot of time trying to grab it with his left hand as it takes on a
lethal life of its own. Up it pops, Dr. Strangelove-style, as Anton
looks horrified and tries to head it off. At one point, he grabs a
cleaver and chops it off. But that scarcely slows the hand down. It
murders Anton's goof-off buddies, Seth Green's Mick and Elden
Henson's Pnub, and then goes after his girlfriend, Molly, played by
Jessica Alba. The buddies rise from the dead and slide into the
couch potato mode in front of Anton's TV. Why this option is not
extended to the dead parents is not made clear.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pnub holds his severed head in his lap, it, too, takes
on a life of its own, the most amusing in the film, which mostly
relies for comic effect on moments such as a cat gnawing on a
eyeball. By the time druid priestess Viveca A. Fox hits town in
search of the hand, it already has taken off to do some damage at
the big school dance, and does. But by this time a pall of
diminshing returns has settled over ``Idle Hands.'' Flender and
Sawa try to cover for it by overstating their limp material. This
does nothing but expose its nothingness all the more glaringly. If
the hand had any sense, it would have pulled the plug on this one.

`NOAH' TAKES THE WRONG COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
NOAH'S ARK 
Starring: John Voight, Mary Steenburgen, F. Murray Abraham, James
Coburn, Carol Kane, Alexis Denisof, Mark Bazeley, Jonathan Cake,
Emily Mortimer, Sydney Poitier, Sonya Walger 
Directed by: John Irvin 
On: NBC 
Time: Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the start of NBC's ``Noah's Ark,'' we're warned that the
biblical story has been altered ``for poetic effect.'' But that
would be wishful thinking on the part of the filmmakers, including
producer Robert Halmi Sr., the demigod of TV event movies, because
there is nothing in this stubbornly prosaic creation that's even
nearly poetic. Like those folks we call ``people pleasers,''
``Noah's Ark'' is the kind of bland product that so desperately
wants to be liked that it ends up as a sanded-down thing, stripped
of any outstanding qualities. It steers clear of the intensities of
religious parable and philosophy, opting instead for godawful comic
shtick and trite romantic antics. Typical of this trivialized
telling of the great flood is F. Murray Abraham's Lot, a joker who
Rodney Dangerfields on about his nagging wife: ``I usually take her
everywhere with me because it's easier than having to kiss her
goodbye.'' Thud.
</P>
<P>
   How to characterize ``Noah's Ark''? Picture in your mind a
Disney animated feature from a classic, in the manner of
``Alladin.'' Then imagine a live-action remake of that cartoon, and
you've got the flippant and twice-removed tone of ``Noah's Ark,''
which airs Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. Because it has an epic theme
and one of those international casts that help in the European
marketing, NBC is hawking the two-parter as this season's
``Merlin'' or ``Gulliver's Travels,'' two successful Halmi
projects. But ``Noah's Ark'' doesn't come close to those movies,
either as TV-sized history or visual accomplishment. As it turns
the end of the world into a whimper, it even fails to exploit the
potential for eye-popping stylizations in the animals who arrive to
be saved. As they march two by two onto the wooden vessel, the
elephants and monkeys and mice are characterless beings who remain
mostly invisible during the voyage to salvation. There's no ``Dr.
Dolittle'' playfulness, and only a dash of National Geographic-like
awe. Other effects opportunities are also botched, including an ark
that's as impressive as a giant log and a sea of volcanic lava that
evokes electrified tomato soup.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Voight is the man of the four hours, a sullen Noah with long
gold-gray locks. He's the least annoying presence in the cast,
although he is required to veer awkwardly from mensch to
self-righteous whiner, and in one scene he does a cute Tevye-like
dance that may send you searching for your Dramamine. In the
movie's silly interpretation of the Bible, Voight's Noah has chats
with the displeased Lord about the decadent people of Sodom and
Gomorrah, who have orgies of sex and liquor. The big guy is given
voice by Voight himself, with ``Do not arouse the wrath of the
great and powerful Oz'' intonations and frivolous comments like ``I
would like a second opinion but who could I ask?'' God tells Noah
about the forthcoming apocalypse, and soon Noah and his family, as
well as Lot and his wife, are fleeing the doomed Sodom with orders
not to look back. Lot's wife is played as a shrew by Carol Kane,
and when she turns into a pillar of salt, and Lot breaks off a
finger, you may find yourself thinking about potato chips. Kane is
supposed to be humorously primitive, but she's only grating. She's
one of the three cameo actors _ along with Abraham and James Coburn
_ who fail to charm in their scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Steenburgen is an odd choice for Namaah, Noah's wife. It's
not just that she can't shake the 20th-century affect, since this
adaptation aims for a contemporary feel. She's just too anxious to
be an Earth Mother, too fiesty to be the docile little woman, too
intelligent to be bonking people over the head with frying pans in
moments of tired slapstick. The timing of her delivery is off,
particularly in part one, and when she goes mad during the ark's
``Waterworld''-ish voyage in part two, you may wonder if she's
joking. The three dashing British actors who play Noah and Namaah's
sons are also out of place. These fellows belong in tights in
Sherwood Forest, and not in a story about the failings of mankind.
Their love games with the three young women on the boat are
tedious, as they try to steal kisses behind the watchful eye of
Noah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noah's Ark'' might have been more fun if it's mistakes had
been even bigger, if garish casting errors had been made and
irreverent jokes had been lobbed. Too bad no one put Mel Brooks at
the helm.

THE FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY HERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Among the raft of technology-oriented books that
have floated by in recent weeks, two have particularly intrigued
us.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most fascinating is Neil Gershenfeld's ``When Things
Start to Think'' (213 pages, Henry Holt; $25).
</P>
<P>
   Gershenfeld, who co-directs the Things That Think research group
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab, among
other duties at the Cambridge campus, has written a highly readable
overview of the way computers are penetrating areas you might never
imagine, from clothing to paper, earrings to shoe heels, and
kitchen appliances to cello bows.
</P>
<P>
   The results are going to be transformative _ and fairly soon, he
said. Now, Gershenfeld's not the only one to say some of this
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, Paul Saffo of the Institute for the
Future predicted in a Los Angeles appearance that the dominant
technology trend of the next 20 years will be hanging sensors _
that have the ability to see, hear, smell, touch, even taste
surroundings _ on computers.
</P>
<P>
   That will rapidly expand the machines' ability to learn, react
and develop, and to interact with humans more intelligently, Saffo
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that vision doesn't go far enough, Gershenfeld said,
proceeding to eloquently argue his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've been doing my whole life is looking at bits
and atoms and how they relate to each other. Sensors are an
important piece of the story, but the bigger story is the merging
of bits and atoms,'' Gershenfeld said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world becomes an interface,'' Gershenfeld said. ``If the
world does become your interface, then computers know what you're
doing. They can sense objects in their environment. That's a piece
of the puzzle. The next step is (when) components know each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where efforts such as Sun Microsystems' Jini language,
which is designed to let ``information appliances'' of all sorts _
from smart refrigerators that know when you're out of milk to a
room that knows to turn on the music, turn up the heat and turn on
the lights when you enter _ can talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Gershenfeld's notion of the personal
fabricator, essentially the three-dimensional version of a fax
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Need a new coffee cup? Download the specifications from some
online center (probably for a nominal charge) into your home p.fab.
It'll cut and aggregate materials to make the cup right there in
your utility room.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just simple stuff coming out of the p.fab. The
electronics for many kinds of devices could essentially be printed
onto the materials by the fabricator, using some of the techniques
just now being developed at MIT and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're printing not just the structure but function,''
Gershenfeld said. ``There'll be a world of clock-radio designers.
You can design your own _ upload it on the Net for other people to
use if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes wrought by thinking things will be gradual but are
already happening in some areas, such as with safety products and
toys.
</P>
<P>
   One great example is Lego's MindStorms, which meld the company's
mainstay, interchangeable building blocks with simple but
programmable computers. MIT's Media Lab helped develop the toys,
which were a big hit after their introduction last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Gershenfeld said the product is remarkable because it lets
children build functions into their toys.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what also has happened is that the MindStorms have
become a big hit with adults, who are using them to create a wide
range of simple devices. The only knock (aside from their somewhat
steep price) is the desire for more possibilities, users have said.
The company has begun rolling out add-on modules with new
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But while only a few thinking things are showing up in the
market, Gershenfeld said his is ``not a book about the distant
future. So much of this is already working in the laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   And as technology melds separate kinds of boxes into one big
digital manipulator, much more is possible _ and by many more
people who no longer have to serve a long apprenticeship learning
to create amazing art, music and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, it's exciting,'' Gershenfeld said. ``If one
thing can be your PC, a Strad (Stradivarius violin) and TV at the
same time, you can reduce the barriers to personal expression.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Gershenfeld's most refreshing aspects, however, is his
insistence that any new technology be at least as convenient,
useful and powerful as whatever it is replacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising that it needs to be stated,'' Gershenfeld said
of that maxim, repeated throughout his book. ``It seems to be such
a simple thing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's say it again, via one specific example that
Gershenfeld uses early in his book to make a very good point.
</P>
<P>
   Paper remains a remarkably efficient, cheap, high-resolution way
to transmit huge amounts of information conveniently. Even the best
computer screens remain rotten at it. When the electronic paper
Gershenfeld talks about in his book becomes widely available, then
we'll have something.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick overview of what Gershenfeld is up to, he suggests
checking out a couple of related Web sites:
www.media.mit.edu/physics for general information about his
department and links to the Media Lab and other projects, and
!www.media.mit.edu./ttt for the Things That Think consortium. &QL;

 &QL; 
NOTHING BUT HITS: Another good read comes from Michael J. Wolf, who
heads the 200-person entertainment and media practice at New
York-based management consultant Booz-Allen and Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's ``The Entertainment Economy'' (296 pages, Times Books;
$25) has a simple but arresting thesis, particularly if, like many
Angelenos, you already live off the hometown entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that entertainment has become a driving force
throughout the rest of the economy,'' Wolf said in a recent
interview. ``It's having a huge impact on how we do everything. The
rest of the world increasingly looks to Hollywood not only for its
stories but for the marketing techniques. And when those techniques
are applied to other areas, they become even more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   ``People's lives have changed,'' Wolf said. ``They don't have as
much time and want to have a good time. It's become this
generation's entitlement. Most people already have the stuff they
need. We're becoming a world of fun-focused consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just in the United States, Wolf said. Even in extremely
poor countries such as China, ``entertainment is viewed as a
necessity. You can find families that earn $2,000 a year but have a
VCR and buy a couple of videos a year.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's happened, Wolf said, is the seeping into the broader
economy of the entertainment industry's approach to creating
successful products. Hit brands and the canny marketing that helps
create those hits are the way companies make money these days, Wolf
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is moving into this hits-and-flops culture,'' Wolf
said.
</P>
<P>
   As examples, he points to the unheard-of $175 million marketing
budget Gillette used in 1990 when it debuted its Sensor razor.
Within two years of its launch, that one brand controlled a
whopping 18 percent of the razor market, and more than $1.2 billion
of the razors were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Then as that hit's sales power waned, Gillette came out last
year with its Mach3 successor, burnishing the three-blade razor's
image to a high-tech sheen with a gargantuan $300 million marketing
budget that helped push the company's market share and stock price
to all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment itself has become the way to revive fading
downtowns around the country, including in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf points to the beneficial impact of a Magic Johnson Theatres
complex on its Baldwin Hills neighborhood. Other areas such as
Pasadena's Old Town, Long Beach's Pine Street and Santa Monica's
Third Street Promenade have flowered as well in recent years with
the addition of theater complexes and entertainment-minded retail
shopping areas.
</P>
<P>
   And the lessons of the entertainment economy will directly
impact where the Internet goes as well, Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you provide engaging content, people aren't going to
come,'' Wolf said. ``TV has set a high expectation for the
Internet. People are going on the Internet expecting to have an
engaging entertainment experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That means anybody who goes on the Internet becomes the
equivalent of a network television programmer, (not a computer
programmer), Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Pepsi.com site,'' Wolf said. ``The one thing you
can't get there is a Pepsi. Pepsi becomes an entertainment
programmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller retailers are going to have to create more entertaining
ways to shop if they want to survive in an era where Net-connected
consumers can shop the world for the best price on many products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an e-mail from a guy who has done entertainment stuff in
his furniture business to attract customers,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Another correspondent runs a women-oriented bookstore that
regularly organizes events there that might appeal to its
customers. Those retailers have a chance to do well in the new era,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is sanguine about the future of Los Angeles, where he
spends much time, as the dominant entertainment capital of the
world, even as that business reaches into more of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where technology becomes an equalizer, the creative
element becomes even more important,'' Wolf said. ``Talent becomes
the important differentiator. That's important for people in Los
Angeles.'' &QL;

Slobodan Milosevic and winning the release of three U.S. POWs
captured a month ago. Meanwhile, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin
was in Belgrade Friday as well and immediately went into a meeting

educators say adding police officers to schools does not guarantee
safe buildings. ``We need to shy away from making our schools look

<P>
   Having spent Easter in northern Italy with the sound of NATO
bombers screaming overhead, I travelled back to Sweden through
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   There, a number of retired generals were speaking out. One of
them, Gerd Schmueckle, was wounded six times on the Russian front
during World War II, but then served in the highest positions
inside NATO. And he warned of a new fascination with war. Perhaps,
he said, it is a question of generations. When the war veterans are
losing their hair and teeth, and disappearing into homes for the
elderly, the new generation suddenly has a different attitude
toward war.
</P>
<P>
   For Schmueckle, war was associated with horror beyond
imagination, leaving deep psychological scars on individuals and
nations. Bombs, he said, do not create peace; instead, they breed
hatred for years, perhaps for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Younger politicians believe that they can fight new types of
wars. And these new wars are becoming increasingly popular. Indeed,
they are now conducted a couple of times a year. They are supposed
to be clean wars: high-rhetoric, high-altitude and high-technology
wars; smart bombs for smart politicians. The ``third way'' in war.
</P>
<P>
   These smart wars can be used to beef up diplomacy when it runs
into problems which seem too complicated. But they can also be used
to replace diplomacy entirely and just express the outrage that we
feel over evil regimes doing evil things.
</P>
<P>
   It's evil, isn't it? No one can really defend the outrageous
acts of a Saddam Hussein or a Slobodan Milosevic. Well then, it
can't be wrong to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   So in the West, we are in the strange situation that instead of
cashing in our peace dividend, we are on the verge of running out
of cruise missiles, or at least the air-launched version. The smart
wars are beginning to take their toll on war stock.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these smart wars conducted from the air is that
they are often difficult to relate to political objectives, and so
far have not proved a great success in achieving those objectives.
In Baghdad, there are no longer any U.N. inspectors to look for
weapons of mass destruction, but Saddam Hussein is still there.
Wasn't it supposed to be the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the aim of the smart war was to keep the Albanians in
Kosovo and get rid of Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. So far, it
has turned out to be the other way around. The air war against
Yugoslavia has not prevented a humanitarian catastrophe; rather, it
has become associated with one.
</P>
<P>
   The air war against Serbia will not only be a war over the
future of Kosovo, but also a war over the future of smart wars and
the use of air power in isolation. If Milosevic throws in the towel
and agres to all the NATO demands, smart wars will be here to
stay, to be used whenever diplomacy runs into too many
complications.
</P>
<P>
   But if the air war turns out to be a prolonged phase of wanton
destruction and humanitarian disaster preceding a reluctant
decision by NATO to mount a ground offensive against Kosovo (and
take responsibility for a long-term occupation of part of the
Balkans), the future of smart wars will be very different.
</P>
<P>
   We are now seeing the refighting of the war of words over the
use of air power in the Bosnian conflict. In that war, Washington
was always arguing that a few volleys of cruise missiles and
strategic strikes would sort out the problem, while others argued
that this would only aggravate the situation on the ground and
worsen the plight of exposed civilians and U.N. peace-keeping
troops.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the emotional debate about the responsibility
for the massacre of Muslims after the fall of the U.N.-declared
safe area of Srebrenica in July 1995 turned on whether it was NATO
or the United Nations which had prevented air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   This presumes that air strikes could have stopped the Serb
soldiers marching in. In Kosovo, massive NATO air strikes have
clearly done nothing to prevent or limit the Serb onslaught on the
Kosovo Albanians. It certainly felt nice to see the good missiles
heading for their evil targets. But one day we may discover that
the massacres in Kosovo during the days and nights when NATO was
striking from the sky were even worse than the terrible war crimes
in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   We must learn again the lessons of war and power; we must
painfully start to reread the classics such as Clausewitz and all
those who learned about war and power the hard way. Perhaps there
are no smart wars, even in our smart age.

<P>
   Since the alternative is too horrible to contemplate, let us
assume that before long NATO succeeds in imposing its will on
President Milosevic, with or without the use of ground troops, and
that a kind of peace has descended on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to remember is that it is not only Kosovars who
have suffered as a result of Milosevic's murderous drive for a
Greater Serbia. As a consequence of his policies, hundreds of
thousands of Serbs have also been expelled from lands which their
forefathers have occupied for centuries in Croatia, Bosnia and no
doubt now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these people will conclude, as the Germans did 50 years
ago, that they must pay the price for following a deluded leader,
and learn to live within diminished boundaries. But it is more
likely that they will conclude that once again they have been the
victims of a historic injustice, and that they will brood in
bitterness, waiting to launch yet another futile attempt to reverse
the verdict of history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for the future tranquillity of the Balkans, the Serbs
will have to be brought back into the international community as
equal members.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the consequences go much wider than the Balkans
alone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, NATO will be profoundly affected even in victory.
There were two main arguments about NATO enlargement. One argument
was that NATO would remain a purely defensive alliance, and that
those who remained outside had nothing to fear. The other was that
NATO would now acquire a new role: to promote human rights,
democracy, good government and market economics inside Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear how a military organization could promote
civilian objectives. But the ultimatum which NATO delivered to
Serbia _ and the war which has followed it _ means that it can no
longer be portrayed as a purely defensive alliance. And many are
wondering where it will stop.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could gain or lose. Before the crisis, most Russians were
as ignorant of what was happening in Kosovo as most Westerners. If
Prime Minister Primakov's bid to act as a broker in the peacemaking
succeeds, he will boost the prestige of Russia as well as of
himself. But many in the West regard Russia as an irritating
irrelevance. Relations between Russia and the West could spiral
downward.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members have been surprisingly united in support of
military action. Milosevic's policies left them no decent choice.
But NATO has turned out to be a very blunt instrument. Even if a
halfway decent settlement is now cobbled together for Kosovo, it
will be more difficult to get people to support a repetition of the
trick in another European crisis. And America is now likely to find
it harder to get European support for the idea that NATO should
extend itself beyond this continent, to help maintain the peace
wherever it is threatened, and punish villains wherever they are
found.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the biggest question of all: the nature and the
future of U.S. global power. Americans believe that they have a
duty to slay dragons. But the record _ in Vietnam, in Iraq, in
Iran, in Somalia, even in neighboring Cuba _ demonstrates that
there are severe practical limitations even to the most awesome
military power, especially when it is exercised in the belief that
technology can substitute for body bags.
</P>
<P>
   All our relationships are likely to be more edgy as a result of
what has happened. NATO's identity crisis and trans-Atlantic
recrimination are likely to intensify, even as the Europeans wonder
whether they will ever be able to organize a peaceful continent
without external assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as India or China, which do not share the U.S.
view of its own role, will become more inclined to join in
resisting U.S. demands. Sooner or later America too will have to
adapt to an imperfect world. But there is a danger of going too
far, and retreating into sullen isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glum prospect. Because there are no simple, cheap or
satisfying solutions, we will have to go for complex and boring
ones.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should abandon its wilder pretensions to set the rest of
the world on a right moral course. It should concentrate instead on
its basic function as a defensive alliance and expand its network
of partnerships with non-members. In Europe, the main, and most
successful body for the promotion of peace, prosperity and
democratic rights in Europe, is not NATO but the European Union. It
should give practical aid and political support to the countries
most immediately affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
includes Russia, should become the main pan-European agency for the
resolution of political disputes between its members.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the much despised United Nations. Of course
the U.N. cannot solve all, perhaps not even many, of the world's
problems. Of course it provides no basis for starry-eyed optimism
about universal peace and world government. But despite its
numerous failures, it is the only comprehensive, law-based body
which exists for the purpose of settling political disputes among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of
the 1990s, while the Permanent Members of the Security Council
still took one another seriously, it functioned as its founders had
intended. The theory which has recently gained currency _ that if
the United Nations cannot agree then the United States and its
allies have the right and the duty to take action on their own _ is
arrogant, subversive of the rule of law, and unattractive to a lot
of people.
</P>
<P>
   However inconvenient, it is time for the Western powers to try
once more to make the United Nations work.

adapt to an imperfect world. But there is a danger of going too
far, and retreating into sullen isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a glum prospect. Because there are no simple, cheap or
satisfying solutions, we will have to go for complex and boring
ones.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should abandon its wilder pretensions to set the rest of
the world on a right moral course. It should concentrate instead on
its basic function as a defensive alliance and expand its network
of partnerships with non-members. In Europe, the main, and most
successful body for the promotion of peace, prosperity and
democratic rights in Europe, is not NATO but the European Union. It
should give practical aid and political support to the countries
most immediately affected by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
includes Russia, should become the main pan-European agency for the
resolution of political disputes between its members.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the much despised United Nations. Of course
the U.N. cannot solve all, perhaps not even many, of the world's
problems. Of course it provides no basis for starry-eyed optimism
about universal peace and world government. But despite its
numerous failures, it is the only comprehensive, law-based body
which exists for the purpose of settling political disputes among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of
the 1990s, while the Permanent Members of the Security Council
still took one another seriously, it functioned as its founders had
intended. The theory which has recently gained currency _ that if
the United Nations cannot agree then the United States and its
allies have the right and the duty to take action on their own _ is
arrogant, subversive of the rule of law, and unattractive to a lot
of people.
</P>
<P>
   However inconvenient, it is time for the Western powers to try
once more to make the United Nations work.

KEEPING TALENT IS BOTTOM LINE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, companies became more defensive about losing
their star employees to competitors and began offering them bonuses
if they'd just stay.
</P>
<P>
   Energy companies, desperate to keep their sought-after
geologists and geophysicists, were forking over as much as $50,000
if the technical wizards would only sign a two- or three-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, retention bonuses have become more commonplace _ and
more sophisticated. Sought-after job applicants, who automatically
ask if the job comes with a signing bonus, are now inquiring if the
job comes with a retention bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The ``pay to stay'' bonuses also are popping up when two
companies merge. The buyer, eager to ensure the transition will go
smoothly, often will give choice employees a bonus if they agree to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Savitsky, senior consultant in strategic rewards for
Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Dallas, said she has seen staying bonuses
as high as 50 percent of salary but they are more typically 10 to
20 percent of base pay.
</P>
<P>
   When a company is sold, employees naturally focus on finding
another job, she said. A stay bonus helps to counterbalance that
tendency.
</P>
<P>
   Stay bonuses also have become a condition of employment that can
resemble indentured servitude, however well-paid.
</P>
<P>
   One large Houston employer saw several of its key executives
quit to go to work for competitors, so the company ``offered'' its
senior executives a three-year contract with an iron-clad
noncompete agreement, said Stephen Newton, managing director of
Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive recruiting firm in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A year before it's set to expire, an executive is asked to sign
another. If an executive refuses, it shows his hand that he plans
to leave the fold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PAYING FOR COMPLETION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies also are offering stay bonuses to
employees who can complete a critical project _ often
computer-related _ by a particular deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Savitsky said she is working with a West Coast company that was
struggling with keeping motivated software developers long enough
to work out the bugs in their computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   The company offered the software developers between $20,000 and
$30,000 each if they completed the project in four months. So they
locked themselves in a room and they got the job done, Savitsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a company pays a stay bonus based on the culture it
promotes, and for the high-tech industry, that's a culture of fun.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the spirit, one software company sent its three
top developers, who worked around the clock debugging a major
project, to Tahiti for two weeks, Savitsky said. They didn't go
together, however. They were sick of each other. But the bonus did
keep them on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the stay bonuses can backfire if other employees get
jealous. In the high-tech industry, it's part of the culture for
people to talk about the perks they get.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's important to communicate what kind of skill the members
brought to the table and what they earned for the organization,
Savitsky said. It helped that the CEO who gave out the cash bonuses
for completing the project on time also gave everyone an extra day
off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SMALL CHANGE DOESN'T RATE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schaeffer, vice president of human resources for Apache
Corp. in Houston, said stay bonuses that focus on the completion of
a specific task work the best if the project has a beginning and an
end and is outside an employee's regular job responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The money also has to be sizable enough to retain a key employee
_ it takes about $5,000 to have much of an impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Metamor Worldwide, the information technology consulting firm,
doesn't put much stock in retention bonuses. It pays them to the
employees of the firms it buys because it wants to retain that
intellectual capital _ but as a regular part of the business, it
says they're not that important.
</P>
<P>
   While compensation is important, it's more important for
employees to work on challenging projects, get plenty of training,
work with good managers and work with the latest technology in a
fun environment.
</P>
<P>
   Metamor, for example, has Foosball tables in the offices, said
Ken Johnsen, president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is what has kept turnover down to 15 percent a
year when the industry average is more like 25 percent, he said,
noting that Metamor employees are not mercenaries going from job to
job in search of higher wages.

HEALTHY ECONOMY CREDITED FOR CALIFORNIA TAX WINDFALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Higher salaries, bonuses and huge stock
market earnings for some Californians will pump an extra $3 billion
in taxes into the state treasury, prompting lawmakers to salivate
over how to spend the windfall.
</P>
<P>
   California received $53 million in checks from taxpayers on
Thursday alone. So much money is flowing into the coffers that
budget writers already have counted an unexpected $1.6 billion for
the month of April, the main tax-paying month. An extra $300
million came in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``They assumed there would an economic slowdown,'' said Sandy
Harrison, spokesman for the Department of Finance, ``and in this
case, exactly the opposite happened. The economy continued to
expand.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid this news, the state Senate approved Thursday the first
draft of the $78.8 billion budget for 1999-2000 _ a record in size
and timing. It has been 13 years since the Legislature sent the
governor a budget by the June 15 deadline, and Gov. Gray Davis has
been leaning on lawmakers to hurry the process.
</P>
<P>
   The document faces significant revisions in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   The budget story has been the same for the past few years, with
lawmakers being surprised each spring with huge windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The first major tax influx after the early 1990s recession was
spent by Davis' predecessor, Pete Wilson, and the Legislature on
reducing the number of students in elementary school classes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Legislature cut car registration fees last year,
some Republican lawmakers are looking at $1.7 billion in additional
tax cuts, lower college fees, sending money back to local
governments and shifting a major portion of the gasoline tax toward
fixing roads.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is one of the only places where Republicans have
leverage in the Legislature because it takes a two-thirds vote to
approve the document. Democrats have a majority in both houses, but
not enough votes to pass the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly and Senate Democrats and Davis are urging caution when
it comes to drastic tax cuts, however. The governor, a Democrat,
has already said that his Republican predecessor and the previous
Legislature spent too much money.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bustamante, a spokesman for Davis, said increasing the
amount of money in reserve, more dollars for education and a pay
raise for state employees are the administration's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a guy who is going to be far more prudent
in the way he spends taxpayer dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While some lawmakers think the estimated $3 billion windfall is
inflated, they contend most of the money may already be eaten up
because Davis' first budget draft in January vastly underestimated
some expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature found out, for example, that California schools
enrolled 60,000 more students than expected, which will cost the
state an extra $277 million.
</P>
<P>
   Others want to boost funding for Medi-Cal and other health
insurance programs for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President pro tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, told
lawmakers Thursday that it was ``better to invest in infrastructure
than a piddling tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting to see when the dust clears how much of that
money is spoken for,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, ``and I
certainly want to squash discussions of an additional tax break.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican senators released a plan Thursday that would,
among other things, spend $500 million to again cut
car-registration fees. Car taxes were cut 25 percent this year, but
the next reduction, of 12.5 percent, isn't projected to happen
until 2001. The GOP wants the cut now.

NOTEBOOK DESIGNERS DECIDING SMALLER IS BETTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notebook computers have long been trying to attain the power and
capabilities of desktop systems. Only recently, though, have
portables finally been muscular enough to be considered as desktop
replacements.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interesting development, notebook design is beginning
to have a greater effect on desktops. Since space is at a premium
in many homes and workplaces, a smaller desktop system has appeal
for many people.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at a desktop system that closely resembles a
portable PC, and an excellent portable that could easily replace
many home desktops.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sony Vaio Slimtop, $3,000, Sony Electronics. In the summer of
1996, Compaq Computer Corp. introduced a startling new design that
featured a 12-inch flat-panel screen attached to an undersized PC
case. It included some impressive features _ including a multidisk
CD changer and a wireless mouse _ and an equally impressive price
tag. With its 166-megahertz Pentium chip and 16 megabytes of
memory, it sold for a hefty $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its groundbreaking design, it was way overpriced and
didn't take off. The model was discontinued the next year, and of
course became a hot seller after Compaq lowered the price in a
clear-'em-out sale.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the Presario 3000 lives on in the Sony Vaio
Slimtop, a desktop system that borrows heavily from notebook
computer design. Unfortunately, like the Compaq model, this one
also costs too much. But it's cool, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   The case for the Slimtop looks like a closed, full-sized
notebook computer. You can either stand it on its side, or lay it
flat on a desk. The system comes with a separate 14.1-inch
active-matrix display, with small speakers mounted on each side.
</P>
<P>
   The design is full of intriguing touches. For example, the
keyboard's wrist rest turns into a keyboard cover.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the PCV-L600, which comes with a 500-megahertz Pentium
III chip, 128 megabytes of memory, a 10.8-gigabyte hard drive, a
24X CD-ROM drive and an ATI Technologies Rage Pro video card with
four megabytes of video memory.
</P>
<P>
   It also uses Sony's new Memory Sticks, which are small plastic
sticks that contain extra memory. Slide one into a slot near the
floppy drive, and you can use it for storing small files.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the case's small size, the Slimtop is expandable. It has
a PC-card slot, for the credit-card-sized devices usually
associated with notebook computers, and an internal PCI slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Slimtop was not the fastest Pentium III system I've used. In
fact, it underperformed most 450-megahertz Pentium II systems.
</P>
<P>
   The display is probably the most impressive aspect of this
computer. It was bright, sharp and comfortable to look at for long
periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   This would be an excellent system for someone with a lot of
money and not much desk space. But given that you can get a more
muscular desktop system for two-thirds the price, the design's
``wow'' factor just doesn't cut it. A better deal may be the
PCV-L400, which comes with a 400-megahertz Pentium II chip, a
smaller hard drive and 64 megabytes of memory, for $2,300.
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario 1900, $2,800, Compaq Computer Corp. You almost didn't
get a chance to buy the Presario 1900 notebook computer. It
originally was under development by Digital Equipment Corp.'s
notebook team, and when Compaq acquired Digital, the group that
makes Compaq's business portable line, the Armada, wasn't
interested in it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the consumer group knew a good thing when it saw it
and staked a claim. That's good, because this is the best notebook
Compaq currently offers, in either its business or consumer lines.
</P>
<P>
   The 1900 is sold via Compaq's Web site, as a configure-to-order
system. I tried a model with a 333-megahertz Pentium II chip, 64
megabytes of memory, a four-gigabyte hard drive, a 13.3-inch
active-matrix display, a 2X DVD-ROM drive, a built-in 56K fax
modem, a NeoMagic 256-bit graphics card with only 2.5 megabytes of
video memory, the usual complement of ports and slots and a
portable version of Compaq's Internet keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The 1900's case is rugged and very versatile. The solid case
feels like it could take a beating. The DVD and floppy drives are
in a wedge that snaps onto the bottom of the computer. Remove them,
and it goes from being a full-function multimedia system to a thin,
light road warrior's machine that's about five pounds and just 1.2
inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   The full-sized keyboard has an excellent feel to it and is well
laid out. The responsive touchpad includes a rocker button that
lets you scroll vertically in most programs, an excellent feature
for browsing through deep Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   This is a speedy computer _ it handled everything I threw at it.
The display was bright and easy to see, even in low-power mode.

   I've got only two complaints about the Presario 1900. Given that
it's a machine aimed at consumers, including home users, it should
have had a joystick port, an omission I suspect stems from its
origins as a business portable at Digital. Also, since it comes
with DVD, it should have a TV-out feature so you can plug it into a
television set to watch movies.

`GHOST DRIVERS' ON WINDOWS 98 SHOULD BE DELETED IN SAFE MODE 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q: I have discovered another problem with duplicated file names
in W98 _ ``ghost drivers'' in the Device Manager. It seems that
multiple operating system installs create one or more duplicate
devices in Device Manager that can only be viewed in Safe Mode.
Usually this only creates problems during shutdown, especially on
Compaq Presarios. Whenever PCs exhibit shutdown problems or
unexplained illegal operations or page faults, I bring up the
system in Safe Mode and check Device Manager for duplicated
devices. If they exist, I delete the second one. Shutdown problems
or unexplained system errors usually disappear afterward. I do not
know why or how these ``ghost devices'' get installed, but they do
create operational problems.
</P>
<P>
   A: I checked in with Microsoft's technical support, which
confirmed what you're saying. But don't be so fast in deleting just
one of those entries _ you don't know which is the real one, and
which is the ``ghost.''
</P>
<P>
   The technician I spoke with said it's best to remove both of
them while in Safe Mode. Then, when you reboot into Windows' normal
mode, the operating system should re-recognize the drive and
install the right driver.
</P>
<P>
   If you remove just one, and it's the wrong one, then Windows
might add another duplicate. Often, the ghost driver is a
historical artifact, an old entry without a driver to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   Why it shows up in Safe Mode, though, remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The technician said the problem is not confined to Presarios _
Microsoft has seen this issue on different kinds of machines.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, to get into Safe Mode, hold down the CONTROL key
after the computer does its test of the memory and various drives,
and before the operating system starts. You'll get a menu that lets
you choose Safe Mode as one of the options.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there log files on Windows 98 that show what files have
been used and when? Are there the same kind of files for Web
browsing? I know about the history area in the various browsers,
but are there files as well on the hard drives that contain Web
browsing info? I've had someone snooping recently on my computer
and I want to know how to delete these files if they exist.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are files that show which files have been used on a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you look in the Windowsapplog folder, you'll find a series of
files that have the names of your applications. As you use the
applications, the contents of these are updated. They are used by
the Windows 98 disk defragmentation application, which puts the
most-used programs on the fastest part of the disk. The defragger
uses these files to determine which programs get the most use.
</P>
<P>
   The History entries found in both Netscape Communicator and
Internet Explorer appear to be the only places where Web browsing
is tracked. The latest versions of these programs _ 4.51 for
Communicator and 5.0 of Internet Explorer _ both allow you to
easily clear your entries. Look in the settings or preferences
menus in these browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, TweakUI, the configuration applet that is found on the
Windows 98 CD, includes a tab called ``Paranoid'' that lets you
erase your history and other ``tracks'' you may have left.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, be aware that the folder called Temporary Internet
Files includes HTML pages and graphics from the pages you've viewed
online using Internet Explorer. If you use Communicator, look in
the Communicator folders on your hard drive for a subfolder called
Cache for these stored files.
</P>
<P>
   They are there to speed up your Web access, so your browser
doesn't have to download graphics and pages that have not changed
since you last looked at them.
</P>
<P>
   Again, these can be deleted.
</P>

SPLITTING HEIRS OVER TEXAS BARBECUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCKHART, Texas _ To call Edgar Schmidt a latter-day King Lear
might seem ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   He was, after all, the owner of a barbecue joint, a hard-working
sort known around this plain-spoken town as ``Smitty.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again we're talking about barbecue, more specifically
Central Texas barbecue, arguably the best barbecue in the state,
which to most around these parts means the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting atop this pyramid of superlatives is the century-old
Kreuz Market, a barbecue landmark that Schmidt bought in 1948 with
the blessing of the Kreuzes themselves and ran for nearly four
decades before selling the business to his sons, Rick and Don.
</P>
<P>
   But like Shakespeare's Lear, Schmidt divvied up his kingdom.
While the business went to his sons, he left the venerable red
brick building and downtown property to his daughter, Nina Sells.
The seeds of a Shakespearean tragedy, Texas-style, were sown.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Rick Schmidt will move Kreuz Market about a
half-mile north on State Highway 183 to a soon-to-be-constructed
building of brick, metal and wood on a patch of farm land. His
sister gave him no choice, he said, offering him a five-year lease
instead of the 20-year deal he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants this place for herself,'' said Schmidt, whose
brother Don is now retired from the family business. ``I offered to
rent it, to buy it, to make improvements on it. She said, `I ain't
interested in you long term and I'm not gonna sell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sells describes the fallout in different terms. The building
needed repairs to meet code, she said, but her brother (she calls
him Mr. Schmidt) wanted to expand the dining room instead. Then
last year, Sells said, Schmidt delivered an abrupt
``sell-or-I-leave'' ultimatum through the Austin
American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were problems I thought we needed to work out before we
extended the lease,'' said Sells, who is the Caldwell County clerk.
``He went to the press thinking public opinion might force me to
sell the building to him, but I decided to stick it out.''
</P>
<P>
   With Kreuz (pronounced Krites) &UR;  &LR; Market relocating, Sells plans
to open a barbecue joint called Smitty's in its place, a tribute to
her father. But to patrons of Kreuz Market this is no solution at
all, because at Kreuz everything is the way it was, and that's the
way folks like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow it's not gonna be right,'' said a somber Jim McGill,
working on a piece of sausage, a hot link, or just plain ``hot,''
in Kreuz vernacular. Kreuz Market makes 3,100 sausage rings every
day, cools them overnight, then reheats them over the pits before
serving them the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At Kreuz Market, tradition matters. Patrons come, as many as
2,500 on Saturdays alone, to devour beef shoulder, chops, prime rib
and sausage. Entering from the gravel parking lot at the rear,
folks are met by an open fire of post oak logs and smoke-tarnished
walls.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plates, just butcher paper, no forks and no side
dishes, save whole tomatoes, avocados and the like. Folks come for
the meat. Which is why there is no sauce, either.
</P>
<P>
   They get crackers or bread, a choice to be made after a 16-year
veteran named Ella weighs their barbecue and slaps it on two sheets
of paper. The purists take crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Patrons eat in a long, smoke-stained hallway, an adjacent dining
room and another upstairs, all of which featured cabbage knives
tethered to the tables until just recently. (Now Kreuz Market
grudgingly supplies plastic knives.)
</P>
<P>
   So revered is the restaurant, and so honored the dining ritual,
that the place is often invoked in spiritual terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas is the holy land of barbecue,'' said the
American-Statesman, in a lengthy tribute last summer, ``then the
Kreuz Market is its most hallowed shrine, beef shoulder its blessed
sacrament.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuz Market dates back to Aug. 20, 1900, when a son of German
immigrants named Charles Kreuz bought property on the Lockhart town
square. Seven months later, Kreuz Market opened its doors, selling
meats and cooking what was left over on the pits out back.
</P>
<P>
   Today Kreuz still features a meat market, but barbecue is what
people come for, thinking nothing of a 60-mile round trip for lunch
from Austin or its surrounding communities. Some come from out of
state to sample the glistening barbecue, still others from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have not had the chance to experience this have
missed a better part of living,'' said John Reagan, as he carved up
a pork chop and drank a Shiner Bock, the preferred beer at Kreuz.
Big Red _ in a bottle _ is the even more popular nonalcoholic
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes down good with sausage,'' said Sam Samarippa, savoring
the red cream soda. ``That's the way I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few really understand the family dynamics that threaten the
rituals of patrons like Samarippa. Was Rick Schmidt simply sore
that his sister inherited the building? Did Sells squeeze her
brother out of the property in an attempt to grab his share of the
local market?
</P>
<P>
   ``This might look like our intention,'' said Sells. ``But it
really is the result of Mr. Schmidt's decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A more pertinent question here in the Texas barbecue belt is
whether the Kreuz faithful will forgo the character of 208 S.
Commerce St. for hunks of tender shoulder, or the other way around.
Will they stay true to Rick and his slabs of pork chops or Nina and
the celebrated building?
</P>
<P>
   That may depend on how quickly a brand-spanking-new barbecue
joint can evolve into a hallowed shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just gonna have to do it right,'' said Schmidt. ``We're
just gonna have to do the best we can to keep the feel we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it may depend on whether Sells can cook top-notch barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   She is leaning toward a menu that includes beans and potato
salad, which is almost certain to create a backlash among Kreuz
purists. Even so, the draw of the old building is powerful, and her
joint is likely to challenge her brother's share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Sells enters the highly competitive arena with her husband, Jim,
who has placed first in Lockhart's Chisolm Trail Cookoff the last
two years. Jim Sells and his sons are recent blue-ribbon winners in
contests in Luling and Lubbock, impressive credentials even in
barbecue's Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmidt is unfazed. So confident is he that he is building
the new Kreuz Market with twice the barbecue pits as the old one
and room for 700 patrons. As for tradition, Schmidt is considering
starting the fire in the new joint with embers from the old one,
which is how Kreuz Market starts up the pits every day and manages
to boast an unending fire.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt reckons the walls of his new place will be smoked up in
a matter of weeks, giving the new joint plenty of atmosphere. Even
so, he said, the draw of Kreuz Market has always been the barbecue,
not the building.
</P>
<P>
   Cook it, Schmidt said, and they will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got plenty of competition,'' he said. ``One more without
experience doesn't bother me.''

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The U.S. economy expanded at the
surprisingly strong annual rate of 4.5 percent in the first three
months of the year, the government reported today. While a slowdown
from a torrid 6 percent pace in the fourth-quarter, the
first-quarter gross domestic product was well above what had been

   RUSSIA-INVEST (Tosno, Russia) _ Russia's economic turmoil last
summer confirmed American companies' worst fears about Russia: it
is too unstable to do business there. But a number of Western
multinationals _ Caterpillar, Nestle, Lucent Technologies and
others _ have since decided to go deeper into Russia rather than
pull out. Many have picked areas where the local government
supports business, regardless of broader upheaval in Russia. In St.
Petersburg and the surrounding region, for example, six American

   Patrons eat in a long, smoke-stained hallway, an adjacent dining
room and another upstairs, all of which featured cabbage knives
tethered to the tables until just recently. (Now Kreuz Market
grudgingly supplies plastic knives.)
</P>
<P>
   So revered is the restaurant, and so honored the dining ritual,
that the place is often invoked in spiritual terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas is the holy land of barbecue,'' said the
American-Statesman, in a lengthy tribute last summer, ``then the
Kreuz Market is its most hallowed shrine, beef shoulder its blessed
sacrament.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuz Market dates back to Aug. 20, 1900, when a son of German
immigrants named Charles Kreuz bought property on the Lockhart town
square. Seven months later, Kreuz Market opened its doors, selling
meats and cooking what was left over on the pits out back.
</P>
<P>
   Today Kreuz still features a meat market, but barbecue is what
people come for, thinking nothing of a 60-mile round trip for lunch
from Austin or its surrounding communities. Some come from out of
state to sample the glistening barbecue, still others from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have not had the chance to experience this have
missed a better part of living,'' said John Reagan, as he carved up
a pork chop and drank a Shiner Bock, the preferred beer at Kreuz.
Big Red _ in a bottle _ is the even more popular nonalcoholic
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes down good with sausage,'' said Sam Samarippa, savoring
the red cream soda. ``That's the way I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few really understand the family dynamics that threaten the
rituals of patrons like Samarippa. Was Rick Schmidt simply sore
that his sister inherited the building? Did Sells squeeze her
brother out of the property in an attempt to grab his share of the
local market?
</P>
<P>
   ``This might look like our intention,'' said Sells. ``But it
really is the result of Mr. Schmidt's decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A more pertinent question here in the Texas barbecue belt is
whether the Kreuz faithful will forgo the character of 208 S.
Commerce St. for hunks of tender shoulder, or the other way around.
Will they stay true to Rick and his slabs of pork chops or Nina and
the celebrated building?
</P>
<P>
   That may depend on how quickly a brand-spanking-new barbecue
joint can evolve into a hallowed shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just gonna have to do it right,'' said Schmidt. ``We're
just gonna have to do the best we can to keep the feel we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it may depend on whether Sells can cook top-notch barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   She is leaning toward a menu that includes beans and potato
salad, which is almost certain to create a backlash among Kreuz
purists. Even so, the draw of the old building is powerful, and her
joint is likely to challenge her brother's share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Sells enters the highly competitive arena with her husband, Jim,
who has placed first in Lockhart's Chisolm Trail Cookoff the last
two years. Jim Sells and his sons are recent blue-ribbon winners in
contests in Luling and Lubbock, impressive credentials even in
barbecue's Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmidt is unfazed. So confident is he that he is building
the new Kreuz Market with twice the barbecue pits as the old one
and room for 700 patrons. As for tradition, Schmidt is considering
starting the fire in the new joint with embers from the old one,
which is how Kreuz Market starts up the pits every day and manages
to boast an unending fire.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt reckons the walls of his new place will be smoked up in
a matter of weeks, giving the new joint plenty of atmosphere. Even
so, he said, the draw of Kreuz Market has always been the barbecue,
not the building.
</P>
<P>
   Cook it, Schmidt said, and they will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got plenty of competition,'' he said. ``One more without
experience doesn't bother me.''

THOSE PESKY BUGS EATING PLANT LEAVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: All of my plants have leaves with holes. Will you tell me
what insect is attacking my crops?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am seeing damage from two pests in our garden _ slugs and
fuzzy caterpillars that are falling from the overhead trees. Both
eat similar holes in leaves. Search carefully among your plants for
the culprit in your garden.
</P>
<P>
   The fuzzy caterpillars have whitish hairs along their sides and
could be one of the tent caterpillars I have a problem with every
spring but not at other times of the year. The various tent
caterpillars only have one generation. Whatever type, the
caterpillars have eaten the edges of coleus and punched holes in
the sweet-potato vine. They don't seem that picky. I usually just
squish them, but you can treat with Bt (``Bacillus thuringiensis'')
if you spot any caterpillar in your garden.
</P>
<P>
   The slugs are often difficult to spot, but they are deep in the
plants or on the backsides of the leaves when at work. Otherwise,
they hide under stones and bricks and beneath pots. I picked up a
potted geranium recently and found many tiny slugs thriving in the
moist dark.
</P>
<P>
   Slugs eat holes right out of the middle of the leaf or eat the
edges. These I hand-harvest as long as that's reasonable, but I
have resorted to DE, diatomaceous earth and even snail and slug
bait when infestation threatens an entire crop. You'll need to
reapply either of these products after a heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will ruellia make a good ground cover? Lamium?
</P>
<P>
   A: `Katie' ruellia is a good ground cover for sun or shade. This
clumping perennial is less than a foot tall, with slender, long,
arching leaves. Root-hardy, it will return after a freeze, but in
mild winters such as this year's, little damage is done to the
foliage.
</P>
<P>
   `Katie' produces petunialike, purple blooms for months. Bloom
time begins sooner, of course, after a mild winter, since plants do
not have to regrow. There is also a pink flowering form.
</P>
<P>
   This easy-to-grow plant spreads and produces numerous offspring
from seed. I simply pick the seedlings if they pop up where I don't
want them.
</P>
<P>
   `Katie' ruellia has a taller cousin commonly called Mexican
petunia. It matures to a height of about 3 feet, and it, too, can
be used as a taller ground cover. It does best in sun. Once dense,
it can be quite attractive, but you will need to corral it or
you'll have a sea of ruellia.
</P>
<P>
   Lamium, or dead nettle, is a perennial ground cover, often with
variegation. Height is a foot or so. Lamium needs shade and a
fertile, moist but well-draining soil. Although it is most
attractive, I have found it less vigorous in our garden, but
perhaps you will have better luck. You could first try it in a
small area container to see how it does in your garden.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a large Arizona ash that is 27 years old and produces
thousands of seeds every year. I have three other Arizona ash trees
that do not produce seeds. Is there anything I can do to stop
production of these seeds?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some ashes are pesky seed producers. The only way I know to
stop seed production is to cut down the tree that is producing the
seed. The nonproducers in your garden could be male trees.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you please give a brief refresher course on African
violets? I'm having trouble getting my plants to bloom.
</P>
<P>
   A: Try the following basics and see if your plants don't
respond.
</P>
<P>
   Light is a prerequisite to year-round African violet blooms. Any
area of your home that receives bright, filtered light will do. An
east window, where the plants will get some morning sun, is ideal.
</P>
<P>
   African violets will grow and bloom under fluorescent lights.
Double-tube fixtures are recommended. The lights should hang 8 to
10 inches above the foliage and be turned on 12 to 14 hours a day.
African violets do prefer dark nights.
</P>
<P>
   Overwatering is a major cause of houseplant death. Use wicking
to avoid this problem. With this system, the soil absorbs water via
a string extended from the hole in the bottom of the pot to a
reservoir of water. It's an especially good watering system to use
if you're going to be away for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Clean the reservoirs with household bleach and water once a
month or when algae begins to form. It's a good idea to replace the
wicks when you repot.
</P>
<P>
   African violets also may be watered from the top, or from the
bottom by adding water to the saucer. Use room-temperature water,
and water when the soil is somewhat dry to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, water from the top to leach built-up salts.
</P>
<P>
   By using a wick and reservoir system, you can water and
fertilize simultaneously. Use a diluted, balanced fertilizer per
instructions on the package. If your plants have adequate light but
aren't flowering, you may need to fertilize more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   A sterilized, lightweight, soilless potting mix will allow
aeration and good drainage and discourage disease. Plastic
containers discourage salt buildup.
</P>
<P>
   If you're comfortable, your African violets will be comfortable,
because these plants like room temperatures. Ideal temperatures
fall in the 65-to 70-degree range at night and 5-10 degrees warmer
during the day. If it gets too warm, your plants will react by
growing spindly, and the few flowers that are produced may drop
before attaining good size. Good air circulation is most important,
as is enough humidity _ within the range of 40 percent to 50
percent.

 &HT;    SERBIAN-AMERICANS FEEL HOMELAND'S PAIN
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 2
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    With photos
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARMA, Ohio _ The morning sun shines on this well-kept Cleveland
suburb and ignites the brilliant color of the stained glass windows
in St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Christ himself in luminous bloom along the southeastern wall
dominates the stout architecture of the Eastern rite church. But
again this Sunday, He fails to brighten a preoccupying somberness
inside.
</P>
<P>
   America is at war with Serbia, which for the people of St. Sava
means their home is at war with their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatches from friends and family living under threat of NATO
air strikes in Yugoslavia spread through the congregation, a
cornerstone of one of the largest Serbian-American colonies in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   And bred within it, by the details about lives and jobs brought
down in Yugoslavia along with the bridges and the buildings, is a
powerful sense of confusion and frustration over what is happening
and how little they seem able to influence it.
</P>
<P>
   Insular and suspicious, they are desperate to be advocates for
peace, but feel hamstrung by the portrait of their nationality as
aggressive, unyielding and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with being a Serb,'' said John Petkovic, an
entertainment columnist for The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, ``is that
every time you say something you're challenged with these
all-or-nothing propositions: `So are you saying you favor ethnic
cleansing?'''
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is no. But the long answer, and it gets very
long as it weaves through centuries of Serbian resistance to a
parade of aggressors, is that ethnic Albanians, Serbians and
Croatians have employed equally menacing tactics in the generations
of feuding that precipitated this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at one point in time and say, `These are the
good guys and these are the bad guys,''' said Alex Rakic, an
attorney. ``We think it's horrible what's going on, but you need to
see the whole story. We just feel like Serbia's been picked as the
loser in the break-up of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The heritage of the Serbian people is on display in Parma,
centered on the church, stoked with a fearsome pride built over
centuries of hostile occupation and brutal turf warfare. Little by
little, they have pressed the epic battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389
into the consciousness of America to help explain why Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic remains immovable after five solid
weeks of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of Kosovo Polje, in which the Serbians made a heroic
but losing stand against the Ottoman Empire, is the foundation of
Serbian belief in the rightness of their refusal to consider ceding
the region of Kosovo to ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbian homes here in Ohio, almost without fail, hangs a
painting called Kosovska Devojka. Cleveland Serbs say you'll find
it in every Serbian home in America. The title means Kosovo Girl.
The image depicts a woman giving aid to a lone surviving Serbian
soldier lying amid the bodies at Kosovo Polje, For a people whose
American descendants in Cleveland often teach their children
Serbian before they learn English, you almost can't overestimate
the symbolic value of a simple wall decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Rakic says, if America awoke one day and heard that
Mexican-Americans realized they were a majority within the city
limits of San Antonio, site of the Alamo, and decided to claim it
as a new, independent state. Imagine it. Well, Kosovo means more to
Serbia than the Alamo means to most Americans, but no American
would support an armed insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand,'' Rakic's uncle interrupts as he
walks through the living room, ``the Serbs cannot afford to lose
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Each night of the week now since the bombing began,
Serbian-Americans assemble at Public Square in downtown Cleveland.
In the shadow of the Gothic-looking Tower City Center, they circle
a patch of green grass contained by a city of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Some nights, the crowd is bigger than others. It's hard to
sustain a protest on a daily basis and mostly the TV and newspaper
people have stopped showing up. On the other hand, the Friday night
fish fry at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church _ a separate parish
from the cathedral _ sells out week after week and with each event
another few thousand dollars is cobbled together for humanitarian
relief. Of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the struggle for attention is one of the most challenging.
Last Sunday, on the last day of NATO's 50-year anniversary summit
in Washington, a bleary-eyed group at St. Sava's still was
recovering from an overnight bus ride. Members of the group rode
into and out of Washington in 24 hours just to stage a protest
while the diplomats were in town, but a small slip of paper, news
coverage of their demonstration, has them all awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this?'' a man huffs. ``Two-thousand? They say we had
2,000?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, he wants you to know. Cleveland alone sent 500 or
more. Add Chicago and Detroit, two other cities with large colonies
_ their word _ of Serbian-Americans, and you've hit 2,000 without
considering any other town.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Park Service told them the crowd was between 10,000 and
15,000, which only fuels their sense of dismay _ and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wonder,'' Rakic says. ``Why not state the correct
number?''
</P>
<P>
   Around St. Sava, they're starting to talk about forming a
committee to organize rebuttals to media accounts. When U.S. Rep.
Dennis Kucinich, a Democrat who represents this area and is of
Croatian descent, visited for a question-and-answer session, a
woman in the group asked if they should hire a public relations
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kucinich offered his congressional office as a clearinghouse for
information, but the Serbian Unity Congress is likely to move
forward with a public relations professional, said its president,
who lives in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all we talk about,'' said Milosh D. Milenkovich,
president of the congress. ``This is not something that's going to
resolve itself. All the Serbs are changing their way of life as a
result of this.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a fault line, a split in the Serbian-American
community, it is in what they believe of the atrocities the Serb
military is accused of committing in Kosovo. Generally, those like
Milenkovich who were born in Serbia and became U.S. citizens, are
dismissive of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Milenkovich doesn't believe the tales of rape or executions,
noting as do others around him that all the films of refugee camps
show an abundance of the able-bodied young men the Serbs are
supposed to be targeting. He is certain the Albanians fled NATO's
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   American-born Serbs are more willing to believe some of the
horrors. But they question the scale and are puzzled by the rush to
assign blame. After all, through the 1980s, the Serbs were the ones
being driven from Kosovo by Albanian coercion, violence and, as The
New York Times once wrote, rape. And the Serbs, too, were the
victims in 1995 when Croatian forces conducted a brutal sweep of
the Krajina region of Croatia. More than 200,000 Serbs were driven
from their homes and resettled in some of the same towns now under
NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize there are things going on over there being
committed by people of our nationality,'' said Joan Jakovich. ``But
where were you when my family was being ethnically cleansed?''
</P>
<P>
   Jakovich sells retail displays and her husband, an accountant,
is president of St. Sava Cathedral. She said her 80-year-old great
aunt was among those forced out of Krajina, and never was heard
from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of go through your whole life trusting the
government,'' she said, ``but when you grow up and become
personally involved in something you kind of feel ashamed to be
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakovich was the talk of the church recently for having finally
punched through the telephone roulette to say a few words during a
CNN call-in show. The congregation was watching and knew it was her
the minute she was on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone watches CNN, even though they hate it. They consider it
no less a tool of the Clinton White House than Belgrade television
_ bombed off the air by NATO _ was to Milosevic. They tune in
endlessly, seeking new information they're not likely to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the soccer stadium in Pristina? In the first few days
of the conflict, American media broadcast and published rank rumor
that a soccer stadium had been converted into a concentration camp.
Turned out it wasn't true, but the damage to Serbians was done.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the bombing of a refugee convoy a few weeks
ago. Though a NATO fighter accidentally dropped the bombs, the
Pentagon plowed through the first day's news cycle saying they
believed it was a Serbian MiG.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think structurally the media is free,'' said Petkovic of the
Plain Dealer, ``but intellectually is another story.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is their hope?
</P>
<P>
   Peace. They hope President Clinton will stop insisting that the
only option for peace is capitulation by Milosevic, because they
don't think it will ever happen. They hope NATO will suspend the
bombing just long enough to make one serious attempt at diplomacy
because the offer at Rambouillet was, like Clinton's current
demands, simply too rigid and too unfair to be considered a serious
effort at peace.
</P>
<P>
   And they hope to get on television. Around their offices they
say they have succeeded in converting a few gung-ho bombers and
they'd like to find the forum to reach more of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you just get them to question,'' Jakovich said,
``that's a victory.''

BIOGRAPHIES AND STORIES ABOUT REAL PEOPLE CAN INSPIRE CHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From books children learn about real people who influence _ in
tiny or giant ways _ their young lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those books fill community and school libraries, waiting
for a school assignment on the explorers or the Revolutionary War
or American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents relegate biographies and other books about real
people to assignments. What a shame. In everyday reading at home,
they could mix real-life stories with Charlie Bucket, Christopher
Robin and Angelina the Ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   These new ones are a good place to start:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Restless Spirit: The Life and Work of Dorothea Lange``
(Viking, $19) is the story of a haunting and unconventional life.
Lange is most famous for her photos of real people in desperate
situations: tiny Japanese-Americans with evacuation tags hanging
from the buttons of their cloth coats; cars overloaded with
blankets, goats and children, California-bound in the hope of
escaping the Depression; an 11-year-old boy picking hops in Oregon
in 1939 alongside his grandmother at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Her image of a migrant mother and her three children taken in
Nipomo, Calif., in 1936 has come to symbolize the tragic human
despair of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get my camera to register the things that were more
important than how poor they were _ their pride, their strength,
their spirit,'' Lange said.
</P>
<P>
   Other quotes head each chapter as author Elizabeth Partridge
unravels the story of an unconventional individual: ``The secret
places of the heart are the real mainsprings of one's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Partridge's book tells of a time in American history, a time we
know better because of the photographs Lange took.
</P>
<P>
   The book also is a story about photography: ``One should really
use the camera as though tomorrow you'd be stricken blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is about personal _ and national _ strengths and
frailties.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher recommends ``Restless Spirit'' for kids ages 10
and older.
</P>
<P>
   _ MFor readers ages 5-9, a story about the Great Depression is
disguised in ``The Babe &AMP; I'' (Harcourt Brace, $16).
</P>
<P>
   David A. Adler writes about a young boy who loves Babe Ruth and
yearns to see him play in Yankee Stadium. The boy's father has lost
his job and sells apples on a street corner. Embarrassed, he
pretends to go to the office every day, hiding the truth from his
wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   The boy hawks newspapers. No matter what the headline, he calls
out the latest news about the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   How he learns about his father, how he finally meets his hero
and gets a $5 tip, how he finally _ in July 1932 _ sees the Babe
play make a heartwarming story about a national hero who helped at
least this family through tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Widener's illustrations, in acrylics, work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rushmore'' (Scholastic, $17.95) captures another character
of American history. Lynn Curlee tells how Mount Rushmore was
carved and about Gutzon Borglum, the man who designed and fought
for it.
</P>
<P>
   With precise details, Curlee examines the many problems
associated with the project _ from disbelief to finances _ and the
hardships of men who set the dynamite charges and hung on ropes
from Harney Peak in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Children will
glimpse a bit of political maneuvering and ``offensive egotism'' in
the story.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as good as a visit to Mount Rushmore and the little
museum filled with data and photos below the faces. But it's good.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic recommends the book for ages 7-10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peter Rabbit, Mrs. Tiggywinkle and their woodland friends have
touched every child's life. ``My Dear Noel: The Story of a Letter
From Beatrix Potter'' (Dial, $15.99) tells how their creator,
Beatrix Potter, began doing children's stories.
</P>
<P>
   Potter, who lived in England's Lake District, was a farmer, a
political activist, an artist of nature and a storyteller. She had
no intention of becoming a famous creator of children's books. But
when Noel Moore, the 5-year-old son of a friend, became sick, she
wrote letters. One included ``The Tale of Peter Rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter continued to write animal stories to the Moore children,
illustrating each with fragile character-filled drawings.
</P>
<P>
   On the front endpaper of the book is a facsimile of the original
picture letter sent to Noel in 1893. The back endpaper shows the
same letter cleaned up for greater legibility and laid out in the
correct reading order.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Johnson tells Peter Rabbit's story clearly and with obvious
affection for the bunny and Potter. Recommended for ages 4-8.

 &HT;    SERBIAN-AMERICANS FEEL HOMELAND'S PAIN

<P>
   PARMA, Ohio _ The morning sun shines on this well-kept Cleveland
suburb and ignites the brilliant color of the stained glass windows
in St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Christ himself in luminous bloom along the southeastern wall
dominates the stout architecture of the Eastern rite church. But
again this Sunday, He fails to brighten a preoccupying somberness
inside.
</P>
<P>
   America is at war with Serbia, which for the people of St. Sava
means their home is at war with their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatches from friends and family living under threat of NATO
air strikes in Yugoslavia spread through the congregation, a
cornerstone of one of the largest Serbian-American colonies in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   And bred within it, by the details about lives and jobs brought
down in Yugoslavia along with the bridges and the buildings, is a
powerful sense of confusion and frustration over what is happening
and how little they seem able to influence it.
</P>
<P>
   Insular and suspicious, they are desperate to be advocates for
peace, but feel hamstrung by the portrait of their nationality as
aggressive, unyielding and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with being a Serb,'' said John Petkovic, an
entertainment columnist for The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, ``is that
every time you say something you're challenged with these
all-or-nothing propositions: `So are you saying you favor ethnic
cleansing?'''
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is no. But the long answer, and it gets very
long as it weaves through centuries of Serbian resistance to a
parade of aggressors, is that ethnic Albanians, Serbians and
Croatians have employed equally menacing tactics in the generations
of feuding that precipitated this war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at one point in time and say, `These are the
good guys and these are the bad guys,''' said Alex Rakic, an
attorney. ``We think it's horrible what's going on, but you need to
see the whole story. We just feel like Serbia's been picked as the
loser in the break-up of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The heritage of the Serbian people is on display in Parma,
centered on the church, stoked with a fearsome pride built over
centuries of hostile occupation and brutal turf warfare. Little by
little, they have pressed the epic battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389
into the consciousness of America to help explain why Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic remains immovable after five solid
weeks of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of Kosovo Polje, in which the Serbians made a heroic
but losing stand against the Ottoman Empire, is the foundation of
Serbian belief in the rightness of their refusal to consider ceding
the region of Kosovo to ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbian homes here in Ohio, almost without fail, hangs a
painting called Kosovska Devojka. Cleveland Serbs say you'll find
it in every Serbian home in America. The title means Kosovo Girl.
The image depicts a woman giving aid to a lone surviving Serbian
soldier lying amid the bodies at Kosovo Polje, For a people whose
American descendants in Cleveland often teach their children
Serbian before they learn English, you almost can't overestimate
the symbolic value of a simple wall decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Rakic says, if America awoke one day and heard that
Mexican-Americans realized they were a majority within the city
limits of San Antonio, site of the Alamo, and decided to claim it
as a new, independent state. Imagine it. Well, Kosovo means more to
Serbia than the Alamo means to most Americans, but no American
would support an armed insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand,'' Rakic's uncle interrupts as he
walks through the living room, ``the Serbs cannot afford to lose
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Each night of the week now since the bombing began,
Serbian-Americans assemble at Public Square in downtown Cleveland.
In the shadow of the Gothic-looking Tower City Center, they circle
a patch of green grass contained by a city of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Some nights, the crowd is bigger than others. It's hard to
sustain a protest on a daily basis and mostly the TV and newspaper
people have stopped showing up. On the other hand, the Friday night
fish fry at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church _ a separate parish
from the cathedral _ sells out week after week and with each event
another few thousand dollars is cobbled together for humanitarian
relief. Of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the struggle for attention is one of the most challenging.
Last Sunday, on the last day of NATO's 50-year anniversary summit
in Washington, a bleary-eyed group at St. Sava's still was
recovering from an overnight bus ride. Members of the group rode
into and out of Washington in 24 hours just to stage a protest
while the diplomats were in town, but a small slip of paper, news
coverage of their demonstration, has them all awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this?'' a man huffs. ``Two-thousand? They say we had
2,000?''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, he wants you to know. Cleveland alone sent 500 or
more. Add Chicago and Detroit, two other cities with large colonies
_ their word _ of Serbian-Americans, and you've hit 2,000 without
considering any other town.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Park Service told them the crowd was between 10,000 and
15,000, which only fuels their sense of dismay _ and suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wonder,'' Rakic says. ``Why not state the correct
number?''
</P>
<P>
   Around St. Sava, they're starting to talk about forming a
committee to organize rebuttals to media accounts. When U.S. Rep.
Dennis Kucinich, a Democrat who represents this area and is of
Croatian descent, visited for a question-and-answer session, a
woman in the group asked if they should hire a public relations
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Kucinich offered his congressional office as a clearinghouse for
information, but the Serbian Unity Congress is likely to move
forward with a public relations professional, said its president,
who lives in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all we talk about,'' said Milosh D. Milenkovich,
president of the congress. ``This is not something that's going to
resolve itself. All the Serbs are changing their way of life as a
result of this.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a fault line, a split in the Serbian-American
community, it is in what they believe of the atrocities the Serb
military is accused of committing in Kosovo. Generally, those like
Milenkovich who were born in Serbia and became U.S. citizens, are
dismissive of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Milenkovich doesn't believe the tales of rape or executions,
noting as do others around him that all the films of refugee camps
show an abundance of the able-bodied young men the Serbs are
supposed to be targeting. He is certain the Albanians fled NATO's
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   American-born Serbs are more willing to believe some of the
horrors. But they question the scale and are puzzled by the rush to
assign blame. After all, through the 1980s, the Serbs were the ones
being driven from Kosovo by Albanian coercion, violence and, as The
New York Times once wrote, rape. And the Serbs, too, were the
victims in 1995 when Croatian forces conducted a brutal sweep of
the Krajina region of Croatia. More than 200,000 Serbs were driven
from their homes and resettled in some of the same towns now under
NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize there are things going on over there being
committed by people of our nationality,'' said Joan Jakovich. ``But
where were you when my family was being ethnically cleansed?''
</P>
<P>
   Jakovich sells retail displays and her husband, an accountant,
is president of St. Sava Cathedral. She said her 80-year-old great
aunt was among those forced out of Krajina, and never was heard
from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of go through your whole life trusting the
government,'' she said, ``but when you grow up and become
personally involved in something you kind of feel ashamed to be
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakovich was the talk of the church recently for having finally
punched through the telephone roulette to say a few words during a
CNN call-in show. The congregation was watching and knew it was her
the minute she was on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone watches CNN, even though they hate it. They consider it
no less a tool of the Clinton White House than Belgrade television
_ bombed off the air by NATO _ was to Milosevic. They tune in
endlessly, seeking new information they're not likely to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the soccer stadium in Pristina? In the first few days
of the conflict, American media broadcast and published rank rumor
that a soccer stadium had been converted into a concentration camp.
Turned out it wasn't true, but the damage to Serbians was done.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the bombing of a refugee convoy a few weeks
ago. Though a NATO fighter accidentally dropped the bombs, the
Pentagon plowed through the first day's news cycle saying they
believed it was a Serbian MiG.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think structurally the media is free,'' said Petkovic of the
Plain Dealer, ``but intellectually is another story.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is their hope?
</P>
<P>
   Peace. They hope President Clinton will stop insisting that the
only option for peace is capitulation by Milosevic, because they
don't think it will ever happen. They hope NATO will suspend the
bombing just long enough to make one serious attempt at diplomacy
because the offer at Rambouillet was, like Clinton's current
demands, simply too rigid and too unfair to be considered a serious
effort at peace.
</P>
<P>
   And they hope to get on television. Around their offices they
say they have succeeded in converting a few gung-ho bombers and
they'd like to find the forum to reach more of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you just get them to question,'' Jakovich said,
``that's a victory.''

STRICT DRUG LAWS YIELD AN OVERDOSE OF PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ANDREAS TZORTZIS  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At least three times a night, Terrence Stevens needs
someone to roll him over in his cell. He also needs help turning
the page of a book and has to use his left hand to grip his right
when he spoons food into his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Crippled since the age of 2 by muscular dystrophy, Stevens, 32,
is an anomaly at the Green Haven Correctional Facility, an hour
north of Times Square by car. He requires a 24-hour attendant,
usually another prisoner, and bed rails on his cell bed. So far,
Stevens has served six years of a 15-to-life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was convicted of possessing more than four ounces of
cocaine, stashed in a duffel bag next to his seat on a Greyhound
bus in 1992. Under strict laws initiated by former Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller in 1973, the amount automatically earned him 15 years
in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   To proponents of such laws, Stevens is a good example of how
effective the laws can be in ridding the streets of drug dealers
for long periods of time. To advocates seeking to change the
sentencing guidelines, however, Stevens is serving a possible life
sentence for a crime that merits far less.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller drug laws will be 26 years old in May. Denounced
as Draconian by a host of judges, ex-state senators and advocacy
groups, a movement to change the laws has gained momentum over the
past year. Under the laws, anyone convicted of possessing four
ounces or more of cocaine or heroin or selling two or more ounces
of the drug receives an automatic minimum sentence of 15 years in
prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The strict laws are a major reason why the New York prison
population has grown by more than five times since their inception.
Worse, say opponents, the laws require small-time nonviolent
offenders to serve their sentences in maximum security prisons
alongside rapists and murderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in there with all kinds of people,'' said Regina Stevens,
Terrence's mother. ``He can't do anything to defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever his brother, sister or mother come to visit, guards
often make Stevens wait for hours because searching him takes more
effort than they want to expend, said Alice Byrne, a private
investigator who is looking into the circumstances surrounding the
conviction of Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to triple the years he's been in there, because of
the circumstances he's been under,'' said Byrne, whose office is in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents assert the laws have effectively snared repeat drug
offenders and cleared the streets of most drug dealers. Seeking to
debunk the myth that drug felons are ``harmless victims of the
system,'' the New York District Attorney's Association published a
study in February this year. In analyzing the prison population,
the study found that 70 percent of prisoners incarcerated for drug
felonies were second-time offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for change contend that the laws do not get the
drug kingpins they were originally designed to catch. Too often,
said Alan St. Pierre of the Marijuana Policy Project, the laws
catch the small-time users and sellers who do not have the
resources to fight incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Anthony Papa, barrel-chested and burly. A paintbrush
looks like a matchstick in Papa's thick hand. Lifting weights at
Sing Sing prison in upstate New York afforded Papa protection from
potential attackers. Wielding a paintbrush gave him his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Papa wasn't well-acquainted with art until he went to prison in
1985. The exposure came only after Papa delivered an envelope
filled with four-and-half ounces of cocaine to undercover police
officers conducting a drug sting.
</P>
<P>
   The bust came during a slow month for his radio repair business
in the Bronx. With a wife and young daughter to support, Papa was
amenable when a bowling partner he knew dealt drugs approached him
with $500 and asked him to deliver a small envelope of drugs to a
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Papa, a first-time offender, went to court and lost. He was
mortified at the thought of going to prison but under the
Rockefeller law he received a 15 years-to-life sentence. Once Papa
went behind bars, an inmate named Indio gave him watercolors, a
paintbrush and guidance. Over the next 12 years, Papa earned two
bachelor's degrees and a master's degree and created 36 paintings,
all about prison life.
</P>
<P>
   When one of the pictures, ``15 Years to Life,'' a self-portrait,
was shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1994, Papa's
story began getting coverage in the press. The attention eventually
helped gain him his release.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Papa, 44, has a two-inch thick packet of press clippings
about his work as a painter in prison and as an advocate on the
outside. He works as a clerk in the patent law office of Fish &AMP;
Neave, which, he points out, is only a block away from Rockefeller
Center. The packet is stored in a file drawer in his windowless
office, where the click of the gray door closing still reminds him
of his cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell into the role of the Zeitgeist,'' Papa said
philosophically, explaining his current role as a key figure in the
push to change the drug laws. ``It came about and I just fell into
it. I became the poster child'' for the controversy over mandatory
sentencing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of people like Stevens and Papa are what advocates
use to lobby state senators in hopes they will apply more pressure
on Gov. George Pataki to change the laws. An organization called
Families Against Mandatory Minimums plans to hold a family lobby
day sometime this spring, featuring relatives of inmates imprisoned
under the Rockefeller laws who will hold press conferences and
speak to legislators in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is ripe for reform,'' said Therese Derikart, the
organization's New York director. Derikart has a case file bursting
with stories like Papa's. Her clemency file, she said, is still too
thin.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, begun some years after Rockefeller signed his name
to the laws in 1973, has gathered momentum in the last two years,
said Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional
Association of New York, a non-profit prison watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, proposals to ease penalties by state politicians in New
York do not go far enough for the advocacy groups. Despite
suggesting he would change the laws when he took office, Pataki has
taken few steps in that direction. When state legislators discuss
the laws, Gangi said, talk will most likely center on the state
budget rather than changing sentencing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics always overwhelm the issue,'' he said. ``It poisons
the well from our standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe it is the lucrative lure of prison construction in
their districts that keep many of New York's legislators straddling
the fence. Building a prison brings automatic jobs and revenue to
the neighboring cities. Already there are 69 prisons in New York
state, according to the Department of Corrections. Pataki's 1999
budget includes construction of a new, 750-cell maximum security
prison in Malone, N.Y., according to Families Against Mandatory
Minimums.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have plenty of money to build more prisons,'' said Brian
Frankel, a lawyer and high school friend of an inmate named Eric
Marsh, who is serving a 15-to-life sentence at the Eastern
Correctional Facility in Napanoch, N.Y., for allowing his apartment
be used during a sale of 2.2 ounces of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In carefully scripted prose, Marsh, like Papa before him, has
written letters to lawyers, politicians, judges _ anyone who will
listen. Now in his ninth year of incarceration, Marsh has worked
inside the prison as a teacher's aide, received a bachelor's degree
in psychology and served in the facility's Jewish Synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to belabor the point of my trial,'' he wrote in a
recent letter to Derikart. ``But the sentences that were given in
my case, were extremely disproportionate to the crimes involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel put it another way: ``This guy is a political
prisoner.''

</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN MARKET _ On a recent Saturday, Betty Delacruz leaned
against a wall at the Knickerbocker Live Poultry Market and waited
for her two chickens and three quail to be killed, plucked, and
gutted. Now she shops, sometimes twice a week, at the
Knickerbocker, which for 62 years has catered to several immigrant
cultures in Brooklyn. Each has its own idea of what makes good
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ASIAN EYES _ More and more Asian women are seeking plastic
surgery to make their eyes like more western.
</P>
<P>
   CANADIAN STUDENTS _ Colleges and universities in the United
States are getting fewer students from Canada, thanks to the
exchange rate on money.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG LAWS _ The Rockefeller drug laws will be 26 years old in
May. Denounced as Draconian by a host of judges, ex-state senators
and advocacy groups, a movement to change the laws has gained
momentum over the past year. Under the laws, anyone convicted of
possessing four ounces or more of cocaine or heroin or selling two
or more ounces of the drug receives an automatic minimum sentence
of 15 years in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   ELEPHANT MANURE _ Elephant manure, pungent and plentiful, is
rich in nutrients, perfect for gardeners to use as fertilizer after
a half-year of composting. For more than 20 years, the Ringling
Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus has given away the pachyderm
panacea to horticulturists, who report gigantic flowers and rapid
vegetable growth as a result. Zoos around the country also sell the
powerful dung. High-grade exotic manure has even reached the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC ISLAM _ Some Hispanic-American women who become Muslim
do so for love, having met a Muslim man. Others are searching for
tranquility. Whatever the reason, for Hispanic-American women,
embracing Islam is not easy. Adjusting to a new dress code,
lifestyle and the language of the Koran, Arabic, can take years.
</P>
<P>
   MEAN COMEDY _ There is little to laugh about at some open-mic
nights at comedy clubs, which amateur stand-ups use it as a venue
for venting.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY PROMOTION _ ``Everybody parties,'' said a member of one of
New York's most active event promotion teams. ``It's all about
making sure everybody is having a great time. It's not all fun and
games, trying to throw parties in New York, but somebody's got to
do it, right?'' Apparently, more and more young entrepreneurs think
so. Black Diamonds Entertainment and other events groups, like
ProLinks Incorporated, Net2 and Partners in Soul, hold parties
several nights throughout the week at New York clubs like NV, the
Metronome, Vivid, Cream and Nell's, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   SUBWAY MUSICIANS _ For subway riders, the buskers' presence
provides a pleasant background noise and a diversion during rush
hour. But for the musicians, the underground stage provides more
than the $80 to $150 they can earn in five hours; it is a chance to
be in the public's eye, and to gain some recognition, which could
lead to a grander stage. Pete Seeger, Woody Gutherie and, according
to legend, Tony Bennett all performed underground.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIAN FUTURE _ Commentary: Since the presidential elections
in Nigeria in late February, Western leaders, diplomats and
scholars now talk about Africa's most populous country in rhapsodic
terms. They don't speak of a failed state with a seeming propensity
to self-destruct. Rather, they gush about a strategic country on
the cusp of renewal.

DUMBO DUNG DELIVERS POWER TO FLOWERS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine monstrous roses, 400-pound pumpkins and
tomatoes the size of grapefruits. These are not fairytales or
wishful thinking but products produced by what some people call the
greatest manure on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant manure, pungent and plentiful, is rich in nutrients,
perfect for gardeners to use as fertilizer after a half-year of
composting. For more than 20 years, the Ringling Brothers and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus has given away the pachyderm panacea to
horticulturists, who report gigantic flowers and rapid vegetable
growth as a result. Zoos around the country also sell the powerful
dung. High-grade exotic manure has even reached the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest stuff on Earth,'' said Pete Cimini, the
stable master at Ringling Brothers. ``It's pure manure, no
additives. Miracle-Gro ain't got nothing on Ringling.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the circus's 14 elephants eats 150 to 250 pounds of hay
per day, along with various grains, fruits and vegetables. While
the notion that elephants love peanuts is myth, they do favor
pumpkins and watermelons. They also drink 30 to 50 gallons of water
each day. They need to eat and drink this much to sustain their
weight, which can range from 8,000 to 20,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of their prodigious intake, they produce elephantine
amounts of manure _ up to 500 or more pounds per day in extreme
cases. Each pellet of elephant waste is about the size of a
volleyball and weighs between eight-and-a-half to 10 pounds.
Because elephants digest only about 40 percent of their food, their
dung is rich in nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   As the circus makes its circuit around the country, it gives
away the elephant manure at stops where demand for it is high.
Anyone who wants some can call and pick some up. Demand for dung is
greatest in Houston, Cimini said.
</P>
<P>
   People in Houston regularly begin to line up for the fecund
fertilizer the night before the giveaway, Cimini said. So many
gardeners come that the circus has two uniformed police officers to
handle the crowd, he said. The circus also rations out the manure,
one five-gallon bucket per person.
</P>
<P>
   The giveaways usually occur around lunchtime. Most of the people
in line are ``Ma and Pa Home Depot-type people,'' Cimini said.
``But always look for people with ties or high heels, looking over
their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   The circus does not deliver. Gardeners must find their own way
to get the manure home. ``They bag their own, box their own, have
trucks ready to haul,'' Cimini said.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant manure is so popular that some have resorted to theft
to get it, Cimini said. At a stop in Atlanta in 1997, ``We had a
Mount Everest, actually a Mount Ringling, of manure. It was 15 feet
tall and as wide as one of the circus rings. The next morning, I
went out to check up on the pile, and it was not even a foot
high.'' The night before, a circus employee had seen a dump truck
driving away from the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The manure was never recovered. ``What is the world coming to
when you steal someone's dung?'' Cimini wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of elephant manure, it is still so
plentiful _ and renewable _ that 99 percent of the circus's stock
ends up going to the landfill, Cimini said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx Zoo in New York does not give away any of its elephant
manure, because of Board of Health regulations, said Rosanne
Thiemann, an employee in the curator of mammalogy's office.
</P>
<P>
   The National Zoo in Washington, though, packages the manure of
some of its herbivores _ elephants, giraffes and rhinos, among
others _ into a product named Zoo Doo. The Zoo Doo does not include
the dung of carnivores, as it is poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-pound bag costs $6, while a souvenir bucket of 15 ounces
costs $5, said Rick Reichley of Friends of the National Zoo. ``Zoo
Doo is the ultimate in recycling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Doo helped Joe Mills, a photographer from Falls Church, Va.,
to grow ultimate pumpkins. Mills set the pumpkin record in
Washington, D.C., 1997 with a 408-pound pumpkin, named Boo-Da 1,
with the help of Zoo Doo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zoo Doo is a gourmet manure,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the gourmet dung, Mills bested his record the
next year with Boo-Da 2, a 470-pound pumpkin. Mills had a 500-pound
pumpkin, but an animal ate it before it could be officially
weighed. ``I just know it was something that had fairly big
claws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Doo exists on the Internet, as well. The name Zoo Doo is
licensed by a company in Memphis, Tenn. It has an agreement with
the National Zoo, allowing it to use the name. The Zoo Doo company,
which blends the dung of many different herbivores, can be found at
www.zoodoo.com. The company's website boasts:
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the vitamins elephants eat, Zoo Doo is like a
multivitamin for the garden.''

HISPANIC WOMEN SWAP CULTURE AND RELIGION, CONVERT TO ISLAM

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mariam Ramon has swapped her short skirts, visits to
the beauty parlor and Roman Catholicism for baggy pants, a head
scarf and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon, 52, a Puerto-Rican American, became a Muslim 10 years
ago. Her curiosity about the religion was aroused by an Islamic
prayer ritual by four African-American men near her South Bronx
home. She watched as they unfolded their prayer mats, knelt and
turned east to face Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a beautiful thing,'' she said. ``I was struck by the
peacefulness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Hispanic-American women who become Muslim do so for love,
having met a Muslim man. Others are searching for tranquillity.
Whatever the reason, for Hispanic-American women, embracing Islam
is not easy. Adjusting to a new dress code, lifestyle and the
language of the Koran, Arabic, can take years.
</P>
<P>
   No exact figures exist on the ethnicity of Americans who convert
to Islam, although it is widely agreed that African-Americans
account for more than a third. The number of Hispanic American
converts is unknown. What is known is that the numbers, although
small, are growing, according to Ebrahim Hopper from the Council on
Islamic-American Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Vanesa Rivera, a petite woman with delicate features who looks
much younger than her 20 years, is planning to officially convert
to Islam in the summer. Introduced to the religion through an
ex-boyfriend, Rivera attends Arabic classes at a mosque in New
York. ``It took me a while to get used to this,'' she said, tugging
on her purple and lilac silk headscarf. ``At first I felt very
uncomfortable, but now I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ecuador and raised a Roman Catholic, Rivera moved to New
York with her family when she was 13. Only her mother and sister
know of her decision to become a Muslim. She is waiting to tell her
father, whom she says will be less understanding. ``I know he will
laugh at me for wearing the scarf,'' Rivera said. ``Probably my
friends will too. But I'm determined, so I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciling a new identity and religion with a non-Muslim family
and community is difficult. ``My mother has a little battle with my
decision every time she sees me,'' Ramon said. Both Ramon and
Rivera spoke about misunderstandings in the wider Latin community
that often make them feel isolated. ``Latin people have very little
understanding about Muslims,'' Ramon said. ``They think they are
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to her new look with the headscarf is not Rivera's
biggest worry. Fear of being laughed at and facing prejudice
concern her more. A student at New York Technical College, Rivera
wants to become a teacher at a public school when she graduates.
She is worried about the reaction she will receive when she wears
her headscarf to interviews. ``Maybe I won't be able to get a
job,'' she said. ``Maybe the kids will say I look ugly or get
scared because of the scarf.''
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice is something Arwa Avila, a Mexican-American who lives
in Los Angeles, has faced since she converted to Islam in 1991. She
tells of being verbally abused in the street and taunted for
wearing her headscarf. A few years ago, before her conversion, she
said she would have replied in kind when taunted. Now, she bites
her tongue. ``Shouting back would be a bad reflection on Islam,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Avila said she could live with the taunts. What has proved more
troubling is mastering Arabic. Her husband, a Syrian-born American
she met after she converted, helps her and teaches the language to
her two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important for me that my children speak Arabic and
English than Spanish,'' she said. ``Arabic for the Koran and
English because we live in America.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few organizations specifically for Hispanic-American
Muslims is Alianza Islamica, based in Spanish Harlem. Offering
support to the local Puerto Rican and Dominican community, Ramon,
who volunteers with the group says Alianza Islamica emphasizes the
similarities between Hispanic and Islamic culture to foster mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many commonalities,'' Ramon said. ``Spain was under
Islamic rule for 700 years, many of the words in Spanish come from
the Arab language and there are many similarities in the societies
like the importance of the extended family.''
</P>
<P>
   Avila notes that many of the similarities helped her adjust.
``Certain values, role expectations and ways of life are amazingly
similar,'' she said. ``Even the governments in the Middle East and
in Latin countries are the same,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging certain cultural similarities, Rivera said
it was actually the promise of a different culture that attracted
her. ``Hispanic culture is wild; Islamic culture is calmer,'' she
said, sitting in a quiet corner of the mosque she frequents,
clutching a copy of the Koran. ``Even though I've only just started
coming to the mosque, I feel a strong connection with other
Muslims. More than with my own people.''

AT OPEN-MIC NIGHTS, COMEDIANS LOSE THE GAG REFLEX 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ALEX LANE  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As an open-mic night wound down on a recent Wednesday
at the Collective Unconscious club in Manhattan, a stand-up comic
named Steve Y walked onstage and set up a video camera, saying he
was taping his set for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took out a pistol loaded with hollow-point bullets,
spewed a string of nonsense, and held the gun to his head.
</P>
<P>
   Y didn't pull the trigger, and he said it was just a joke. But
the six or seven staff members and performers left in the room were
worried enough to get him off stage, take him outside, and talk him
into giving them the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Gunplay is rare at these shows, but it's safe to say the
incident was not exactly a surprise to anyone who knows the scene.
Open-mic nights, which take place just about every night of the
week somewhere in lower Manhattan, have long been the first step in
a career in stand-up comedy. But these days, comedians say, the
amateurs seem less interested in starting a career than in working
out their aggression. Open-mic nights have become the dark
underbelly of stand-up comedy _ desperation, anger, downright
oddness and occasional violence take the place of gags and jokes.
Nowhere is it clearer that humor is often born of pathos.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' said Jen Miller, who hosts the weekly
open-mic night at Collective Unconscious, ``open-mic comedy is
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   She explained, ``The comedy boom of the '80s is over,'' and the
entertainment industry is less interested in comedians than it was
a few years ago. So there are fewer pros-in-training on the amateur
circuit _ many of today's open-mic performers are leftovers who see
their six minutes on stage as a mini therapy session.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a young, fresh group of people who are starry-eyed
and happy with their jobs and their lives,'' Miller said. ``You
have a three-and-a-half-hour show that sucks because people are up
there doing their therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What scared me about the Steve Y incident was that it was that
one guy, but it could have been any one of 30 or 40 people I know
on the scene and I wouldn't have been surprised,'' said Sean
Conroy, a comedian and open-mic regular who has been at it for
about a year.
</P>
<P>
   A recent open-mic night in the dark back room of Bar None, a
tavern in Manhattan's East Village, offered a glimpse into this
strange, often gloomy world.
</P>
<P>
   There was ample low self-esteem: ``I'm just a jerk tonight, I'm
sorry guys,'' said a comic named Spiro who, like most, was not
getting any laughs. His audience _ as at many open-mic nights _ was
mostly comics waiting for their turn onstage. ``I'm a compulsive
loser and I'm just attaching myself to another hobby for two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   There was kookiness: ``I've got a date next week, and we're
going to Queens,'' said a comic named Gawi, who has an Elmer
Fudd-style speech impediment and often talks in non sequiturs.
``What do I do? Do I buy condoms beforehand? Do I wear green
underwear?''
</P>
<P>
   And there was plenty of misogyny: ``This is a great place to
bring a date, if you're going to rape her,'' said a comic who goes
by the name Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   For more traditional comics, the endless stream of kooks can be
too much to take. ``When I first started, I couldn't be in the room
unless I was performing, I just found it too depressing,'' Conroy
said. ``It's all these things, the racism, the homophobia, the
constant talk of raping and killing women.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy said he had learned to define deviancy down. ``After a
while you're like, 'Well this person's not psychotic, so at least I
can watch them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Comedians have always incorporated a politically incorrect
edginess into their acts, but many open-mic performers seem
genuinely hateful. Women are often the target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most stand-ups wouldn't know how to get a date if they took a
course,'' said Paul Mercurio, a writer and correspondent on the
Comedy Central cable channel's Daily Show. ``There's that
resentment, 'If I can't have you, I'm going to find something wrong
with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio spent a year and a half on the open-mic circuit before
growing into television work. ``In looking back, it's kind of a
bizarre thing to put yourself through,'' he said. ``All comics have
problems, but lots of these people had so many more problems than
most people. It was kind of weird to try to be funny in such a
depressed environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the strangeness erupts into actual violence. Mercurio
remembers waiting to follow a whiny folk singer performing
``Blowin' in the Wind'' at one open-mic. During the song, a fight
broke out at the pool table, and a man got slashed with a
box-cutter razor blade. The slasher ran out, leaving the victim
grabbing his neck, screaming, ``He cut me! That guy cut me!''
Through all this, the folk singer played on undeterred. ``And you
can understand why,'' Mercurio said. ``Because you wait all week to
get the spot and you don't want to give it up for anything.'' When
the folk singer finished, the emcee called Mercurio to the stage as
police tended to the victim. Mercurio's first line was, ``I always
wanted to follow a slashing.'' This annoyed the victim, and a
wadded-up, bloody napkin flew out from the audience, hitting
Mercurio in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Pepitone, another comedian, said he's always slightly
nervous at open-mics, especially after the Steve Y incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to be nice to everybody,'' Pepitone said. ``It
gets weird in these venues, these weird, dark, little places.''

COMMENTARY: MINES THREATEN NIGERIA'S PATH TO DEMOCRACY

<P>
   Since the presidential elections in Nigeria in late February,
Western leaders, diplomats and scholars now talk about Africa's
most populous country in rhapsodic terms. They don't speak of a
failed state with a seeming propensity to self-destruct. Rather,
they gush about a strategic country on the cusp of renewal.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sweet but ironic turn. Only a year ago, Nigeria earned
the status of an international pariah, and looked like a Rwanda or
Bosnia waiting to happen. A new dispensation should kick in when
the election winner, Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military head of
state widely respected in the international community, is sworn in
as president on May 29. The ceremony will mark the end of 15 years
of continuous military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians and the outside world hope that this transition will
permanently do away with military rule, an aberration that has
plagued the country for most of its 38 years of independence. As
desirable and legitimate as this expectation is, the incoming
civilian administration might prove to be just another civilian
interregnum. Some odds suggest that the military might soon shoot
its way back.
</P>
<P>
   The sad legacy of long military rule might fuel an impatience
that could lead to instability. Under the military, Nigeria's
economy ran aground. The country earned at least $250 billion from
sales of crude oil, but its people reel in poverty. Per-capita
income is now under $250, down from the $1,200 of the 1980s. The
country's currency, the Naira, is now worth about one cent, down
from $1.25 in the late 1970s. A Nigerian head of state once boasted
that the country's problem was not money but how to spend it.
Bogged down by a $32 billion external debt, Nigeria is now one of
the world's 13 poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Things are worse in human terms. Nigeria, the world's
eighth-largest producer of oil, cannot fuel its cars. About 50
percent of its 115 million population live below the poverty level.
Life expectancy is low, infant mortality high. Infrastructure is
either extinct or comatose. Telephone lines are mostly dead. Roads
are pockmarked. Water taps run dry. The electricity authority beams
darkness. A futile anger dilutes the puny smiles on the faces of
Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
   Many expect these dire circumstances to change with the exit of
military rule. Maybe. Apart from being saddled with this crushing
inheritance, the new administration will also confront great
expectations and will be hobbled by free-falling oil prices. Unmet
expectations can give way to despair and angst, which might send
the country back in the cyclical trap of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transition to democracy, of course, has to have tangible
meaning for people in terms of standard of living, sense of
security and economic opportunities,'' said Salih Booker, director
of the Africa Studies Program of the Council on Foreign Relations,
a New York-based policy group. ``If things don't happen as quickly
as people expect, they might say 'if democracy could be this bad
why not give us military rule.'''
</P>
<P>
   Having suffered for too long, Nigerians might not have the
patience for a gradual turn-around. And in Nigeria, the soldiers
are always waiting in the barracks.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of possible pretexts for the army to act.
</P>
<P>
   One, corruption, for which the country has achieved notoriety,
will outlive military rule. ``More money was spent in this campaign
than at any other time before,'' said Julius Ihonvbere, a Nigerian
who works as the program officer for governance at the Ford
Foundation in New York. ``These politicians don't see themselves as
philanthropists. What we might witness is the crudest looting in
recent times.'' The soldiers always take power under the pretext of
cleaning up the mess created by politicians, but end up out-looting
the politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Another dangerous signpost is the pervasive sense of alienation
reigning in parts of the country. Many in the southwest region of
Nigeria, from where Obasanjo hails, distrust him, viewing him as a
stand-in for the corrupt generals from the North. The elections
were shadowed by accusations of manipulation. The Ibos in eastern
Nigeria feel cut out of the present dispensation. The Niger Delta,
which produces the country's oil but is the least developed section
of the country, is full of angry people who feel left out.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nigerians clamor for change in the structure of their
country and for equitable allocation of resources. But it is
unlikely that the incoming administration will address these issues
_ the campaigns were empty on issues, heavy on bland
generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria could slip into a one-party state. The People's
Democratic Party dwarfs the other two parties and controls a
majority of seats in all levels of government. In a political
system where winners take all and incumbents are always difficult
to unseat, it is unlikely that one-party rule will be prevented.
And when people are frustrated with domination in Nigeria, they
embolden the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not yet morning on creation day,'' said Ihonvbere,
quoting Chinua Achebe, the Nigerian novelist who wrote Things Fall
Apart. ``I see this as a short break from military rule. It could
be a long one. But certainly not the end of military rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker said Western countries could prevent these scary
scenarios. ``They should emphasize to him [Obasanjo] the need to
form a government of national unity and put in place democratic
institutions and respect people's rights,'' he said. ``The West has
been too euphoric about the transition in Nigeria. Euphoria doesn't
help that country.''
</P>
<P>
   With a population that accounts for one-fifth of all the people
in sub-Saharan Africa, its human and resource endowments and its
strategic importance, Nigeria can still dance in the sun as a real
giant. But to realize the destiny its people and many outsiders
crave, Nigeria needs restructuring, revival, and reconciliation.
Only these, not just elections and twinkling rhapsodies, can ensure
that the military will not be tempted to inflict themselves again
on the country.

IMMIGRANTS FLOCK TO BROOKLYN CHICKEN MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By SANDRA YIN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent Saturday, Betty Delacruz leaned against a
wall at the Knickerbocker Live Poultry Market and waited for her
two chickens and three quail to be killed, plucked, and gutted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone had six to 10 chickens in his yard,'' said Delacruz,
42, recalling life in her native Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Now she shops, sometimes twice a week, at the Knickerbocker,
which for 62 years has catered to several immigrant cultures in
Brooklyn. Each has its own idea of what makes good chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Vargas, 43, a car repairman from the Dominican Republic,
has a taste for sancocho, a stew concocted of chicken, spaghetti,
green plantains and yucca. It's important the bird doesn't fall
apart during up to two hours of cooking, he said. Tough old hens
can take it, but young chickens are ``no good for soup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early decades, mostly Italians, Germans and Eastern
Europeans came to the Knickerbocker, said owner Michael Lane. Now,
the clientele is mostly from South America, particularly the
Dominican Republic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent immigrants who make their way to the store hail
from China and Poland. And each group has its own idea of how fowl
should be picked and prepared.
</P>
<P>
   A Rumanian whose family raised about 60 chickens in Yugoslavia,
Stella Janca, 64, makes chicken soup up to twice a week. Leaving
her grocery cart in line, she peers into cages at chicken legs,
searching for the bony nodule on the back of the leg that tells
their age. Few have any. The vitamins and medicine in their feed
make them grow too fast, she said. The young are okay for goulash,
she said, but she is looking for a one-year-old for soup.
</P>
<P>
   Head, feet and body will serve as the base for the soup stock,
she explained. Following a recipe handed down through generations,
she will add parsley, carrots, onions, and homemade noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most customers, who let the poultry man select a bird,
Janca insists on feeling the chickens before deciding to buy. She
wanders from cage to cage, sometimes reaching in to pull a
squawking bird out. Now prodding, then gently squeezing the bird's
chest, she considers the chicken's soup worthiness. ``If it's too
skinny, it might be sick,'' she said. ``And if it's too soft,
there's too much fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacks of cages line the market walls. They contain rabbits,
ducks and quail, but mostly chickens. Four-month old broilers and
friers, far from a ceiling heater, huddle together for warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cruz, 25, a dental technician from Bayside, Queens, buys
three chickens a week. His family of four, he said, can go through
one and a half chickens in one day. As Dominicans, they relish
arroz con pollo, a rice and chicken dish, and deep fried chicken,
Cruz said. If it's Monday, it's fried. If it's Wednesday, it's with
spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Tuesday, John Zhune, 46, bought five white chickens
for his Aunt Elba to roast, stew or boil for soup. In the
mountaintop town in Ecuador where he grew up, the family raised 100
chickens for themselves. Homegrown chickens are the best, the
Ridgewood, Queens resident said. Free to wander, ``they eat every
kind of little animal,'' he said. Insects, cockroaches, even mice
are part of their daily nutritional intake. The diverse diet makes
for more intense flavor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Proprietor Lane, who sometimes mans the cashier window, said his
chickens were free-range. ``Technically,'' he said, ``it just means
they can walk out the door.'' At the Knickerbocker, the door is
always propped open and cage doors are sometimes left wide open as
well. But few chickens choose to leave the confines of their cages
for the streets of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   When not in Ecuador managing real estate and visiting family,
Zhune grows nostalgic for pollo horneado, a family specialty. Back
home, his oldest brother Luis, 55, makes the dish by roasting
chicken with garlic, onions, and Coca-Cola for four hours in a wood
burning oven.
</P>
<P>
   Under the din of the market's fan, a babel of chirps, warbles
and ``bock-bock-bocks'' is punctuated by the occasional screech of
protest as a poultryman pulls a chicken out of a cage. Frayed old
egg layers, destined for someone's soup pot, jab beaks into each
other's faces.
</P>
<P>
   While 5-to-10-pound chickens are the most popular, said Manuel
Duran, 46, who has worked in poultry markets for almost 20 years,
preferences vary. Chinese and Latinos seem to prefer the red
spotted, grey rock pullets, he said as he stood by the scale
waiting for customers to appear, a white surgical mask propped on
top of his baseball cap. Many Chinese prize black-skinned chickens,
which they believe possess greater healing powers.
</P>
<P>
   To cut or not to cut, or even how to cut, all depends on the
customer. When Duran marks one of the tags wired to a bird's foot
with ``CS'', Claude Nance, 62, who has killed chickens at the
market since 1972, knows to treat the chickens ``Chinese style.''
The cut to the neck will be small and he won't remove the head.
</P>
<P>
   Central Americans from Colombia, Mexico and Ecuador also like
the head attached, Duran said. Mexicans do not want their chickens
gutted. Many Dominicans, partial to fried chicken, want the meat,
but do not want to be bothered with the head, feet, heart or liver.
They prefer the younger, white chickens. South Americans sometimes
ask that the chickens be cut into small pieces for stewing or
frying.
</P>
<P>
   Customers pay at a window, where a sign says ``Paga Aqui, Por
Favor Gracias'' and ``Please pay here. Thank you.'' A sign on the
wall lists specials: Gallinas Blancas or white hens, are five for
$11 and hens, red or amarilla, three for $12.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the market for the first time in 13 years, Gladys Roman,
47, who was raised in Puerto Rico, said she stopped her weekly
visits in the mid-1980s because of the smell. On a recent Saturday
morning, waiting outside the gutting room for her number to be
called, the Puerto Rican said she had come at her Italian
son-in-law's bidding. Her baby granddaughter's Italian grandmother
would make soup of the chicken she bought. Weeks later, Roman
recalled, the baby's cold and ear infection were gone in two days.

MUSIC GOES UNDERGROUND AND SUBWAY RIDERS FEEL THE BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By ADAM KRAMER  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carolina Slim, wearing a long gray army coat and a
black fedora, looked out onto the subway platform under Times
Square. His foot moved to the slow rhythm of his guitar as he
squeezed out a blues tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way down in New Orleans, the prettiest girl I've ever seen,''
he sang as his student and sideman Ricky Gordon grated a piece of
metal up and down the washboard on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, one of the rush-hour commuters dropped
change into the white box at the pair's feet, and Slim would thank
them with a slow nod of his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing in the subway because of the crowd,'' Slim
said. ``Every car, some will stop, and you can get a few dollars,
then the next car and a few more. The reward is the people stopping
everything and listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim, 72, whose real name is Elijah Staley, is one of hundreds
of musicians whose music _ heard above the hiss and click-clack of
subway trains, the beep of turnstiles and the garbled voice of
loudspeakers announcing the arrival of another train _ radiates
through the underground catacombs that make up the subway system.
</P>
<P>
   For subway riders, the buskers' presence provides a pleasant
background noise and a diversion during rush hour. But for the
musicians, the underground stage provides more than the $80 to $150
they can earn in five hours; it is a chance to be in the public's
eye, and to gain some recognition, which could lead to a grander
stage. Pete Seeger, Woody Gutherie and, according to legend, Tony
Bennett all performed underground. Slim has played in commercials
and a Madonna video.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, 150 subway musicians are sponsored by the city
through a transit authority program called Music Under New York,
while other performers set up shop on the subway station platforms,
tunnels and mezzanines. They are from diverse backgrounds and play
a broad variety of music: African, blues, jazz and the drum beat of
sticks hitting plastic buckets are only a few of the sounds that
give the subway music its character.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking to make the musician rosters as diverse as
possible, in order to reflect the city,'' said Tim Higginbotham,
co-director of Music Under New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tim and his wife, Gina, have run the music program since 1993,
which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. They are
responsible for scheduling performers at 25 locations throughout
the transit system and arranging the 150 weekly performances. In
addition, they are responsible for overseeing the roster of
musicians and auditioning hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   According to Higginbotham, the program books about 75 out of the
150 musicians who are a part of the program each week. The others
are out of town or have different gigs that occupy their time. Each
year, the program adds about 15 new musicians via an audition
process that involves playing before a panel of music industry
professionals. The musicians are judged on quality, variety and
appropriateness for the mass transit environment.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out on to the shuttle platform, Slim and his partner
surveyed the crowd, grinning and talking to the people with their
facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look up at the people, look 'em in the eye,'' said Slim.
``Have conversations with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim, born in South Carolina, moved up to New York 48 years ago
after a stint in the army in World War II. Playing the blues since
age 9, Slim gave his first public concert at age 15. He has been a
part of the Music Under New York since its inception, playing two
or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good,'' said Eliana Misan, who was listening to Slim
while waiting for a friend. ``It makes New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner from Slim, facing the entrance to the downtown
N and R trains and the Latin Music Store, Larry Wright, 24, drummed
on a pair of white plastic buckets. Wright was a freelancer _
someone not associated with Music Under New York. This means his
music, unlike those of his sanctioned colleagues, cannot be
amplified.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was discovered in the subway at the age of 15, when PBS
filmed a show about him and the plastic buckets he uses to make
music. Since then he has performed on Broadway in ``Bring in Da
Noise, Bring in Da Funk,'' on videos, in a Levi's commercial, and
now plays every Sunday at the Baggot Inn in Greenwich Village, in a
show called ``Keep Banging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not for the money, it's giving back to the community,''
Wright said. ``Nothing wrong with coming down here and
practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's usual spot was where Carolina Slim had set up, but out
of respect for his fellow street musician, he had moved around the
corner. Now after two hours, Wright was putting away his buckets
and closing up for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the subway is something that they can never take
away, I got to keep coming back,'' Wright said. ``I like lifting
people's spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   At the return stop of the shuttle _ facing the steps that bring
passengers from the 4,5 and 6 trains _ stood a man with Fila
sneakers, black jeans and a black hat with a New York Yankees
emblem. Resting in between his legs was a tan and white bowl with
long stick shooting upward, which held the 21 strings he picked
with both thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Keba Bobo Cissoko, from Guinea Bissau, has been in the United
States for four years and has been playing in the subway for one.
He sings in his native language, Creolo, playing the instrument
from his country, the Kora. The elevated pitch and gentle rhythms
of his voice, which move at a fast pace as he keeps time with the
harp-like sounds emanating from his instrument, are not common to
America. But the messages his songs convey are cross-cultural. He
sings of travel, life, love and history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sing about everybody, about America,'' Cissoko said. ``When
you are traveling you have to talk about everything, about culture.
I am talking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the commuters rushing through the station paid little
attention to the black man with a smile from ear to ear. Most were
more concerned with filing in and out of the subway cars; a few
looked at his instrument as if it was from a faraway, unknown
world.
</P>
<P>
   Like most subway musicians, Cissoko likes singing in the subway.
He enjoys meeting different people; it is a way for him to be in
the public eye. Through public contact, he has been able to get
other jobs, like playing music for the Yoga and African dance
classes at The New York Sporting Club.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians of Music Under New York and the freelancers, who
make their living playing for people running through the vast
corridors that encompass the subway, are a mosaic of different
races and cultures. They represent the city, and are a part of New
York City's history, culture and lore.
</P>
<P>
   According to Higginbotham: ``The music in the subways adds to
the cultural mix of this town.''

AIR FORCE TO SEEK BIDDERS FOR SOME WORK AT TEXAS BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force in August will seek private bids to
take over some operations at Lackland Air Force Base, a move that
could affect more than 1,600 civilian jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most jobs at the base, known as ``The Gateway to the Air
Force,'' would transfer to the private sector in a cost-cutting
move, although an unknown number of jobs also could be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Texas partnership already has formed to bid on the
work at Lackland, the Air Force's only basic-training base.
</P>
<P>
   The first bidder to publicly disclose its intentions is EG&AMP;G
Technical Services, represented by EG&AMP;G Management Services of San
Antonio. The company already has a contract with the city of San
Antonio to redevelop Kelly Air Force Base into an industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   EG&AMP;G's main partner will be Boeing Service Co., based in
Richardson, Texas, a separate Boeing division from the aerospace
services operation that began aircraft operations at Kelly last
year. Kelly will cease being a base and will be turned over to the
city of San Antonio in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If the competition for a private contract doesn't meet the
government's standards, however, the Air Force will continue to
operate Lackland under its own contracting rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private competition winner must beat the most efficient
government plan by 10 percent or more,'' said Rudy DiLuzio,
president and general manager of EG&AMP;G Management Services.
</P>
<P>
   According to Air Force information posted on the Internet, the
sweeping privatization contract would put into private hands
numerous operations at Lackland.
</P>
<P>
   They include civil engineering services, communications, grounds
and building maintenance, logistics, operations support, personnel
mission support and supply services.
</P>
<P>
   Some computer support and aircraft maintenance also likely will
be part of the package, along with the possible operation of the
air control tower for the Kelly runway that soon will be shifted to
the control of the Lackland installation next door, DiLuzio said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force will continue to conduct the basic training
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to looking for savings by inviting competitive bids
from private industry, the Air Force also is studying its own
operations at Lackland, aiming to cut costs through reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Its new plan, when completed, will be compared with the best
private proposal, which must be 10 percent lower than the Air Force
benchmark cost to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   DiLuzio estimated the civilian jobs affected would include the
more than 1,000 positions now at Lackland, plus about 600 civilians
scheduled to transfer from Kelly to Lackland in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force declined to confirm that figure Thursday. Several
spokesmen said more time was needed before the information could be
released.
</P>
<P>
   DiLuzio said his company's experience at Kelly would be an
advantage in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an established track record,'' he said. ``We will
treat people fairly in offering working conditions, salaries and
benefits. We must be more than sensitive in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Job losses are possible, whether Lackland is operated by private
contractors or by the Air Force under a new plan, DiLuzio said,
declining to guess the magnitude of the work-force reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The possible value of the contract would be between $80 million
and $100 million per year.

STUDY SAYS HANDFUL OF STORES DOMINATE APPAREL MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICOTRIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you think clothes all look alike and the same
stores are on every corner, it's not your imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 companies control nearly half the clothing sales in the
United States, according to a report released Thursday by The NPD
Group, a market research firm based in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are ultimately going to say, if store A, store B and
store C are all the same, why should I go shopping?,'' NPD Vice
President Kathaleen Mercer said. ``We can't continue to have the
sameness we all feel is in the marketplace right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, based on 1998 statistics, reports the following
retailers _ in order of sales generated _ lay claim to 47 percent
of the country's apparel sales: J.C. Penney; Wal-Mart Stores Inc.;
Dayton-Hudson Corp.; Kmart Corp.; May Co.; Federated Department
Stores Inc.; Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.; Limited Corp.; Dillard's Inc.;
and the Gap Inc. The report did not release dollar figures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, The NPD Group found the top 10 retailers controlled 35
percent of industry sales. All of the retailers listed were the
same with the exception of Macy's, which was named separately
because it was not yet owned by Federated, and the Gap, which did
not make the list.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10's increased share of the market is being attributed
to the flurry of retail consolidations this decade.
Cincinnati-based Federated bought Macy's, Bloomingdale's and the
now defunct Emporium. May Co. and Robinson's merged in 1992. And
Dillard's recently purchased Mercantile Stores Co. Inc., giving it
a strong hold of the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, stores like Wal-Mart and Target, a division of
Dayton-Hudson, have expanded and become more focused on apparel.
The Gap has diversified, with such offerings as BabyGap and the Old
Navy Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you've got a couple of stores that have very wide
reaching presence, it's very easy for them to make things look the
same,'' Mercer said. ``On the other side, as these retailers are
consolidating and building muscle, maybe they'll take more risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Other retail consultants were not surprised by the results, nor
did they find them disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco retail consultant Helen Bulwik was surprised those
10 companies didn't control an even greater percentage of apparel
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only consolidation of ownership. There are more stores
now than there were in 1990,'' she said, adding that consumers have
more choices. ``We probably have a more diverse selection than we
had nine years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it good or bad for the people? It's pretty irrelevant,''
said George Rosenbaum, chief executive of Leo J. Shapiro &AMP;
Associates, a Chicago-based market research firm that studies
buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum said specialty stores and smaller retailers are
capitalizing on consumer boredom with department stores, creating a
vibrant market for those retailers. ``For the talented independent
retailer with a point of view, times have never been better,'' he
said.

KRAFT NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Sending for Connecticut and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The decision everyone is waiting for isn't much of a decision at
all. Robert Kraft wants to keep his Patriots in Foxborough, in a
sweeping turnabout that signifies so much that is good and bad
about a man who inspires such respect and revulsion.
</P>
<P>
   It's delicious to think there's a dramatic decision at hand, the
kind of storyline on which reporters and politicos in this city
have always thrived. But be clear: NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue,
an agent of the owners, would not have negotiated a stadium deal
with political leaders in Boston if Kraft didn't want him
negotiating that precise thing.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Kraft say he never wanted to leave, not the day
he signed with tears in his eyes and Connecticut Governor John
Rowland at his side, not now that acrimony has blossomed into
action in Foxborough. Recall Globe sports scribe Michael Holley's
description of Kraft at that November signing: ``He looked like a
man who was worried about the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   One Kraft intimate says that soon _ possibly Sunday, more likely
later in May _ he will step before the cameras in that Everyman way
he sometimes has and announce that the team will stay where it has
always belonged: Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   He will talk again about how a part of him died when the Boston
Braves moved to Milwaukee in 1953. He will talk about how his
intention in buying the Patriots back in 1994 was to stop them from
leaving town, not to move them out himself. He will talk about how
Boston, not Hartford, is his home. Always has been. Now it always
will be.
</P>
<P>
   When he speaks, Kraft, a generous philanthropist, won't have to
mention the most astounding part of his decision _ that he'll forgo
$374 million of Connecticut's money to spend a couple of hundred
million of his own to build a new stadium in Foxborough. For this,
in the papers, on talk radio, all across this city, he will be
deified, hailed again as a hometown hero. Much of his sentiment is
true, the glory deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along,'' said one Kraft associate, ``it's not
about the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. But Kraft's legion of detractors paint a less
flattering portrait, saying the only thing more important to him
than money is the adulation that accompanies his ownership of a
professional sports franchise. The press coverage, the fans, are
like a narcotic, driving him to seek ever more.
</P>
<P>
   In Foxborough, Kraft used to board a golf cart before games and
drive among the tailgaters, slapping their hands and accepting
their praise. He had glass doors installed in his box so he could
step outside and toss hats to fawning fans.
</P>
<P>
   In matters of business, he is said to be ruthless, an
opportunist slow to lend a helping hand unless his own interests
are at stake. He once lashed out at a well-known civic leader as
``nothing but an employee, and if you were my employee, you'd be
fired.'' He launched legal action against restaurateur and former
racetrack owner Charles Sarkis as Sarkis was recuperating from
brain surgery. Connecticut, critics say, is just his latest victim,
another in a long list of foils.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very deceptive, dishonest person, and you can
quote me on that,'' Sarkis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All of this may work out fine for Patriots fans. In Hartford,
Kraft will need to summon every whit of ruthlessness to renege on a
deal that has so emotionally revived a city in dire need of
revitalization, its fervor captured in a banner Hartford Courant
headline the day after the deal was penned: ``Touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   His love of adulation, at least in Boston, will also have to be
true to walk away from the most lucrative such offer in the history
of the NFL, courtesy of Connecticut, for the relatively paltry $70
million proposal in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft associates say the decision awaits only the details.
They are waiting for the Massachusetts Legislature to pass the bill
that will make the proposal a reality. They are gathering all their
escape options from Hartford. They are mulling the idea of letting
NFL owners reject the move at their May 25-26 meeting. Old-line
owners, unimpressed with stadium handouts in small cities and
reeling from teams abandoning Los Angeles and Houston, are focused
on television viewership and its resulting revenues in major
markets like Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would someone walk away from a $374 million publicly
financed deal to go build your own facility on your own dime?''
Governor Rowland asked earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   That's a seemingly straightforward question with a complicated
answer _ an answer embodied in the complex motives of the New
England Patriots owner, Robert Kraft.

BIOGRAPHIES AND STORIES ABOUT REAL PEOPLE CAN INSPIRE CHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From books children learn about real people who influence _ in
tiny or giant ways _ their young lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those books fill community and school libraries, waiting
for a school assignment on the explorers or the Revolutionary War
or American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents relegate biographies and other books about real
people to assignments. What a shame. In everyday reading at home,
they could mix real-life stories with Charlie Bucket, Christopher
Robin and Angelina the Ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   These new ones are a good place to start:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Restless Spirit: The Life and Work of Dorothea Lange``
(Viking, $19) is the story of a haunting and unconventional life.
Lange is most famous for her photos of real people in desperate
situations: tiny Japanese-Americans with evacuation tags hanging
from the buttons of their cloth coats; cars overloaded with
blankets, goats and children, California-bound in the hope of
escaping the Depression; an 11-year-old boy picking hops in Oregon
in 1939 alongside his grandmother at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Her image of a migrant mother and her three children taken in
Nipomo, Calif., in 1936 has come to symbolize the tragic human
despair of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get my camera to register the things that were more
important than how poor they were _ their pride, their strength,
their spirit,'' Lange said.
</P>
<P>
   Other quotes head each chapter as author Elizabeth Partridge
unravels the story of an unconventional individual: ``The secret
places of the heart are the real mainsprings of one's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Partridge's book tells of a time in American history, a time we
know better because of the photographs Lange took.
</P>
<P>
   The book also is a story about photography: ``One should really
use the camera as though tomorrow you'd be stricken blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is about personal _ and national _ strengths and
frailties.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher recommends ``Restless Spirit'' for kids ages 10
and older.
</P>
<P>
   _ MFor readers ages 5-9, a story about the Great Depression is
disguised in ``The Babe &AMP; I'' (Harcourt Brace, $16).
</P>
<P>
   David A. Adler writes about a young boy who loves Babe Ruth and
yearns to see him play in Yankee Stadium. The boy's father has lost
his job and sells apples on a street corner. Embarrassed, he
pretends to go to the office every day, hiding the truth from his
wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   The boy hawks newspapers. No matter what the headline, he calls
out the latest news about the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   How he learns about his father, how he finally meets his hero
and gets a $5 tip, how he finally _ in July 1932 _ sees the Babe
play make a heartwarming story about a national hero who helped at
least this family through tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Widener's illustrations, in acrylics, work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rushmore'' (Scholastic, $17.95) captures another character
of American history. Lynn Curlee tells how Mount Rushmore was
carved and about Gutzon Borglum, the man who designed and fought
for it.
</P>
<P>
   With precise details, Curlee examines the many problems
associated with the project _ from disbelief to finances _ and the
hardships of men who set the dynamite charges and hung on ropes
from Harney Peak in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Children will
glimpse a bit of political maneuvering and ``offensive egotism'' in
the story.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as good as a visit to Mount Rushmore and the little
museum filled with data and photos below the faces. But it's good.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic recommends the book for ages 7-10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peter Rabbit, Mrs. Tiggywinkle and their woodland friends have
touched every child's life. ``My Dear Noel: The Story of a Letter
From Beatrix Potter'' (Dial, $15.99) tells how their creator,
Beatrix Potter, began doing children's stories.
</P>
<P>
   Potter, who lived in England's Lake District, was a farmer, a
political activist, an artist of nature and a storyteller. She had
no intention of becoming a famous creator of children's books. But
when Noel Moore, the 5-year-old son of a friend, became sick, she
wrote letters. One included ``The Tale of Peter Rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter continued to write animal stories to the Moore children,
illustrating each with fragile character-filled drawings.
</P>
<P>
   On the front endpaper of the book is a facsimile of the original
picture letter sent to Noel in 1893. The back endpaper shows the
same letter cleaned up for greater legibility and laid out in the
correct reading order.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Johnson tells Peter Rabbit's story clearly and with obvious
affection for the bunny and Potter. Recommended for ages 4-8.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Clique and double-clique _ reader
e-mail
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My column on the recent school massacre brought a number of
e-mail comments from readers, agreeing or disagreeing, that there's
no crueler society than school cliques.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   From Patricia Thompson, hkt-pat(at)lcc.net:
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I, when we were in high school in the early
1950s, got along with most everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember any of us being mean and ugly to the outcasts
and nobodies. But at that time none of us had much money, and it
made us more equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised to be kind to everybody and most of us lived in a
two-parent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, parents have a hard time teaching morals when they
don't have any themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From Sara Krone, Krone(at)tempest.coedu.usf.edu:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your article should be required reading for students in all
schools through the country. Besides the troublemakers being
counseled, the 'cliques' should be counseled also.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can't be friends with everybody, but ridicule and
taunting should never be tolerated against those who are
'different.'''
</P>
<P>
   From Christine Daniels, CrickleD(at)aol.com:
</P>
<P>
   ``What you failed to mention was the cold, hard fact that it is
not just peers who shun the 'misfits.' Many teachers and coaches
are guilty of doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   From Shari Crabtree, ctree(at)goodnet.com:
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the problem is how these young men felt about
themselves. The high school years are so difficult for young
people, especially if they are not in one of the popular cliques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the schools are part of the problem when they glorify
the athletes and barely acknowledge the scholars.''
</P>
<P>
   From Kevin McGehee, mcgehee(at)mosquitonet.com, who writes
McGeHee's News &AMP; Comment from North Pole, Alaska:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, heck, if I had known that being on the outs with all the
cool high school cliques could excuse mass murder, God only knows
what I could have gotten away with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only I had been in high school 20 years later than I was,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, everyone who was 'dissed' by the jocks or
cheerleaders or chess team or whatever in high school, please raise
your hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a turnout. How many of you have ever committed mass
murder? Anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   From James A. Aiken, jaiken(at)alaska.net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that you are correct that these groupings in high
school can have devastating effects on children and society. You
are incorrect when you say that this behavior is left behind when
we become adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year the state of Alaska passed an anti-gay rights
amendment. The religious right produced a very nasty campaign, with
lots of out-of-state money, which demonized gays and lesbians,
providing yet another clique on have's hurting the have-not's.''
</P>
<P>
   From Dave Deufel, Ld637535(at)aol.com:
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody, and I mean everybody, would show consideration
for a fellow human being, this tragedy would not have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have war on drugs, war on tobacco and now it's time to have
a war on this type of prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, here's a note that's being passed along through the
Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``To everyone that reads this:
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Jayson Martin from Littleton, Colo. I would like
everyone to please say a prayer for the safety and healing of
everyone who was involved in this terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one we can all agree with.

IF TERMITES ARE MUNCHING ON YOUR HOME, DON'T PANIC _ BUT TAKE
ACTION NOW

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How to spot 'em:
</P>
<P>
   If you are ever going to see a termite, now's the time. They
swarm in the spring, at dusk, usually after a rain.
</P>
<P>
   Often, termites are confused with flying ants. There's a
difference: Ants have a pinched or thin waist; termites have a
thick waist. An ant's antennae are bent; a termite's are straight.
Ants have eyes; termites don't. Both have two pairs of wings, but
for ants, the pair closest to the head is longer than the second
pair. The termites' two pairs of wings are equal in length.
</P>
<P>
   Both ants and subterranean termites (the type of termite we have
in this area) swarm at this time of year. The swarm is made up of
reproductives, young insects mature enough to mate, seeking to
start new colonies.
</P>
<P>
   A subterranean termite swarmer is 1/4 to 3/8 inch long, black to
pale yellow-brown, with pale to smoky-brown wings that cover the
body when the insect is not in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you missed the dramatic swarming moment. Here are the
telltale signs that termites have arrived: Mud tunnels along the
foundation of the house. Buckling paint or tiny holes in wood.
Wings or sawdust near windows, doors or garage. (Termites lose
their wings after swarming, their little way of saying, ``We're
here, have fear.'')
</P>
<P>
   There are 45 species of termites. Three are quite common in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Subterranean termites: These are the most prevalent, causing 95
percent of all termite damage, and are found in every state except
Alaska. They nest in the ground and enter the house through mud
tunnels or cracks as small as 1/64 of an inch. Because they need
moisture to survive, they constantly travel between the home and
the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Drywood termites: Typically found in humid southern coastal
regions. They attack homes through the air and gain entrance
through any gap, no matter how tight. They live in the wood, not
the soil, and need very little moisture to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Formosan termites: First entered the United States in Houston in
1965 and have traveled north and east. They have been discovered in
Atlanta and a few instances as far north as Denton County. They
look and act like subterranean termites, but because their colonies
are twice as large, they can eat more wood and cause extensive
damage in a relatively short time.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   How to kill 'em:
</P>
<P>
   Call a professional exterminator. There is no other way to
safely rid your home of a termite infestation.
</P>
<P>
   The professional pest-control company may suggest one
eradication method or a combination of these applications:
</P>
<P>
   Baiting systems: Monitoring stations are placed in strategic
locations in the ground surrounding a home. If termite activity is
detected, the monitoring devices are transferred into a bait tube
that contains a pesticide called hexaflumuron.
</P>
<P>
   Hexaflumuron does not contaminate the environment because it
does not penetrate the surrounding earth. Termites feed on the bait
and return to the colony to feed the colony members. This method
may require several trips for installation and monitoring. Control
may take from a few weeks to more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-slab method: A special tool or tube is inserted through
holes drilled in the concrete slab. The pesticide is injected
through the tube into the soil beneath the slab. Holes drilled in
the slab should be no farther apart than 12 inches in order to form
a chemical barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Trenching: A 6- to 8-inch-wide strip, 10 inches deep, is
excavated in the soil adjacent to the outside foundation wall on
slab homes. Homes on pier and beam foundations are trenched by
excavating soil in an area 6 to 8 inches wide around all piers and
pipes and along foundation walls. All the soil that is returned to
the trench has been treated with termiticide.
</P>
<P>
   Rodding: Involves the use of a long rod with a special tip to
penetrate the soil. The rod of pesticide is usually inserted about
every 12 inches. Rodding alone is not recommended, because gaps in
the treatment zone will occur. Rodding combined with trenching is
the conventional technique. Orkin uses a combination of rodding,
trenching and baiting, says company spokeswoman Susan Kirkpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Foam: This is used to apply termiticide to hard-to-reach places
such as chimney bases, dirt-filled porches and sub-slab areas. It
is a relatively new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tenting: This method is used to treat drywood termites. Your
house is covered with what looks like a giant circus tent, the
corners are laced up tight and then the interior of the house is
fumigated. This effectively kills all the termites in the house
buts does nothing to control subsequent infestations. Once the tarp
is removed it can take from a few hours to overnight for the
fumigant to dissipate. The extermination company uses a monitoring
device to check that all pockets have dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   Heat: This method is for drywood termites as well. Heaters are
used to raise the interior wall temperature to 140 degrees. It
takes several hours, but the heat does kill the termites. Freezing
systems work in a similar fashion, but they are not approved in
Texas as the house has to stay at a freezing temperature for
several days.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Survival tips
</P>
<P>
   According to John Chapman, an entomologist with Terminix,
termite damage usually is not covered by homeowner insurance
policies. Check yours now.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live in brick or stone houses are not spared either.
There is a great deal of wood in all houses, and termites will
penetrate through hairline cracks in concrete and mortar to get at
that wood.
</P>
<P>
   If you learn that termites are attacking your home, do not
panic. Do not let any company rush you into termite control
services. A delay of a few weeks will not make any difference.
</P>
<P>
   Deal with licensed, certified professionals. Their contracts
must include this information: Licensed and Regulated by the
Structural Pest Control Board of Texas, 1106 Clayton Lane, Suite
100 LW, Austin, TX.
</P>
<P>
   This agency warns customers not to use companies that base
prices on gallonage of material used, profess to have a secret
formula, have no listed phone number or claim to be endorsed by
Texas A&AMP;M University or any other state agency.
</P>
<P>
   No company will give cost estimates over the phone as the
treatment plans can vary wildly depending on the kind and size of
the structure and the amount of infestation. Solicit bids from
several reputable companies before you choose one.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Brooks, executive director of the Texas Pest Control
Association, says Texans should know there is a required three-day
cooling-off period to protect consumers in any home solicitation.

`CHAPLAIN OF BOURBON STREET' RETURNS TO PULPIT AFTER STRAYING FOR A
DECADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAIME JORDAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ As the founder of a storefront ministry on
New Orleans' Bourbon Street, the Rev. Bob Harrington made his name
ministering to pimps, prostitutes and gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry led to fame and fortune, interviews with
``Hustler'' magazine and Phil Donahue, and public debates with the
now-missing atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, the ``Chaplain of Bourbon Street'' had 46
religious albums and nine books to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   But with the notoriety and riches also came frolic, Harrington
said. And that frolic led to his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   He had an affair that ended his marriage, and he left Bourbon
Street to become a motivational speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his calling haunted him.
</P>
<P>
   He would drive for miles to avoid passing a church steeple. He
would cringe if someone called him ``Brother Bob.'' And at every
hotel he stayed in, he would hide the Gideon Bible in the
night-stand drawer.
</P>
<P>
   It was on one of these nights, while staying in a Los Angeles
hotel, that Harrington thought about killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   And it was on that night that he instead began to reverse his
decadelong absorption with worldly affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pride, arrogance, self-centeredness and stubborness became my
method for living,'' Harrington said. ``Satan tossed me a pass, and
I grabbed it and ran for defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 71, Harrington is making a comeback. He has left Bourbon
Street, but this time he hasn't left God.
</P>
<P>
   He has relocated his organization, The Chaplain, to an
unincorporated area near the Fort Worth suburb of Mansfield, where
he plans to help Texans overcome sin and return to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans say, `Don't mess with Texas.' Well, Texans are messing
with God,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he returned to the ministry in the early 1990s, Harrington
said, his listeners can see and feel the change in him. He spoke
alongside The Rev. Jerry Falwell and other evangelists recently at
a revival in Branson, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that people want to hear my story, because every
family has someone who my life can touch,'' he said. ``People want
to know those who've been through it. I don't recommend anybody go
through this, but it rings the bell of credibility. This man knows
what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime admirer Evelyn Linton, who was converted under
Harrington's ministry, said she and her husband prayed that
Harrington would return to his calling.
</P>
<P>
   Linton, 75, and her husband were two of Harrington's most famous
converts. They were the owners of a successful strip club in the
1960s in San Antonio, but after praying with Harrington, they gave
their lives to Jesus and closed the club that same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people doubted him,'' Linton said. ``So many
of the ministers fall, like Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Linton and her husband continued to pray for Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``God used him for us,'' she said. ``I knew it was for real. It
wasn't fake at all. You don't give up millions of dollars for
play.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Harrington married Texas native Becky Birdwell, 48.
</P>
<P>
   The two met 30 years ago at a revival where Harrington was
speaking. Birdwell Harrington said she may have fallen in love with
him then.
</P>
<P>
   She also watched his decline from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned about him when he was away from his
calling, because I know he was very unhappy,'' she said. ``His
ministry meant a lot to me. I rededicated my life under his
ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   His new life with Birdwell Harrington is far removed from the
turmoil and scandal of his past.
</P>
<P>
   They live in the country, where Birdwell Harrington raises
miniature horses.
</P>
<P>
   Remnants of Harrington's career line the walls of his home
office. The platinum and gold albums hang on the wall alongside
framed book jackets and photos of Bourbon Street and jazz
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Birdwell Harrington teases her husband about his move to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   While stroking her pet potbellied pig, Birdwell Harrington
shared a new joke between the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Bourbon Street to the farm, now you can tell people you
are really `out standing in your field,' '' she said, laughing.

EXI-STENCIL ART: ENAMEL WARE IS A FORGIVING PROJECT FOR BEGINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stenciling is a very easy craft, if you have a good stencil.
Simone Smart's book not only explains stenciling methods in
thorough detail, but also includes 40 stencils. She shows how to
use them on floors, fabric, walls and tableware.
</P>
<P>
   Smart recommends enamel plates and bowls _ the kind you find at
camping stores _ as excellent first projects. ``They are
inexpensive; any slight chips that they accumulate add to their
charm; and, more importantly, as paints dry relatively slowly on
enamel, any mistakes can be wiped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to stencil enamel ware.
</P>
<P>
   Materials:
</P>
<P>
   Item to be stenciled
</P>
<P>
   Stencil
</P>
<P>
   Heavy paper
</P>
<P>
   Spray paint appropriate for metal (read manufacturers' warnings)
</P>
<P>
   Spray adhesive
</P>
<P>
   Masking tape
</P>
<P>
   Brown craft paper, or newspaper
</P>
<P>
   Drop cloths
</P>
<P>
   Baffle (A piece of stencil board or cardboard, folded into a
V-shape for easy handling. It is used for deflecting and softening
a jet of spray paint, or for protecting parts of the stencil from
the jet.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. Practice stenciling before decorating your chosen surface.
Rolls of heavy paper provide an excellent surface to practice on.
</P>
<P>
   2. Make sure the surface to be stenciled is clean, dry and free
from dust. Smooth metal needs to be rubbed with steel wool so paint
can adhere.
</P>
<P>
   3. Spray the reverse side of your stencil with adhesive and
stick it firmly to the surface. If you are stenciling a rounded
surface, secure the stencil with pieces of masking tape as well as
adhesive. Protect the area surrounding your stencil with brown
craft paper, or newspaper, taped in place. Protect the floor with
drop cloths.
</P>
<P>
   4. For simple two-color designs, use masking tape to shield the
different areas of the stencil.
</P>
<P>
   5. Shake the can of spray paint for up to a minute, even longer
if the weather is cold. Test the spray on a piece of scrap paper to
make sure the paint is spraying smoothly and that you have the
right color.
</P>
<P>
   6. Hold the can about 10 inches away from stencil. Position the
baffle halfway between the paint and the stencil. Spray in short
bursts, of less than a second, directed at the top of the baffle,
and moving the can away from you. The baffle takes the first strong
hit of color and the trailing-off goes on the stencil. This will
take a bit of practice to get right.
</P>
<P>
   7. Try to spray two or three light coats of paint rather than
one heavy coat. A heavy spray is more likely to seep under the
stencil.
</P>
<P>
   As you effectively spray the baffle and not the stencil, the
baffle can become drenched with paint. If you are not careful, this
can drip onto your stencil. Replace the baffle or cut off the
soaked corner.
</P>
<P>
   8. Once your stencil painting is dry, it can be baked in the
oven to become dishwasher-proof. Follow the manufacturers'
instructions for baking.
</P>
<P>
   _

CLINTON'S POST-TRAGEDY SHOT FROM THE HIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton didn't flinch when ordering 18-, 19- and
20-year-old military personnel into places that he can't pronounce
to fight for the cause of freedom and democracy, but he has angst
over the thought of those same young men and women possessing
firearms when they return to their native soil.
</P>
<P>
   The stink of hypocrisy in the president's latest attempt to
control guns in America is enough to curl the nose hairs of anyone
who believes in the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, young patriot, your country trusts you enough to put a
fully automatic assault rifle in your hands so you can protect some
stranger's life half a world away. But when you get back to the
good ol' U.S. of A., you'll go from patriot to peon, 'cause I'm
gonna make it against the law for you to keep a five-shot .38
revolver in your night stand to protect your own sorry hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothin' personal, you understand. It's just that we don't have
a clue how to stop violent mental defectives, so I'm doin' the only
thing politicians know how to do in such cases, and that's intrude,
infringe and otherwise trample on the freedoms of law-abidin' folk
_ even ones willing to fight and die for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's move was so, so predictable. Instead of waiting to
find out exactly how many existing laws Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold violated to get their hands on the weapons used in last
week's terroristic attack on Columbine High School, he lets one
week pass before proposing ``the most comprehensive gun legislation
any administration has put forward in 30 years,'' to quote an
ebullient White House.
</P>
<P>
   One report this week indicates that at least 19 federal and
state gun and explosives laws were violated in the Colorado case.
Had Harris and Klebold survived their bloody rampage, those charges
alone would have been enough to put them away for the rest of their
unnatural lives. Does anyone really think that three, four or a
dozen more gun laws would have made a dog's worth of difference to
them?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not much of what the Artful Draft Dodger proposed is
new. He took darn near every gun-control initiative every devised
short of total confiscation (just give him time), added the new
wrinkle of background checks for people wanting to buy explosives,
and presented a reformulated package to an America still mourning
the events in Littleton. And then he flat-out admitted that
timing's everything in getting something like this passed in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   If gun-rights advocates even mention the Second Amendment after
such an event, they are accused of trying to capitalize on tragedy.
But it's perfectly acceptable for gun-control proponents to jump on
it like a duck on a June bug.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with this kind of reflex lawmaking: It doesn't work.
Even the traditionally anti-gun Democrat Tom Daschle of South
Dakota said he doesn't think more gun-control legislation is the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because the senator realizes that most of the
problems outlined in the ``omnibus'' crime package already have
corresponding state and federal laws on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Do laws deter evil? Did a prohibition against possessing the
components to make explosives stop the cross-wired psychotics in
Colorado? Or the group of Wimberley 14-year-olds who allegedly
conspired to blow up their school last week?
</P>
<P>
   Last I looked, a law against murder has been on the books since
... well, since Moses came down from the mount. But that hasn't
stop evil people from killing.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever know what twisted mix of societal influences,
chemistry and just plain evil turned Harris and Klebold into
murderers. But frustration over not being able to answer time-worn
questions has the administration lashing out at an easy target:
guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the quest to restrict potentially deadly weapons, people are
looking in the wrong place. How many American homes have teen-age
time bombs ticking away, undetected behind the closed doors of
their bedrooms, because Mom and Dad are too busy trying to fulfill
the materialistic dream of two SUVs in the driveway and a TV in
every room?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, probably not very many. The vast majority of Americans
are hard-working, law-abiding, decent human beings doing the best
they can to raise their children to be normal, functioning members
of society. But the deadliest concealed weapon in this country is a
neglected or ignored child.
</P>
<P>
   As information about Eric Harris continues to surface, it's
becoming searingly clear that everyone around him missed the signs
of impending doom. Those who did see them _ like the parents of a
classmate who was threatened by Harris on his Web site _ were
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, isn't it, that the only other ones who saw Harris for
the walking disaster he was were the Marines? Even America's
premier fighting machine knew there was something not right about
that natural-born killer.

SLAIN TEEN'S FAITH INSPIRES OTHERS AFTER LITTLETON TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cassie Bernall was asked if she believed in God. She said yes.
Then she was shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 17-year-old, one of the victims of the Columbine High
School horror in Littleton, Colo., is inspiring others nationwide
to stand up for their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Word about her confession of faith in the face of death is
spreading. Young people in Fort Worth praised her during a
discussion last weekend at Travis Avenue Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   One youth lauded Bernall and wondered whether he would have had
the courage to profess his faith in a similar potentially deadly
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered the same thing about myself,'' said Bob Ellis, a
spokesman at the West Bowles Community Church in Littleton, where
Bernall was active in the youth group. ``We all wish we would have
that kind of courage. But we will never know until someone is
pointing the muzzle of a gun at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said his church has been getting calls from around the
country praising Bernall's bravery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of her witness, it is causing many people to inquire
what this God is all about,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six members of West Bowles Community Church's youth group
were in Columbine High School when the shootings and bombings
occurred. But only Bernall was killed.
</P>
<P>
   She was known for carrying a Bible to school and had given a
Christian testimony in church the Sunday before she was killed,
Ellis said. A videotape of the testimony was played at her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the slayings may have been random, many believe
that Christians, athletes and ethnic minorities were targeted by
the gunmen, who were known to be fascinated by Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   One of those killed, Isaiah Shoels, 18, was an African-American
and an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Another, Rachel Scott, 17, also was a devout Christian who often
spoke of becoming a missionary. The Rev. Barry Palfer, senior
associate pastor of the Orchard Road Christian Center where she
attended, believes she also was killed for her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Bernall was with other students in the library
when the gunmen walked in and sought her out. They asked her if she
believed in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said `Yes,' and those were her final words,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernall's parents issued a statement saying their daughter was
in God's hands. They said they were not surprised by their
daughter's actions in light of her strong commitment to her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Youth evangelist Josh McDowell mentioned Bernall's uncommon
courage when he spoke to more than 70,000 teen-agers at a youth
conference in Detroit last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I go, I'm hearing about Cassie,'' McDowell said in
an interview after the conference, sponsored by Teen Mania
Ministries in Garden Valley, Texas. ``She is a true martyr for her
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, a Dallas-based staff member of Campus Crusade for
Christ, said the deaths of the young Christians may end up having a
major impact in encouraging other young people to take God
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   He devoted one of the Detroit conference presentations to the
Littleton killings, asserting that one of its causes was the
emotional turmoil of today's young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just underneath the surface of most teen-agers _ including
church kids _ is a raging anger,'' McDowell said. Parents,
especially fathers, must show more love and attention to their
children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell said the young Christians killed in Littleton will be
missed by their friends and loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``But their deaths may end up doing a world of good,'' he said.

CBS SHOULD FIRE STERN FOR CRUDE REMARKS AFTER LITTLETON TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a supermarket in Englewood, Colo., last week, a woman waiting
in line to pay for her groceries suddenly started to cry. Soon,
others at the checkout counter began to tear up as well. This is
what life is like after Littleton. Routine errands can be
transformed by raw emotion.
</P>
<P>
   At around the same time, radio personality Howard Stern had this
to say about the Columbine High School massacre: ``A bunch of
good-looking girls go to that school. There were, like, really
good-looking girls running out of there with their hands over their
heads. Did those kids try to have sex with any of the good-looking
girls? They didn't even do that. At least if you're going to kill
yourself and kill all the kids, why wouldn't you have some sex?''
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference between freedom and license. No one denies
Stern's right to say these things. It is the law of the land that
he can say whatever he might. But if he said these things in your
home, or anyone else's home, or in the homes of the families and
friends of the massacre victims, he would be asked to leave and
never come back.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he did say these things in homes all across the Denver
area and, indeed, all across America, over the airwaves of the
Infinity Radio Network. He did so as Infinity's most highly valued
entertainment asset. And he did so as a de facto employee of CBS.
Infinity is 82-percent-owned by CBS, once known as the Tiffany's of
broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was immediate. The Rocky Mountain News called on
Colorado-based broadcast outlets to drop Stern's radio and TV
programs. The Colorado state Legislature passed a resolution
seconding this idea and demanding that Stern be censured for his
remarks. Disc jockeys on competing radio stations called for
Denver-area businesses to cease advertising on Stern's show and
called on the shock-jock to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   There was no apology. There was instead the usual complaint that
Stern's comments had been ``taken out of context.'' Stern himself
denied that his comments had been insensitive and attributed the
backlash to basic broadcast economics. ``We're getting ratings and
starting to get attention,'' he said, implying that the controversy
should be understood as a tactical thrust in the ceaseless battle
for market share.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Stern expressed no remorse and tendered no apology
was hardly surprising. He has made a career of bad taste and
offensive behavior. His radio and television programs are devoted
to it on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising was that not one person from CBS said or did
anything to rebuke or even reprimand Stern.
</P>
<P>
   CBS President and CEO Mel Karmazin, who has shepherded Stern's
radio career, had no public comment. Leslie Moonves, the president
of the CBS Entertainment Group, had no public comment. And not one
single member of the CBS board of directors said one word about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   This might be acceptable if Stern was just another deejay
looking for a headline. But he is not. He is, in fact, CBS's most
highly compensated ``talent.'' According to Brill's Content
magazine, Stern is paid almost $14 million a year for his services.
And he is a money machine for the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Howard Stern Show'' generates enormous revenues. He
delivers millions of dollars to Infinity's bottom line. As a
result, Infinity is beating Wall Street's expectations. Wednesday,
the company reported that its first-quarter net income rose 55
percent on exceptionally strong sales of advertising on its radio
stations and billboard properties.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now is looking for ways to increase the show's
audience. It is eyeballing deals with Internet companies to augment
its distribution. Among those who will approve the final decision
to amplify Stern's voice are members of the CBS board of directors.
They include Westinghouse Electric Corp. chairman Michael Jordan,
Bell Atlantic chairman Ray Smith, former Philadelphia congressman
William Gray, who now serves as the head of the United Negro
College Fund, former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, and Aspen
Institute Chairman David McLaughlin. All of them have had
distinguished careers in their chosen professions and, by all
accounts, are fine people.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether these fine people will continue, by
their silence, to sanction Stern's conduct and whether, by their
consent, they will seek to expand Stern's reach. It is a question
of some moment.
</P>
<P>
   The country is at a crossroads. Either we begin to rebuild a
civil society or we don't. There is nothing we can do to bring back
those children killed in Littleton. But there are things that can
be done to make life in this country better.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is to put an end to a media culture that rewards
unacceptable conduct and encourages antisocial behavior. A good
place to start would be the dismissal of Howard Stern from the
employ of CBS.

POLICE SQUAD TARGETS CRIMES AGAINST PROSTITUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Police Department has created
an investigative team to deal exclusively with crimes against
prostitutes, whose illicit activity makes them easy prey for
thieves and assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The Crimes Against Prostitutes unit is designed to focus on
violent predators who attack prostitutes, dealers who supply them
with drugs and pimps who force them to stay on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Fred Lau said the new investigative unit did not
mean that the department condones prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prostitution is still illegal in San Francisco but we're
trying something different,'' Lau said. ``We're looking at the
picture and we see a group of women who are often victims of
violent crime ... That's something we will not tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau said prostitution is a more complex problem than rounding up
street hookers every night. Deputy Chief Richard Holder, who
oversees the new unit, said getting women out of prostitution is a
social service task that the police can't do alone. There are women
who have been arrested 20, 30, even 50 times for prostitution or
related crimes, but still find their way back to the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to just look at this from a very narrow law
enforcement perspective,'' Holder said. ``What we've realized is
that we can't just make more arrests and think that will solve any
of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau said prostitutes are entitled to the same level of police
service as anyone else in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a form of community policing for a very vulnerable part
of the community,'' Lau said. ``If someone is sexually assaulting
any woman in San Francisco, it's a crime that we want to stop. It
doesn't matter if she's wealthy or living on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the sex workers and some prostitutes themselves
said they approve of the new unit but remain wary of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Gina, a self-described prostitute who would not give her real
name, said she welcomed concerns for safety. ``But I've been
hassled by cops so much. I mean, do they really care what happens
to me?''
</P>
<P>
   A criminologist who has studied serial killers and their
penchant for murdering street prostitutes said many of the women
don't report crimes against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredibly high-risk victim group,'' said Professor
Michael Rustigan of San Francisco State University. ``Street
prostitutes are the favorite victims of serial killers. These are
among the most vulnerable people in our society. They get raped
often. They get robbed often. The incidence of crimes against
prostitutes is huge. When one is found dead, I believe that is just
the small tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent predators know that these women are not likely to
report crimes to police and if they do talk to police, they might
not be believed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The police unit was started on an experimental basis in December
and was unveiled this week. Since its inception, the Crimes Against
Prostitutes unit has investigated 24 cases, including several in
which women were kidnapped, assaulted, raped and beaten.
</P>
<P>
   So far, nine of the investigations have resulted in arrests and
several are still open.

expecting as recently as a couple of days ago. By Sylvia Nasar.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Neverrr trusht a naked woman,'' Sean Connery
counsels in his sibilant Scottish burr in ``Entrapment,'' the new
thriller about two thieves chasing the ultimate heist.
(italics)Eshpeshally,(end italics) he might have added, when the
woman is Catherine Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Connery's co-star, foil and _ inevitably _ love interest in the
movie has a way of parting men from their right minds.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's ``Mask of Zorro,'' Antonio Banderas disrobed her
with a few deft strokes of his sword, maddened by her fiery fencing
skills. Her May cover for Details magazine is a wet
head-and-shoulders shot designed to drive male readers to
heavy-breathing distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Much is suggested, but nothing revealed in Ms. Zeta-Jones's
steamy scenes on screen and in print. Just as well. Hollywood's
priorities have changed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   How an actress looks out of her clothes has become less
important than how glamorous she looks in them. There is the
head-to-heel scrutiny in the celebrity glossies.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar runway. The endless talk shows and commensurate
wardrobe calibrations. What to wear seems to have become almost as
important a question for a rising star as her choices in parts and
the men she is seen with.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Ms. Zeta-Jones, 29, rifled through the
closets in her suite at the St. Regis last Tuesday morning, at the
beginning of a publicity parade that will take her to Los Angeles,
Cannes, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   She had just flown in from Scotland the night before with her
brother, a publicity agent, and two trunks in tow that looked like
they might have needed their own plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love clothes,'' Ms. Zeta-Jones said. Normally, she said,
she just takes a carry-on: ``I'd just roll up a few essentials,
throw in a few books and I'm off.''
</P>
<P>
   But you don't just roll up the wine-colored Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
dress she was wearing with strappy Gucci heels and double-decker
diamond earrings on loan from Fred Leighton. It was just one of
several interview get-ups she would change into and out of that
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This I'm going to wear on MTV today, with a little black tank
top,'' she said, plucking from the bedroom armoire a bright blue
floral print skirt by Christian Lacroix, and tossing it on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   For ``CBS This Morning,'' she said she was thinking cashmere.
``You don't want a figure-hugging thing on a breakfast show,'' she
said. In the end, though, she ended up wearing a figure-hugging
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana floral top and tight skirt on the show. (``I'm
going to tell you something you've probably never heard before,''
said Mark McEwan, her interviewer on the show. ``You're a very
beautiful woman.'')
</P>
<P>
   She started opening the drawers of the armoire. ``That's my
underwear drawer,'' she said. ``You don't need to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides having studied ballet, tap dancing, acting and judo, Ms.
Zeta-Jones is well schooled in the art of flirtation.
</P>
<P>
   Striding around the suite, her dress clinging like a second skin
(make that a first skin), she tossed her long black hair around and
exclaimed, ``Love that!'' in her strong Welsh accent. ``Zorro'' had
half the Spanish-speaking world thinking Ms. Zeta-Jones was one of
them. She isn't, though she does find similarities between her
``volatile'' Celtic temper and the Latin temperament.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion show continued. She laid out a clingy hippie
ensemble in crocheted cotton from Christian Lacroix for ``The Rosie
O'Donnell Show'' the following morning. ``I thought I'd give Rosie
a little shimmy-shimmy,'' she said, demonstrating. But the piece de
shimmy was her dress for ``The Tonight Show,'' where she was booked
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut to Jay Leno,'' she said, brandishing a long, burgundy
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana corset dress. ``It looks like underwear off the
hanger, but it's wonderful on.''
</P>
<P>
   Constrictive costumes are a trademark for Ms. Zeta-Jones, a
period piece veteran. She was first noticed at 19 in an overheated
television drama called ``Darling Buds of May,'' set in England in
the 1950s, which put her in ``pointy bras, big skirts and
petticoats,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Her stardom was confirmed when the British tabloids began
rummaging through her garbage for embarrassing dirt. A 1994
adaptation of Thomas Hardy's ``Return of the Native'' on CBS got
her a New York agent. Two years later, Steven Spielberg watched her
survive the CBS ``Titanic'' miniseries and placed her in his
production of ``Zorro.''
</P>
<P>
   Between ``Zorro'' and ``Entrapment,'' her most notable
appearance was as a presenter at this year's Academy Awards. Her
red strapless Versace gown met with approval from the fashion
gantlet. She has an ``affiliation'' with Versace, she said, but
relies on her personal stylist to find her clothes from other
designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear anything just because it's hip or trendy,'' she
said. ``I need structure. I don't like flimsy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is she the kind of actress who slobs around in jeans and
sweats so people will think she's down-to-earth. ``I feel very
uncomfortable in jeans,'' she said. Her father, who owned a candy
factory in the Welsh town of Swansea always wore a suit and tie for
dinner. Boyfriends are expected to measure up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of them have dressed really well,'' she said.
``One didn't, and I thought I could change that, but of course you
never can.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ms. Zeta-Jones itemize her wardrobe, you feel yourself
in the presence of a pro, a clothes race horse. ``I do think it's
important to try and get it together,'' she said. ``If people are
going to send you these things, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Like many beautiful women, she professes not to be. ``I've got a
broken nose,'' she said (from a childhood misadventure).
``Freckles. I have broken capillaries around my eyes, and my neck's
funny from an operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many women with amazing bodies, she professes not to work
out. ``Not much,'' she said. ``I walk fast. And from my dancer
days, I'm always flexing my muscles.'' During the interview, she
ate two chocolates and boasted that she had pancakes for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   As a photographer was about to start snapping her portrait, Ms.
Zeta-Jones's brother, Lyndon, told her that the host of a British
television show, Jill Dando, had been murdered the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew her,'' Ms. Zeta-Jones said, covering her mouth in
shock. ``How awful.'' Almost as abruptly, she snapped herself out
of it. ``Anyway, let's think about that in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   She grabbed a springy Dolce &AMP; Gabbana dress and held it tightly
against her torso. ``I'm in my van Gogh period,'' she said. ``Ever
since I saw him in L.A., life has been more interesting.''

FRANKLIN GRAHAM SEES A GENERATION `RAISED ON BLOOD' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Colo.)  (mk) 
 By KATHERINE LEE and MATTHEW MILLER   
 Tuscaloosa (Ala.) News  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy
Graham and a prominent evangelist in his own right, is making
Tuscaloosa the site of his only U.S. festival this year. The free
event at the University of Alabama's Coleman Coliseum began Friday
and ends Sunday. It is expected to draw at least 15,000 people on
each of the three days.
</P>
<P>
   Graham arrives here fresh from two places that have been much in
the news: Kosovo and Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is a very sad place,'' Graham said, relaxing with
peanuts and a Diet Coke in a hotel Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of people who have literally
had to flee within a minute's notice. Some have walked nine or 10
days. They've had to eat grass, tree bark, anything for
nourishment. They've lost loved ones. Their families have been
raped or killed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to question the president,'' Graham said, ``but
to what extent do we get involved? Is America the policeman of the
world? Why Kosovo and not Africa?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes that the bombing campaign will open up a
long military involvement in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the bombing stops tonight, it will be weeks before
anyone goes home,'' he said. ``There are landmines, booby traps.
There'll be problems for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Graham spoke last Sunday at the memorial service
for the students and teacher killed at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., and appeared on MSNBC Wednesday night with Vice
President Al Gore for a video town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, an avid hunter, owns guns and has taught his own
children how to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns are a problem, but they are not the issue,'' he said. He
puts the blame squarely on violent films and video games, which he
says push children to expect ever bloodier entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is violence,'' he said. ``Where are we getting the
anger and hatred? How are we becoming desensitized to violence?''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, the father of four, said he has a device on his
television that blocks out anything more graphic than PG-13 films.
But he said such measures alone won't solve the larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are learning these behaviors,'' he said. ``They think
in order to be entertained, someone has to be raped. Someone has to
be beaten up. Someone has to be shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see much hope for this country. We're going to see
more police in schools. We're seeing a generation of children
raised on blood.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests a sin tax on violence similar to the taxes already
levied on cigarettes and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit them in the pocketbook,'' he said. ``Make people pay at
the box office. If they pay $10 for a ticket and another $8 fine,
they may decide it may not be worth it. And let the money go to the
victims of crime. Put it back into society.''

`ELECTION' BRINGS HIGH SCHOOL POLITICS TO THE CINEMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the many vividly evocative truths to surface in ``Election,''
Alexander Payne's disarming, dead-on second film, the one that
gives the most pause comes during the student body candidates'
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell), school weirdo and darkhorse
presidential candidate, uses her floor time to tell Carver High's
adolescent electorate that the contest is more or less only about
the candidate's egos and putting a victory on their college
application.
</P>
<P>
   They should vote for her: She doesn't want to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, her sentiments earn her the deafening gymnasium-wide
approval of her peers and the contempt of her two competitors, one
of whom is Paul (Chris Klein), her popular ex-football player
brother, the other is a heat-seeking success monger named Tracy
Flick (Reese Witherspoon).
</P>
<P>
   Tammy's observant truth is recognizable to anyone who's had to
suffer through a student government campaign in which the only
people who really cared about the election were the handful of
candidates and that one overworked teacher responsible for
organizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Rare was that kid who seemed to truly believe in the power of
student government. For most of us, the high school election didn't
seem to make sense because it was a public, organized campaign of
the politics of popularity that high school was all about. The
president never presided and the government never ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The film's droll touch is that Tammy only entered the race to
get back at the girl who broke her heart by dating Paul. She's as
wrong as she is right. With ``Election,'' Payne announces himself
as one of the keenest purveyors of the scattered pieces that once
was an American morality.
</P>
<P>
   For him, absolute good is as mythical and mythologized as
absolute bad. And he wades though the vast gray area in between
with aplomb, sagacity and a bracing lack of presumption, tempered
with unbridled suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In his first film, the unlikely dark comedy ``Citizen Ruth,''
Payne moves a pregnant Laura Dern between fervent pro-life and
pro-choice factions for her benefit. Ruth Stoops was trash _ wily,
conflicted, survivalist, but she had the integrity of a loaded
garbage bag. But like the extremists who used her first, she was
fundamentally decent.
</P>
<P>
   So are the folks powerwalking through ``Election,'' whose
setting has made the clever move from the New Jersey of Tom
Perrotta's '98 novel to Payne's native Omaha, also the home of
Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who wrote both his films with Jim Taylor, does a lot of
snooping around trash receptacles in ``Election'' as if that's
where the answers to life's mysteries had been thrown and only
Payne had the good sense to dig through them.
</P>
<P>
   The garbage is not where we meet Jim McAllister _ the history
and civics teacher and school council supervisor _ played by
Matthew Broderick in his most layered and resonant film stint that
puts him on the receiving end of the misery his Ferris Bueller
wrought principal Ed Rooney. But, slowly, he's drawn into it by
Tracy, a buzzing fly-trap of determined overachievement.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious to the point of dementia, so driven she could run you
off the road of life, Tracy looks to be that extracurricular
zealot, simultaneously poised and out of control. As far as she's
concerned, the Carver High student body presidency is her divine
right. Her schoolmates agree: She's running uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McAllister _ or ``Mr. M'' as he's greeted and addressed by
his students _ is put off by her bumper-sticker self-assurance and
the secret knowledge that she had a career-ending affair with his
best friend Mr. Novotny (Mark Harelik), the math teacher.
</P>
<P>
   So he recruits Paul the injured quarterback to run against her.
Tracy's flummoxed but more driven than ever. Then Tammy's 11th-hour
run sends everybody reeling and kicks the mayhem into ``Election.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, high school has become a marketplace for teenagers to
buy identities and show them off. In the movies, it's a glossy,
hormonal amusement park as superficially hodgepodge as a
refrigerator magnet. In the news, it's a bloodbath of nightmarish
proportions in which the faces, personalities and backstories are
lost in the sensationalist headlining of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's many beauties is the graininess that gives the
classrooms and corridors the homemade quality missing from
distressingly overproduced TV cover stories and the new teen flick
of the week, as well as the cornfed American nuance disappeared
from a farce like ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the usually sexed-up or underused Witherspoon is born-again
as an actress of fierce, head-turning revelation in a
hell-for-leather funny incarnation of snappy drive that finally
releases her from the remuda of her pony-actress peers.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's satire has given her and Broderick a bizarro
Humbert-Lolita antagonism in which Tracy sexlessly goads Mr. M,
who's having his own problems at home, to derail her train.
</P>
<P>
   It obsesses him to the point of blindness. It's among the
shrewdly observed relationships that elevates ``Election'' to the
level of quotidian sublime even if Payne has to climb through the
trash to get there.

UNDER TOUGH LAW, THOUSANDS OF KIDS FIND OUT THAT SMOKING IS
ILLEGAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Kristin Sullens was busted by a security
guard at The Parks mall in Arlington just as she stepped outside
and lit up.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco she smokes is not illegal, per se, but she is 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never crossed my mind that I might be arrested for smoking
a regular ol' cigarette outside the mall, on the way to the car,''
Kristin said.
</P>
<P>
   Even kids who can recite all the health risks are not always
aware that they are breaking the law when they light up cigarettes
or pop a pinch between their cheeks and gums.
</P>
<P>
   Under tough new Texas legislation, kids caught smoking can be
arrested, fined up to $250 and sentenced to an eight-hour tobacco
awareness course or to eight to 12 hours of community service. They
can also have their drivers' licenses suspended for up to six
months _ if they're old enough to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law went into effect in January 1998, nearly 3,500
minors have been sentenced to awareness programs, 160 have had
their licenses suspended and hundreds of others have paid fines and
completed community service.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin can't remember how old she was when she started smoking.
She was smoking about a pack-and-a-half a day when she was busted
last month. She was given a $100 fine, which she avoided by
attending a tobacco awareness program instead. (The program cost
her $50.)
</P>
<P>
   She has since cut down to 10 cigarettes a day and is trying to
smoke even less. ``I'm tired of my clothes stinking, and my breath
_ and cigarettes are expensive,'' she said as she finished filling
in her workbook during the final session of her awareness program.
</P>
<P>
   The tough new law is part of a comprehensive approach to
reducing children's access to tobacco products. Senate Bill 55 also
restricts vending machines and outdoor advertising and prohibits
giving free samples or coupons to anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Underage smokers say the new law is ``crazy'' or ``ridiculous''
and isn't going to stop anyone from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Harriett _ ``with two T's'' _ who asked that her last name not
be used, was busted for possession of tobacco after police officers
spotted a pack of cigarettes in her car, parked at a high school in
Richardson. ``I had heard from friends that they could bust you now
for possession of tobacco, but I couldn't believe they would really
do it,'' the 17-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   She was a little put out that she couldn't just pay her $125
fine rather than attend a tobacco awareness program, which cost her
$50 plus eight hours of her time, in order to keep from losing her
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the fine may be dismissed, except in cases of
repeated offenses, upon completion of an educational program or
community service. Failure to attend the program or do the service
may result in suspension of the minor's driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very weird. If you get caught smoking dope, you can just
pay a fine, but if you get caught smoking a cigarette, you have to
go through a program like this. It's like they consider cigarette
smoking worse,'' says Harriett.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls smoking her first cigarette at age 11. ``Of course I
want to quit,'' she says. ``Who wants to look old and wrinkled? I
know all the health risks. My grandmother died of emphysema, and I
can remember her lots of times disconnecting her oxygen tank and
going into another room to smoke a cigarette so it wouldn't blow up
or start a fire or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Harriett has tried hypnosis, acupuncture, nicotine gum and
patches _ ``nothing has worked so far.''
</P>
<P>
   She received a second citation for underage smoking just three
days before starting her tobacco awareness class.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING AWARENESS CLASS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Petty is one of about 230 state-certified tobacco
educators in North Texas. The educators are volunteers, many of
them counselors or teachers, who undergo a two-day state-sponsored
program to become certified. They are paid with the fees they
assess for tobacco awareness programs ($35 to $60).
</P>
<P>
   ``Classes are set up to help the kids figure out what's driving
them to use tobacco _ what role the media is playing, what it's
costing them today,'' Petty says. ``One of the main things I try to
do is get them to think, to figure out for themselves why they
smoke and whether or not it's worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get them to think about how tobacco makes their breath smell
bad and their teeth yellow and how expensive it is _ cigarettes
cost $3 a pack. I try to get them to think about what all they
could buy with all those $3 packs they are smoking,'' Petty says.
``They aren't worried about getting heart disease in 50 years, but
they are concerned about bad teeth, bad smell and wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   He conducts smoking awareness sessions in the employee training
room at the Kroger food store at Loop 820 and U.S. 80 in far
southwest Fort Worth, where the manager decided tobacco education
is a worthy cause and donated the space.
</P>
<P>
   The training room is also where the store's salesclerks are
taught about the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Any store clerk who sells tobacco to a minor commits a Class C
misdemeanor. Tobacco retailers are required to verify the age of
purchasers who look younger than 27. Fines for selling to minors
start at $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids think the new law is aimed at them, but it comes down on
the retailers heavier than on the kids,'' says Barry Sharp with the
state Office of Tobacco Prevention in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get it out to the community that it is
against the law for minors to purchase, possess or use tobacco,''
says Rhonda Sweeney of the Texas Department of Health's regional
Office of Tobacco Prevention in Arlington. ``We know children are
experimenting with it younger and younger. When we have the
opportunity, we like to start at the kindergarten level, teaching
them about the damage it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Texas Youth Tobacco Survey found that by sixth grade,
27 percent of public-school kids are already using tobacco. This
suggests that prevention efforts need to start earlier than grade
six, say state health officials. They hope to use part of the
mammoth $17.3 billion settlement from the state's lawsuit against
the nation's largest tobacco companies to expand prevention
efforts. But none of the settlement money has been allocated _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   PUFF BABIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a much higher prevalence of smoking among children in
Texas than there is among adults.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they are in sixth grade, 27 percent of public-school
children say they use tobacco, according to the 1998 Texas Youth
Tobacco Survey. Eighteen percent of the sixth-graders _ most of
whom are 11 or 12 years old _ smoke cigarettes, while 5 percent use
smokeless tobacco and 12 percent smoke cigars.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they reach eighth grade, 36 percent say they have
used a tobacco product in the past 30 days. By high school, it
rises to 43 percent _ 51 percent among boys, 35 percent among
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Among Texas adults, 22 percent report using cigarettes, and 9
percent report smoking cigars.

`SLC PUNK' GOES BACK TO THE GOOD OLD PUNK DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before floundering white boys turned to hip-hop as their muse
for rebellion, punk was their preferred lifestyle. Then it became
suburbanized, the subject of magazine cover stories and mainstream
fashion statements.
</P>
<P>
   The punks were disgruntled: Suddenly kids with Union Jack tees
and Mohawks were riding the escalator in the local galleria.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1985, and guys like Stevo (Matthew Lillard) of ``SLC
Punk!'' have all but had it with the commercial dilution of punk's
squalid grandeur. So what's he doing soapboxing near the
information kiosk in a Salt Lake City mall?
</P>
<P>
   He delivers an impassioned, intermittently funny soliloquy into
a low-angled camera. He's fired up, but neither Stevo nor the film
acknowledges that he's ranting from within the bastion of his
contempt. You can imagine our punk hero-preacher heading to the
Orange Julius to rinse out the post-sermon cottonmouth.
</P>
<P>
   But such is James Merendino's muddled, vexing, ultimately
engaging comic lament to the passing of a great, lost era in
American indie life. ``SLC Punk'' is part satiric essay and part
sobering drama that's often tidier, jokier and more childish than
the furious umbrage and fond nostalgia conjured by the film's title
sequence, which features a barrage of ska, punk and reggae album
covers.
</P>
<P>
   Merendino flirts with inefficacy in too many trite scenes of
us-vs.-them grandstanding and Lillard monkeyshining into the
camera. Though, Stevo allows Lillard, alas, to break on through to
the other side of his Jim Carrey-on-a-surfboard persona.
</P>
<P>
   Things begin in a reckless flurry of character intros,
exuberantly rendered anecdotes and the explanation of the social
hierarchy. Then, through both conceit and wimpiness, the movie
proceeds to wear out its welcome. Steve could leave his Salt Lake
City environs and go to Harvard law school like his unctuously
well-meaning dad (hugely funny Chris MacDonald). But he refuses to
sell out the way his former hippie parents did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sell out,'' his dad corrects. ``I bought in.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter; Stevo's not having it. Instead, he'd rather
hang with his best friend, ``Heroin'' Bob (Michael Goorjian) _ a
kid whose fear of needles keeps him doing the drug after which he's
nicknamed.
</P>
<P>
   Stevo is insouciant in an explosive, Matthew Lillard way that
gives Goorjian's pensive, searching expressions the complexity of a
Rubik's cube. He's what you keep your eyes on when Merendino's
storytelling bogs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``SLC Punk!'' doesn't get to where it seems to be heading until
Stevo and Bob drive to Wyoming with a guy named Eddie (Adam Pascal)
to buy beer. Merendino films the trip in exterior shots from the
American Western road. The moment is flashed with a momentary
brilliance and legitimate energy as they mount a rousing
retaliation against the liquor store clerk and its patrons, who
ridicule their weirdness.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of the three guys racing through the arid landscape to
their car situates them and punkness as a culture of angry
displacement, a way of life that's been pillaged akin to the
Indians whose Mohawks they've copped.
</P>
<P>
   It's handsome filmmaking that doesn't surface until the final 25
minutes during which Stevo and company's sense of marginalization
achieves the palpable, emotional import that's more expressive than
anything its characters' have to bitch about.

<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ You could tell this was no ordinary
university lecture. Hundreds of students eager for a seat formed a
line in advance and filled the 900-seat venue.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to see Michael Douglas, a 1968 alum and later a
part-time area resident, who paid a visit Thursday to his alma
mater, the University of California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   When Douglas nonchalantly entered, stage right, the audience
exploded into applause that was more than just a warm welcome. The
thunder quickly turned into a standing ovation before Douglas had
said a word. This was not just the decorous display of admiration
you might find at a film festival. This was barely contained
bedlam, the kind of exuberant show of affection lavished on rock
bands as they take the stage, or, perhaps more accurately, on a
winning team that takes the field.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is, in his way, UCSB's own one-man winning team, having
emerged from his days as a floundering freshman to reach the
pinnacle of superstardom. Many in the student audience, like
Gabriel Callahan, a 20-year-old film studies major, had come for
the chance to pick up tips from such a veteran Hollywood insider.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary insider. As revealed during an hourlong
question-and-answer session, the students clearly saw in Douglas
not just a star, but a former student, someone who walked the same
halls, strolled the same beaches, even lived in the same dormitory
and carried the same youthful dreams. Someone who might have been
like them.
</P>
<P>
   As one said: ``Thanks for coming back _ not as a superstar, but
as an alum.''
</P>
<P>
   After the boisterous welcome, Douglas, 54, mixed genial talk
about his professional experiences as an actor and producer with
personal reminiscences about his early days at UCSB. It helped that
one of Douglas' two on-stage interviewers was Stanley Glenn, now a
professor emeritus of dramatic art, who taught Douglas back in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment indicative of the conversational, often
light-hearted tone of the discussion that followed, Glenn handed
Douglas a script (``Michael has been a good sport about doing
this'') and had him re-enact a scene from his first UCSB role _ as
a messenger in the Shakespearean comedy ``Much Ado About Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Poignantly, that inauspicious campus debut had taken place in
the same Campbell Hall where Douglas spoke Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas was to read the lines just as he had at the time, Glenn
instructed, and the Oscar-winning actor obliged, breathlessly
reciting his elegant Elizabethan lines at a frantic tempo. It was
Shakespeare as auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas recalled how he had come running down the aisle, then
stopped just short of the stage, about where his father, screen
legend Kirk Douglas, was seated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father turned to his friend next to him and says, `What did
he say?''' As his accomplished father left the theater, Douglas
recalled, he said, ``Thank goodness I don't ever have to worry
about my son becoming an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas explained that despite his family pedigree, he was not a
natural-born actor, and it took time to find his way. His raspy
voice needed work, as Glenn explained. Douglas was also forced to
leave UCSB temporarily because of failing grades. But, as Glenn
corroborated, the young actor worked hard upon his return to learn
his craft, eventually taking on bigger roles and winning campus
awards.
</P>
<P>
   Student questions were alternately personal (``What did you do
on the weekends out here?'') to strictly professional (the pros and
cons of acting and producing). A number of students prefaced their
remarks by thanking Douglas for his $600,000 donation that made the
public purchase and preservation of some land near the campus
possible.
</P>
<P>
   More often, though, students prefaced their remarks with words
of praise. A few took their praise a step further. Joseph
Priestley, a 23-year-old political science major, unfurled a ``Wall
Street'' poster, which Douglas came forward to sign. Jaime Nio, 27,
a business economics major, leaped onto the stage after asking his
question and had a friend snap a picture of him and his favorite
actor. Douglas again obliged, amicably and unperturbed. No one in
the audience seemed to mind, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very inspirational to see someone who graduated from this
program and made it,'' said Vanessa Luke, 20, who used the question
period to invite Douglas to see her in an upcoming campus
production of ``Waiting for Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's funny. He's got a great stage presence. He's got a nice,
easy quality about him, which is good to see for college students
because that's what we like,'' Luke said.

RADISHES: EASY TO SPROUT, HARD TO GROW RIGHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somehow, radishes have earned the reputation of being easy to
grow. Possibly this is because the seeds germinate so quickly.
Radishes are often planted in a child's garden, because they will
oblige with seedlings before the child has lost interest and can be
ready to eat in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, growing good radishes is not easy. The goal is a
crisp, delicately piquant root, nice for slicing into salads or
eating out of hand with a sprinkle of salt and a slice of buttered
bread.
</P>
<P>
   But as often as not, the radishes come out of the ground so hot
that they scald the tongue, or they are mushy in the middle instead
of crisp or they are tunneled through by root maggots. How can so
much go wrong so fast?
</P>
<P>
   We're talking here about summer radishes, the fast-growing kind
that are usually thought of as round, red-skinned and
white-fleshed. There are many other shapes and colors of summer
radishes, and any of them can be grown with the same degree of
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, summer radish is a misnomer. Radishes that
are pleasantly tangy rather than fiery are grown in the spring or
fall, not in the summer. The hotter the soil, the hotter the
radish. Even the use of a garden row cover to keep leaf-munching
flea beetles and root maggot flies off the radishes may raise the
soil temperature enough to increase the radish's pungency.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but radishes tend to bolt to flower and seed as
the days get long. (Conversely, they must have at least six hours
of sun each day, or they will grow only tops and no bottoms.)
</P>
<P>
   The corollary to the speed with which radishes mature is that
they become over mature just as quickly. If they are not pulled and
eaten within a few days of reaching maturity, radishes will keep
growing and the cell walls will separate from each other. That
makes the interior spongy, which is called pithiness.
</P>
<P>
   Radishes must also have even soil moisture. If they are allowed
to dry out and then watered heavily, they will respond with such
exuberant growth that they split wide open. Many a gape-jawed
radish has been pulled from a garden after a spring thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to improve the chances of a superior radish crop is
to plant them in small quantities fairly often _ say, every five to
seven days, or as often as you think of it _ except in July and
August. You might lose a few of those sewings to maggots, heat,
excess rain or pithiness, but the law of averages says some will
grow to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three feet of row is plenty. You could sprinkle a few
seeds alongside a slower-growing crop like cabbage, knowing that
the radishes will be harvested before the cabbage needs the room.
As the radishes grow, thin them by pulling some as soon as they are
the size of dimes or even smaller and add them to salads.
</P>
<P>
   If you want big radishes, plant them deeply, about an inch and a
half deep. Planting radishes shallowly _ a half-inch deep _ results
in small roots.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite trick is to mix radish seeds with those of carrots or
parsnips to mark the rows and help break the soil for these
slow-germinating crops. Parsnips and carrots can take up to three
weeks to sprout (old-timers say they go to the devil seven times
before they come up), by which time the radishes will be ready to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   All varieties of summer radishes grow equally well or poorly, so
you may as well be adventurous. White Icicle is a venerable
variety, dating back to the 16th century, and its carrot-shaped
white roots are more resistant to pithiness than most. Plum Purple
stays crisp longer than the average radish, and its skin is a
wonderful purple-fuchsia color.
</P>
<P>
   French Breakfast radishes are elongated and pink, with a white
splash at the root end. They tend to be milder than most summer
radishes; unfortunately, they're also the quickest to become pithy.
</P>
<P>
   Easter Egg radish isn't really a variety; it's a mixture of
radish varieties with different skin colors. It's amusing to grow,
and it can provide radishes from the garden for a relatively
extended period because not all of the varieties mature at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Although they don't hold well in the garden, summer radishes
will keep in the refrigerator drawer for a month or so, if you
remove the tops.
</P>
<P>
   If you miss a harvest and the radish roots have become spongy,
you might leave the radishes in the ground until they bolt. Shortly
after the yellow or white flowers fade, the radishes will produce
seed pods, which look like tiny okra pods. Radish seed pods, picked
when they are soft and green, are spicy, crunchy and nifty in a
salad.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, a radish variety grown specifically for its
pods. It's called rat-tailed radish, and it produces long curled
seed pods that were commonly pickled in the 17th century to serve
with roasted meats.
</P>
<P>
   You can keep sowing summer radishes into the fall. Radishes will
handle frost, but can't tolerate being frozen. They'll take a
little longer to mature as the days grow shorter, but they'll also
be milder in the cool weather, and will hold a little longer in the
garden without getting pithy. In short, they will be almost easy to
grow.

   NEW YORK _ Ambassador Vladislav Jovanovic, a veteran diplomat
who is Yugoslavia's representative to the United Nations, believes
the Western media have failed to accurately portray his country's
side of the conflict in the Balkans. Speaking in English in his New
York office Thursday, he accused the United States of creating a
false pretext to start NATO bombing as part of a plan to eventually
invade and occupy Kosovo and all of Yugoslavia. He also said NATO
is intent on killing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic if the
alliance cannot force him from power. Here are excerpts of
Jovanovic's interview with Cox Newspapers Washington bureau chief
Andrew Alexander:

<P>
   Q. _ Ethnic Albanian refugees are accusing Serb forces of
atrocities. Do you believe this is happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ Those stories (are part of a) media war by . . .some
sources that are extremely well organized. It is not possible for
all those stories to happen. There was intensified fighting between
our security forces against the strongholds of the KLA (Kosovo
Liberation Army), who are terrorists. Those strongholds were
concentrated in Albanian-populated villages. In order to neutralize
such strongholds, you have to use heavy arms and machine guns, and
you have to accept that there will be some casualties among
noncombatants because the (KLA) combatants live with their
families. This explains why there are a lot of destroyed houses in
those villages. And also, there are those (among Serbs and ethnic
Albanians) who try to take advantage of the war to settle accounts
with their neighbors or to plunder or rape. I can imagine that some
people engaged in this kind of private justice. And as a result of
this, certain cases of the mass graves could have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ NATO says its air strikes began in part because Serb forces
started ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A. _ There was no ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ So, in your view, what caused the NATO air strikes?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ When NATO started to concentrate troops on our frontiers,
our army started to take defensive positions nearby. And for that
reason only, the strongholds of the KLA (along the border) were
cleared by our forces. Q. _ Are you saying that NATO used your
army's action against the KLA as a pretext to start bombing?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ Yes. But even beyond that, the main reason was our
non-acceptance of the (latest) so-called peace plan. It contained
unacceptable things for us, including . . .giving up the
sovereignty of Kosovo and accepting the right of NATO to enter and
occupy it. For any self-respecting country, this would be
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ Regardless of what caused the flood of ethnic Albanian
refugees _ Serb forces or NATO air strikes _ how can Yugoslavia
expect them to return to Kosovo if they fear for their lives
without an international peacekeeping force?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ We repeatedly have invited them to return and told them
they will be safe. Already, slightly more than 100,000 have
returned and nothing has happened to them. But for those who
returned to (the Kosovo city of) Pristina, NATO began bombing the
city and it caused them to flee again.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ What do you believe is the NATO objective?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ America's first objective is to see NATO implanted into
Yugoslavia. Kosovo is the beginning. It is of strategic importance,
militarily, in the region. The American intention is eventually to
occupy all of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ NATO planes recently bombed one of Milosevic's homes. Is
NATO trying to kill him?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ I believe the policy of (the United States) is to do away
with President Milosevic by all means. Politically if possible,
physically if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ Your government estimates NATO bombing has caused at least
$100 billion in damage. If the bombing continues through the
summer, will Yugoslavia reach a point where it is defeated without
surrendering?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ This is the determination of NATO. It is a crime _ when you
deliberately destroy the fabric of a society in order to break
their will. (The goal) is to destroy for the sake of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ What do you think the average American thinks of Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ They automatically associate the name 'Serb' with what they
are seeing in the media. Which is the result of systematic
brainwashing (by the Clinton administration through the U.S.
media). I have met a lot of Americans who react negatively to the
Serb name. But I have also met a number of common Americans _ a
doorman, a waitress, a policeman _ who all wanted to express their
sympathy with us because the mightiest country would exercise
deception against such a small country.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ Who are your allies in the world community?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ In your country, the term 'international community' is used
in one possessive way. You think it is those who join us or who
share our interests. In our case, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and
China and India have taken a public stand against this. But there
are a number of other countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa
and some Arab countries who have criticized NATO for an act of
aggression that is unlawful. They are very concerned that if the
bombing of NATO succeeds, it will be the end of any
multilateralism. Any other country could be a candidate to be
subjected to the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ Milosevic is portrayed by Clinton and some Western media as
an evil dictator. On a personal basis, what is he like?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ He is an introvert, which is not always a good quality when
you need to be at public functions. He is intellectually arrogant
and shy at the same time. He is a modest man. You can only start to
explain something and with extraordinary speed, he performs his
capacity to differentiate from things that are unimportant. His
logic is so powerful that nobody can match him. As a man he is
absolutely warm and charming.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ What about reports that he has dark periods and can be a
heavy drinker?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ No. He drinks probably one whiskey a day. He is a very
virtuous man. He is a faithful family man. He doesn't like to hear
people making sexual jokes. He is so fond of his wife that I don't
think he's known any other women in his life. He used to be a
communist. But his mentality is not fit for him to be a communist.
He is very pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ Is it possible to negotiate a peace?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ I am afraid NATO and the United States government are not
ready yet for a settlement, because that settlement would require
compromise and they want to win the war. They want to occupy Kosovo
and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Q. _ Do you anticipate NATO ground forces?
</P>
<P>
   A. _ Yes, possibly. But it will be disastrous. They are not yet
convinced that they cannot win the war. They believe that
Yugoslavia will crack. Later, when they realize that their plans
cannot come true, then perhaps they will think about compromise.

   NEW YORK _ ``Will it fit in the Subaru?''
</P>
<P>
   As repartee, the line doesn't have much of a Seinfeldian snap.
But it would do for a Thursday night in Brooklyn Heights as Chris
Eigeman, the frowning embodiment of New York angst in the sitcom
``It's Like, You Know,'' joined his wife and their best friends for
an evening out _ dinner, followed by a midnight trip to Home Depot
to buy a french door.
</P>
<P>
   Rewind. Chris Eigeman? Wasn't he the whining preppy in Whit
Stillman's film ``Metropolitan''? And in his new television show
(the last episode of the season will be Wednesday night on ABC at
8:30), isn't he the whining New Yorker who goes to California to
write about how awful it is, only to be seduced by the weather, the
wealth and the massage therapist with blinding white teeth? So
what's a Hollywood sitcom star doing in Brooklyn? He lives there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Moomba kind of people,'' Eigeman said far more
jovially than any character he has played. He and his party were
pouring red wine liberally and considering the lamb on the menu at
La Bouillabaisse, a seafood bistro on Atlantic Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Eigeman, 34, though an acerbic cynic in front of the camera, off
camera seems more like a complacent yuppie in an upscale sitcom. In
``Metropolitan,'' they had a name for people like him: Urban Haute
Bourgeoisie.
</P>
<P>
   Eigeman's wife, Linda, is a producer at CNN. Their best friends
are Marvin S. Putnam, a lawyer, and his wife, Kerith S. Putnam, an
executive at HBO. In the last five years, the two couples, who at
one point roomed together in Brooklyn, have worked their way up to
separate apartments with views near the Promenade. The Eigemans now
even have a bathtub that holds four. ``Not that we've ever used it
like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They play suburbanites in Brooklyn, meeting once a week to
indulge in what they call ``50's bridge,'' where socializing is as
important as winning. ``You don't know the rules very well,''
Eigeman explained, ``and there's a great deal of drinking. If I'm
the dummy, I read Architectural Digest.'' When there's confusion
about the rules, one of them calls Ms. Putnam's mother in New
Jersey for advice.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the typical who's-your-surgeon Hollywood types.
Squeezed into a cramped table at the back of the bistro, the
couples talked about everything from MP3 technology to an article
in The New Yorker ``written by that chef,'' Ms. Putnam said.
``Don't eat the chicken!'' the others recalled. ``No well-done
meat!''
</P>
<P>
   Eigeman, trying to remember which Henry he played at Riverside
Shakespeare Company, said, ``It's not IV, V or VIII, and there's
not a VII, so it's got to be VI, by deduction.'' There was a
spirited discussion of Ann Jillian's sitcom in the early 1980s,
though no one could remember its name. ``French Maid''? ``Windows
on the World''? Finally, a bearded man at the next table shouted
out: ``It's a Living!''
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the two couples piled into a Subaru Outback and
drove to Home Depot in Red Hook. ``It's the real man's Ikea,''
Eigeman said as he and Putnam began guy-talking about the french
door that Eigeman planned to install himself in the study. ``I have
a couple of chisels and a wood plane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The women went off to buy mops and garbage bags while Eigeman
tested the fire extinguishers, and bought one. At the checkout
counter, he laughed at what he called the ``impulse items'':
20-inch circular saws and grout.
</P>
<P>
   Last seen, the french door was wedged into the Subaru and the
couples were headed back to the Heights. It had been, like, you
know, midnight at Home Depot.

 &HT;    YUGOSLAV AMBASSADOR SAYS NATO BOMBINGS ARE A PRELUDE TO
OCCUPATION

   NEW YORK _ Ambassador Vladislav Jovanovic, a veteran diplomat
who is Yugoslavia's representative to the United Nations, believes
the Western media have failed to accurately portray his country's
side of the conflict in the Balkans. Speaking in English in his New
York office Thursday, he accused the United States of creating a
false pretext to start NATO bombing as part of a plan to eventually
invade and occupy Kosovo and all of Yugoslavia. He also said NATO
is intent on killing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic if the
alliance cannot force him from power. Here are excerpts of
Jovanovic's interview with Cox Newspapers Washington bureau chief
Andrew Alexander:

   SCHOOL-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ If much about the murderous
shootings in Littleton, Colo., seemed alien and bizarre, at least
one part of the story seemed familiar: the world of jocks and
nerds, preps and geeks, winners and losers that defined life at
Columbine High. The incident and others like it have been viewed
through many prisms _ guns and violence in the media, values and
parenting. But the fact that such horrors keep playing out in high
schools tracks longstanding and growing concerns about what kind of
educational and social environments they provide. By Peter
Applebome. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-ECON-REVIEW (Washington) _ The central U.S.
foreign-policy conundrum: In an age when your military adversary
can also rank among your biggest trading partners, and when your
military allies double as your fiercest economic competitors, does
America want weak global neighbors or strong ones? The question
helps account for the bizarre crazy-quilt of U.S. foreign policy
these days, and is complicated by the fact that the world stage is
crowded with weak countries jockeying for global influence while
struggling with economic woes. By David E. Sanger. (`i' category)

   RUSSIA-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Moscow) _ If Russia is the country it
seemed to be for 10 years after the fall of communism _ a nation
struggling to grow into a modern democracy _ then the West has a
long-term stake in its success. But if the real Russia is instead
the seething fury visible on the nightly news, the glory-mongering
defender of murderous hypernationalism, then its success looms

<P>
   OBESITY-DRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ To the pharmaceutical industry,
the corpulence of America means a booming new market for diet pills

Hoffman-LaRoche received FDA approval to sell Xenical, the first
pill to be approved since the government recalibrated its

welfare recipients to assess how their well-being has been affected
by stricter eligibility rules and work requirements, the question
of those not accounted for looms ever larger. They amount to more

it's normal to discuss intensely personal matters, money is not

   CHINA-PARTY-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Communist Party chief Jiagn Zemin
and his aides are worried that the party is losing touch with the

   KOSOVO-ANTIWAR-REVIEW (Washington) _ In the debate over NATO's
bombing of Serbia, the voice of the American anti-war movement has
not been heard to any great degree. Once it was so loud that it
helped end the Vietnam War. But it may be heard soon if the war
widens. By Irvin Molotsky.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-WARCOSTS-REVIEW (Washington) _ For an air war that in the
eyes of many U.S. generals has been run on the cheap, tactically,
bombardment of Yugoslavia could go down as the most expensive
military campaign, bomb for bomb, in history. It's costing more to

`NOAH'S ARK': ROCKING THE ARK _ A MOST UNBIBLICAL NOAH 
</HEADLINE>

   Who knew that the story of Noah and the ark included orgies,
pirates, action-movie fistfights, an Opheliaesque mad scene and a
large helping of Borscht belt humor? ``I didn't know what happiness
was till I married you,'' Lot (F. Murray Abraham) tells his wife
(Carol Kane). ``Now it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Lot and his ill-fated spouse, you may be asking yourself,
know Noah? Not in the Bible, but in ``Noah's Ark,'' a highly
peculiar movie to be shown Sunday and Monday night on NBC, the two
men are fast friends. The movie announces up front that it has
taken some poetic license with the biblical story, and that is an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   The irreverent script with its contemporary language (``I
wouldn't exactly call Lot righteous,'' says Noah's wife, played by
Mary Steenburgen, in a tone that wouldn't be out of place on
``Friends'') is not without its odd charms. Late one evening, when
Noah (Jon Voight) complains to God that building the ark is just
too big a job for one man's family, the Lord has a suggestion:
``Stop drinking, Noah. You'll get more done.'' Noah defends
himself, saying, ``I don't drink when I'm working.'' And God sees
his point.
</P>
<P>
   God's voice, by the way, is also done by Voight, which makes
some sort of religious statement in itself. As Peter O'Toole's
eccentric character said in the 1972 film ``The Ruling Class,'' he
realized he was Jesus Christ when he noticed that every time he
prayed he was talking to himself. (And it turns out that Peter
Barnes, who wrote the ``Noah's Ark'' script, wrote and directed
``The Ruling Class,'' which was based on his play.)
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour movie's basic plot is the same as the one in
Genesis. God instructs Noah to build a huge boat because the world
is about to be destroyed by the mother of all floods. Since the
only survivors will be the ark's passengers, God tells Noah to put
on board not only his family but also one male and one female of
every kind of animal on the earth, so they can go forth and
multiply when it's all over. It then rains for 40 days and 40
nights, everywhere. Afterward Noah sends out a dove to look for
land, the bird returns with an olive branch, humankind is given a
new chance and God promises never to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Hallmark Entertainment's ``Noah's Ark'' makes
some unusual additions. The battle scenes that open the film look a
lot like mud wrestling. When Noah comes home from the war, his
three sons, all of whom have British accents, just want to know if
he has brought them everything. Noah's wife, Naamah, is a terrible
cook. When the boys grow up, they save Ruth (Sydney Poitier,
daughter of Sidney), in a sort of Indiana Jones rescue, from
becoming a virgin sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   On the ark, Naamah almost gets away with throwing the
cockroaches, mosquitoes and other annoying creatures overboard. God
has decreed that to avoid procreation nobody can have sex on the
ark and this creates a good deal of frustration for the three sons
and their gorgeous fiancees, as well as for Naamah.
</P>
<P>
   James Coburn makes an appearance as a peddler on a geegaw-laden
boat that looks like something out of ``Waterworld.'' Soon after,
Lot turns up again, wearing an eye patch and having swordfights
with his fellow pirates on another craft that Kevin Costner might
have piloted in search of dry land. Sometimes the ark looks like
the monolith from ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   In this age of computer-generated wonders, viewers might expect
(and tune in for) some spectacular special effects. Inexplicably,
though, they won't find them here. The smoke, fire and lava that
surround Noah on Mount Topek almost make Cecil B. DeMille's 1956
parting of the Red Sea in ``The Ten Commandments'' look
technologically advanced. At other times, splashing water
practically screams ``computer imagery here.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the cast is loaded with Oscar winners, and they manage
to exude more dignity and vitality than you might expect. And
Barnes' script might have worked in other hands. But the
combination of his dialogue, John Irvin's direction and Paul
Grabowsky's score, which ranges from wacky '50s-sitcom-style
commenting notes to opening-the-heavens grandeur, canceled one
another out. And the result is mostly just silly.

THE SCARY EVOLUTION OF CRIME COMICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think I'll give it to yuh in the belly! Yuh get more time to
enjoy it!''
</P>
<P>
   Quick, name the year of that quote. It was 1954. Fredric
Wertham, a psychiatrist, was citing comic book dialogue to
illustrate its brutalizing effect on children. Of course it could
have been yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   When two Colorado teen-agers, armed with pipe bombs and
sawed-off shotguns, stormed Columbine High School and shot a dozen
students, a teacher and themselves, the video games Doom and Quake
and the Internet were named as possible suspects. In Time magazine
Jeff Inman, a youth intervention specialist in Georgia, indicted
the video games: ``You can actually set the gore level. ... How
much blood do you want to see splattered? It's sickening. It gives
kids a lack of respect for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Has anything changed in 50 years? Around 1948 Wertham noticed
that many juvenile delinquents consumed a lot of crime and horror
comic books. He argued in his book ``Seduction of the Innocent''
(Rinehart, 1954) that there must be a connection. ``An attitude
which I have found most frequently engendered by crime comics is an
attitude of brutality,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wertham described a boy who burglarized stores as saying, ``I
read the comic books to learn how you can get money''; a
10-year-old ``inveterate reader of comics'' who threatened a
3-year-old, ``Now I must gouge your eyes out!'' and a comic-reading
boy who was asked about his future profession and answered, ``I
want to be a sex maniac!''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Kiste Nyberg, the author of ``Seal of Approval: The History
of the Comics Code'' (University Press of Mississippi, 1998),
suggests Wertham was a more complex critic than most people think.
He fought racism and sexism in comics. He was one of the first
psychiatrists to look at the culture children are raised in rather
than at the character of individual children.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the first to point out the homosexual undertones of
Batman and Robin: ``Robin is a handsome ephebic boy, usually shown
in his uniform with bare legs. ... He often stands with his legs
spread, the genital region discreetly evident.''
</P>
<P>
   However complex he was, Wertham is now linked with his fanatical
campaign against comics in 1954. ``Seduction of the Innocent''
created such a tremor that during Sen. Estes Kefauver's
congressional hearings on juvenile crime, not only Wertham himself
but a number of comic artists testified. Walt Kelly, the creator of
``Pogo''; Milton Caniff, creator of ``Steve Canyon,'' and Joe
Musial, author of the ``Katzenjammer Kids,'' went to the hearings
to defend the virtue of newspaper comic strips and distinguish them
from the ``bad'' sort of comics.
</P>
<P>
   William Gaines, the head of E.C. Comics, publisher of ``The
Crypt of Terror'' and ``The Vault of Horror,'' tried to show that
things could be worse. As Ms. Nyberg describes it, Gaines insisted
his stories were in good taste and often had an ``O. Henry
ending.'' Kefauver then held up a cover of Crime SuspenStories and
said: ``This seems to be a man with a bloody ax holding a woman's
head up which has been severed from her body. Do you think that is
in good taste?'' Gaines said yes, then explained that it would only
be ``in bad taste if, for example, the severed head was held higher
and blood was shown dripping from it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the death of horror comics, crime comics and Mad comics
(Gaines turned Mad Comics into Mad magazine). But it was not the
federal government that intervened. When local and state
governments, pushed by parent-teacher associations and church
groups, tried to censor comics, they ran smack into the First
Amendment. Comic book publishers didn't wait to see the next step.
They began to police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954 they formed a trade association, the Comic Magazine
Association of America and, within that, the Comics Code Authority.
They agreed to rate their own comics, giving a seal of approval
only to those that complied with the code. And comic book
distributors vowed that they wouldn't touch anything without the
seal. Here are some of the requirements of the Comic Code, as it
stood then:
</P>
<P>
   ``Crimes shall never be presented in such a way as to create
sympathy for the criminal, to promote distrust of the forces of law
and justice or to inspire others with a desire to imitate
criminals. ... Scenes of brutal torture, excessive and unnecessary
knife and gun play, physical agony, gory and gruesome crime shall
be eliminated. ... If crime is depicted it shall be as a sordid and
unpleasant activity. ... In every instance good shall triumph over
evil and the criminal punished for his misdeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Comics Code even a comic of Bugs Bunny stealing
something would not fly, says Art Spiegelman, the creator of
``Maus.'' Soon after the code went into effect, only the bland
survived: funny animal comics, Archie comics and superhero comics
like ``The Flash'' and ``Green Lantern.'' It was not until a decade
later that underground comics took off.
</P>
<P>
   The Comics Code is still in effect. But its rules have changed
to fit contemporary standards, and now most comics slip through the
cracks anyway, because the distribution practices have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Are there any echoes of 1954 still rumbling in the current anger
against video games and the Internet? Spiegelman thinks people have
gotten wiser. ``They know it's not just video games, it's also
guns, the breakdown of the social fabric.'' People can see, he
says, that Japan has more violent comics than we do but far less
crime. They see that the causes of violence are complex. But one
thing has not changed. Complexity makes people feel helpless, and
when they feel helpless they look to the past, says Spiegelman.
``Remember when comics used to be funny?'' people say. Of course
that's what they said in 1954.

 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ At times Orlando Patterson seems to be
mouthing the arguments of racial neoconservatives. An
African-American who teaches sociology at Harvard University,
Patterson asserts that problems in many black neighborhoods stem
less from white racism than from the breakdown of the black family
and the behavior of black men who impregnate too many black women
and marry too few.
</P>
<P>
   In other moments, he sounds like a traditional liberal,
insisting slavery and the Southern sharecropping system are to
blame for such irresponsible behavior by breaking down the family
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, his proposed solution _ that more black women should
marry outside their race _ might take those on the left and right
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they make that important decision to explore the broader
marriage market, it may well put more pressure on Afro-American men
to shape up,'' he said in a recent interview. ``But the situation
right now is that they've restricted their market to the men who
have no incentive to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Such iconoclastic views have helped turn Patterson, 59, into one
of the most provocative thinkers on the status of blacks today.
Conservatives criticize him by saying he focuses too much on the
debilitating effects of slavery and not enough on the impact of the
welfare state. Black feminists chastise him for challenging the
notion that black women suffer from double discrimination because
of their race and sex. (He says they have more education and higher
incomes than black men.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some blacks take him to task for publicly airing
``dirty linen.'' Kenneth Tollett, a professor of sociology at
Howard University, said: ``I don't think he appreciates the
consequences of his analysis. He is apparently blaming black males
as the major source of difficulties in the black community. That's
just fodder for racists and people who want to denigrate the black
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet agitating people may be the point. ``It's a cultivated style
of his,'' said Glenn Loury, a professor of economics at Boston
University and a friend of Patterson. ``He means to be
iconoclastic. He means to go against the grain. He takes relish in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has been challenging conventional ideas about race for
years. He has written five weighty sociological treatises,
including ``The Ordeal of Integration'' (Civitas/Counterpoint,
1997) and ``Freedom in the Making of Western Civilization'' (Basic
Books, 1991), both of which won the National Book Award. He has
also penned three works of fiction, including ``The Children of
Sisyphus,'' published in 1964 when Patterson was 23 years old. It
was one of the first accounts detailing the lifestyle and
philosophy of Jamaica's Rastafarian cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was writing about the Rastas long before they became
fashionable,'' he said in the lilting accent of his native Jamaica
as he leaned back on a leather sofa in his fifth-floor office.
Patterson's skin is deep bronze; his hairline is receding. A wispy
goatee clings to his chin.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is his latest book, ``Rituals of Blood: Consequences of
Slavery in Two American Centuries'' (Civitas/Counterpoint), that is
causing a stir by weighing in on the long-running debate over how
much damage slavery did to the black family.
</P>
<P>
   During the antebellum period, abolitionists emphasized the havoc
slavery played on black family life. After the war, Southerners who
dominated American history for decades flipped that argument upside
down, calling slavery a stabilizing force on blacks whose family
life deteriorated after emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in this century, sociologists like W.E.B. Du Bois and E.
Franklin Frazier placed the spotlight once again on the
debilitating after-effects of slavery. As a young official in the
Johnson administration, Daniel Patrick Moynihan was influenced by
their work as he grappled with the persistently high level of
out-of-wedlock births among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Moynihan's argument was countered by Herbert
Gutman, a professor at City University of New York. In his classic
book, ``The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom,'' he tried to show
the resilience of the black family and how through all of slavery's
depredations, the family emerged relatively intact. Gutman's work
was seized upon by many black intellectuals who were both troubled
by Moynihan's depiction of black antisocial behavior and the
implicit message of Gutman's work: If black families survived the
ravages of slavery, then whatever problems that plague them today
are the result of contemporary racism.
</P>
<P>
   To Patterson, however, Gutman's theory is romantic nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, how can you have 270 years of history in which the
family was not recognized, women could be raped, beaten, stripped
naked in the fields before their so-called husbands; where men were
emasculated deliberately in the sense of having no authority, no
say over their children, even though they are encouraged to
reproduce; how can you have 270 years of that and claim that people
came out with intact families with a two-parents, suburban-type
family?'' he asked. ``It's just absurd on the face of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He scoffs at critics who say his forthright critique of black
men and families hurts African-Americans. And he is impatient with
the reluctance to discuss sexual relations between black men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson started writing about gender relations among
African-Americans in 1991, when Anita Hill leveled her explosive
charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas after he was
nominated for the Supreme Court. In an op-ed article for The New
York Times, he dismissed the charges and Thomas' alleged
``Rabelaisian humor'' with Ms. Hill as merely examples of a
``down-home style of courting.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was hissed at when he repeated his theory at a
conference at Georgetown University a year later. After the
experience, Patterson began to throw himself into the issue of why
the relations between black men and black women were in such a
sorry state.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His interest in the subject has a personal dimension as well,
however.
</P>
<P>
   His father was a police detective whose efforts to unionize
police officers caused him to run afoul of the British colonial
authorities in rural Jamaica, turning him into a bitter man who
drank too much and abused his wife. The couple separated when
Patterson was 2. They reunited when he was 11, but there was always
tension in the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess a lot of my attitudes toward gender and so on are
formed by that experience, because I do think that I've always had
difficulty relating to him,'' Patterson said of his father. ``They
came back together mainly for my benefit, but I'm not sure that was
a great idea for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At college at the University of the West Indies and in graduate
school at the London School of Economics, Patterson called himself
a ``radical nationalist.'' He demonstrated for an end to Jamaica's
colonial status _ he was 22 when the country became independent in
1962 _ and for a federation of Caribbean nations. His left-wing
politics led to a long friendship with Michael Manley, the late
socialist prime minister of Jamaica, to whom Patterson was an
unofficial adviser for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 a crackdown by a conservative Jamaican government
against leftist student and faculty organizations at the University
of the West Indies, where he was teaching, convinced Patterson that
he should move to the United States, where he was eventually
appointed to the Harvard faculty.
</P>
<P>
   His background and interests have created an odd mixture in
Patterson: a black student of the American racial dynamic who was
born and raised in a foreign country with a black majority. It is a
mixture he says allows him to view racial issues here with a fresh
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in a society in which almost everybody _ my kinsmen
anyway _ were people of color, you don't experience the kind of
racial hurts which from what I read in autobiographies and accounts
by sociologists are a very powerful shaper of attitudes,'' he said.
``Race was something I discovered intellectually later on in
college. But having a group of white people who were the majority
around you and constantly giving off signals of their superiority
and your inferiority was something I was spared the burden of
having to put up with.''

SHIFTING ALLIANCES IN CONGRESS ON MATTERS OF WAR AND POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Southern Exposure is a weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)  
(rk) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUNGHLIN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Oh, what a difference a war _ and a president _
make.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, when Congress debated whether to give President
Bush the authority to use force against Iraq, Republicans decried
Democrats who dared challenge the commander in chief on military
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to take this very serious and solemn act, we
must give the president, not 535 commanders in chief, the authority
to do it right,'' declared Texas Rep. Tom DeLay, criticizing
lawmakers who wanted to ``micromanage'' Bush's actions in the
Persian Gulf. ``For Congress to deny the use of force to back up
the world community's demands would make them meaningless. Force is
the only credible threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Now with a Democrat in the White House, Republicans are openly
challenging President Clinton's authority. And they don't seem to
care very much that other NATO countries have lined up against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to DeLay once more, this time griping about Clinton's
policy in the Balkans and suggesting that Congress ought to play a
bigger role in the military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should vote to forbid any deployment without congressional
approval,'' DeLay said, complaining that the administration ``has
played musical chairs'' in its use of forces and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetorical flip-flop is striking. And Democrats are just as
guilty of tailoring their public position to suit their party.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Vice President Al Gore, who eight years ago was the
senior senator from Tennessee. Gore groused about Bush's military
policy, saying he ignored the role of Congress as the country
prepared for war against Iraq. ``There is much to regret at this
point,'' Gore said. Now, he is Clinton's biggest cheerleader as
Clinton defends the NATO-led strikes in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Not all lawmakers appear to be affected by party label, with
some demonstrating a fairly consistent philosophy when it comes to
matters of war.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., took considerable heat
for his refusal in 1991 to support the use of force against Iraq,
saying the move to war was premature. In March, Hollings again
demonstrated his reluctance to send U.S. forces in harm's way,
refusing to support the airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   CHECK, PLEASE
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Rep. Spencer Bachus isn't too sure about this conflict
in Kosovo, but he is certain he doesn't want the United States to
be stuck with the tab.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Republican was part of a group that pushed for
a provision that seeks to get NATO reimbursement for the
overwhelming share of the military costs the Pentagon is paying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only right to expect our NATO allies to shoulder a
greater share of the load,'' said Bachus. ``We must demand they pay
their fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   And if a member nation refuses to pay or offers the old check is
in the mail excuse, the legislative language would require the
president to report on the reasons why no reimbursement was made.
</P>
<P>
   BEAM THEM UP
</P>
<P>
   With satellite television dishes sprouting across the South
faster than strip malls, it is no wonder Southern lawmakers were so
anxious to get involved with the recent House passage of a bill to
protect the ability of satellite companies to offer local broadcast
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new competition will come better services at lower
prices, so the real winners will be our constituents,'' said Rep.
Howard Coble, R-N.C., who engineered the agreement on the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., another player on telecommunication
issues, was even more enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will have a revolutionizing impact on the
marketplace,'' crowed Tauzin, praising the benefits to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, while the conflict in Kosovo might seem remote
to much of the public, members of Congress know almost all voters
have their own hands near the remote _ control that is.
</P>
<P>
   A BUG'S LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Escalating a fight with the Environmental Protection Agency, a
bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it
harder for the agency to ban certain pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act of 1999, the
bill would direct the EPA to use ``sound science and a fair
implementation process'' in deciding whether to take some dangerous
pesticides off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Allen Boyd, a Democrat, and Charles Canady, a Republican,
both of Florida, and Louisiana Rep. Chris John, D-La., are among
the bill's co-sponsors, many of whom come from districts with large
agricultural bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we certainly want dangerous chemicals prohibited, we
must ensure we do not use outdated, unscientific data to ban
products that family farmers depend on,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are expected to fight the measure, arguing
that the bill would only complicate efforts to introduce safer
growing practices to the American farm.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a dressing room deep in the men's department of
Macy's in Paramus, N.J., a lone linty french fry nuzzled a
balled-up Kleenex. A few cardboard strips, discarded from shirt
collars, beckoned from across the maroon carpet. Straight pins
glinted shyly under a bench.
</P>
<P>
   Paco Underhill, retail anthropologist and passionate shoppers'
advocate, gave me a withering look. Macy's, the look said, wasn't
doing its job, and he was mad about it. ``Righteous anger,''
Underhill had explained earlier, ``is very much a part of my
personal universe.''
</P>
<P>
   He stomped out of the dressing room _ at 6-foot-4, Underhill is
good at making a point with his body.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody feels a shopper's pain more acutely than Underhill, the
47-year-old founder of Envirosell, a market research company that
studies shopping habits, and a disciple of the late urban
anthropologist William H. Whyte. As Whyte did, Underhill applies
the field-study methods of a behavioral scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Envirosell researchers, known as trackers, follow shoppers
around stores, recording their every twist and sidle, their every
pat and fondle of the merchandise. Their notes are supplemented by
miles of what Underhill calls ``the most boring'' videotape, to
understand how people navigate stores, and what attracts or repels
them.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster), Underhill reveals that Americans walk the way they drive
_ on the right _ and so they habitually veer to the right aisles of
a store. (Australians and the British, by contrast, veer to the
left.)
</P>
<P>
   Underhill knows that most people, especially women, don't like
to be jostled or nudged on their bottoms when they are shopping,
and they will walk away even if they might have been interested in
buying. (When Underhill first observed this ``butt-brush factor''
at Bloomingdale's and described it to the store's president, a tie
rack was moved out of a narrow traffic lane, and, in the following
weeks, Underhill said, sales of ties soared.)
</P>
<P>
   Underhill knows that 65 percent of men who take jeans into a
dressing room to try them on will buy them, and that only 25
percent of women will. And he knows that a woman shopping with a
man will spend less time in a store than if shopping alone, or with
a friend, o even a child.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means if you are an American retailer is that it
makes sense to offer your best merchandise on the right side of the
store, in aisles wide enough for two-way traffic, and to give men a
place to sit and something to do in stores that sell mostly to
women.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to name a major American retailer that Underhill
has not admonished _ I mean advised. Executives of the Disney Store
were exhorted to crawl through their aisles on hands and knees to
see displays from a child's viewpoint, and to rearrange the goods
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Underhill charges from $30,000 to the high six figures for a
store study, and much of his advice borders on the obvious. Still,
clients like Starbucks, the Gap, AT&AMP;T, Estee Lauder, Walgreen's,
Apple and Citibank have all hired Envirosell.
</P>
<P>
   John Lombardi, the executive vice president for creative
services at Revlon, an Envirosell client, is a believer. ``Here's
an obvious thing, and that is that as the population ages, as our
customer ages, the bottom 13 inches of a shelf of products gets
harder and harder for her to reach,'' Lombardi said. ``And so, you
zone your products so they can be reached. You extend that
information into type size and package design. You sort of know
these things, but you don't realize it or do anything about it
until somebody says it. I love Paco's work. His _ what do you call
it? _ retail intelligence is just invaluable information. You can't
make this stuff up.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's was but one of a dozen stores Underhill and I visited on
a recent Saturday at the Garden State Plaza in Paramus. (``As
researchers of shopping, we routinely sacrifice our weekends,''
Underhill said sternly.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He took me on a tour of dressing rooms to prove a point, namely
that it is here that most retailers fall on their faces. ``A
dressing room is the closing place,'' he said. ``It's where you
make the commitment _ where the sale happens _ and very few stores
seem to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   First stop, the Disney Store. Zero dressing rooms! Even though
Disney's retail chain has begun selling clothes, not just T-shirts.
Underhill was furious, and it hardly mattered that Disney is a
client; he is as wonderfully abusive to clients as to nonclients.
``I get mad when they're dumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sondra Haley, the vice president for publicity and promotions
for the chain, declined to comment, citing company policy ``not to
comment on the work of our consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   Underhill has a checklist of features for what makes a dressing
room successful: adjustable, flattering lighting; ample room to
turn around in and to park a stroller; a ``chair plant,'' a place
for a companion to sit, and something for that companion to do
(toys for children or magazines for men). Not least, it should be
clean.
</P>
<P>
   A former stutterer, Underhill speaks carefully and in complete
paragraphs. You sense that his professional interests may have
sprung from years of small indignities suffered _ beds that were
too short for his lanky frame, suits that didn't quite fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tall people are desperate for choice,'' he said, flinging off
his denim jacket to reveal that the sleeves of a pale blue dress
shirt were two inches short.
</P>
<P>
   Following him around a mall is exhausting. You have to jog to
keep up. He seems to have become Everyshopper, an amalgam of the
50,000 or so shoppers he's observed over the years, all short of
time and fuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the couture department at Nordstrom's, a saleswoman opened a
dressing room at his request and then, after being grilled about
whether the lighting was adjustable (no), and Champagne was
available (no, but there was bottled water), she asked, ``Who
(italics)are(end italics) you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Paco Underhill,'' he said, and she fell back, clearly
confused.
</P>
<P>
   At Mimi Maternity, there were tiny dressing rooms with
saloon-style doors, (italics)but(end italics) these opened onto a
semi-private common area, with one chair plant, a box full of toys
and some well-thumbed Sports Illustrateds. (Is the American male
really such a cartoon?) In any case, Underhill beamed. The sales
clerk looked happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   At BCBG, there was a sitting area _ chair plants! _ outside the
dressing rooms, but no men's magazines or mirrors in the dressing
rooms. (italics)And(end italics) the common mirror was in full
sight of the front door.
</P>
<P>
   The dressing rooms in the Polo Jeans store were predictably
exquisite, paneled in the same wainscoting as the rest of the
store, with distressed wood doors, five clothes hooks, an aluminum
chair and rock-and-roll-y photographs on display _ an Annie
Leibovitz portrait of the Red Hot Chili Peppers naked in one room,
the work of Ellen von Unwerth in another.
</P>
<P>
   Underhill loved it all. But when a toddler barreled past,
roaring, he said: ``There is nothing for that child to do. Somebody
should have thought of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Do companies think about their dressing rooms? Lynn Tesoro, a
spokeswoman for Polo Ralph Lauren, said that dressing-room design
at Polo Jeans stores is meant to be an extension of the store's
design.
</P>
<P>
   As for Macy's, whose Paramus men's dressing room had been found
harboring a french fry and other debris, a corporate spokesman
issued a statement explaining that stores follow a checklist to
maintain comfort and cleanliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that in mind, we were dismayed to learn that your
findings in our Garden State Plaza store showed a breakdown in this
system,'' the statement read. ``Know that this has not, is not, nor
will it ever be our standard, and that we will make every attempt
to correct the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Paco Underhill is smiling.

FROM ROCK MUSIC TO RUSSIA, HAVING A LIKELY RESCUER FOSTERS MORAL
HAZARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About two years ago, Matt Hazard and three of his buddies got
together to form a new, hard-rock band in Minneapolis. At a loss
for what to call themselves, they settled on Moral Hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guitarist wanted to get my last name in the band because
we thought it sounded cool, but every combination seemed kind of
lame,'' recalls the 19-year-old Hazard. ``But we were all in the
same high school economics class, and one day our teacher began
writing that term on the board and we said, `That's it.''' He adds,
``It's seems like a relevant term to society.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Rarely do dreary economic abstractions become fodder for
mainstream media accounts or occasional cocktail party chatter as
the concept of moral hazard has.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, moral hazard describes any situation, though usually
a financial one, in which risky behavior is encouraged because risk
takers believe they will be bailed out of mistakes by a third
party.
</P>
<P>
   Think Asia and Russia here. The international financial crisis
that erupted in Thailand and began tearing across the globe nearly
two years ago left the policy wonks who had to deal with its
consequences in a philosophic bind. Many lenders and investors had
plowed money into rapidly growing countries like Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea in the belief that governments there
would always prop up certain key companies. But many of the
corporations were so larded with bad debt that the governments
couldn't keep them afloat forever. In Russia, feverish financial
speculation was fueled in part by the belief that the Russian
government wouldn't default on its bonds and by the perception that
Russia, with all its nuclear warheads, was too big for anyone to
let it fail.
</P>
<P>
   Investors badly misjudged the situation in all these countries,
lost money when economic meltdowns occurred, then stampeded for the
exits. That put all the countries in a squeeze. After all, it's
hard to keep food stocked in stores and an economy moving ahead
when nobody will lend you more money. So the International Monetary
Fund and the U.S. Treasury Department both advocated lending fresh
funds to these nations to get them over the hump and back onto the
happy track of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no!'' shouted critics of that idea. They said that if
the IMF and the Treasury Department gave more money to the
countries, both the countries and speculators would feel safe to
invest recklessly in the future because they knew they would be
bailed out. Classic moral hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When individual behavior is random and the downside is bid up
by implicit guarantees of being bailed out, you encourage risky
behavior,'' observes William A. Niskanen, chairman of the Cato
Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. Asia and Russia,
of course, aren't the only arenas in which moral hazard has reared
its ugly head.
</P>
<P>
   Other well-known cases of moral hazard at work include the
savings and loan debacle in the United States a decade ago, in
which owners of old-fashioned mortgage banks felt safe taking
fliers on dangerous real estate forays because the banks' deposits
were insured by the federal government. The government-led rescue
of the once high-flying hedge fund, Long Term Capital, also might
be morally hazardous if it encourages free-wheeling speculation
disconnected from the threat of financial ruin. Although no public
money was used to keep the fund afloat, critics said the Federal
Reserve's orchestration of the rescue sent a signal that some
funds, no matter how much gambling they indulged in, were too
important to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance underwriters and their customers regularly engage in
morally hazardous transactions. Health insurers constantly weigh
what medical treatments they will cover, trying to decide if
coverage will induce patients to pursue elaborate and expensive
treatments that they don't necessarily need. The flip side of this
is, of course, insurers or HMOs that become so tightfisted and risk
averse that patients can't get treatments they surely need. Home
ownership also can be a morally hazardous proposition. People who
might otherwise avoid building homes in Malibu because of the risk
of fire and mudslides or in hurricane ravaged parts of the East
Coast might do so anyway because their home insurer picks up the
tab if their house is destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Morally hazardous situations may also crop up outside the narrow
confines of the financial world. Take major league baseball, for
instance. The American League, unlike the National League, has long
had a designated hitter rule that allows a team to substitute a
better batter each time their pitcher would normally step up to the
plate. And where is the moral hazard in that? It turns out that
American League pitchers tend to throw more bean balls at batters
than do their counterparts in the National League because, some
studies say, such risky _ even nasty _ behavior can't be punished.
The designated hitter rule keeps the bean baller safely away from
the plate, where an opposing hurler could otherwise launch
fastballs at his head in retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, timing is everything. While easy to spot morally
hazardous situations in retrospect, after the risk has surfaced, it
can be much harder to discern moral hazard _ or act on it _ in a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, as canny an observer of
financial markets as anyone in Washington, was attuned to the
ambiguities of moral hazard when he defended the effort to pump
fresh funds into South Korea in 1997 as that country edged toward
economic collapse. ``Look, I wouldn't spend a nickel to bail out
investors or creditors,'' he said at the time. ``The purpose of
this is not to help creditors; the purpose is to help Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that saving the country also meant saving
investors who had placed errant bets there.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, say those who disdain relying on moral hazard as a hard
and fast standard. They say a more nuanced balancing act must be
struck between not encouraging risky behavior and forestalling an
economic crisis before it spins further out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people just say, `Oh, there's a moral hazard here,'
and rule out a whole range of actions that might be taken,'' says
Barry Bosworth, a senior economics fellow at the Brookings
Institution in Washington. ``I'm not saying we just disregard moral
hazard and charge ahead, but it is often the case in financial
crises that those who triggered the crisis don't pay at all;
average citizens do.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid moral hazard is to establish better frameworks
for anticipating and reducing risks in a world where different
countries hew to wildly different ethical and financial standards.
Along these lines, Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the
Exchequer, has called for improved financial disclosure, better
oversight and stronger ties between the public and private sectors
to stave off financial disasters in various parts of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Big central banks, if they're honestly run and efficiently
operated, also can be useful lenders of last resort when a crisis
looms. Bosworth points out that the United States banking system
operated for about 100 years without a central bank to act as a
lender of last resort during financial crises. So before the
creation of the Federal Reserve earlier this century, the country
frequently lurched from financial crisis to financial crisis, a
pattern that has largely disappeared here since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Niskanen at the Cato Institute doesn't rule out
lending during a crisis if all somebody needs are a few bucks to
get them over the hump. But if larger problems such as corruption,
cronyism or wasteful economic policies exist when a bailout is
being considered, he is inclined to raise the moral hazard flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should respond in a crisis based on rules
established before the crisis occurs and not based on rules
negotiated during a crisis,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But others demur from this point of view, noting that pulling
the plug on a borrower _ even if it is the right thing to do in
terms of avoiding moral hazard _ can often make a bad financial
situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game about getting the right balance between
systemic risk and allowing markets to function,'' said Morris
Goldstein, a former International Monetary Fund official and a
senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in
Washington. ``I lean more to the case by case approach than to the
idea of laying out rules in advance. It's very difficult to lay out
an either-or rule because systemic risk can sometimes be
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some rock bands who share Goldstein's philosophy and
extol the virtues of benevolence if the threat of moral hazard
arises, especially when rules are not clear or maybe don't even
exist, like in the notoriously fickle and unfettered music
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we researched it on the Internet, moral hazard seemed to
be people whining about the U.S. helping out other countries,''
notes Hazard. ``But in the music industry you just can't make it on
your own, and you always need someone to bail you out if you're
going to make it. So that side of moral hazard has a lot of meaning
for me.''

<P>
   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gradual warming trend over the Middle West will continue to
mount Saturday as the core of an expansive, stationary high
pressure system holds steady over the region. However, afternoon
warmth will be tempered near the shores of the Great Lakes, where
the uneven heating of land and water prompts cool air residing over
the lakes to push inland.
</P>
<P>
   With the stationary high over the Middle West interrupting the
upper-level winds that steer weather systems typically from west to
east across the nation, an orphaned area of disturbed weather off
the Southeast coast will remain nearly stationary, setting the
stage for clouds and pockets of rain and drizzle from the eastern
Carolinas to northeast Florida. Feisty ocean winds will average 15
to 25 mph along parts of the Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   After another chilly morning, the Northeast will warm to levels
above seasonal readings, though afternoon warmth will be tempered
near the Atlantic coast as developing sea breezes escort cool air
inland.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt over parts of eastern Colorado
and west Texas as a sluggish front and trailing jet stream
disturbance work in tandem to lift moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico. A few of the storms will become severe, with tornadoes or
damaging straight-line winds possible in isolated spots. Heavy rain
and flooding are also possible, while moderate to heavy snow will
fall above 9,000 feet in the some of the mountains of northeast New
Mexico and eastern Colorado. Meanwhile, high winds will buffet some
of the deserts of southern New Mexico and southern Arizona.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Blocking High &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under relentless sun, the risk of wildfires heightened across
Michigan the past few days. Meanwhile, flooding downpours doused
east-central Colorado. To the south, heavy snow blanketed the
mountains of northeast New Mexico. All three extremes were related
to a blocking high pressure system stalled over the upper Middle
West this week. Near the center of the sprawling high, evaporation
rates have been high, leaving the upper Middle West parched. On the
unyielding western flank of the high, a low pressure system came to
a virtual halt, setting the stage for recurrent rain and snow.  &QL;

<P>
   Three years, some 2,000 parties and dozens of widely read
columns later, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson has mixed feelings about being
London's longest serving Drop Dead girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm emotionally bankrupt,'' Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson said over
lunch at the staid and sober Oxford-Cambridge Club. ``Then again,
who wouldn't be with my schedule?''
</P>
<P>
   London's ultimate party girl, Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson sometimes
goes to three cocktail parties a night, often of a promotional
nature, galvanizing paparazzi, bouncers and former boyfriends as
she makes her way around town.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, she has chronicled her Holly Golightly
life in a column in the Style magazine of the Sunday Times of
London.
</P>
<P>
   The column _ originally titled ``The Social Diary of Tara
Palmer-Tomkinson,'' but now, for some reason, called ``Yah!'' _ has
made the whippet-thin Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson, 27, one of London's
best-known faces.
</P>
<P>
   The site for the lunch was deliberately selected so she would
not be bothered or recognized. The plan was only partly successful.
She was not bothered at the Oxford-Cambridge Club. No one is
bothered at the Oxford-Cambridge Club. But she definitely was
recognized, as the discreet smiles of the elderly men at the next
table showed.
</P>
<P>
   Could she smoke? Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson asked nervously. Alas, she
could not. This was, after all, the Oxford-Cambridge Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I am in boarding school,'' she said, as she glared
at a portrait of Clement Atlee, the late British prime minister.
Atlee glared back. Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson ordered another white wine.
</P>
<P>
   Did she consider herself a party girl who writes, or a writer
who parties?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson, who was dressed in an elegant gray shift,
didn't like the question and asked to leave the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must forgive Tara,'' Toby Pocock, her zealous new
entertainment agent, said later. ``She has been under great strain
lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it was true. Last week, only days after the lunch,
Ms. Palmer-Tompkinson was reported by British newspapers to have
checked into a clinic near Wickenburg, Ariz., for treatment related
to stress. Jeremy Langmead, her editor at The Sunday Times,
confirmed that she was ailing. ``I just hope she's getting well,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One would never have guessed that stress and strain were threats
to Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson, judging from her light-as-air column.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Donna's do, I rushed off to Elle Macpherson's 30th
birthday party at Harry's Bar,'' she gushed in a typical recent
installment. ``It was so exclusive that I can barely tell you a
thing about it _ all my A-list chums are terrified I will report
their little indiscretions. Perish the thought _ and don't worry,
Elle, about that business with you, the whipped cream and the
ring-tailed lemur, mum's the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson's knack for conjuring up the velvet-rope
world in which she and her friends circulate, while also making
gentle fun of it, has made ``Yah!'' one of The Sunday Times' most
popular features.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell the Clarence is rock 'n' roll as there is an eye
mask in the minibar,'' she reported in another column, in which she
regaled readers in her breathless way, with the tale of sorties to
Dublin and the Clarence Hotel, owned by Bono of U2. ``I certainly
needed it after two nights on the town with my traveling companion,
Miss Dee,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dressed head to foot in our new Ghost wardrobe, we started off
in the Kitchen, the club in Clarence's basement. Being a bit of a
superstar, I was provided with security for the night, which meant
that a poor girl called Stephanie had to wait outside every time I
went to the loo.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any proper It Girl (the term adopted by the British press
for Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson and her kind, meaning a well-photographed
beauty with little to do besides go out at night), Ms.
Palmer-Tomkinson is to the manner born.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up on her family's stately 1,200-acre estate near
Basingstoke. ``Please don't mention Basingstoke; it's an ugly town
full of ugly people, in Hampshire,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Charles Palmer-Tomkinson, was Prince Charles' ski
instructor. Her mother, Patti, nearly died in a 1988 avalanche that
killed a royal aide, Maj. Hugh Lindsay. Over the years, Ms.
Palmer-Tomkinson has also accompanied Prince William and Prince
Harry on holidays to the royal retreats at Klosters, Balmoral and
Sandringham.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson briefly had a career working for
Rothschild's. Then, using the Chelsea flat she shared with her
sister, Santa, who works in publicity for Polo Ralph Lauren, as a
partying base, she shifted into frivolous mode as a fashion stylist
and model by day and a queen of the nightclubs after dark.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1996 came a widely published photograph of Ms.
Palmer-Tomkinson being kissed platonically by Prince Charles, who
was trying to play up his lighter side. Ray-Ban called and asked
her to model its sunglasses on her next ski trip to Klosters,
followed by other sponsors seeking to exploit her instant celebrity
for sales.
</P>
<P>
   She said yes to them all, including Mazda, which bestowed on her
a sleek black MX5 in return for promoting the company image. She
also said yes to Prada, Chanel, Versace and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after The Sunday Times interviewed her in its Style pages,
the editors so liked ``the look and sound'' of her, Langmead
recalled, that they gave her a column.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think I am the person I write about,'' she
said, as she relaxed in the vacant library of the Oxford-Cambridge
Club. ``They don't realize that half the time I'm putting myself
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the crank letters, and the brickbats from other
journalists, including the rumor that she does not really write her
columns, despite winning a writer of the year award in 1998 from
London journalists who cover society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tara's column is edited creatively,'' Langmead said. ``What is
important is that Tara lives the column.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a drag on a cigarette after lunch, Ms. Palmer-Tompkins
said: ``The press in this country is only happy if you are
successful for a day. Then they tear you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she conceded, the grind does get her down sometimes.
Nevertheless, she insisted, brightening, that being an It Girl has
its rewards. She has capitalized on her celebrity for cameo roles
in two recent films.
</P>
<P>
   In one, ``Mad Cow,'' she plays herself and is thrown out of a
nightclub. She is also planning a book of some of the letters (not
the crank ones) she has received from readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not necessarily crazy about being an It Girl anymore,''
she said. ``But I don't mind continuing to use it. Besides, I love
my diary. I plan to keep on writing it until I'm 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Mummy and Daddy are very proud of me.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Ms. Palmer-Tomkinson made her entrance at the
Bluebird Club on Kings Road, for a party promoting a sports-car
race called the Gumball 3000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no idea of what this is about,'' she had
said blandly over lunch. ``Then again, I usually don't.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment she seemed to falter as she approached the
threshold of the club, where techno music throbbed.
</P>
<P>
   But as the flashbulbs popped, she seemed to pull herself
together. She flashed a gallant smile and strode forward, conscious
of her duty.

<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ If opposition candidate Mireya Moscoso
triumphs in Panama's presidential election today, analysts say it
would be a startling comeback and a touch of revenge for one of the
nation's most snake-bitten political families.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso floundered early in the campaign. But in a pair of
recent polls, she moved two points ahead of Martin Torrijos, the
candidate of the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   Banker Alberto Vallarino is in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, 52, is the widow of Arnulfo Arias, who was elected
president of Panama three times. All three of his terms were cut
short by coups.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leaders of the final uprising against Arias in 1968
was Omar Torrijos _ Martin Torrijos' father _ who ushered in 21
years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Peggy Scranton, a Panama expert at the
University of Arkansas, Moscoso and her Arnulfista Party believe
that their time has finally come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memories go back here, they really do,'' Scranton said.
``Surely, in the party's mind and in her mind, they are thinking:
`Now, it's my turn.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although Moscoso and Torrijos often refer to the past, the
winner will begin a five-year term at a crucial moment for Panama's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Panama Canal treaties, the United States will turn
over full control of the waterway to Panama at noon Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lingering doubts about Panama's ability to
administer the canal on its own and to develop thousands of acres
of canal properties and military bases left behind in the American
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country will be without `gringos' for the first time,''
said Gustavo Gorriti, an associate editor at the Panama City daily
La Prensa.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Panamanians, pocketbook issues have defined the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Ernesto Perez Balladares, who took office in
1994, Panama has privatized the telephone and electric companies,
slashed import tariffs, and reformed the labor code to make it
easier for companies to hire and fire workers.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies have led to annual economic growth rates of
between 2 and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, a flood of cheap imports has angered farmers and
factory owners. Unemployment is 14 percent. Many Panamanians say
the wealth has failed to trickle down.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel cheated,'' said Ever Chi Pardo, an economist at
the University of Panama. ``The economy needed fundamental changes
but it should have been done gradually.''
</P>
<P>
   A Panamanian businessman who did not want his name used put it
another way. ``The poor people hate the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such indignation helped to scuttle President Perez Balladares'
drive last year to seek a second consecutive term. He wanted to
amend the constitution to allow re-election, but the initiative was
overwhelmingly rejected in a voter referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the anti-government sentiment is now hurting
Torrijos, who served for four years under the current
administration as vice minister of government and justice.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is what Gorriti describes as a backlash against
party dominance. For 26 of the past 31 years, the Panamanian
government has been controlled by the military or the PRD, which
was founded by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the PRD is Panama's largest party and has an impressive
get-out-the-vote machinery. If he wins, Torrijos is expected to
follow many of the government's policies.
</P>
<P>
   But in campaign appearances, Torrijos has tried to project a
softer, more caring image. He also has invoked the memory of his
father, a popular figure who spent heavily on public housing and
other social projects during his regime. Omar Torrijos was killed
in a 1981 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can not create wealth and development without social
justice,`` Torrijos said last week at a huge rally in Panama City.
``The new Panamanian nation is an alliance between the people and
the government to defeat underdevelopment, poverty and injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Torrijos may have peaked too early. In recent weeks his
double-digit lead in the polls has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   When the newspaper La Prensa published an opinion survey last
week showing that Moscoso had moved into the lead, PRD militants
bought 20,000 copies in a desperate effort to block its
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso married Arnulfo Arias in 1969 when he was already
Panama's most famous civilian politician. Arias won the presidency
in 1940, 1948 and 1968 and is believed to have won in the
fraud-tainted 1984 elections as well.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Arias died in 1988, Moscoso formed the Arnulfista
Party and narrowly lost the 1994 election to Perez Balladares. If
she wins, she would become Panama's first-ever female president and
Latin America's fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doors have been opened,'' Moscoco said at a press conference
last Friday. ``Now both men and women identify with us. And many
women feel that we are capable of doing the same job as men.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso paints herself as a populist and has promised to raise
tariffs, jumpstart local industry, and help farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But Panama is locked into a structural adjustment agreement with
the International Monetary Fund that runs through next year. That
will make it difficult for the incoming government to substantially
alter the nation's economic course, Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, who studied interior design at a Florida community
college, has no government experience and critics claim that she
has a poor grasp of economics and international affairs. During the
campaign, she refused to debate Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   Since losing the election five years ago, however, Moscoso has
made hundreds of visits to impoverished Panama City neighborhoods
and to rural villages, and such barnstorming paved the way for her
rise in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has worked like a dog,'' Scranton said. ``She has paid her
dues.''

 AT A GERMAN MUSEUM, McCARTNEY EXHIBITS HIS OWN PAINTINGS  
 (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIEGEN, Germany _ This is a pretty little town in the hills of
North Rhine-Westphalia, but even the most loyal burghers say it's
not a place where much happens and it certainly isn't a cultural
center.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday. Sir Paul McCartney, the ex-Beatle, arrived at the
local museum here Friday to unveil an exhibition of his own
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed and ready for a barrage of put-downs from the
world's cultural critics, McCartney opened a display of 73 oil
paintings that includes abstract portraits of his late wife, Linda,
a ghostly homage to John Lennon and a whimsical series that treats
Queen Elizabeth II like a Warhol pop icon.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, casting around for a new way to express himself,
began painting about 16 years ago, but until now he had not shown
his work in public. Indeed, he said, he had declined many
invitations from would-be exhibitors because they all seemed
obsessed by his celebrity and oblivious to the work itself.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Suttner, Siegen's cultural events manager, persuaded
the rock star that he was indeed serious and that Siegen was the
perfect venue for a debut. Suttner made his appeal in a letter that
he slipped to one of McCartney's technical staff at a concert five
years ago in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolfgang Suttner was the first person to approach me
seriously,'' said McCartney on Friday at a news conference that
drew 300 reporters from across Europe. ``There were many that did
in fact approach me and said they were willing to put on an
exhibition, but they hadn't seen the paintings. Wolfgang was the
first one who came up and said, I'd like to look at the pictures
and examine them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people will just automatically not like it
because it's me, but that's OK,'' said McCartney. ``It's always
risky to do something outside your own field. But I think I've
always been taking risks. Back when I was part of the Beatles, a
lot of what we did was risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the paintings veer toward Abstract Expressionism,
although some are cartoonlike caricatures, such as one called
``Elvish Me'' in which Sir Paul paints himself as an Elvis
look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the paintings are devoted to Linda McCartney, who died
last year of breast cancer. They range from the fairly concrete _
``Yellow Linda with Piano'' _ to a four-part series of increasingly
abstract views of him kissing her. In ``Linda Yellow Cross,''
painted in 1991, he depicts her with what almost seems like
schoolboy adoration: a saintlike face above a simple red cross, a
heart as if drawn by a child and a castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the style is maybe beginning to emerge,'' Sir
Paul said when asked whether he had found his metier. ``That was
always the hardest question, what do I want my style to be? I just
decided to do anything I wanted at first and see where that
leads.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney said he began painting when he turned 40 and was
looking for something new to do. Though he had long been drawn to
art, he had tended to write himself off. It was Willem de Kooning,
he said, who finally motivated him to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said life begins at 40, and I wanted to begin but
nothing began,'' Sir Paul said. ``I had this problem, that `I don't
paint,''' he continued. But de Kooning persuaded him to try. ``He
was one of the first people to liberate me,'' said McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Suttner said he had been working on the exhibition for years. It
started when he read that McCartney had become an avid painter.
Having a serious interest in painting himself and having staged
many small art exhibits over the years, he wrote a letter asking
the singer for permission to see the paintings and evaluate their
potential for a show.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney responded and soon allowed Suttner to view the
paintings at his home in Sussex, England.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the McCartney studio, Suttner said, he was
stunned by the breadth of work and its free-spirited nature. That
started a long series of discussions and preparations, which
eventually led to a decision more than a year ago to go through
with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney's collection now totals about 600 paintings, out of
which he and Suttner selected the ones for the show. The exhibit
runs until July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Paul made clear that he takes his art seriously. He refused
to answer questions about his music or any subject unrelated to the
paintings. At the same time, he took pains to avoid suggesting that
he was anything more than a dedicated amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm slightly embarrassed by it,'' he remarked at one point.
``It would be so much easier to be a musician. But I do enjoy it,
and I don't see anything wrong with it.''

 &HT;    SENATORS TO DEBATE USING 'ALL NECESSARY FORCE' IN BALKANS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Friday reluctantly agreed to debate a
resolution allowing President Clinton to use ``all necessary
force'' against Yugoslavia, but the outcome seemed likely to be
another signal of congressional doubts about the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent the resolution,
sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to the floor with no
recommendation on whether it should be approved. However, leaders
of both parties said they would move Monday to table, or kill, the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House voted to require Clinton to seek
congressional approval before sending ground troops to fight in the
Balkans, and also declined on a tie vote to approve a resolution
supporting the U.S.-led NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., told fellow members of the foreign
relations panel he was concerned that when McCain's resolution came
up for Senate debate, critics of the war might counter it with a
proposal to tie Clinton's hands. The result would be confusing
signals ``sent around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Coverdell contended, the debate was ``premature''
because Clinton has not announced plans to expand the air war to a
land operation. Indeed, the president has said he opposes ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Coverdell, also a member of the GOP leadership, said
the Senate would debate the resolution for about four hours Monday
afternoon. The leadership had planned to avoid taking up the McCain
measure altogether, but the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the
War Powers Act requires such resolutions to be considered by the
full membership.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure conceded that a majority of the
senators would vote to table their motion.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution prompted a hurried meeting of the Foreign
Relations Committee in cramped quarters off the Senate floor just
as members were fleeing town for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Senators sharply differed not only over the McCain proposal, but
whether Congress has an obligation to debate the Balkan air war,
now beginning its sixth week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, America is at war,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., a cosponsor of the McCain resolution. ``We in Congress ...
surely have some responsibility to step forward and address what we
believe should and should not be done and not duck that
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Congress of the United State buries its head on this
one,'' he added, ``why are we here?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., an anti-war activist in the Vietnam
era, countered that now was not the time to criticize the effort in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret enormously what happened in the House,'' he said,
calling it ``gutless and craven'' for the House to vote not to
support the air war and then to propose $12.9 billion in emergency
military spending, twice as much as the president sought.
</P>
<P>
   But a Democratic colleague praised the House action against the
air war. ``The United States Congress has not supported the
bombing, plain and simple,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis. ``I
think it was a good vote.''

 &HT;    Releasing the Columbine victim inside all of us
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ She was standing on the sidewalk in front of
Longview High School. The woman, who looked to be in her 30s, was
holding her baby in one hand and clutching her little boy's hand
with the other. The look on her face reminded me of the looks on
the faces of war refugees. She was gazing longingly at the school.
</P>
<P>
   It was last Wednesday, the day our kids had been hearing would
be the day something bad would happen at their school: a bomb, an
armed assault, something. You name it, the rumor mill had churned
it out. It was the day that 700 of their classmates did not attend
class.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, according to LHS conventional wisdom, was the reason
school officials employed 24-hour security guards and an explosives
sniffing dog for an indefinite time. It was the day the statewide
minimum skills test was to be administered to ninth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, an 11th-grader, had not answered my queries for
several days about whether she wanted to attend school on that day.
I had told her I believed it would be safe but that I would never
require her to go somewhere that she was afraid to go.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn is a very methodical person. Her decisions are usually
carefully considered, and this was a big one. She had conferences
with me and with her friends who in turn conferred with their
parents. Some of the adults decided to keep their children at home;
others told their children there was no way they would allow them
to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't get my answer from her until Wednesday morning. The set
of her jaw told me as she sat in the living room waiting for me to
get ready: She was worried but she would not be bullied.
</P>
<P>
   We put her stuff in the car. We had a lot of stuff because
toward the end of the school day, she was to leave for a student
council convention in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering the student drop-off area, I immediately spotted
the principal on the front patio but far fewer kids than normal.
The usual din was absent. The principal good-naturedly asked what
in the world we were up
</P>
<P>
   to with suitcases, a cooler and a chocolate cake in tow. We
reminded her of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   As I returned to my car after many hugs and kisses and goodbyes,
I saw the faces of many of the students who were waiting for the
first bell to ring. They were worried, some looked afraid, others
looked confused.
</P>
<P>
   My heart ached for them but I also became angry that the insane
acts of people they would never know were placing such a burden on
our kids in Longview, themselves now victims of the senseless
rampage in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Close to tears, I walked down the steps and saw the woman on the
sidewalk. I had an appointment in another town and I was already
late, but I couldn't pass her by.
</P>
<P>
   In Spanish, I asked if I could help. Her voice shaking with
emotion, she responded, ``Tengo miedo.'' I'm afraid.
</P>
<P>
   I put my arms around this other mother, a stranger, and we
cried. Then we talked. She told me her daughter was a 10th-grader
and she too was determined not to be cheated out of even a day of
her education. We comforted each other. ``God is great,'' she said
in Spanish. We both knew in our hearts that our daughters would be
fine, but we too were victims of Columbine. Being a victim is not a
good feeling, it is maddening and it
</P>
<P>
   makes you very, very angry.
</P>
<P>
   My memories of high school are overwhelmingly positive and I
resent greatly the fact that last week will become part of my
daughter's remembrances. But I am determined to make sure she and
as many of her fellow students as possible have many, many more
good ones before they leave high school.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing you're a victim is painful, remaining one is shameful.

Slobodan Milosevic and winning the release of three U.S. POWs
captured a month ago. Meanwhile, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin
was in Belgrade Friday as well and immediately went into a meeting

   MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ A new outpouring of Kosovo
refugees crowded across the border day and night here at the rate
of 1,000 per hour Friday, arriving from a heavily populated area
where new threats of Serbian conscription drove them to risk the
trip they had feared making for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances and mobile clinics veered up the twisting road from
Kukes city throughout the afternoon, as more and more people who
had walked at least part of the way arrived suffering from
exhaustion and dehydration under a pitiless sun and mountain winds
that blasted all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the nightmare we've been expecting,'' said Ray
Wilkinson, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cleaning Prizren,'' he said, referring to the
municipal area of more than 100,000 people located about 15 miles
north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   And they appear to be cleaning it of professionals, according to
refugee agency officials. Serb police detained a doctor and six
nurses at the Prizren hospital Thursday morning, ``bundled them
into a vehicle and drove them to the Albanian border.'' They were
not given time to notify their families.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kukes relief agencies scrambling to put up more tents
for the newcomers were hampered by the strong winds. Even the 100
new tents planned by the Red Crescent Society of the United Arab
Emirates and another 120 being raised by Medecins Sans Frontiere of
Belgium were expected to accommodate only about 4,800 people. More
than 11,000 crossed into Albania from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. (local
time) Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said 50,000 will be coming,'' said Ahmad Alburainain,
head of the Red Crescent delegation trying to expand the UAE tent
camp. It had filled existing vacancies with 10 truckloads of
refugees by 2 p.m., and workers were struggling to raise the
additional tents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The local government has opened schools, the mosque and even
government buildings to hold refugees overnight in emergencies such
as this in past weeks. By nightfall, thousands of people were
sitting on the ground around the main city square and outside
packed refugee camps, or were waiting in parked cars to learn if
there was any place for them to sleep inside.
</P>
<P>
   More than 630,000 refugees have poured out of Kosovo province
since NATO airstrikes began March 24, including an estimated
373,000 into Albania, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Over
7,000 refugees arrived Thursday in Macedonia, the largest number in
at least two weeks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Families from Prizren -- Kosovo's second-largest city -- and
surrounding towns started arriving in Albania Thursday, but the
burst of humanity began around 9 a.m. Friday for a combination of
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband came yesterday. We separated because they were
taking up the men,'' said Hamensha Zyberi, a 28-year-old mother of
two who travelled from Prizren by bus Friday with her mother,
children and in-laws. They were sitting on a sparsely grassed
hillock just past the border checkpoint Friday afternoon, waiting
with thousands of confused others for transportation to Kukes or
anywhere safe.
</P>
<P>
   Like other refugees, she told that Serb police pounded on the
family's door Thursday and asked for the men of the house. They
said they would be back to get the men on Friday, as part of a
nationwide military mobilization, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many also were spurred to leave Prizren now because they had
heard Thursday night on the Kukes television station, which is
available in Kosovo a few hours a night, that people had made it
safely from Prizren across the border without harassment and
without teenaged boys and men being grabbed from their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave my husband's name, so I knew he made it all right,''
said Zyberi. The station routinely broadcasts names of Kosovar
Albanian refugees seeking missing family members or wishing to
deliver a message back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Men from one family after another told of remaining in hiding
for weeks, fearing the Serb police would come for them any time.
Many said they have been sleeping fully clothed, and some men said
they normally slept in a basement or at different neighbors' homes,
slipping out only after dark to find a place that might be secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the house for three weeks,'' said Islam Abdullahu,
29. ``Women, only women can go out for supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces apparently were not only engaged in a military
mobilization, but intended to drive these people out. For the first
time in a couple of weeks they made available buses -- apparently a
fleet of them -- to carry the Kosovar Albanians from Prizren to the
down of Zhur, about two or three miles from the border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The Abdullahu family began walking to Albania, but after a short
time said they and dozens of others were picked up by a passing
bus. The Serbian driver asked them to pay 30 Yugoslav dinars each
for the passage, which is a little less than $2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got very crowded,'' said Razije Abdullahu, the 29-year-old
wife of Islam. ``We were standing all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they walked the final miles from Zhur, pushing a stroller
with their two-year-old and a few provisions, and mostly carrying
their other boy of four years.
</P>
<P>
   Other families drove over in cars or tractors hauling carts
crammed with people. Hundreds, or possibly more, were reported
walking. Some elderly people, including a man reported to be 100
years old, arrived sprawled in wheelbarrows covered with blankets
and other emergency provisions.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Seldom has a single gunshot echoed so long and
so far.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet that killed San Francisco police Officer Joseph
Brodnik 30 years ago Saturday took a life and ruined a family. It
also sparked a political movement and changed the way the Hispanic
community thought of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Brodnik, 41, was killed in a confrontation with several men he
and his partner suspected of burglary. The seven Hispanic suspects,
known collectively as ``Los Siete,'' became a cause celebre in the
Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   After a fiery trial, in which defense attorneys portrayed their
clients as the victims of racism and police brutality, and
Brodnik's partner as a drunken bully who called Hispanics greasers,
the suspects were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The highly publicized case still reverberates on the streets and
among the police in San Francisco, including Brodnik's son, Bob,
who followed in his father's footsteps and joined the San Francisco
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's torn my family apart,'' said Brodnik, who was 20 years
old and in the Navy when his father was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It split us all up. I haven't seen my mother in 11 years.
That's just what it's done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brodnik declined to discuss it further.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the political climate at the time _ the protests against
the Vietnam War, the Chicano rights movement as well as the growing
immigration of Latin Americans to the city _ the trial had a
tremendous impact, said Carlos Cordova, acting chairman of the La
Raza studies department at San Francisco State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It created a cohesive movement and it became a catalyst for
many individuals to become organized and become very vocal,''
Cordova said.
</P>
<P>
   The case struck a chord in the community because, in 1969, the
mostly white police force often treated Hispanics _ especially
young people _ with suspicion and brutality, said Oscar Rios, the
brother of one of the defendants and now mayor of Watsonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were hanging around, riding around, (the police) would
stop you. Whatever they felt like doing to you, they would do it,''
Rios said.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the shooting, May 1, 1969, Joseph Brodnik and his
43-year-old partner, Paul McGoran, were tracking a group of
burglary suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The plainclothes officers stopped outside a home in Noe Valley
and questioned a group of young men who they believed were carrying
a stolen television.
</P>
<P>
   McGoran told investigators that he was jumped from behind,
knocked down and beaten. In the melee, one of the suspects got
McGoran's gun, and shot Brodnik, McGoran said. Brodnik was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, lawyers for the young men told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   They said McGoran had accidentally shot his partner while aiming
the gun at one of the suspects. Six young men _ Jose Mario
Martinez, 16; his brother Rodolfo ``Tony'' Martinez, 20; Nelson
Rodriguez, 19; Danilo ``Bebe'' Melendez, 18; Jose Rios, 19; and
Gary Lescallet, 18 _ were arrested and charged with Brodnik's
murder. A seventh, Gio Lopez, was never apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joseph Alioto wasted no time in condemning the murder.
Alioto declared an official day of mourning for the slain officer.
</P>
<P>
   News reports described the suspects as ``Latin hippie types''
who appeared at their arraignment ``shaggy-haired and roughly
dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the community were convinced that the young men were
innocent and would not receive a fair trial, because of their race
and their politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there hadn't been any mobilization from the community, they
would have been railroaded and they would have ended up in jail,''
Oscar Rios said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids identified with (Los Siete), because for one of the first
times, there were young guys saying from the jail, hey, stand up
for your rights. Feel proud of being Latino. They became real
inspirations to a lot of us because they were strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Los Siete were College of San Mateo students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was threatening to the police because we were outspoken; we
were immigrants, but we were not as passive as the majority of the
immigrant population,'' said Reynaldo Aparicio, 51, a friend and
supporter of Los Siete. ``Once you spoke on your own behalf, you
were automatically thought of as a radical.''
</P>
<P>
   After the six were arrested, supporters organized fund-raisers,
protest marches and letter-writing campaigns on their behalf. They
started a Los Siete newspaper called Basta Ya. They showed up, en
masse, at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the jurors would walk out at the luncheon recess, the
halls and corridors were lined with people who (were) _ I suppose
you might call them _ counterculture types,'' said Thomas Norman,
former chief trial lawyer for the district attorney and the
prosecutor in the Los Siete case. ``They would shout at the jurors
as they went down the hall, phrases like, `Free Los Siete!' and
`You'd better free Los Siete or you'll be sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops went on trial in this case,'' said Paul Cummins, who
was motivated to become a San Francisco district attorney after
sitting through the trial as a young law student.
</P>
<P>
   McGoran retired from the force after his partner was killed. He
died of a heart attack in 1987, according to his son, Paul McGoran
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the are at the heart of the case _ the Mission District _
is a different place. About 20 percent of the 140 police officers
at Mission Station are Hispanic, which makes a big difference in
how the department is perceived, said station head Capt. Greg Suhr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you go, you can speak to somebody in their own
language ... People are much more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department is also more accountable to the community
because of agencies like the Office of Citizen Complaints, Cordova
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean it's perfect, but from 1969 there's been a
tremendous change,'' he said.

JAILED MAN'S EXPOSE OFFERS UNFLATTERING PORTRAIT OF ATHEIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 2)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The book is titled ``Good Gawd, Madalyn.'' It
might better be called, ``Portrait of a Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To simply label Madalyn an atheist, racist, homophobe,
anti-Semite, etc, would be a tremendous misnomer. To her dubious
credit, Madalyn Mays Murray O'Hair is an equal-opportunity bigot
whose loathing of humanity is eagerly dispensed without
partiality,'' reads a typical passage.
</P>
<P>
   From flatulence to body odor, from petty cruelties and
hypocrisies to grand treacheries, the sins and social shortcomings
of the woman who was at the vanguard of court battles to remove
prayer and Bible reading from public schools are exposed in this
200-page unpublished expose.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it makes extensive use of internal documents of
the atheist movement to detail an elaborate plan to flee to New
Zealand at least a year before O'Hair disappeared in 1995 with her
two adult children and $500,000 in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangements included packing up the 150,000 books and
pamphlets of the atheist library and sending them, using various
subterfuges via Houston to Kansas City, for eventual shipment to
New Zealand, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   This issue is of more than passing importance to the book's
author, David R. Waters, who now sits in a jail in Austin, Texas,
on federal weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents are investigating his role in the disappearance of
O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and daughter Robin Murray O'Hair.
The three disappeared from San Antonio in late September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, 52, has a criminal record that includes murder. But he
is not charged with any offenses relating to the disappearance of
O'Hair and the other two and denies any knowledge of their fate. An
alleged accomplice, however, has implicated Waters in their
murders, according to the testimony of an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Preston of Garland, the author who wrote the book with
Waters two years ago, said he was left with no clear sense of
Waters' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that David is a very intelligent man and
speaks very well,'' Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was in prison for murder, and I think any sensitive man
with his criminal record would realize that if he knocked off
Madalyn, he would get caught, and that would mean the death penalty
for him,'' Preston said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Waters speaks of O'Hair in the present tense.
</P>
<P>
   The book could be read as Waters' alibi: O'Hair and the two
children are alive and well in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   However, from another angle, there is ample material to suggest
he would not have mourned their death, foremost because he was
framed for a theft he says he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the book, Waters, casting himself as yet
another victim of the O'Hair family, is about to plead guilty to
the theft of $54,400 in atheist funds in exchange for 10 years on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was caught between a rock and a hard place. If I went to
trial that afternoon, I would stand a better-than-even chance of
spending the rest of my life in prison. Or, (if I did) what I would
have once found unfathomable, namely, plead guilty, I'd be 100
percent assured of returning home with the woman who now stood
before me crying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to Patti Jo Steffens, his long-time girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seared the very fibers of my being, but I did what was
necessary to insure that I went home with the woman I loved. I
pleaded guilty. Chalk up another victory for Madalyn Murray
O'Hair,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After the plea in May 1995, Waters was sentenced to 10 years'
probation and ordered to repay the $54,400.
</P>
<P>
   The amount was later reduced to $15,000 when Waters shared with
Travis County officials some documents he admits in the book that
he purloined from Jon Murray's private files.
</P>
<P>
   The book is based on 14 months in 1993 and 1994, when Waters
worked for O'Hair in Austin, first as typesetter and then as office
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Preston said the copies of facsimiles, letters and other
documents that Waters provided him appeared authentic. But, he
said, he places no particular faith in Waters' veracity.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a case like this, I fall back on the old Hollywood saying,
`Never trust, never believe,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The book opens in February 1993, as Waters answers a classified
advertisement for a job at American Atheist General Headquarters in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   With a lengthy criminal record including murder, battery and
forgery, Waters had been unemployed for more than a year, dependent
on the income of Steffens, and he was willing to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Waters, who once beat someone to death, casts
himself as the wayfaring innocent as he signed up with O'Hair to
set type for her newsletter for $7 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he imagine he was entering the twisted realm of a
woman he portrayed as a smelly, foul-mouthed bully who brooked no
second opinion or dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind conjured up visions of an environment rife with
intellectual debate and youthful philosophizing as to the meaning
of life and the existence of God. How (expletive) naive,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after, to his amazement and gratitude, the O'Hair
family did not fire him when they learned of his criminal past.
</P>
<P>
   ``That crap is history, kiddo,'' he recalls Madalyn telling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we know you're not some (expletive) Christer sent
here to spy on us ... So, do your job, keep your mouth shut, and
you'll have a job here for as long as you like,'' he quoted her as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair later claimed she did not learn of his criminal past
until far later, after the $54,400 disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Waters account unfolds, this early encounter marked
one of the last times he felt anything but loathing and anger
toward O'Hair and her two adult children.
</P>
<P>
   Jon was a lisping, anal-retentive, foul-mouthed boor; Robin was
nasty; Madalyn was the unquestioned ruler of all that passed behind
the tinted glass windows of atheist headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was truly an enigma. She would discuss current events,
history, law, art, stamp collecting, literature and many other
subjects in a most knowledgeable and scholarly manner; yet she
exhibited a profound and almost sadistic glee in using the vilest
of language, often making a casual obscenity take on more revolting
overtones simply in the way she phrased her words, and in the tone
of voice she used,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, Waters records the fates of dedicated atheist
staff members who were fired by O'Hair on trumped-up issues to save
a few pennies, or who quit after being beaten down by the
capricious rule of the O'Hair troika.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote about O'Hair's derision toward her boards of
directors and her faithful members, and he marvels at her ability
to raise money while whining about hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed. And appalled. This shrewd, hard-as-nails old
woman controlled an empire consisting of a mere 2,081 members, and
yet she amassed millions of dollars in cash, bonds, property and
other assets. All the while she pleaded poverty,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move over Bob Tilton, Jim Bakker, and all you other religious
hucksters ... Per capita, Madalyn had you all beat to hell,'' the
booklet says.

the government reported. That is the sort of heady pace usually

<TEXT>
<P>
   KEIZER, Ore. _ Racers say, ``The older you get, the faster you
were.'' Rex Urban is making that boast come true for the Austin
Healey Bugeye Sprite, a 40-year-old sports car that in reality
never moved as quickly as it does in fond memories.
</P>
<P>
   In his four-man shop in this suburb of Salem, Urban, 44,
restores baby boomers' high school dreams. And he rebuilds the
British sports cars so that this time they really work _ and zip
right along.
</P>
<P>
   The speciality of his business, Mini Motors Classic Coachworks,
is the Sprite _ commonly called the Bugeye or Frogeye because of
its protruding headlamps. The Sprite was introduced in 1958 as an
entry-level sports car that used parts from two tiny commuter
sedans, the Austin A30 and the Morris Minor. The simple roadster
had a four-cylinder engine displacing only 948 cubic centimeters.
It had a one-piece hood-and-fender unit; side curtains instead of
windows, no exterior door handles, and a trunk with no outside
opening. But it was structurally rigid, handled well and could go
80 miles an hour while getting 30 miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Urban's fascination with Bugeyes began in high school. His
graduation present in 1971 was ``Bessie'' (named for its Oregon
license plate, BES 335), a blue 1960 Sprite that he still owns. He
had so much fun, he blew up the motor within a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother had an MG Midget and we had both cars apart in the
garage at the same time,'' he said. ``Everything was
interchangeable _ it was a revelation!''
</P>
<P>
   Urban later planned to import Sprites with Fiberglas bodies and
space frames _ tubular skeletons resembling bird cages, which are
exceptionally light and strong. Such cars have long been available
in Britain. But the American government wanted to classify them as
brand-new cars, requiring them to meet today's emissions and safety
standards. And the English manufacturer started worrying about its
liability.
</P>
<P>
   The coup de grace was delivered by a new, inexpensive sports
car, the Mazda Miata. ``The Miata sold for $13,000 back in 1991,
and we figured the space-frame cars were going to cost $25,000,''
Urban said.
</P>
<P>
   So he turned to rebuilding Sprites, Midgets, MGAs, MGBs and
``big'' Austin Healeys to customers' specifications. Some look as
they did when new; some are wildly customized.
</P>
<P>
   One of Urban's Bugeyes has been clocked at 120 miles an hour.
Like most, it has disk/drum brakes, adjustable shock absorbers,
competition axles and dual-bearing rear hubs that take the stress
off the axle.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder engine is a 1,275-cc unit with electronic
ignition, high-performance camshaft and stainless-steel valves. It
is mated to a Nissan five-speed transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, while prices of fancy Miatas have reached $27,000,
his rebuilt Bugeyes start at $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bess is one of about 50,000 Bugeyes made in 1958-61 _ the first,
best-loved generation of Sprites. Most came to the United States,
and Urban estimates that half still exist, giving him plenty of raw
material for his rebuilt ``Super Sprites.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had hands-on experience in developing the details of what
works and what doesn't. For years, he raced Bessie successfully in
Sports Car Club of America races, though she is now semi-retired to
street use.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of working on British cars he reckons he has skinned
his knuckles on several hundred Bugeyes. He has totally rebuilt
about 50. ``I can do about three a year from the ground up, and I'm
booked through this year,'' he said. ``I could do many, many more
if I could get the help. It's so hard to find anybody who wants to
do this kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban is looking for practitioners of an arcane craft _ the
ability to ``panel beat'' and exactly re-create structural body
pieces. Such skills were common in the assembly of hand-built cars
in the past _ the kind that were driven to extinction by the same
mass-produced vehicles Urban is now repairing.
</P>
<P>
   At Mini Motors now, two cars exist as stripped shells. A
seven-year employee, Tom Birch, 33, is remanufacturing rusted parts
on a panel form that can create compound curves from a single sheet
of steel. By beating the panel over a metal wheel, a complete
fender can be created in one process. It takes a lot of time, but
is quite precise.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sprites are honeycombed with crevices that trap water and
dirt, making them prone to rust even in states like Oregon that do
not salt roads in winter.
</P>
<P>
   A restoration _ what the shop owner calls an ``Urban renewal'' _
includes a a body and chassis dipped in an acid wash to remove
oxidation, then sealed and and painted with urethane. Most people
elect to have the rear-hinged hood (which includes the fenders)
altered to tilt forward for better access to the engine. The
interior can be leather or vinyl, and Urban makes an exact copy of
the original factory hardtop for $850. He also offers a lockable
trunk-access panel behind the seats _ no small consideration in a
car without a trunk lid or door locks.
</P>
<P>
   Urban became friendly with the car's originators, Donald Healey
and his son Geoff, before both men died. From those contacts, he is
able to buy windshields and sidescreens from the original British
supplier.
</P>
<P>
   The original Bugeye had a 948-cc engine, but so far nobody has
wanted to keep it. ``I've got piles of them,'' Urban said. But he
is always on the lookout for 1,275-cc engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that Midget over there?'' he said, pointing to a '74 model
waiting to be repainted. ``We prey on those.''
</P>
<P>
   So why buy an Urban Sprite for as much as $20,000 instead of an
average Bugeye for about $5,000? ``I can build up to 140-horsepower
engines, but I build a really good 100-horsepower one. I've turned
96 miles an hour in a quarter mile, and with a five-speed
transmission I get up to 37 miles per gallon on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've never been beaten by a Miata. If I ever do, it's back
to the drawing board.''

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE TO ANNOUNCE NEW AIR POLLUTION RULES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - President Clinton is expected to announce on
Saturday new clean air standards that would reduce the permissible
level of sulfur in gasoline and force most sports utility vehicles
to meet emission standards required of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   By calling the four-wheel-drive vehicles ``trucks,'' car makers
have not had to account for pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and
smoke under limits set for automobiles under the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules are to be proposed by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House and EPA were trying to keep details of
the rules from becoming public until Clinton was able to announce
them during his weekly radio program Saturday, environmental and
industry groups pieced together enough details to start issuing
reactions Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations said that if the rules are finally approved --
around the end of the year -- the new standards would:
</P>
<P>
   -- Require oil companies to reduce the sulfur content of
gasoline by enough to the meet in every state the standard already
set by California -- an average reduction of about 90 percent
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   -- Require car makers to reduce by an average of about 90
percent the emission of oxides of nitrogen, or ``NOX'', the key
ingredient of urban smog.
</P>
<P>
   -- Require that sports utility vehicles weighing less than 8,000
pounds be counted as cars for the purpose of computing overall
fleet average emission levels.
</P>
<P>
   NOX emissions would be limited to about 0.07 gram per mile under
the new rules, as opposed to 0.6 gram per mile currently permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of sulfur in gasoline, which varies widely but
averages around 330 parts per million, would have to go down to 30
parts per million, the current California standard.
</P>
<P>
   Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an
environmental group, said the timing under which sports utility
vehicles come under the federal emission limits would mean the
largest vehicles will not have to meet the toughest standards until
2009.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA is offering us a breath of fresh air,'' O'Donnell said,
``but we going to have to wait too long to inhale.''
</P>
<P>
   Motor vehicle manufacturers have generally supported removal of
sulfur from gasoline because the crude oil residue gums up
catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can produce 21st century technology, but we need 21st
century fuel to use it,'' said Ed Lewis, a spokesman for the
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Petroleum Institute and the National
Petrochemical &AMP; Refiners Association said a 90 percent reduction in
gasoline sulfur content would be ``unnecessarily costly.''
</P>
<P>
   The new standards were applauded by the Environmental Defense
Fund, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the National Lung
Association.

`NOAH'S ARK' WON'T FLOAT YOUR BOAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Noah's Ark'' must have looked perfectly fine on paper. The
production arrives via Robert Halmi Sr.'s big, bigger, biggest
grinder, which has manufactured hits (''Merlin'') and misses (''The
Odyssey''). And he may very well have assembled the most decorated
cast in a TV movie ever, what with four Oscars and one Emmy spread
among the cast members.
</P>
<P>
   But from start to finish, ``Noah's Ark,'' premiering the first
of two parts at 8 p.m. CDT Sunday on NBC, is a complete and utter
mess. It takes the biblical story of Noah as told in the book of
Genesis and butchers the poor thing into little, unrecognizable
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Jon Voight, bearded and with hair blanketing his
shoulders and back, portrays Noah as a committed wise man who never
wavers in his beliefs. When asked to vacate the sin-filled Sodom,
he does, only to watch the place burned to the ground by fireballs
raining from the heavens. When asked to build a boat large enough
for two of every animal, he does, escaping the 40-day, 40-night
flood that wipes out everyone _ except his loudmouth enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, enough scums of the earth survived in order to stage
a dramatic battle to take over the Ark. (Noah, his wife, three sons
and their girlfriends fend them off with pots and pans and other
weapons until God has enough and tidal waves drown the outlaws.)
</P>
<P>
   This happens on the second night, which veers even more off
course. ``Noah's Ark'' wants to tell an emotional story about what
happens to eight people stuck at sea. But it merely turns into a
low-grade ``Waterworld,'' in which the punks on water bikes are
replaced by pirates brandishing rotten teeth and spitting on one
another every time they speak.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of this band of merry men is Lot, played by Oscar
winner F. Murray Abraham, who is more comical than anything else as
a mangled-faced psycho.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Peter Barnes also included the role of an opportunistic
peddler, played by James Coburn, Oscar winner No. 3. He initially
turns up in Sodom, loaded down with all sorts of salable items,
which I suppose he lifted from the nearest gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the Ark floats in the middle of nowhere, he turns up
on a boat filled with goodies, asking if they need to replenish
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth Oscar winner here is Mary Steenburgen, who plays
Noah's patient, trusting wife, Naamah.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy winner? That's Carol Kane, who plays Lot's wife as a
yapping discontent who turns into a pillar of salt after disobeying
God's will by looking back as fireballs rained on Sodom. (Lot, ever
the nurturing husband, breaks off a finger and keeps it.)
</P>
<P>
   At least ``Noah's Ark'' is upfront with its, well, rewriting of
the Bible. Viewers will be told at the beginning that ``For
dramatic effect, we have taken the poetic license with some of the
events of the mighty epic of Noah and the flood.''
</P>
<P>
   For that alone, a friend of mine eager to see this miniseries
seemed disappointed, partly because she had plans of making it a
family event with her young children, filling the evening with
biblical discussion.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is to skip it and read the few pages devoted to
Noah in the Bible instead. Book adaptations in general are
difficult creatures. In the age of ratings and profits, expecting a
network to stick with the essence of any classic, let alone the
Bible, is asking a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere this week:
</P>
<P>
   A six-hour documentary promises to change viewers' feelings
toward Europe. It travels from Norway to the beaches of Portugal to
offer a European vacation of a different beat. ``Wild Seas,'' (8 to
10 p.m. CDT Sunday, PBS) is the first installment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thug Life in D.C.'' (10 p.m. CDT Tuesday, HBO) Filmmakers Marc
Levin and Daphne Pinkerson go inside the D.C. prison system to hear
the stories of some of the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   This installment of the ``America Undercover'' documentary
series focuses on a 17-year-old who faces the possibility of 115
years behind bars if convicted of shooting a police officer and
murdering a teen-ager. He calls himself ``the definition of thug''
_ someone who is ready to do what it takes to get what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing thing about ``Thug Life in D.C.'' is the
hopelessness. Like many of the others, the 17-year-old grew up in
poverty and without a father. Most of the people he knew had served
jail time. Doing time is as much a rite of passage as graduating
from high school is for many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down Will Come Baby'' (8 p.m. Tuesday, CBS) Meredith Baxter
stars as a workaholic mother who sees warning signs when a stranger
tries to move into her daughter's life, but who can't do much about
it until it's too late. Diana Scarwid] is the woman with more than
friendship on her mind, and Tom Amandes portrays the husband, the
most clueless person alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down Will Come Baby'' fails to move past the cliches. This is
ultimately a movie that CBS figures has enough of a provocative
premise to at least lure eyeballs. Baxter does her thing, playing a
strong-willed woman even while in emotional distress.

RUSSIAN MINISTERS SAY A DEFERRED REPAYMENT PLAN IS CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fresh from concluding a vital debt refinancing
agreement with the International Monetary Fund, top Russian
ministers said Friday that foreign creditors were close to agreeing
on deferred repayment of the country's Soviet-era loans.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the officials played down the political
disputes that the IMF agreement could cause within the Russian
parliament and the government. The IMF's terms commit the Russians
to making painful economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the deferment of $16
billion in payments on the Soviet Union's debt to foreign
governments and banks remained only to be ``put on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, all preconditions for such accords have been
created,'' Zadornov told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the IMF announced that it would release $4.5
billion in credits over the next 18 months so that Russia could
essentially pay the lender what it owes from past loans. The
collapse of the Russian economy in August 1998 resulted in a
default on $40 billion in domestic debt and pushed Russia to the
edge of default on much of its external debt.
</P>
<P>
   Russia needed an economic program approved by the IMF before it
could restructure the foreign debt it had inherited from the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov said a Russian government delegation in Washington this
past week had spoken to representatives of the governments and
banks that hold the Soviet debt, with encouraging results. But he
said that even if these creditors agreed to defer repayments over
the next two years, Russia's debt problems remained severe. ``We
will not be able to make foreign debt payments over the next 10
years according to the original schedule,'' Zadornov said.
</P>
<P>
   On a related topic, Zadornov said almost 89 percent of foreign
investors in Russian Treasury bills had agreed to final terms of
the domestic debt restructuring. Foreigners hold about $17 billion
of the total sum. The most notable dissenter to the deal is Credit
Suisse First Boston, which invested in Treasury bills worth about
$770 million at the time of the economic crash, according to
Zadornov. The minister said no special terms would be offered to
Credit Suisse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Russian government may find greater understanding
abroad about its difficult economic straits than at home. For the
IMF to release the loans, the government must adhere to the
economic program the two sides have developed. But the program
includes new taxes that will be hard to put into effect in an
election year. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for the end of
1999, and the presidential vote for the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the economic program rests in large part with the
Communist-controlled Duma, or lower house, which historically has
been hostile to IMF-related policies. The first deputy prime
minister in charge of the economy, Yuri Maslyukov, insisted Friday
that only a small portion of the IMF program required action by the
Duma. Maslyukov did not mention, however, that those measures were
perhaps the most critical.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, for Russia to fulfill its 1999 budget projections
it must raise more revenue through new taxes, which require
parliamentary approval. The IMF conditions call for an increase in
the export tariff on oil and significant increases in taxes on
gasoline and alcohol, which are sure to be unpopular among voters.
Moreover, they are expected to cause another round of inflation.
Since the August crisis, prices in Russia have risen 97 percent.

   (italics)In the compressed world of the office, little things
mean a lot. And when someone has an annoying habit or seems to
think that any kind of behavior is acceptable, co-workers can
suffer _ often in silence. And even when they speak up, their
protests can go unheard.(end italics) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the Fortune 500 company where Lynne Hawes of Mount Kisco,
N.Y., worked, her office was directly across a small hallway from
one occupied by a young woman who, as Ms. Hawes puts it,
``weaponized her telephone for daily battle for much of the working
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Acoustics were unusually excellent and I didn't _ couldn't _
miss a sigh or syllable,'' Ms. Hawes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early morning's conversation began with her munching
donuts and slurping coffee while explaining to her mother that she
had come home at 20 past 12, not plenty past 12 last night, and
that her life was her business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next, she would call her girlfriend and passionately describe
the details of last night's date.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hawes would occasionally clear her throat or cough to
demonstrate how sound could travel _ but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pitch was loud; emotion high; vulgarisms sprinkled
liberally throughout descriptions,'' Ms. Hawes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job was editorial, and I found myself writing inane
comments on the work I was reading, reflecting my co-worker's
hectic life, rather than critiquing appropriately the text I was
editing.

<P>
   ``I lifted my phone and dialed her extension to ask her to

   In the advertising agency where Jaime J. Jasso of San Antonio
worked, there was an otherwise ordinary account supervisor who
would walk through the art department and invariably break into
song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worse yet, it was always the same song and (worse still)
always incorrectly sung,'' Jasso writes. ```Hey, hey for the
Monkees,' he'd sing, for no apparent reason other than (perhaps) he
was in a good mood. We could think of no other rational explanation
for the theme song of the late 1960s phenomenon to remain stuck in
his mind and surface so unexpectedly, so often.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, a co-worker and I drew him into an extended
conversation by asking him about the Monkees. Were they favorites
of his, or was there some other reason he was so obviously fond of
the group some 28 years after their popularity had peaked? Did he
know they were derisively referred to as the `pre-Fab Four'? Was he
even vaguely aware that by 1995 they were considered a bit passe?
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that he was not aware of either the fact that he
was singing out loud or that the Monkees were generally held in low
esteem (never mind that the (italics)correct(end italics) lyrics
were ``Hey, hey we're the Monkees''). But from that point on,
whenever we heard him sing his spirited version of the Monkees'
theme song, we would ask him about the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would seem to snap him back into focus somehow. At the
very least, he would leave our area immediately rather than endure
our questions.'' &QL;

   ``There's nothing like having a co-worker who has converted her
desk into her `toilet,''' writes Joyce Henckle of Bangor, Maine.
``Now I mean this in the true tradition of an Elizabethan novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, she says, who was `unlucky enough to arrive at work
early was subject to the just-from-the-shower look that was, in
over a half-hour of time, transformed into Madame Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This co-worker had every cosmetic resource known to humankind
at her disposal in her desk. We are talking a propane-powered
curling iron, an electrified magnifying mirror for those
hard-to-get-at eyebrow hairs, a hot pot to make oatmeal in every
morning and a loud selection of her favorite music to put her in
the mood for the day.
</P>

even if she was at her desk, the workday had not yet started.'' &QL;

off-putting habits, Claire Papanastasiou of Baltimore can reminisce
and wax philosophical.

   She calls one of her office mates the Sneeze That Roared.

   ``No one in the newsroom would know when it would strike, but
when it did, hold on to your computers,'' she writes. ``The hardest
times were during the winters when this woman would sneeze like
Godzilla at least 15 times a day; no one would ever say, `God bless
you.' We'd say, `Thank God we survived that one,' or `What was the
Richter reading this time?'''

&HT;        LEGIONNAIRE'S BACTERIA FOUND AT U.S. CAPITOL POWER PLANT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 30, -- Federal safety inspectors recently
found ``potentially hazardous'' levels of Legionnaire's bacteria at
the power plant that supplies heating and air conditioning to the
Capitol and Congressional offices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite warnings last year that bacteria levels must be
monitored at least monthly, no tests had been performed for the
last several months, inspectors said.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the congressional Office of Compliance issued a
citation last week to the Architect of the Capitol, the office
which oversees the power plant, for failing to conduct the tests
and exposing employees to the ``hazard of developing Legionnaire's
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no risk the bacteria could be sent into the Capitol or
congressional offices, inspectors said. But the bacteria, found in
a cooling tower at the facility, presented a risk to employees of
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the architect's office said they had no knowledge
that any employee has contracted the illness. The office has 2,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   For the next year, the architect's office must conduct culture
tests on the cooling towers at least monthly and submit the results
to inspectors, the citation said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legionella bacteria is ubiquitous and occurs naturally,''
wrote H.M. Franklin, administrative assistant to the architect of
the capitol in a response to the citation. ``The level that can be
causative of disease is a matter of medical disagreement. The
Architect of the Caitol has adopted a regimen to keep such
concentrations as low as practicable.''
</P>
<P>
   The first cases of Legionnaire's disease were discovered in 1976
when 182 people contracted a pneumonia-like illness at an American
Legion
</P>
<P>
   conference in Philadelphia. Twenty nine died.
</P>
<P>
   Legionnaire's victims may develop flu symptoms, or bronchial
problems. The disease varies in severity and can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Don Maddrey, a spokesman for the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, the union which represents
employees of the architect's office, described the Capitol as a
``cess pool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe the working conditions at the U.S.
Capitol,'' Maddrey said. ``It's pretty primitive.''

SEC PLAN FOR BETTER POLICING BY BROKERAGE FIRMS DRAWS HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an attempt to combat securities fraud among small
over-the-counter stocks, the Securities and Exchange Commission has
proposed that brokerage firms do more of the policing.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which is open for public comment until May 8,
would require a brokerage firm that makes markets in certain
over-the-counter stocks to review the issuing company's financial
data periodically to try to detect fraud. If the firm found
evidence of malfeasance, it would have to stop making markets in
the company's shares. In addition, brokerage firms would have to
maintain records of their review procedures. Stocks traded on the
Bulletin Board and the pink sheets would be affected, but not those
on the Nasdaq National Market System or its Small Capitalization
Market.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the proposal has received a flood of criticism
from traders, investors and stock issuers who say that it would
drive reputable firms out of the business of trading these stocks.
A trader's job is to set prices on stocks based on supply and
demand from investors, these people say. By saddling firms with the
responsibility for analyzing companies' financial data and
operations, regulators would increase the firms' potential
liability and the risk involved in trading these stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that honest firms would probably stop trading the
roughly 10,000 stocks on the Bulletin Board and pink sheets,
leaving stockholders unable to sell their shares and companies less
able to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal has serious flaws and is not going to be
effective in deterring microcap fraud,'' said George Kramer,
associate general counsel of the Securities Industry Association.
``You make it harder on the legitimate players, and at the end of
the day you'll end up with fewer of the legitimate players and more
of the bad actors.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 letters have been submitted to the securities
commission regarding the proposal, the vast majority in opposition.
As is customary, regulators declined to speak publicly about the
pending rule change while it is in the comment period.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation, which
oversees many of the firms that trade smaller, more obscure
over-the-counter stocks, supports the rule change. Michael Dorsey,
general counsel for Knight Trimark Group, a large market-making
firm, and a former lawyer at the commission, says that the group's
support may overpower industry opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal shows the securities commission's extreme
frustration over fighting fraud in shares of some tiny unknown
companies peddled to investors by unscrupulous brokers. According
to the SEC, a market maker should help fight such fraud because by
facilitating trades, the brokerage firm ``raises the profile of the
security even though the market maker is not an active participant
in the fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has supplied a list of 28 warning signs that a market
maker could use to spot fraud at a company. These include a change
of accounting firms, inconsistent financial statements, altered
certificates of incorporation, extraordinary gains in year-to-year
operations and unusual activity in brokerage accounts of companies
affiliated with the issuer. But while market makers are good at
measuring investor demand for the stocks they trade, they are not
now equipped to investigate a company's activities to the degree
the SEC would like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the SEC doesn't want there to be a secondary market for
small businesses,'' said R. Cromwell Coulson, chairman of National
Quotation Bureau LLC, publishers of the pink sheets. ``If so, they
should state it.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the proposed rule change say it reflects an
increasing prejudice against small business by securities
regulators. Brad Smith, owner of WBS&AMP;A Ltd., a consulting firm for
small businesses in Austin, Texas, said: ``No one out here is for
microcap fraud. Throw the suckers in jail; they are the bane of our
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of those people are legitimate salt-of-the-earth
entrepreneurs,'' he added. ``We just can't legislate them out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC is proposing to modify a rule that came into being in
1971 when the Nasdaq market was new and information was sparse
about the companies that traded on it. The idea behind the rule,
according to Dorsey, was that market makers should not quote prices
in a security for which there was no information available to
investors. Brokerage firms had to gather this information and make
it part of their records, available for any investor who requested
it.
</P>
<P>
   But this information is now readily available on the Internet at
the SEC's Web site. Rather than being expanded, the rule should be
trimmed back, Dorsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also require brokers who post investors'
orders on an electronic communications network, or ECN, to do the
due diligence. These networks bypass Nasdaq's traditional trading
system, allowing investors to meet without the market makers. By
using an ECN, the broker is acting solely as a conduit for the
investor to meet another investor interested in completing the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   While the SEC's concern about microcap fraud is shared by most
on Wall Street, the extent of the problem is difficult to measure.
Alan Davidson, president of Zeus Securities, a small brokerage firm
in Jericho, N.Y., and a member of the NASD board, asked an SEC
staff member at a February meeting how widespread fraud was at
Bulletin Board and pink sheet companies. ``I asked them, `Are you
talking 10 percent?' and they said, `No,''' Davidson recalled.
``Then I said, ``Are you talking about 1 percent?'' and they said,
`That's more like it.''' With 10,000 companies trading on the two
venues, that would put those committing fraud at no more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Even if fraud was found at a majority of these companies,
pushing the reputable brokerage firms away would leave only crooks
who flout securities regulations as a matter of course, market
participants say.

SALSA SINGER'S PARTY FORCED TO FACE THE MUSIC IN PANAMA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, May 2)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Salsa star Ruben Blades doesn't like being
the warm-up act.
</P>
<P>
   But the Panamanian singer, actor and part-time politician, had
little choice last week when he took the stage at an outdoor rally
to endorse presidential candidate Martin Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   Torrijos, of the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party, or PRD,
was the headliner because Blades' political party, Papa Egoro, has
virtually collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics blame Blades for trying to manhandle the party from
abroad as he goes about making movies and recording CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to run the party by fax from Hollywood,'' said Eric
Jackson, editor of the Panama News, a weekly newspaper. ``It's been
a big disappointment to many, many people.``
</P>
<P>
   Papa Egoro, which means ``mother earth'' in the Embera Indian
language, was formed in 1992. Led by Blades, the party projected a
youthful image and attracted thousands of Panamanians who had never
voted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Blades finished a respectable third place in a
seven-way presidential race, while Papa Egoro won six seats in the
congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt very satisfied,'' said Carl Nordstrom, the party's
vice president. ``In just two years, we showed that old-style
politics was over.``
</P>
<P>
   But after the campaign, Blades returned to his home in the
United States where he was distracted by a messy divorce, Nordstrom
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Panama, Papa Egoro was also on the verge of a breakup.
Two of its six legislators were kicked out of the party because of
political disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of running its own presidential candidate this year,
Papa Egoro formed an alliance with the PRD, a traditional party
that has been plagued by corruption scandals and was closely allied
with former dictator Manuel Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Blades insisted on controlling Papa Egoro, said Raul
Leis, who resigned as the party's secretary-general in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He once said that directing a political party is like
directing an orchestra,'' Leis said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many political parties, Leis said, Papa Egoro has been hurt
by its focus on a strong personality rather than strong ideas. That
appears unlikely to change soon.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about possible nominees for Panama's 2004
presidential race, Nordstrom said, ``Our candidate is and always
will be Ruben Blades.'' &QL;

individual investors get hurt. Consider what happened when the
small secondary market for real estate limited partnership
holdings, many of which were sold in the 1980s, disappeared a
decade later. Investors were able to sell their holdings only at
steep discounts to net asset values, often to professional
investors taking advantage of individuals' needs for cash to buy
assets on the cheap.

   Businesses will have a harder time raising capital if the
proposal is adopted, said Robert Wussler, the chief executive of
United States Digital Communications Inc., a reseller of satellite
telephone equipment and phone time in Chevy Chase, Md.; its shares
are traded on the Bulletin Board. ``In order to start and expand
small businesses you've got to be able to raise capital,'' said
Wussler, a former president of Turner Broadcasting and CBS
Television. ``The Bulletin Board has been a proven method of
raising capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies as varied as Toys ``R'' Us, Xerox and the predecessor
of Blockbuster Video began their public trading in the pink sheets.
</P>
<P>
   If market makers abandon trading in the 10,000 companies on the
Bulletin Board and the pink sheets, the shares will still change
hands somewhere. And they might be traded on venues that are
completely out of regulators' purview. ``I find it incredible that
they want the guys who are regulated to take on more
responsibilities, driving the market to somewhere that it isn't
regulated,'' Coulson said.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing microcap fraud will not be easy without disrupting
small companies. Lewis Lowenfels, an expert in securities law at
Tolins &AMP; Lowenfels in New York, said, ``The challenge for the
regulators is to address the cancer of microcap fraud in a way that
does not destroy the honest small broker-dealers, who provide
sorely needed capital and liquidity for smaller companies in
today's marketplace.''

DON'T BE INTIMIDATED _ BUYING A PAINTING IS MUCH LIKE BUYING A
FRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're at that happy point in life where you have a balance left
in your checking account _ not only after paying bills, but after
you've covered the ski trip and the kids' new iMac game, to boot.
Maybe, you say to yourself, it would be fun and intriguing to start
buying some art.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, you're thinking, you should have plunked down money to
attend the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth's big fund-raising
auction last month. It featured everything from Picasso to a pair
of bowls thrown by someone the art critic knew in college.
</P>
<P>
   But auctions, even when they're reliably conducted, aren't for
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Where, then? You're just not sure.
</P>
<P>
   It's strange but true: A lot of otherwise savvy consumers turn
clammy and clueless when it comes to buying art. After all, art
possesses a mystique not associated with other commodities.
</P>
<P>
   So we have identified this simple strategy: Pretend, instead,
that you're buying a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   First, do your homework. Visit established dealers and consider
various names or brands. Are you looking for reliability?
Innovation? Do some reading, find out background. Make sure you've
considered a variety of options.
</P>
<P>
   Decide what you want and what you can afford, and work with the
dealer who suits you best.
</P>
<P>
   When you make your decision, arrange financing. Then take it
home (or have it delivered) and install it.
</P>
<P>
   There, you didn't even break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   So go forth. Acquire. And be prepared to enjoy for far more
years and in far more ways than any fridge _ Sub-Zero or not _ can
offer.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   STEP ONE: DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND GO WINDOW-SHOPPING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of artworks you can buy: American Indian
baskets; video installations; figurative paintings; assemblages of
coral, tin can and ballpoint pen.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, consider your options. Give yourself at least
three or four months to soak up gallery and museum shows, to read
and to talk with people you know who buy art.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, you may be looking for art to fulfill specific
requirements. Do you want something soothing and easy on the eyes?
Do you want something that fits your decor or stands on its own? Do
you want something that is sure to prompt questions or just minds
its own business?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people buy to enhance a room in their home,'' says Pam
Campbell, co-owner of William Campbell Contemporary Art. ``If they
become more serious about collecting, they start buying because
they are emotionally attracted to a piece.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with Gregg and Mary Brauer, whose downtown
Fort Worth loft is studded with artworks they've bought over the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got started the way I think a lot of people do, with more
of an interest in decoration than art, per se,'' Gregg Brauer says.
``We had the classic bare-walls syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   As their tastes changed and matured, though, the Brauers started
simply buying what they liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when we bring it home, the art finds its own place,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   STEP TWO: CONNECT WITH A DEALER WHO SELLS WHAT YOU LIKE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After you've been everywhere and seen everything, decide what
``you'' like. Never mind trends. Forget what your nosy neighbor
might say. Connect with the dealer whose inventory fits your taste.
</P>
<P>
   First-time buyers are best off with an established gallery or
private dealer. Auctions, hotel-room sales, catalogs and Internet
buying are fraught with uncertainties, even if you're an
experienced collector.
</P>
<P>
   When you identify your gallery, don't assume that all they have
is what's on the walls. The gallery owner should offer to bring out
material from the back room or from flat files.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, dealers can have works sent in for your
inspection, in which case all you're obligated to pay for is
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   If you see something you like, ask if you can have it held for a
few days, or have the right of first refusal. That way, you can
look at it two or three more times before you make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also will bring things to a client's home or office, so
they can live with them for a couple of days,'' Campbell says. If
you're a new client, she'll probably ask for a credit card imprint
but, again, you're under no obligation to buy.
</P>
<P>
   And please, please don't start buying art as an investment.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're buying museum-quality work, art is a poor
investment, says veteran Fort Worth collector Bill Runyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the statistic I've seen is that only 2 percent of the
art that sells actually appreciates in value and stays up there,''
says Runyon, who moved from buying work by blue-chip artists to
taking his chances with promising new kids on the block.
</P>
<P>
   That said, price (as well as visual preference) is a good
guideline for beginning collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Brauers quickly realized that first-rate works by emerging
local artists could be had for a fraction of what they'd pay for
inferior pieces by marquee names. So start with an inexpensive _
say $200 to $300 _ purchase of good quality as a
confidence-builder.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Campbell says, ``Just be yourself. Don't worry
about sounding ultra-sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Brauer puts it: ``There is no secret handshake you need
to know in order to buy a piece of art.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   STEP THREE: BUY IT
</P>
<P>
   Most galleries accept credit cards, but just as many allow you
to pay for an artwork in installments _ at no extra cost. And most
of them allow you to take the artwork home before it's paid off.
</P>
<P>
   So, all things considered _ the low price of good local art, the
services a dealer can extend _ the decent thing to do is not ask
for a discount. Instead, think of a discount as a reward you may
earn (along with stuff like getting invited to special previews and
studio visits) after you've become an established client.
</P>
<P>
   What else?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if, after a few years pass and you continue
buying, some of your initial acquisitions seem too easy. This is
part of the territory. Your best bet is to await a local
fund-raising auction and donate such works to a worthy cause.

   Homicide statistics in a Boston Globe story about a school

homicide rate in 1997 was 6.8 per 100,000 population, about 3.6

there were 18,209 homicides in the United States in 1997, according

BUSH, ZEDILLO TALK POLITICS AND DEDICATE NEW BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush stepped into the
international arena Friday to discuss politics with Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo before the two dedicated a new bridge
across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who met privately, discussed Zedillo's plans for the
further democratization of Mexico's election system and Bush's
thoughts on a run for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was interested in my political plans, and I was in his,''
Bush said. ``I believe he is going to go down as one of the best
political reformers in Mexican history.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zedillo praised Bush and President Clinton as
``friends for Mexico,'' but he made no further political comments.
Zedillo did not pass the mid-point of the bridge to cross into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential exploratory committee that was formed in March is
evaluating Bush's campaign prospects and raising money coast to
coast. But Bush reiterated that he would wait until the Texas
legislative session ends in four weeks before making any decisions
about running for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going well, but first things first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush focused on international relations in his public comments
during the dedication of the Veterans Memorial Bridge that links
Brownsville with Matamoros, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He told the crowd of about 1,000 people that Mexico and the
United States can solve more problems and create more jobs as
friends than as adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some in this world who would rather build a wall
than a bridge,'' said Bush, who was dressed casually in an
open-collar shirt against the South Texas heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridge says even though we have problems we can solve them
in the spirit of friendship rather than animosity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-lane bridge, the 13th to dot the Texas-Mexico border
from Brownsville to Laredo, will serve as a direct connection
between U.S. 77, which will become Interstate 69, and a
six-to-eight lane loop in Matamoros.
</P>
<P>
   The structure, which cost U.S. state, local and federal
governments $68 million, is expected to relieve congestion
resulting from expanding cross-border trade.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo praised the bridge as an example of his country's
partnership with the United States and said he would work to expand
free trade with as many countries as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bridge serves as an example of the confidence and trust
between out countries,'' Zedillo said. ``Free trade has meant more
and better opportunities for all countries participating.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Zedillo met privately on the Mexican side of the border
in a brief ceremony to dedicate a customs booth there. Although the
two were side-by-side on a platform in the middle of the bridge,
Zedillo never set foot in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's term ends in 2000 and he has vowed to open the process
by which his successor will be selected. The presidency has been
dominated by the same political party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he and Zedillo discussed a host of issues including
primaries in Mexico's coming elections, the global impact of
Brazilian economic woes and the challenges of raising teen-agers.

THE LAST CHICAGOAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 02, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, when Andrei Shleifer was a 25-year-old
assistant professor fresh out of graduate school, a postcard
arrived one winter morning in his mail in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   On the front was one of of the iconic images of modern
economics: a photo of Milton Friedman and George Stigler strolling
together along a shady Hyde Park street. Seen from the back were
the long and the short of the Chicago school: two men who organized
a movement that had worn away the Iron Curtain through sheer force
of intellect.
</P>
<P>
   Penned onto the sidewalk next to the famous pair was a small
circle with an x in it.
</P>
<P>
   On the back was a note from Stigler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is room for more on the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   That summer Shleifer left Princeton for Chicago. He remained
there for nearly four years, long enough to prove Stigler right.
Then, at the age of 29, he decamped to Harvard and a full
professorship.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Shleifer found himself in the news when, as expected,
he won the John Bates Clark Medal, which is awarded every two years
to the most distinguished US economist under 40. Shleifer is 39.
</P>
<P>
   He thus joined a long list of stars who have won the prize in
the past quarter century: Kevin M. Murphy, University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business; David Card University of California at
Berkeley; Lawrence Summers, US Treasury Department; Paul Krugman,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; David Kreps, Stanford
Graduate School of Business; Sanford Grossman, Wharton School of
the University of Pennyslvania; Jerry Hausman, MIT; James Heckman,
University of Chicago; Michael Spence, Stanford Graduate School of
Business; Joseph Stiglitz, World Bank; and Martin Feldstein,
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a far longer list of potential stars who didn't win the
medal were MIT's Joshua Angrist, Princeton's Bo Honore and Alan
Krueger, and Harvard's Michael Kremer. The fuss in recent years
over the Clark medal has its critics: Imagine if baseball was to
pick only one Most Valuable Player and do so only every other year.
What kind of a guide would that be to the World Series of a given
year? What sort of tip sheet to the Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, no denying that Shleifer makes good copy, if
only because the best mid-career US economist first set foot in the
United States at the age of 15. His parents emigrated to Rochester
in 1976, among the very first Jews permitted to leave the Soviet
Union under a set of new agreements. His father is an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   By 1978, Shleifer was headed for Harvard; his test scores were
off the map. A freshman friend, J. Bradford De Long, remembers an
introductory economics section led by an expert on the Soviet
economy _ and attended regularly by the alum of Moscow Math and
Science High School Number Two. ``Andrei has very good social
skills,'' says De Long.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Shleifer struck up an association with young
Lawrence Summers, then just starting out as an assistant professor
at MIT _ by citing five errors in a Summers paper, according to
legend. Shleifer graduated in math in 1982, and went straight on to
MIT.
</P>
<P>
   There were subtantial contributions from the very beginning. His
thesis (unpretentiously titled ``The Stock Market and the Business
Cycle'') became at least a pair of papers, one on ``implementation
cycles,'' the other on mis-pricing of companies whose shares are
included in widely followed indexes. He quickly formed a lasting
research partnership with Rob Vishny of the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business that has been among the longest-lasting
and most fruitful in all of present-day economics.
</P>
<P>
   They made their first big splash in 1986 in ``Large Shareholders
and Corporate Control,'' pointing out the significance of a
frequently overlooked fact: that raiders inevitably participate in
the gains from their takeover bids. That put the pair squarely in
the middle of the discussion of the market for corporate control
that has percolated briskly for more than 20 years, ever since
Michael C. Jensen touched it off in 1979 with and article on
principal-agent relationships and ownership structures.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to weigh Shleifer's contributions, MIT's
Olivier Blanchard divided them into three broad categories of
enduring work.
</P>
<P>
   There were his explorations of corporate governance and finance,
of course, with his work on certain unpredictable and dangerous
imperfections in financial markets now seen to be especially
far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a 1996 paper on the problems that fund managers would
face in moments of unforeseen crisis (``The Limits to Arbitrage'')
could be said to have anticipated with ``amazing prescience'' the
Long Term Capital Management crisis by two full years, according to
Blanchard.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the third strand, the theory and practice of the
transition from planned to market economies around the world, that
been Shleifer's greatest contribution, says Blanchard, adding that
``he may well be the most influential researcher in the field.'' Of
the Russian privatization in particular, Shleifer was the
intellectual father.
</P>
<P>
   It was he who hit on the idea of selling Russia's largest firms
to insiders at a discount, in the hope that managers later would
sell their windfall gains and surface further value. (The logic is
described in detail in his 1995 book with Vishny and Maxim Boycko,
``Privatizing Russia.'')
</P>
<P>
   If envisaging the Russian privatization is Shleifer's greatest
accomplishment, surely his role in its implementation is his
greatest private sorrow. From 1991 until 1997, he served as
official adviser to the Russian government, often supported by
funding from the US Agency for International Development. During
the latter part of the period, Shleifer's mentor Larry Summers
oversaw US economic policy towards Russia as Deputy Secretary of
the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Shleifer had married a young derivatives trader,
Nancy Zimmerman. In time she had become a well known hedge-fund
manager, making investments in, among many other things, Russian
debt. A student, Jonathan Hay, had become deeply involved in
rewriting the Russian securities laws. Hay's companion, Elizabeth
Hebert, had won a desirable license to sell mutual funds to
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   This web of palpable opportunties and possible conflicts tore
apart in 1997 when political maneuvering in Moscow led to
accusations in Washington: Shleifer lost his government contracts,
his official engagement to the Russian government, and Harvard
restructured its consulting activities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Shleifer has thrown himself into research and
publishing activities, though he remains a principal of an
asset-management firm. A paper with Harvard's Edward Glaeser on
``Not-for-Profit Entrepreneurs'' is making the rounds. His widely
anticipated Clarendon Lectures on financial markets are due later
this year. A collection of lively essays with Vishny _ ``The
Grabbing Hand: Government Pathologies and their Cures'' _ is in the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   As MIT's Blanchard says, ``his value is neither in brilliant
theoretical insights nor in sophisticated models. He is very much
in the old Chicago tradition of building simple models, emphasizing
basic economic mechanisms at work, and looking at the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to the Last Chicagoan. The same meeting of
the governing body of the American Economic Association that
conferred the Clark medal on Shleifer also nominated Sherwin Rosen,
a University of Chicago economist best known for his work on the
economics of superstars, to serve as AEA president next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the '90s have seen one Nobel Prize after another
conferred on economists at the University of Chicago, the decade
since Shleifer left for Harvard has not been an easy one for those
there still working on their reputations. Two of the department's
brightest stars have left: Jose Scheinkman for Princeton and Thomas
Sargent for Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Prescott, a leading exemplar of the Chicago style, has
begun commuting to the Windy City from Minneapolis, and of course
Eugene Fama, Gary Becker, and Robert Lucas remain active there. But
Robert Barro, Michael Jensen and Shleifer are at Harvard, and the
legion of talented economists who remain are either too young or
too old or lacking in the peculiar combination of clarity and
ambition that permitted Friedman and Stigler to put such a stamp
upon their age.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the sidewalk is looking somewhat forlorn.
Unless they miraculously reassemble the mold, Sherwin Rosen is, as
his friends describe him, the Last Chicagoan.

 CIVILIAN CASUALTIES COULD RISE WITH ROCKET ARTILLERY, B-52s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (News analysis)
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite NATO efforts to avoid civilian casualties
in Yugoslavia, the number killed could climb markedly once allied
forces step up the war with ferocious rocket and missile artillery
barrages and unguided bombs from B-52s.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the alliance's accelerated air campaign, 23 Apache
helicopter gunships, designed to take out enemy tanks, are
stationed in northern Albania, poised for combat over the embattled
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In order to protect the choppers, which are vulnerably because
they fly low, NATO commanders plan to clear a path for them in
Kosovo that will be free of Yugoslav air defenses. To produce the
fire-free zone, the commanders have placed 18 rocket launchers on
tracked vehicles along the Albania-Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   The launchers _ called Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) _
are high-tech artillery designed to destroy radar sites and
surface-to-air missiles that might shoot down the choppers.
</P>
<P>
   In less than a minute, each MLRS can fire 12 rockets with a
range of about 20 miles. Once over a target, a single rocket lets
loose its deadly cargo of about 650 mini-bombs designed to kill
troops and destroy vehicles with shrapnel bursts.
</P>
<P>
   The MLRS also can launch two satellite-guided Army Tactical
Missile Systems, each with a range of 120 miles, which is greater
than the width of Kosovo, and each able to release 900 bomblets
over an area several acres wide. Some are equipped with a type of
mini-bomb that can destroy tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi troops in the 1991 Persian Gulf War nicknamed the MLRS
``steel rain'' because of its destructive force.
</P>
<P>
   While each of the cruise missiles that NATO forces have fired
over the last five weeks can blow up a building, MLRS rockets and
missiles are far more destructive. One of its rockets or missiles
can kill people over five acres.
</P>
<P>
   In its attacks so far, NATO estimates it has accidentally killed
about 100 civilians. The Yugoslav government claims the toll is
more than 600 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McNaugher, an Army expert and senior analyst here with
the Rand Corp., a military think tank, said many of the 800,000
ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo could get caught in a MLRS
barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MLRS was very useful against an Iraqi force coming into
Kuwait, where it was military-to-military, and the danger of
civilian casualties was pretty low,'' McNaugher said, but in
Kosovo, he added, ``that's not the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't see how you use the MLRS to clear a path of
safety for the Apaches. There are hundreds of thousands of refugees
roaming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Posen, professor of national security studies at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said an errant MLRS could
devastate a civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weapon drops hundreds of grenades on an area but it is
not with pinpoint accuracy,'' he explained. ``If you guess wrong
and the rockets end up in the wrong place, it's a horror show. This
is deliberately engineered to do a lot of killing in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at Brookings Institution
here, said that in order to avoid killing civilians with the MLRS,
NATO planners will need finely detailed intelligence from commandos
and from spy planes called Joint-Stars surveillance jets (J-Stars)
so that the weapon can be targeted to the right area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be possible to find a (military) convoy with J-Stars,
but a tractor looks an awful lot like a personnel carrier or jeep
from J-Stars,'' O'Hanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if NATO successfully attacks Yugoslav conveys or radar
sites with the MLRS, O'Hanlon predicted that Serbian commanders
will quickly change tactics and intersperse military units among
civilians as they are already doing in parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The same concerns about civilian casualties apply to Pentagon
plans to drop unguided, or ``dumb,'' bombs against Yugoslav troop
concentrations from high-flying B-52 bombers. So far during the
conflict, the bombers have fired only cruise missiles, which
usually can be targeted with precision.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has also relied mainly on other precision-guided weapons
like the Tomahawk cruise missile and the television-guided AGM-130
bomb to destroy buildings, command centers, storage depots and
troop concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   McNaugher of Rand says NATO isn't likely to drop the
indiscriminate dumb bombs unless Yugoslav troops are out in the
open away from towns or refugee camps. ``I can only see using them
on targets in the middle of nowhere,'' he said.

   TOSNO, Russia _ Caterpillar had just cleared away a patch of
spindly trees in this town outside St. Petersburg and begun
building a new $50 million factory when, one day last August, the
Russian financial system collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the Russian government devalued its currency and
simultaneously defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt. Prices
doubled over the next seven months, and the spending power of
ordinary Russians decreased 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble, worth around 15 cents before the crisis, has fallen
to about 4 cents. Many smaller companies, such as those Caterpillar
had envisioned as customers for its Russian-made construction
equipment, were ruined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked ourselves some hard questions,'' said Stu Levenick,
general director of Caterpillar Overseas in Moscow, ``mainly about
whether this was the right time to invest $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic collapse confirmed the worst corporate fears about
Russia: It is too unstable to operate here. Companies such as Pizza
Hut and Hershey have pulled out, and many that had considered
entering Russia shelved their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar could have easily followed the conventional wisdom.
Yet a number of Western multinationals _ not just Caterpillar but
Nestle, Lucent Technologies and others _ are coping with the
economic crisis by settling deeper into Russia rather than pulling
out.
</P>
<P>
   They are not blind to the problems, so they have developed a
variety of strategies to cope. Most have started by picking areas
where the local government now supports business, regardless of
broader upheaval in Russia. This is one such area. In St.
Petersburg and the surrounding region, six American projects are
expected to bring more than $500 million of direct foreign
investment over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar is pushing ahead with its plant, and production
there should begin on schedule in December. Up the highway from
Tosno, the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. opened a new factory this winter,
and Gillette is building one next door. Philip Morris is
constructing a $330 million plant, and International Paper recently
paid an estimated $65 million to acquire controlling interest in a
local paper mill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ford Motor is in final negotiations with the Russian
government to invest more than $150 million in an auto plant in the
region surrounding what was once the city of Leningrad.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this region, still known by its old Leningrad name,
Bayerische Motorwerken recently announced a joint venture in the
far western Kaliningrad region. Lucent Technologies began to
produce fiber optics in the Voronezh region of central Russia. And
Nestle will be investing $30 million in six existing factories
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies had bucked the prevailing corporate
trend before, coming to Russia in the mid-1990s while competitors
hesitated. That experience has made them less skittish than they
might have been five years ago about the turmoil that can damage
emerging market economies.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by Russia's enormous potential to consume and produce
their goods, these corporations have made a long-term commitment
regardless of short-term disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will the crisis end?'' Nigel Brackenbury, general
director of Ford's operation in Moscow, asked. ``It won't. It's the
challenge for all of us in Russia to put together strategies to
promote growth in the conditions we have. It's not time to wait
around for external circumstances to change and help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Western executives are relieved that Russia
reached agreement this week on a $4.5 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund to avoid default on its existing debts
to the international agency, they are paying much more attention
these days to the action closer to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``From New York or Washington, Russia looks hopeless,'' said
Scott Blacklin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Moscow. ``But you can have a successful business here and not at
all be tied to reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the collapse, few foreign investors had the nerves
for Russia. The government treats most businesses, domestic and
foreign, equally poorly, burdening them with onerous taxes, hostile
and corrupt bureaucracies and ever-changing regulations. Direct
foreign investment in Russia totaled a paltry $2 billion last year,
according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But the chamber expects direct investment in 1999 to at least
stay at that level. One reason is that some places in Russia are
easier to work in than others, and the willingness of certain
regional and local authorities to cooperate with investors has been
critical to keeping Western money here. The economic crisis has not
made regions historically wary of foreigners any friendlier, but it
has made fence sitters like the city of St. Petersburg more
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the city's attitude was something like `Kiss our ring,
and maybe we'll do a deal with you,''' said James T. Hitch,
managing partner at the St. Petersburg office of Baker &AMP; McKenzie,
the law firm. ``Now, it's like: `You've decided to stay in Russia
after the crisis? You're dedicated to us? Well, how can we work
together?'''
</P>
<P>
   The city understands that it faces competition for scarce
investment from its neighbor, the Leningrad region. Two years ago,
the regional government developed a set of laws and tax breaks to
attract investors.
</P>
<P>
   The region attracted about $290 million in foreign investment in
1997 and 1998 and is expected to get another $350 million this
year. ``No crisis influences us,'' said Sergei Naryshkin, head of
the region's committee on external economic relations. ``We won't
step back from our investment politics or from our commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has seeped to the local level. Tosno, at a passing
glance, could be any small Russian town. Old wooden shacks that
have begun to list toward the swampy earth line its outskirts. The
main road that cuts through the center of town is still called
Lenin Prospekt, and one mild Saturday residents were out raking
leaves in the parks and squares as they had during the many springs
spent under Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is widespread among the 30,000 people of Tosno, and
people pack the suburban trains to St. Petersburg to seek work
there.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The town's young mayor and his staff are eager to draw foreign
investment. As part of the Caterpillar deal, the town reduced the
local portion of the profit tax. It helped win federal permission
to cut the trees at the site. It worked with the local utility
company to get Caterpillar the electrical power it will need, and
it offered the Americans a 49-year lease on the site, since private
ownership of commercial land still is not allowed in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important to investors is the good will of the
authorities,'' said the deputy mayor, Galina Karpova. ``We're
willing to help them solve their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Many multinationals realize that Russia, stable or not, is
ultimately too big a market to be ignored. In Russia, there's still
great unmet demand for everything from chewing gum and beer to
trucks and bulldozers. And when the ruble weakened badly, imports _
paid for in dollars and other foreign currency _ were suddenly out
of reach for most Russians, who get their skimpy wages in rubles.
That made local production look better.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the companies that were importing stopped,'' Hitch said.
``By contrast, all the companies that were already producing here
or in the process of doing so kept moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For those already here, the crisis forced them to work more
effectively. Wrigley, like most makers of consumer goods, suffered
a drop in sales of between 20 percent and 30 percent. But the
company gained market share from competitors in this period, it
says, because it encouraged its sales force to work harder to get
its products on store shelves to make up for a cut in advertising
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy will be to focus on the export market, as
Caterpillar plans to do, until demand in Russia rises again.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say companies with direct investment have not
suffered. Take United Technologies' Otis elevator business. Among
the oldest Western businesses in St. Petersburg, Otis invested $20
million in building an elevator factory. The company also provides
services for municipalities that still own most housing in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Cities in northwest Russia ran up debts to the company of 40
million rubles, which before the crisis was worth about $7 million.
After Aug. 17, when the ruble was devalued, that sum was worth $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost $5 million in one day,'' said Vladimir Marov, director
of the Otis St. Petersburg plant. ``The crisis hit us very hard.
We've suffered over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   A man with deep laugh lines and the taut build of an aging
bantamweight, Marov walks through the corridors of Otis' offices on
the way to the factory floor. On one side of the corridor, people
are working.
</P>
<P>
   The other half is empty, the beige tile etched with black
circles from the wheels of office chairs that have been recently
packed away. Otis has laid off about 10 percent of its St.
Petersburg staff. Last autumn, Otis St. Petersburg did not sell a
single elevator, and the factory was idle for a month. It has
closed maintenance offices in a few cities and is struggling to get
St. Petersburg to pay 23 million rubles in debt accrued before the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had any experience with such a sudden fall, but we
survived the best we could,'' Marov said. ``The question came up
among our leadership in the U.S. and Germany about whether we
should continue. And we decided we should, because the potential is
so big and things will calm down at some point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That tempting potential and the vision, however elusive, of a
stable Russia continue to draw automakers, despite a 60 percent
drop in sales of foreign cars since last summer. Russians have
typically bought about one million cars a year, only 10 percent of
them foreign-made.
</P>
<P>
   In early April, BMW announced the opening of a 50 million mark
($27 million) joint venture in Kaliningrad to assemble cars and
sport utility vehicles. General Motors is holding talks with
Russia's biggest car company, AvtoVaz, to start a $200 million
joint venture that would initially manufacture 35,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has settled on the village of Vsevolozhsk, 20 miles
northwest of St. Petersburg. The company already has an assembly
plant in Belarus where workers put the final touches on Escorts and
Transit vans that arrive nearly built. The Belarus plant can turn
out 6,000 vehicles a year, though in the six months after the
economic collapse, it produced nothing. The Vsevolozhsk plant would
have far larger capacity, starting at about 25,000 cars a year with
the possibility of expanding to 100,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company looked closely at the entire project. It
decided that to have the high sales it wanted in Russia, it had to
manufacture locally. ``Russia has significant future growth
potential,'' Brackenbury of Ford said. ``The question is, will
there ever be a right time to come into Russia?'' As far as Ford is
concerned, now is as good a time as any.

KOSOVO AND CONGRESSIONAL PARTISANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 02, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even by the low standards we have come to expect of this
lamentable edition of the US Congress, the performance of this
current collection of clucks and Claghorns over Kosovo is
remarkable for its cheap political partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   The US House of Representatives disgraced itself yet again
Wednesday when the members could not even decide whether to approve
or oppose the NATO bombing camaign that is the planet's most
important political issue of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Serb forces systematically massacred more than 100
male refugees kneeling at gunpoint in a farmer's field, the House
refused to support the NATO air effort. With US airmen risking
their lives nightly in a relentless bombing campaign which may yet
take a sad toll of American aircrews, the craven congressmen who
think politics is all that counts undermined what the majority
party's ringleaders privately sneer is ``Clinton's war.''
</P>
<P>
   Their cynicism is exceeded only by their opportunism, for the
same crowd prepared to approve twice as much extra money for the US
military as the President seeks. Coming off a year of fruitless
impeachment bombast, the 213-213 tie vote that refused to put the
House in favor of the US participation in NATO's intensive bombing
campaign was yet more proof that this Impeachment Congress is a
particularly inept assemblage of political mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   It is journalistic shorthand to cite ``the Republican-led House
and Senate,'' but there is next to no leadership visible in either
branch on anything but stick-it-to-Clinton votes.
</P>
<P>
   The tiresome partisanship that branded this new Congress during
the grueling impeachment imbroglio refuses to be quenched. New
Speaker Denny Hastert (R-Ill.) plays the chump as he sits by idly
to watch the brass-knuckle tactics of House Whip Tom Delay
(R-Tex.). This former exterminator is the most relentless
Clinton-basher of the Impeachment Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   It was Delay who engineered the failure of the NATO bombing vote
_ a measure fails if it does not gain a majority, and the tie vote
played into the hands of the GOP even though the muddled Speaker,
Hastert-the-Hesitant, voted a weak ``aye'' at the roll call's tail
end.
</P>
<P>
   Delay is more influential with Republican members than Hastert.
So fearful is the rookie Speaker of the right-wingers commanded by
Delay that he claims he didn't try to influence any Republicans
even though he himself voted meekly to back the NATO effort. How's
that for leadership?
</P>
<P>
   ``A low moment in American foreign policy,'' bellowed House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.), who looks more and more like
the fellow who'll seize the gavel from Hastert. ``A betrayal of
everything America stands for,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans don't know how to play the Kosovo question. The
only one of the 11 Republicans running for president who supports
the war is Vietnam hero Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whose
forthright argument for ground troops and a firm commitment to win
has moved him up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The only New Englanders who voted against backing the NATO air
campaign were four Republicans, including the ususal suspects: two
from New Hampshire, Charles Bass and John Sununu, and Rep. Nancy
Johnson of Connecticut. They are the same three New Englanders who
broke with the regional pack to vote to impeach Clinton. Joining
them was Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, who'd voted against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As the nervous broadcasters of Serb TV waited for their next
transmitter tower to topple, they could brag that at least the US
House refused to go along with the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about giving aid and comfort to the enemy. So Balkanized is
this Congress, if I may use the term, that it looks ever-more-likey
the GOP will lose the slimmed-down five-seat margin initially won
in the landslide '94 House election.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the Democrats are divided as well. While 31
Republicans voted to support the NATO action, 26 Democrats
defected. Still, 181 Democrats voted to support Clinton's decision
on the air war, and 187 Republicans voted ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that this Congress will be unable to overcome the
emotional riptides still swirling about the Congress even as an
ongoing, if undeclared, war changes the subject from impeachment.
It will take a decisive election and a shakeup of the current
congressional leadership to set things right in the divided House
that is this House.
</P>
<P>
   When a number of GOP presidential candidates assembled Sunday
(May 2) in Manchester, NH, for the state party's primary kickoff
dinner, missing from the lineup was this year's frontrunner, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas; last time's winner, broadcaster Pat
Buchanan, and the party's brandname war hero, Sen. McCain.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves, in alphabetical order, Lamar Alexander, Gary Bauer,
Elizabeth Dole, Steve Forbes, US Rep. John Kasich, Alan Keyes,
former Vice President Dan Quayle, and hometown Sen. Bob Smith. They
each got seven minutes of microphone time to do the following, as
far as I can anticipate:
</P>
<P>
   1. Schmooze the locals, being particularly attentive to local
Sen. Judd Gregg, whose organization is not worth antagonizing.
</P>
<P>
   2. Flog the hated Clinton (who just happened to carry New
Hampshire in the last two elections) and deny him any shred of
credit for the prosperous, inflation-free regional economy.
</P>
<P>
   3. Link Vice President Al Gore to all manner of perfidy in DC,
from Buddhist nuns to China policy to nuclear leaks.
</P>
<P>
   4. Blame Clinton-Gore for the moral decay that led to the
Colorado school shootings and many other evils.
</P>
<P>
   All the above are predictable political moves in front of a
partisan crowd. But what does a would-be president say about the
war? How do you package your policy in a couple or three
paragraphs? In front of a local political establishment that, in
Congress if not at the grass roots, is all anti-Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Republicans have always worn their patriotism
on the sleeve, boasting of unmatched fealty to flag, veterans,
military spending, etc. etc. So how will they handle the fact that
their two congressmen just voted against the NATO campaign to halt
the massacres, and will shortly vote double the extra defense
spending the White House deems wise?
</P>
<P>
   How do you square that circle?
</P>

 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To Tony Bennett and his son Danny, it seemed just an
offhand comment. At a star-studded Christmas Eve dinner party in
1997 at the home of Tommy Mottola, then the president of Sony Music
Entertainment, Robert DeNiro turned to the crooner, who was 70 at
the time, and said, ``Hey, Tony _ there's a film I want you in.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bennett, 45, who is his father's manager, said: ``A lot of
people say that kind of stuff. I didn't pay much attention.'' But a
year later, he received a call from Harold Ramis, director of
``Analyze This,'' a Warner Brothers comedy starring De Niro as the
leader of a crime family who seeks help from a psychotherapist.
Ramis, he said, offered his father $15,000 to sing ``Got the World
on a String'' in the movie's final scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold tells me the whole script, and that the analyst and
DeNiro share a love of Bennett's music,'' recalled Danny Bennett.
``But they made a fatal mistake. They told me they had already shot
the film. So I'm like: `Hey, they shot the whole film around Tony
being the end gag and they're offering me $15,000? Frank Sinatra is
dead. There was Sinatra, and then there was Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers said it ended up paying the elder Bennett
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   In most families, it is the son who relies on his father's
business expertise. The Bennetts have turned that traditional
relationship on its head. Tony Bennett might well be a
dulcet-voiced superstar, whose signature tune, ``I Left My Heart in
San Francisco,'' and other hits are entrancing Generation X'ers
today as they did their parents and grandparents years ago. But
when it comes to finances, he is out of his element _ as he is the
first to confess.
</P>
<P>
   And so he has found an unlikely redeemer: his own son. He first
turned to Danny 20 years ago for help in escaping financial
disaster. At the time, Tony Bennett's brand of pre-rock
balladeering was out of favor, his income had slowed and the IRS
was breathing down his neck to collect $2 million in back taxes,
the younger Bennett recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The singer's personal life was also in turmoil. His second
marriage was on the rocks, and to escape his troubles, he had
turned to cocaine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   When the IRS called his accountants to say it was starting
proceedings to seize his house, Bennett, as he put it,
``overindulged'' and had to be rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His son said: ``That was the day of reckoning. That is when he
called me up. I think that was a desperate move.''
</P>
<P>
   So the younger Bennett joined forces with his father, first
seeing that he did not lose his home, and then helping him climb
back to financial health. When the IRS debt was paid off in 1990,
the singer was still skeptical about his financial security. ``I
said, `Your head is above water,' and Tony said, `Really?''' the
son recalled, alluding to his father as Tony, as he always does in
business discussions to make the professional relationship as clear
as possible. ``I don't think he really believes it to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Danny Bennett oversees a nest egg of $15 million to $20
million for his father.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in the singer's Manhattan apartment, which
overlooks Central Park, Tony Bennett seemed the very picture of
sensible prosperity. The furniture was comfortable but sparse, and
a David Hockney drawing of Bennett _ a gift to the singer from the
artist _ adorned one wall. Dressed in gray wool slacks and a plaid
blazer, Bennett sat on a sofa stroking his Maltese dog, ``Boo,'' in
his lap. His manner was polite though distant, a marked contrast to
his easygoing stage style.
</P>
<P>
   But he talked openly about a fear of financial ruin that has
pervaded his musical career. ``For 45 years, I had an ax over my
head,'' he said. ``I thought I was going to go bankrupt. I was
spending more than I was making, on advertising, publicity and
all.'' His managers weren't much help, he said, telling him, ``
`You owe so much money. You will never be able to pull out of it as
long as you live.'''
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong; Bennett did pull out, largely through the
efforts of his son. ``I realize how fortunate I am to have someone,
in Danny, that is truly looking out for my best interests and not
just in it for the money,'' the singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bennett must have seemed an odd choice to replace the
professional managers. At the time, he was a 25-year-old punk
rocker with long, dyed-blue hair. (``At least I had hair then,'' he
recalled.) He had never gone to college, and instead pursued his
dream of becoming a rock star. His father, he said, had no
objections.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out that the son was the mirror image of the
father: Tony's talent lay in art, not business, and Danny's lay in
business, not art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always the business manager for the bands I was in,''
the son recalled. One of his first moves as financial adviser to
his father was to suggest _ he never decrees _ a spending budget
for him and his wife, Sandra. Soon after, Danny's stepmother filed
for a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, the son crunched the numbers and wrote
the budgets while the father performed. To revive the singer's
career, he marketed him as a living American legend, a genial
master of his craft.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. By the early 1980s Bennett was making regular
television appearances on ``Late Night With David Letterman,'' a
program popular with college students.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, his ``Perfectly Frank'' album went gold, selling over
500,000 copies, and in 1993 he appeared with the Red Hot Chili
Peppers on the MTV Music Awards. In 1994 he joined Elvis Costello
and K.D. Lang on the popular cable TV show ``MTV Unplugged.'' Over
the last eight years, he has won seven Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   As his popularity zoomed, Bennett created a program with Sony
Music Entertainment called ``Live by Request'' on the A&AMP;E cable
network that showcases prominent singers. The program, which won an
Emmy in 1996, was an instant hit. When Bennett starred in the first
show, more than 1.5 million viewers called in requests for songs.
</P>
<P>
   The money followed the restored magic. Today, Bennett makes an
estimated 100 live performances a year, earning $50,000 or so a
concert, or about $5 million. An avid artist, he sells his
paintings and drawings for up to $80,000 apiece. His son, intent on
marketing his father's image wherever it will sell, has plans for
Tony Bennett furniture, Tony Bennett sheets and Tony Bennett
towels. Then there are the royalties from more than four decades of
recorded music, and even a commercial or two.
</P>
<P>
   It is Danny Bennett, in consultation with brokers at Gruntal &AMP;
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney, who decides how to invest his
father's money; his father's only rule is a ban on tobacco and
chemical stocks. About 70 percent of the singer's portfolio is
currently in tax-free municipal bonds _ conservative,
income-generating investments not unusual for someone his age. The
remainder is in an array of stocks. Once a month, father and son go
over a printout of the investments and other financial details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' the younger Bennett said, ``I show him what he is
making from the paintings and he goes, `A person could live on
that, huh?'''
</P>
<P>
   While his wealth might not seem much when compared with the
fortunes being made these days by some media superstars, it is a
comfortable sum for a man who was once close to bankruptcy.
Besides, Bennett leads a fairly austere life for a celebrity. True,
he likes to dress well and fly first-class. But he rents his
apartment, and has rejected his son's suggestion that he buy a
country place. And his girlfriend, Susan Crow, 33, is a
schoolteacher who keeps a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances say Bennett is surprisingly unpretentious. As a
result, when his finances unraveled, he wasn't blocked by false
pride from asking his son for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the stage, Tony is remarkably intellectually agile, though
he does not have anywhere near the vocal range or improvisational
gift of Ella and Mel Torme,'' said Jonathan Schwartz, the artistic
director of Lincoln Center's American Songbook series and
well-known disk jockey who currently has a program on WNYC-AM.
``Tony has the confidence in this part of himself. But one of the
things that Tony has known all his life are his limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a 1974 interview in The New Yorker, he discussed some
of those limitations. ``There are things I am searching for, but
they won't take a day,'' Bennett said. ``I would like to attain a
good keen intellect.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a perception of himself reflects humility, as his
son believes, or insecurity, as Schwartz believes, it has freed him
to throw his energies into his art. In that sense, Schwartz said,
it has provided a boost to his career. ``If Tony's low self-esteem
had been higher, it is entirely possible the music would have been
lower, fused as it would have been with arrogance and self,''
Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, the singer has always been exacting about his
craft _ a quality that goes back to his childhood in Queens during
the Depression. His father, a grocer born in Italy, died when Tony
was 9, and his mother supported her family by doing piecework as a
seamstress. And just as she would take home only the
highest-quality dresses to work on, so he would later sing only the
songs he thought were destined to become classics. ``Tony only
sings fancy dresses,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said pleasing his audiences was always more important to
him than making money. And in the old days, at least, a lot of
singers felt the same way, he said. He recalled seeing what he
called the ``financial log'' for the Blue Note, the legendary jazz
club where Fats Waller wrote the music to ``Ain't Misbehavin'.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a jam session in Harlem, and Fats Waller just came
down and wrote that song on a paper bag,'' he recalled. ``The log
showed that he was paid two bottles of gin. The song became a great
Broadway musical and made millions.''
</P>
<P>
   (Though jazz scholars say the anecdote is historically
impossible _ the Blue Note did not even exist when Waller wrote the
song _ they agree that such financial arrangements were not
uncommon.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Bennett said, in the 1950s and '60s, ``one of the
touches of class that singers had was they never spoke about
money,'' he said. The focus was on music, and ``whoever did the
best job rose to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred, Ella, they were the best,'' he said, referring to Fred
Astaire and Ella Fitzgerald. ``Integrity was as important as money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just make money, so what?'' Bennett added. ``It's like
the Chinese say about paper money: The rats eat it.'' Better to
have somebody overseeing his portfolio who cares about his money as
much as about his talent _ somebody, in short, like his son.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a child, Danny Bennett was surrounded by musical
celebrities. His home was often in a state of confusion, with his
father's musician friends coming and going. He remembers answering
the door when he was 8 to a guest who announced: ``I'm Dizzy.''
Thinking the unfamiliar visitor was having trouble standing up,
Danny asked, ``Would you like to come and sit down?'' Dizzy
Gillespie, the jazz great, did.
</P>
<P>
   Though his parents were separated when he was 10 years old and
he lived with his mother, he remained close to his father. When he
got the call for help in 1979, ``It was sad, but it didn't affect
me,'' the younger Bennett remembered, in large part because such
financial meltdowns were a staple of the music business.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His father had already learned the hard way that his son had a
better business sense than he did. In 1974, Tony Bennett wanted to
start an independent record label, but his son advised him against
it, pointing out that he would need a distribution arrangement with
a major label, which he lacked. Bennett went ahead, and the venture
failed. Several years later, he put his financial fate in his son's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   For Danny, working with the IRS was unnerving. ``You would make
all sorts of deals with them, and then all of a sudden I would have
to renegotiate the whole thing with new agents,'' he recalled. To
pay off the debt faster, he borrowed against his father's future
performance contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Resuscitating his father's career was equally tough. Though
Bennett had been recording to critical acclaim on lesser-known
labels in the mid-1970s, his earlier hits had been with Columbia
Records. Danny finally signed a new deal with Columbia in 1985,
aware that it would have more incentive to market new albums that
could promote sales of Bennett's older releases.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, he sought to broaden his father's audience.
``Tony abhorred demographics,'' his son recalled. ``He believed he
could play to the whole family. I told him that in order to do
that, you have to go to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first stop was the Letterman show. And after Danny Bennett
read a news article in The Boston Phoenix in which Bob Guccione
Jr., then the owner of Spin magazine, described Tony Bennett as
``the essence of soul,'' he got Spin to run a profile of his
father. After the singer's musical tribute to Frank Sinatra,
``Perfectly Frank,'' went gold in 1992, his son landed him the spot
on the MTV Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the younger Bennett worked on straight salary. But as
his role grew, and he took over managing all aspects of his
father's career, he began to earn a potentially more lucrative
commission on his father's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   He has already parlayed that success into a wider business; his
entertainment-management company, RPM Music Productions, also
handles Elvis Costello, the pop music band Mike Viola and the Candy
Butchers, and Rasputina, an alternative-rock cello trio. He is
starting RPM Records as a joint venture with Columbia Records.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1992, Danny Bennett put most of his father's money
into tax-free municipal bonds, yielding 5.5 percent _ the
equivalent of 10.3 percent in taxable income for a New York City
resident. But in 1996, as Wall Street continued its long bull
market, he moved about 30 percent into such winning stocks as
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Sprint and Viacom _ and a few losers,
like National Semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   He was an early believer in the Internet, buying Amazon.com and
Yahoo stock for himself and Microsoft for his father. ``I had
learned how to engineer and produce records,'' the younger Bennett
said. ``Computers are an extension of that. In the early 1990s I
was managing a band called Tribe on Warner Brothers. We set up a
Web address in 1992.'' He thinks he was the first to display a Web
address on a record album.
</P>
<P>
   While Tony Bennett is content to let his son handle his
portfolio, he likes to recall one of his own investment triumphs.
Years ago, he says, he was approached by his friend John Kluge, the
billionaire founder of the company then known as Metromedia Inc.,
the television and cellular phone conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Do you ever buy stocks?','' Bennett recalled. ``I
said, `Not really.' He said. `Buy my stock.''' So Bennett did,
sometime around 1970, and held onto it until Kluge called him one
day in the mid-'80s and advised him to sell. ``I had $5,000 worth
of stock at $3 a share. It ended up being $350 a share,'' a gain of
1,157 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While once a person had to have a million dollars to retire
nicely, today the level is a ``tenmillionaire,'' the younger
Bennett said. It appears that his father has passed that mark.
</P>
<P>
   But though the singer has curtailed his performance schedule
somewhat, he has no plans to sit back and clip coupons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you study the masters _ Picasso, Jack Benny, Fred Astaire _
right up to the the day they died, they were performing,'' Bennett
said. ``If you are creative, you get busier as you get older.''

   They Might Even Meet Alan Greenspan Himself &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise that teen-agers would love to meet the
Chicago Bulls or the Spice Girls. But how about shaking hands with
members of the Federal Open Market Committee? Well, for high school
students in the final rounds Sunday and Monday of the Fed
Challenge, a sort of monetary-policy bee for budding
macroeconomists, the committee has star power.
</P>
<P>
   Teams in the finals, held each year in Washington, typically
portray members of the committee, which sets the nation's monetary
policy in discussions of financial conditions and debates over
whether to adjust interest rates. Then the teams are grilled by
judges recruited by the Federal Reserve, which runs the event.
</P>
<P>
   The students' knowledge sometimes amazes the judges. Lloyd
Bromberg, director of educational programs for the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, who has been a judge for the contest in the past,
recalled one contestant who quoted from an arcane report by the Fed
bank in Kansas City, Mo. ``The judges looked to each other and
said, `I didn't read that article,''' Bromberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its fifth year, the contest shows evidence of changing
the way economics is taught. Several high schools around the
country offer college-credit courses that prepare students for the
Fed Challenge, according to Federal Reserve officials. A powerful
incentive is the prize money, provided by Citigroup: a $40,000
grant for the winning school, a $10,000 scholarship for each of the
five members of its team and $10,000 for their teacher.
</P>
<P>
   This year's finalists will meet some members of the committee
they have studied and portrayed _ and perhaps an even bigger
monetary star. It's not certain yet whether the Fed chairman, Alan
Greenspan, will be there this year, but Bromberg said that in 1997,
the students ``lit up,'' when Greenspan appeared to award the
trophy.

   At the Bonnie Ridge Apartments, residents can pay to use a
computer, a printer, a copying machine or a fax machine in an
office-like setting in the community clubhouse. The computers are
connected to the Internet, and there is even a hook-up for laptops.
Residents pay by swiping credit cards at the machines. It costs $5
a half-hour, for example, to use a computer.

RATING VANS: WHO HAS THE BEST FAMILY ROOM FOR THE ROAD?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chrysler created the modern minivan, and for 15 years it has
successfully fended off the arrows of a pack of challengers. But
the rivals keep coming with ever more potent weapons, including new
vans this year from Ford and Honda (on the heels of improved
competition from General Motors and Toyota).
</P>
<P>
   But just as van makers figured out what customers want in a
family vehicle _ from extra doors to cup holders to secondary music
sources with headphone jacks _ the market has cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales have picked up nicely this year, they remain
below their 1994 peak, and rebates and discounts are common. Sport
utility vehicles are one reason, and rebellion against the vans'
soccer-mom image is another.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan is ingenious because it allows families _ or soccer
teams _ to travel together while staying separate. Captains' chairs
give occupants their own padded thrones. Cup holders and storage
pockets are handy. Some vans even have separate rear climate
controls and audio sources with headphone jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is plenty of evidence that designers are paying
attention to how minivans are used. Storage nets between the front
seats hold maps, sunglasses and large water bottles. Drawers
beneath the front passenger seat provide hidden storage. Honda has
a small tray that folds up for a meal on wheels or for use as a
desk. Juice box holders are common.
</P>
<P>
   And there are many ways to customize the seating; this year,
Chevrolet introduced a layout with eight individual seats. Removing
seats has become a science. Some slide forward to increase cargo
room in the rear. Some roll out on tiny wheels. Honda's third seat
folds neatly into the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Two contributors to this page _ who both have full schedules of
suburban child-shuttling _ recently tested five of the most popular
minivans and ranked them for their overall appeal. A few smaller
models were not included, like the Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest
twins, the Isuzu Oasis (which is virtually identical to the
last-generation Honda Odyssey) and the Mazda MPV, which is being
replaced this summer with an all-new model.
</P>
<P>
   Both reviewers were emphatic about their top two picks. Although
both were previously impressed by Chrysler's vans, the Plymouth
moved down their lists.

BLEWSTER-GAFFES (Phoenix) - Slavery wasn't that bad; Native
Americans are stupid. Just another day at the office for Arizona
state Rep. Barbara Blewster. The Dewey Republican's latest gaffe
came in a conversation with Rep. Leah Landrum, one of two elected
African Americans in the Legislature. Landrum says she was offended
but not surprised. This, after all, is the woman who compared
homosexuality to cannibalism and told another colleague she doesn't
look Jewish because she doesn't have a hook-nose. Blewster has also
been peddling a book published in the 1880s on conservative
political philosophy. By CHRIS MOESER. Story will move in the ``A''

 &QL; 
SCHOOLS-JOCKS (Phoenix) - In the aftermath of the Littleton
shooting, we look into the culture on Phoenix area high-school
campuses to see if athletes are a breed apart, recipients of both
special treatment and resentment from their classmates. Do they

AUTO-REVIEW (Phoenix) - Overlooked and underappreciated, the
Mitsubishi Galant deserves a second chance, especially now that
sharp new styling and the addition of a decent V-6 engine brings it
up to speed with midsize favorites Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and
Ford Taurus. Upgrading the Galant is an important move for
Mitsubishi. The Japanese automaker, reeling from several years of
poor sales in the United States and on its home turf, needs a solid
mainstream hit. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``L''

STAGE SET FOR SENATE VOTE ON KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Foreign Relations Committee cleared the
way Friday for a showdown vote next week on a measure calling for
the commitment of NATO ground forces if necessary to help end the
Kosovo conflict as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A vote on the resolution calling on the president to use ``all
necessary force and other means'' sponsored by Sens. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Joseph Biden, D-Del., was scheduled for a vote on the
Senate floor late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., served notice that they would
move to table the measure for different reasons to head off a final
vote. Such a vote would put the Senate on record as either opposing
or supporting a ground invasion of Yugoslav territory.
</P>
<P>
   If their motion to table passes, it would effectively kill any
further consideration of the measure for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Lott opposes the McCain-Biden resolution because he believes it
would give the president too much of a free hand in deciding how to
use U.S. forces without consulting with Congress. Lott favors a
bill passed by the House earlier this week that would withhold
funding for a commitment of ground troops unless specifically
authorized by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lott had been trying to work out a compromise with Daschle that
would allow the House bill, and possibly one other measure, to be
brought up for a vote as alternatives to McCain-Biden. But
Republican aides said they doubted that any alternative would be
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the feeling is, from both leaders, that the less
debate we have on this right now the better,'' said one GOP aide.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, meanwhile, told reporters that he supports the
McCain-Biden bill, but he believes it would be inappropriate to
debate whether to commit ground troops ``at this time'' because
President Clinton has ``admonished us to give the...(NATO) air
mission time to function.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, Daschle noted, has already spoken once on the allied
air campaign against the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, voting in favor of continuing the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an overwhelming sentiment that this is not the
time for the Senate to express itself in greater detail than what
we've already done,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why entertain the issue if it's not the reality, if it's
actually not contemplated by our military and NATO allies?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Relations Committee voted 14-4 in favor of sending
the resolution to the floor, but it did not recommend whether
senators should pass or kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said as the panel began
debate on the measure that he believes the McCain-Biden measure
``puts the cart before the horse'' because it calls for the use of
ground troops before Congress is asked by the president to
authorize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate over this resolution is not about our policy in
Serbia. It is about proper constitutional order in time of war,''
Helms said. ``It is the president's responsibility, which he must
not be allowed to avoid, to seek authorization from Congress for
whatever military action he wishes to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden and McCain, however, insisted that their measure would
``strengthen the president's hand and NATO's hand'' in trying to
force Milosevic to end his brutal offensive aimed at ridding Kosovo
of its ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel was required under the terms of the 1973 War
Powers Act to consider the McCain-Biden resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The House was forced to vote on a similar measure last week
under the terms of the Vietnam-era act, which calls for the
president and Congress to agree when committing U.S. forces to
combat operations for more than 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law was enacted, however, most presidents have chosen
to ignore it, taking the view that as commander-in-chief they have
the right to act unilaterally when committing U.S. forces to action
short of a major war effort.
</P>
<P>
   But that position was challenged Friday by a group of 17 House
members led by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., who filed a lawsuit in
U.S. District Court in Washington asserting that the NATO campaign
against Yugoslavia violates the War Powers Act because it is likely
to continue well beyond 60 days. The allied bombing began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Administration officials state that it is likely that the
current hostilities will be protracted,'' the lawmakers said in
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The House members are asking the court to force Clinton to
either withdraw U.S. forces from the NATO operation or seek a
declaration of war from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, in an effort to invoke the terms of the War Powers
Act, introduced separate pieces of legislation several weeks ago
that would officially declare war against Yugoslavia and withdraw
U.S. forces from the Balkans conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures were rejected overwhelmingly by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's lawsuit drew support from two Democrats as well 14
other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his office, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
called Clinton's commitment of U.S. forces to the Balkans without
the explicit consent of Congress a ``reckless action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This president has violated the law and must be taken to
task,'' said Paul. ``It is a shame that Congress has not done more
to stop the president from this destructive course.''

FROM SKEPTIC TO ADMIRER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LEONARD M. APCAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had not cared much for minivans, preferring the handling of
even a station wagon over these boxes on wheels. Then I took a
family trip in a Plymouth Grand Voyager, hauled home a Christmas
tree on the roof of a Toyota Sienna and took some Cub Scouts
camping in a Ford Windstar.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have to concede that there is no better way for adults or
children to travel long-distance. As I contemplate making a
cross-country trip with my two children, my wife has suggested I
get a mental checkup. I suggest we get a minivan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. HONDA ODYSSEY. After years in the back of the pack, Honda has
sprinted to the pole position with a wider, longer, superbly built
van that has surprisingly good handling. The new Odyssey maneuvers
and corners as well as some good sedans, and it has the most
horsepower in this group.
</P>
<P>
   The top-line EX has two power sliding doors. The third-row seats
disappear into the floor, a smart idea borrowed from station
wagons. With those seats up, there is a deep well that keeps gear
from shifting.
</P>
<P>
   But good luck finding an Odyssey, and forget about getting a
discount; with supplies tight, dealers expect full price. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. FORD WINDSTAR. Safety counts, and among minivans, only the
Windstar and Odyssey receive the government's top five-star
crash-protection rating. The Windstar also has optional side air
bags and a sensor that signals when the van is about to back into
something. But even with better rear visibility, there are blind
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Ford now offers power sliding doors on both sides and two V6
engines. While handling and acceleration are good, the bigger
engine is the most noisy in this group. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER. Except on fancy models,
DaimlerChrysler makes buyers pay extra for features that most vans
have as standard equipment: map pockets, storage bins, adjustable
headrests and other comforts. Handling is acceptable, but no longer
better than Honda's or Ford's. The brakes felt spongy and stops
seemed slow.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the van was a comfortable hauler for a weekend trip to
Vermont. An overhead console included a trip computer _ something
some others did not have. The sliding-door tracks were neatly
disguised. But the 3.3-liter V6 had the fewest horses and was
sluggish on highway merges. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. CHEVROLET VENTURE. The LS test model was a competent people
mover in every way, and in fact just missed third place. Side air
bags are standard, and it can be ordered with seats for eight. But
the middle three seats did not have armrests and passage to the
two-part rear bench was very tight.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy's automated door has safeguards to prevent children from
opening it accidentally but it seemed needlessly complicated. In
fact, the door often closed halfway and then bounced back.
Acceleration and cornering were good, and the sport suspension
improves the handling while firming the ride. In contrast with the
others', the Chevy's brakes chattered on hard stops. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. TOYOTA SIENNA. Here is evidence of how fast the minivan
market moves. The Sienna was new for 1998, but the competition has
already blown by it with more space and better rear access. There
are other signs that the Sienna is not up to date: The third seat
is cramped, the middle seats cannot be removed and there is no
raised ``theater seating'' like the other vans'. But typical of
Toyota, the Sienna is solid and well-built.

ENVIRONMENTALIST ACTIVISTS ACCUSE BUSH OF TAKING INDUSTRIAL
`PAYOFF' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Environmental activists Friday accused Gov.
George W. Bush of taking a $169,400 political ``payoff'' for his
presidential campaign from air-polluting industries that have bills
pending before the current Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks like this was a business transaction
between the governor's office and industry,'' said Peter Altman,
director of the Sustainable Energy &AMP; Economic Development
Coalition. ``You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor is not
influenced by campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas know Governor Bush bases his decisions on
what is right for Texas, and he is the first governor who has held
grandfathered companies' feet to the fire and insisted that they
voluntarily reduce emissions,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is pushing legislation that would allow companies with
older plants to voluntarily come into compliance with the 1971
Clean Air Act. The environmentalists want to close a
``grandfather'' loophole and force the companies to abide by the
law.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of environmental groups has argued that companies
that want to keep the loophole have given state elected officials
more than $4.6 million in campaign contributions in the past six
years.
</P>
<P>
   The groups Friday said Bush got $169,400 from polluters in the
first 28 days of his presidential fund-raising, plus $138,900 from
lawyers with Vinson &AMP; Elkins. The law firm's clients include
Aluminum Co. of America, whose Rockdale, Texas, plant is the
grandfathered site with the state's top air emissions.
</P>
<P>
   While state officials cannot take political contributions while
the Legislature is in regular session, Bush can accept such funds
because he is raising money to run for a federal office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans want the higher standard,'' said Robin Schneider of
Public Research Works. ``When the Legislature is in session,
contributions are barred. But because he is running for federal
office, he can take the payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, who conducted the campaign contribution study, said
contributions were identified as coming from industry political
action committees, executives, members of their boards of directors
and their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists said Bush should return the campaign money
to the grandfathered industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush should give back this dirty money and close this
loophole,'' said Scott Royder, director of Texas Public Employees
for Environmental Responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation that Bush supports would give plants built
before the Clean Air Act took effect until Sept. 1, 2001, to
volunteer for a program to upgrade their equipment to technological
standards no older than 10 years. One study found that plants
grandfathered in 1971 produce about 36 percent of Texas' industrial
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Four environmentalists were arrested at the Governor's Mansion
last week while protesting Bush's stand on this issue.

BAFFERT SEEKING DERBY THREE-PEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ D. Wayne Lukas took a turn in the role,
peaking when he won back-to-back Kentucky Derbies. Before that,
Nick Zito played the part, winning two Derbies in four years. But
the star of this production, Saturday's 125th Run for the Roses at
Churchill Downs, is Bob Baffert, who is trying to become the first
to train three consecutive winners of America's greatest race.
</P>
<P>
   Five men have captured two in a row: Herbert Thompson (Burgoo
King, 1932, and Brokers Tip, '33); Ben Jones (Citation, '48, and
Ponder, '49); Jimmy Jones (Iron Leige, '57, and Tim Tam, '58);
Lucien Lauren (Riva Ridge, '72, and Secretariat, '73), and Lukas
(Thunder Gulch, '95, and Grindstone, '96).
</P>
<P>
   Baffert won the Rose Run with Silver Charm in '97 and Real Quiet
in '98, and, if not for the nose of Grindstone, who nipped his
Cavonnier at the wire, he already would have accomplished a
threepeat.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight shines brightly on Baffert because he is
charismatic, witty, and personable, far more so than Lukas or Zito
(who scored with Strike the Gold in 1991, and Go for Gin in '94).
He takes his position as ambassador of racing very seriously. But
the glare of publicity can be hot, and it has now become generally
known that Baffert isn't always Mr. Nice Guy, and can be quite
testy at times.
</P>
<P>
   The most public incident occurred when Baffert got into a public
shoving match with Scotty McClelland, agent for Chris McCarron, at
Clocker's Corner at Santa Anita. McClelland felt McCarron had been
promised the mount on General Challenge in the Santa Anita Derby
April 3, after regular rider Gary Stevens was committed to ride
Real Quiet in the Oaklawn Handicap the same day. (General Challenge
would go on to win the race.) However, Baffert scratched Real Quiet
from the Oaklawn race because he did not like the weight
assignments, and put Stevens back on General Challenge. When
McClelland found out, tempers flared.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert may not be a hero on the backstretch, but there is no
question he is loved by the public, and if any of his three
entrants, General Challenge, Excellent Meeting, and Prime Timber
tally Saturday, he will go through the top of the charts. However,
Baffert claims he is not worried about what course history may take
_ in fact, he says he's not worried at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in position to win another one,'' said Baffert, 46, a
native of Nogales, Ariz., who began as a quarterhorse trainer.
``That's my job, to get 'em in position. I don't really think about
what will happen in the race. I just think about getting them
there. I don't get too excited, because a lot of things can go
wrong. I never think about history. I never thought I'd get this
far. I never set goals. I'm just here day by day. You've got to
keep the excitement down.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Silver Fox,'' Baffert will send out a powerful
trio in search of the victory that will give him his own page in
the record book. He scratched the outstanding filly Excellent
Meeting from Friday's Oaks, as expected, and she will race as an
entry with General Challenge. The duo, owned by the Golden Eagle
Farm of John and Betty Mabee, noted California breeders, share the
same sire, General Meeting, a son of Seattle Slew. Excellent
Meeting will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux, while General Challenge
will be handled by Gary Stevens, and the entry has been established
as the 3-1 favorite. Prime Timber, a son of Sultry Song, is owned
by Aaron and Marie Jones, owners of a sawmill in Oregon. He will be
partnered by David Flores and is the 7-2 second choice.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who is on the verge of becoming Mr. Derby, has made a
serious study of the race that has made him famous. ``Every time I
come here, I learn a little bit more about the race,'' he said.
``At Churchill, it's not so much getting used to the surface as
getting used to the turns. They are a little bit tighter than the
turns at Santa Anita. General Challenge goes around these turns
like a rat in a barrel, and Prime Timber has been really reaching
out. They've looked great. That's what Derby horses are supposed to
look like, at least the ones I train. When you watch them work,
that separates the men from the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Timber is coming up to a huge race. He's a grinder, he
doesn't give up. General Challenge is the most talented of the
group, but he has to have things his own way. He's a big goof, an
immature horse. He has to get clear and into the right spot. His
stride is so long, it's unbelievable. He takes one stride to the
average horse's two. It's a giant advantage. We need General
Challenge to get away clean, and get into a nice fluid stride.
Excellent Meeting could win the Derby if she gets the trip, but
she's got to get by Prime Timber and General Challenge. If she
wasn't up to the task, I wouldn't run her.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert had clear sailing in 1997 and '98, and the Derby waters
have been calm this year, too. ``I've been so lucky,'' he added.
``The last three years that I've come here, everything has gone so
smoothly with my Derby horses. It's a pressure situation and the
pressure builds up. By the day of the race, I don't really want to
talk to anybody. I get a game face on. But you have to keep
yourself calm at all times. I should probably start drinking, but I
don't drink, so it's a little bit tougher on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of fate. If it's meant to be, it's meant to
be. But it helps to have your horses ready. Then it could really be
meant to be.''

CHAGRINED ROWLAND `GUY WHO LOST THE PATRIOTS' AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Just hours after he used space-age bravado to
declare that ``failure is not an option,'' Governor John G.
Rowland, father of this city's soured stadium deal, absorbed his
administration's biggest political defeat Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians had clambered further onto a political limb than
Rowland had in offering Patriots owner Robert Kraft the nation's
most generous, taxpayer-subsidized playground.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rowland who negotiated the deal in secret with Kraft. It
was Rowland who sold it to the state Legislature. And it was
Rowland who signed the agreement in a celebratory ceremony that he
hoped would signal Connecticut's _ and his _ arrival in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to known as the guy who lost the Patriots,'' the
42-year-old governor said as the gold-plated stadium deal began to
unravel.
</P>
<P>
   But now, almost certainly, he will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain of the ship is the one who is noticed when the
ship comes in,'' said Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin B.
Sullivan, a West Hartford Democrat. ``Unfortunately, he also gets
noticed when the ship sinks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He himself said his political future rests on this outcome,''
said State Representative Michael P. Lawlor, an East Haven
Democrat. ``It has to be a major political blow.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been few issues that Rowland, the nation's youngest
governor, has pursued with such passion _ a risk, he said, for
which he has no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get past the shoelace mentality,'' Rowland said in
an interview in his office last week before the stadium deal
collapsed. ``Everybody's looking down at their shoelaces, saying no
one's going to want to come to Connecticut. No one's going to come
to UConn basketball. We can never get an NFL stadium here. We're
not a big enough state. I'm trying to get people to have a little
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Connecticut's high-stakes roller-coaster ride with
Kraft has ended in defeat and despair, the political fallout is
certain to represent the severest test yet of Rowland's well-earned
reputation as his state's most agile politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hurt the state's reputation nationally,'' said Edward L.
Marcus, the state's Democratic state chairman. ``He's spent a lot
of money. This kind of takes the wind out of Rowland's sails. He
was all pumped up acting like he was the king of the world. He
comes out of this looking extremely foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the framed newspaper story headlined ``Touchdown!'' that
hangs in Rowland's outer office now seems a cruel -- and certainly
premature -- bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   The gregarious Rowland, who was voting for Ronald Reagan's MX
missiles at an age when most politicians run for the school board,
insisted he never wanted to be known simply as the man who brought
pro football to the banks of the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd rather concentrate on trimming taxes, creating
jobs, fighting crime, and _ blessed by the most bouyant economy
since World War II _ helping Connecticut forget the fiscal storms
that ravaged the Constitution State in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's supporters say he will ultimately emerge bruised, but
not broken, by his quixotic quest for New England's Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   He is, after all, a politician's son from a blue-collar city
whose defining moment came not when he became Connecticut's first
GOP governor in 20 years in 1995, but when he conceded defeat in
his first bid for the governor's office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, had Rowland not been vanquished in 1990 by
Republican-turned-Independent Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the imperious
governor whose successful support for a state income tax touched
off a political uproar, his political fortunes _ still bright by
all measures _ would certainly have been different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luck is a word that ought to be attached to him,'' said Thomas
J. D'Amore Jr., Weicker's former chief of staff and a former state
Republican chairman. ``Rowland was very lucky to lose in 1990. The
reason he's successful is because of the state income tax, which he
stood against.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether underpinned by luck, timing, fate or diligence, John
Grosvenor Rowland's easy-going style and elastic political
philosophy has propelled him far beyond his own expectations and
past opponents who have underestimated him at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm an old Waspy, trust-fund Republican,'' said
Rowland, seated in a wing-back chair in his second-floor office.
``I'm more of an Irish-Catholic guy, who grew up in the city _ a
three-decker _ the oldest of five kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland was reared in Waterbury, a working-class city 35 miles
west of Hartford known in Rowland's youth for its brass products
and bare-knuckle politics, where both his father and grandfather
served as city comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waterbury is one of the toughest political places that you can
find,'' said John F. Droney Jr., a former Democratic state
chairman. ``If you can make it in Waterbury, you can make it
anywhere.'' A Republican in a Democratic city, Rowland made it.
</P>
<P>
   After spending a year in his family's insurance business, he
spent $1,300 in 1980 to win a seat in the state House of
Representatives, the first GOP lawmaker from that district in 100
years. Mustached and heavier-set in those days, the backslapping
Rowland quickly moved into the House GOP leadership, railing
against high taxes and trumpeting programs to prop up Connecticut's
sagging cities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when he was 27, Rowland became the youngest member of
the US House of Representatives, where he won a seat on the Armed
Services Committee, supported Reagan's military buildup, and earned
a reputation as the state's staunchest conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the other Republicans and Democrats in the
Connecticut delegation I was a stark raving lunatic conservative,''
Rowland said. ``In my own caucus _ I came in with (GOP Texas
conservatives) Tom DeLay and Dick Armey _ they thought I was a
communist. They thought I was the biggest liberal in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland chafed against the conventions of Washington, a city he
called full of self-important automatons, where seniority, not
smarts, counts. ``I hated it,'' he said. ``It was not real. Not
even close to being real. Self-important as can be. It's
Disneyworld. It's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   When he quit in 1990 to run unsuccessfully for governor, he
tacked to the ideological center, softening his views and acquiring
a reputation as a chameleon _ a criticism that rankles him still.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland's blend of fiscal conservatism, social moderation
and his open willingness to compromise with the
Democratic-controlled legislature has been enormously popular.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps a plaque on his desk that says it's amazing how much
you can accomplish if you're willing to share the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're better making a bad decision and doing something than
making no decision at all,'' Rowland said. ``You have to create
your own opportunities. You've got to take risks and have guts.
Politicians who have luck are politicians who take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   And in defeat, even Rowland critics are willing to give him
credit for trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ought to be congratulated for making the effort,'' D'Amore,
the former GOP party chairman said. ``There was a lack of
experience, of being too quick to the altar. He should have paid
more attention to details _ everything from the siting to the
finances. But, on balance, it was a good thing to try.''

PANAMANIANS GIRD FOR TURNOVER OF CANAL ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY _ There is more than the usual end-of-school-year
spring fever at Balboa High School. There is also a deep sadness.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, this stately school with its red Spanish-tile roof
will graduate its last class of seniors. By the end of May, it will
say goodbye to the rest of its students and staff and close its
doors forever. And by year's end the school, and the rest of the
American-controlled property in this Central American country, will
belong to Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of mixed emotions,'' said Thomas Price, a
Nebraska native who has been the school's principal for the last
four years. ``There's always some uncertainty at the end of a
school year, especially for seniors. But for the other students,
it'll be a whole new experience. No question.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is for Balboa's graduating seniors, the future for Panama
is both exciting and impossible to predict. Nearly a century after
Theodore Roosevelt carried his big stick into this isthmus nation
to create one of the world's engineering marvels, Panama is
preparing itself for life without los Americanos.
</P>
<P>
   But as the clock ticks toward noon on Dec. 31, when the last
step in the transfer of the canal and its surrounding 100,000 acres
of property will be completed, no one _ Panamanian or American _
knows what to expect next. The predictions run the gamut, from US
officials who warn that the canal's operation will be riddled with
corruption to Panamanians who smugly bet that they will run the
waterway more efficiently than the US government ever has in the
years since it opened in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty is the question of who Panama's next
president will be. More than a million voters are expected to vote
Sunday in a race that looks too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates are Martin Torrijos, the 35-year-old
son of the late general, Omar Torrijos, who in the late 1970s
negotiated with US President Jimmy Carter for the canal's transfer
to Panama; and Mireya Moscoso, the widow of former President
Arnulfo Arias Madrid, whose term was cut short when he was
overthrown by General Torrijos in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and voters alike have criticized both candidates for
not offering many new ideas for relying more on the ghosts and
legends of their famous kin as they campaigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am trying to make a better life for my family and they
keep reminding me of their family,'' said Octavio Torres, 27, who
is unemployed and lives in the rough tenement slums of Santa Cruz
in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the presidency will have the ceremonial honor of
presiding over the last step in the Canal Zone handover, something
nationalist factions have dreamed about for decades. But Panama's
next leader will face several daunting tasks, chief among them
being managing independence for a country that has never known life
without the presence of an outside force _ first Spain in colonial
times, then Colombia, and until the end of this year, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge will be absorbing the economic and
psychological blow of the American pullout. The US military, which
has operated seven bases and dozens of schools, airports and
hospitals, have poured more than $300 million a year into the local
economy and provided more than 16,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the independence movements that eventually led to the
canal transfer, the American presence has also offered residents
and foreign investors alike an unspoken guarantee of protection
against rampant crime, invasions and a chaotic government.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable example of that came during seven days in
December 1989 when US forces invaded Panama and ousted General
Manuel Noriega, who refused to leave office after his term ended.
He is now serving a prison sentence for drug conspiracy in Florida.
After that episode, the country dissolved its military and has been
reforming its police and judicial systems.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern as to how quickly Panama will be able to
make new use the rich land and 5,000 structures being left behind
by the United States. Already, there is criticism that development
plans for the land, one-tenth of the country's total area, are
driven more by profit motives than by any effort to address
pressing social needs, such as the 40 percent poverty rate.
</P>
<P>
   At the offices of the Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority, the
agency responsible for developing the transferred areas, director
Nicolas Ardito Barletta uses a computer presentation to offer his
vision of a post-US Canal Zone that offers everything from cargo
loading to day spas. At both ends, new ports, developed by Asian
firms, will welcome cruise and cargo ships. There will be shopping
areas to greet passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Areas along the canal that were once military barrracks and
officers' homes will be turned into country club resorts. A ``City
of Knowledge,'' complete with American and Panamanian university
campuses and research-based companies, will become an academic
jewel, planners say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often hear comparisons to Singapore, and we agree,'' Ardito
said, referring to the potential of the canal and the surrounding
lands, whose value has been put at $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for the vision, officials have attracted investors
primarily from Asia, Europe and the United States, which is still
the canal's biggest customer.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has already taken virtual control of the canal itself.
Ninety percent of the jobs are now held by locals, and a Panamanian
has directed the canal's governing agency since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At Balboa High School, many of the 1,100 students are wondering
what life will be like in their new homes. Most will leave with
their families and live in the US for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see if I like living in the US or if I decide to
come back here to Panama,'' said Steve Bowman, 17, a senior who
will study at the University of Virginia next fall. ``We've had
very different lives down here. Maybe even sheltered. A lot of us
see this as home, and the US as a foreign country.''

   KOSOVO-JACKSON (Belgrade) _ The three captive American
servicemen held by Yugoslavia talked on Friday with Jesse Jackson
and said that they are being kept in separate cells, have no
contact with each other or with other prisoners in the same
facility, were able to take a walk outside their cells only twice
during their monthlong imprisonment, but are generally well-fed and
have no medical problems. By Susan Sachs.

<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Washington) _ An account of the UPI's
interview with President Slobodan Milosevic, in which he charges
that the air war is the United States' attempt to achieve two
goals: to prove its leadership in Europe as well as re-establish
its leadership in NATO. ``NATO believes it can pick on a small
nation and force us to surrender our independence,'' Milosevic
says. ``And that is where NATO miscalculated. You are not willing
to sacrifice lives to achieve our surrender. But we are willing to
die to defend our rights as an independent sovereign nation.'' By
Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade) _ The Yugoslav capital cleans up
after the heaviest night of bombing yet. Army headquarters and the
Interior Ministry were hit. A civilian area of city was
accidentally hit, but no one was killed. By Steven Erlanger.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Belgrade) _ Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian
envoy, is to meet Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, today
and perhaps Ibrahim Rugova, an ethnic-Albanian leader. Meanwhile
the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry says that Belgrade could accept an
international force for Kosovo if the U.N. Security Council
authorizes it _ but only an unarmed force. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Washington) _ Military action as reported from
Washington and NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-APACHE (Washington) _ One night, maybe soon, the first
American Apache helicopters are supposed to take off from a
makeshift base in Albania, pause to refuel in the rugged northern
Albanian hills and then, with rockets raining ahead of them, fly
into Kosovo to try to do what NATO's high-flying jets have not:
eviscerate Yugoslavia's armored forces. Such attacks carry enormous
risk, though. And for that reason President Clinton still has not
approved their use in combat in the Balkans. By Steven Lee Myers.

CLEAR WEATHER BRINGS UPTICK IN NATO BOMBING PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ Aided by the clearest skies since it began attacking
Yugoslavia six weeks ago, NATO said Friday it had conducted its
heaviest night of bombing, targeting army headquarters, the Defense
Ministry and an opulent suburban home of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Brigadier General Giuseppe Marani, NATO's military spokesman,
said the forecast is for good weather the next few days and that
the number of attacks would be stepped up. Bad weather over much of
the last six weeks had hampered the laser systems used by most NATO
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to their trauma, Belgrade residents were shaken by a
moderate earthquake shortly after the bombing runs ended early
Friday. No one was injured in the earthquake, but a policeman was
reported killed when NATO bombs struck the Interior Ministry, which
controls the paramilitary police accused of atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Shea, NATO's chief spokesman, said that NATO pilots had
flown more than 600 sorties in a 24-hour period ending early
Friday, the most yet in Operation Allied Force. That is about
double the average number of daily sorties. Because of the clear
skies, about half of those missions actually fired missiles or
dropped bombs, Shea said. In the past, bad weather has forced many
fighters to return to base without dropping their payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bringing the air campaign home to where it hurts
most,'' said Shea. ``We are benefitting from much improved
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea acknowledged that one NATO missile ``went astray and landed
on some houses.'' Belgrade authorities said four people were
injured and a family narrowly escaped with their lives when they
jumped from their home as it collapsed after being hit by the stray
missile.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO vowed to intensify its air war, there was a flurry of
diplomatic activity in Belgrade, as diplomats tried to find a
negotiated end to the bombing and the expulsion of ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin met with Milosevic in
Belgrade, and Yugoslav officials repeated their offer to allow an
unarmed United Nations-backed force into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea dismissed the offer, saying, ``Those proposals do not come
close to meeting the demands of the international community. They
are not worthy of serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
the increased bombing was part of the ``domination phase'' in which
NATO fighters focus on hitting the Yugoslav forces on the ground
that have been forcibly expelling ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in
what is the worst refugee crisis in Europe since the end of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Among the targets hit Thursday night and early Friday were a
metals plant, a border post, tanks, an oil refinery, surface-to-air
missile sites, the main TV transmitter in Belgrade, the army
headquarters, police stations, and ammunition dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Shea called the target list ``the largest and the most diverse''
of the air campaign so far.
</P>
<P>
   Marani said all of the NATO jets returned safely to base, but
they faced at least 13 missiles fired at them from the ground. He
said they were not encountered by any Yugoslav warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the battle back to the heart of Belgrade,'' said
Marani.
</P>
<P>
   The TV tower, an imposing 650-foot concrete tower on Mount Avila
just outside Belgrade, was a symbol of Serbian pride when it was
built in the 1960s. Its destruction knocked state TV off the air
for a few hours, as have previous attacks on transmitters, but the
station NATO accuses of being Milosevic's propaganda machine has
proved resilient.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were not limited to Belgrade. Marani said the mobile
army units on the ground in Kosovo that are blamed by refugees for
driving hundreds and thousands of people from their homes and
commiting atrocities such as summary executions and rape of
civilians were hit Thursday harder than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over Kosovo, they have been hit,'' he said. ``They have
been hit where they have been found.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Kosovo Albanian leaders met here Friday with NATO general
secretary Javier Solana to express their appreciation to NATO, but
also to ask the alliance to step up its efforts to force Milosevic
to back down. The Albanians, led by Blerim Shala, the newspaper
editor who was part of the Kosovar delegation at the failed peace
talks in France, were reluctant to criticize NATO's refusal to send
in ground troops to flush out Serb troops and rescue an estimated
700,000 refugees stuck inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vjosa Dobruna, director for the Center of Protection of
Women and Children in Pristina, the Kosovar capital, said that
those stuck inside Kosovo have no access to food or medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thought NATO needed to do more to help the
refugees, on whose behalf the air war is being waged, Dobruna said
only, ``I wish they would do it very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea disputed reports that suggested NATO's bombs are creating
environmental hazards to civilians, and that the Yugoslav army is
hanging tough. He said stories suggesting longterm environmental
damage in Serbia are exaggerated, and that desertion and low morale
is rampant in the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   Shea also claimed that NATO's efforts to avoid hitting civilian
targets was working, despite the missile that hit the residential
area in Belgrade, and one that went astray Wednesday night and
destroyed a home in a suburb of the Bulgarian capital Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a fraction of one percent,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   But UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson also
criticized NATO, saying its campaign was killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the former president of Ireland, said, ``Large numbers
of civilians have been incontestably killed, civilian installations
targeted on the basis that they are or could be of military
application, and NATO remains the sole judge of what is or is not
acceptable to bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities say more than 500 civilians have been
killed by NATO, while NATO officials insist the number of
accidental deaths caused by errant bombs is closer to 100.

TECHNO CHIEF ZUCCHINI TO QUITE FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fleet Financial Group confirmed Friday that its chief
technology executive will retire at the end of this year, the
latest top Boston banker to leave in the wake of the company's
planned merger with BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Zucchini, a 52-year-old Fleet vice chairman who joined
the company in 1987, had overseen the meshing of computer systems
in a number of Fleet's past bank mergers _ not always with flying
colors.
</P>
<P>
   But Zucchini's departure was a surprise given that he had been
slated to share responsibility for the newly merged company's
computer systems with his counterpart at BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That pairing, which was unique in Fleet's selection of top
executives _ in all cases, so far, one executive from either bank
was named _ may have helped precipitate his departure, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zucchini's retirement, first reported by the Providence Journal,
is the second departure of a Fleet executive this week. John
Hamill, the president of Fleet Bank of Massachusetts and a
prominent face in Boston's business community, also said he would
step down at the end of the year. At BankBoston, executive vice
president Ira Jackson, the man credited with reshaping the
company's image after it was tarnished by scandal in the mid-1980s,
announced his retirement last week.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company is expected to announce more top management
changes, possibly next week, as it carries out the $15 billion
merger announced on March 14. The banks are still awaiting approval
for the combination from federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's spokesman, James Mahoney, said Zucchini is selling his
Rhode Island horse farm in order to move to California with his
family to pursue that interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger created an opportune time for Mike to make his
move,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no secret in the banking community that Zucchini's
star had dimmed _ and that the reputation of BankBoston Corp.'s top
computer executive, Joseph Smialowski, was still rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Zucchini had been at Fleet a long time, and they had had
some operating snafus in their history,'' said Nancy Bush, a senior
vice president of Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. in New Jersey. ``Is one event
connected with the other? I can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucchini was loyally supported by chief executive Terrence
Murray during his career.
</P>
<P>
   Zucchini, who was responsible for integrating Fleet's and
Shawmut National Corp.'s computers, took the heat for a check-
processing problem in Connecticut, which delayed the Shawmut
conversion by a few months.
</P>
<P>
   He also was the Fleet executive responsible for a short time in
the early 1990s for the company's embattled operations in the
south, Fleet Mortgage in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Zucchini's mixed reputation is in contrast to that of
Smialowski, whom BankBoston hired last November from a job as chief
technology officer for Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Smialowski ``is very, very well regarded,'' and BankBoston
regarded his hiring ``as something of a coup,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's said that Zucchini would stay on long enough to help
plan the integration of the two banks' computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be around for the critical decisions about what systems
they'll choose,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker
Anthony Inc.

HARVARD PILGRIM POSTS HUGE LOSS; 8 PERCENT RATE HIKE PLANNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, New England's largest
health maintenance organization, Friday posted its biggest annual
losses ever after having vastly underestimated their medical
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the growing ranks of the nation's financially ailing
HMOs, Harvard Pilgrim said it lost $94 million from operations in
1998 on revenue of $2.67 billion. When $40 million in investment
income is added, the HMO's net loss shrinks to $54 million.
</P>
<P>
   To recover, Harvard Pilgrim, which insures 1.3 million patients,
said it will aggressively raise premiums an average of 8 percent,
with some customers seeing double-digit hikes this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to keep premium rates as close to our costs as
possible,'' said Allan Greenberg, chief executive of Harvard
Pilgrim in Brookline. ``To the extent we can control costs,
premiums won't skyrocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the red ink, Harvard Pilgrim late last year laid
off 100 employees, including Dr. Patrick Mattingly, the No. 2
executive at the HMO. This year, Harvard Pilgrim, which employs
4,200 full-time workers, instituted a hiring freeze in selective
departments and did away with bonuses. In addition, the pay of the
company's top two dozen executives has been frozen for 1999.
Greenberg said no further layoffs are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Other HMOs in Massachusetts have reported losses for 1998,
including Tufts Health Plan in Waltham and Fallon Community Health
Plan in Worcester. Only Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts
and Neighborhood Health Plan, which is owned by Harvard Pilgrim,
made money last year. Tufts lost $12.8 million last year, while
Fallon lost $21 million, in one year wiping out one-third of its
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the past two years have been tough on the managed
care industry. Buffetted by ballooning prescription drug costs and
other expenses, dozens of large insurers have plunged into the red.
Kaiser Permanente in California last year lost $288 million on
revenues of $15.5 billion. Oxford Health Plans in Connecticut lost
$276 million on revenue of $4.7 billion in 1998. Smaller health
plans have been battered, with some going out of business
altogether, including Health Insurance Plan of New Jersey, whose
200,000 patients were stranded in March when the company was forced
to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the managed care market is particularly
brutal, as insurers continue to artificially suppress premiums to
maintain market share or gain new customers. While consumers have
benefitted from the stable premiums, insurers are paying the price
with their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most intensely competitive climates in the
United States,'' said Jack Reichman, a director of Standard &AMP; Poors
Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: raise premiums, say industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty percent of the industry is losing money because the
industry hasn't charged corporate America enough for what their
employees consume,'' said Kenneth Abramowitz, health care analyst
with Sanford Bernstein in New York. ``HMOs have to raise their
rates 10 percent a year for the next three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's premium increases for 1998 were relatively
modest, even though its expenses swelled, leading to the large
loss. The HMO, for example, spent $300 million last year on
prescription drugs alone, a 17 percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors for the loss include spending to address the
so-called Y2K problem in which computers cannot recognize the year
2000. It also incurred ``large losses'' in its Medicare business,
though Greenberg declined to specify an amount.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Harvard Pilgrim made a modest net income of $5.4
million on $2.3 billion in revenues, down from $19.3 million in net
income on $2.1 billion in revenues in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's declining fortunes are reflected in its
Standard &AMP; Poors' bond ratings, which have slid from A in 1997 to
BBB this year, with a ``negative'' outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said he expected Harvard Pilgrim to break even this
year, but declined to discuss more specific projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test for them is how well they can implement a
turnaround plan,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's Reichman.

 &HT;    CheckFree glitch mostly fixed
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CheckFree said Friday it has largely fixed a glitch in
a new software system that disabled electronic banking accounts for
all week.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the system should work fine but 2 percent of
those trying to use it might still have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provides electronic banking services, said
the glitch affected a new program called Genesis. Genesis is used
by 21 banks nationwide, including SunTrust and FirstUnion.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers of these two banks in Atlanta reported problems
signing onto to their electronic banking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 500,000 electronic banking customers were affected by the
glitch nationwide, CheckFree said. There were no estimates on how
many customers were inconvenienced in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The glitch, which prevented customers from accessing their
electronic accounts, bedeviled CheckFree all week. It wasn't until
late Thursday that the company found the root of the problem and
began to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of everyone at CheckFree, I want to apologize for
the inconveniences consumers have experienced because of this
issue,'' Chief Operating Officer Pete Sinisgalli said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree Holdings Co. has some 2.8 million customers and helps
to provide electronic payment services at 350 institutions.

 &HT;    PreRunner stays with the pack
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Toyota is hardly a leader when it comes to building
and selling compact pickups, but the Tacoma PreRunner is proof that
the company is learning to play follow-the-leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Throw on some options to dress up the exterior and add comfort
to the interior, and the PreRunner can run with other
American-built pickups as long as the going doesn't get too rough.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota does get some things right. The test regular-cab
PreRunner had a high-quality ``imperial jade mica'' green paint job
that gleamed. The fit-and-finish both inside and out reflected the
build quality that goes into Toyota's cars, and there's nothing
cheesy about the cloth and plastic in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   But that should be expected, because the PreRunner doesn't come
cheap. The rear-wheel-drive test vehicle's base price of $14,768 is
about $10,000 below what you'd pay for a loaded version with
extended cab and four-wheel drive, but dressing it up with options
boosted the bottom line to $17,732.
</P>
<P>
   The powertrain, too, is solid, although hardly a powerhouse. The
standard engine is a 2.7-liter four-cylinder rated at 150
horsepower at 4,800 rpm and a maximum 177 pounds-feet of torque at
4,000 rpm. The engine is responsive, and the four-speed automatic
transmission _ no manual available _ handles the power nicely,
despite a tendency to kick down when all the driver really wants is
just a touch of acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The ride has been improved, but remains less than carlike. The
PreRunner isn't fond of uneven pavement, and rumble strips can be
felt as well as heard. The handling is good, as long as turns are
met with a little respect.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota wants the regular-cab, rear-drive PreRunner to be
mistaken for a four-wheel-drive model and pretty much succeeds on
that count. The PreRunner's 265/75R15 tires and sporty aluminum
wheels help make it about 70 inches tall, and it's got enough
ground clearance _ nearly a foot _ to make the step up a bit of a
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But while the PreRunner goes well, it lacks the standard
anti-lock brakes of many of its competitors, and two doors are all
you can get. Extra doors are coming, Toyota says, well aware that
more manufacturers and buyers are realizing that third and fourth
doors are a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   In short, don't expect too much of the PreRunner. It's clearly
well-built and has good ergonomics and decent seats, but it's not
the macho truck its option-aided looks suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Toyota PreRunner compact rear-drive pickup
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $17,732 (Includes discounts not always
available. Base price: $14,768)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: side-impact beams, dual air bags with
passenger-side switch
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine with 16 valves (150
horsepower), four-speed automatic overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Options on test vehicle: sport package with 265/75R15 tires and
aluminum wheels, chrome-plated rear bumper, cloth bucket seats,
sliding rear window, center console box, sun visor with mirror and
pocket, $1,670; package with air conditioner, stereo radio with
cassette player, carpeted floor mats, $1,405; package with tilt
wheel, cruise control, tachometer, digital clock, $690; bedliner,
$279; trailer hitch, $295

COST PRESSURES THREATEN TENNESSEE'S AMBITIOUS HEALTH INSURANCE
PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In one bold stroke, Tennessee converted its
Medicaid health benefits to managed care five years ago and used
the savings to cover hundreds of thousands of people who could not
afford health insurance of their own or were too sick to qualify.
With 3 million people enrolled, its program, called TennCare,
became the most ambitious and generous government health plan in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But with TennCare's costs rising and Tennessee facing a budget
deficit, the program is under fire and facing probable retrenchment
under pressure from Gov. Don Sundquist. And the people most at risk
are those who benefit most from the state's effort at providing
nearly universal health insurance: those with chronic or even
terminal diseases who have been rejected by private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   To arrest a projected 12 percent increase in TennCare spending
for the year beginning in July, Sundquist, a Republican elected to
a second four-year term in November, has proposed a moratorium on
new enrollments of the uninsurable for six months or a year while
the state explores cutting benefits, raising premiums and
tightening eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, TennCare Director Brian Lapps is suggesting that some
beneficiaries of the program are exploiting it. The poorest
recipients, Lapps said, could help pay for their care if they would
only curb their use of cell phones and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a spoiled population that wants everything for
nothing,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The program's advocates are stunned. ``Tennessee did something
ahead of the curve, and now it's back to the Okefenokee Swamp,''
said Dr. Stephen Raffanti, medical director of an outpatient AIDS
clinic at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center that opened its
doors when TennCare began and now has 1,500 patients.
</P>
<P>
   TennCare is free for most of its beneficiaries, who are poor
enough to qualify for Medicaid. The better-off beneficiaries pay
premiums, deductibles and fees based on their incomes. Applicants
with debilitating pre-existing conditions, like AIDS or multiple
sclerosis, qualify merely by presenting a letter from an insurance
company denying them coverage.
</P>
<P>
   TennCare's impact has been greatest for that last group, which
the program calls ``uninsurables,'' currently numbering 108,000 of
the 1.3 million enrolled in TennCare. But they are also by far the
most expensive group _ a single patient's medication can cost tens
of thousands of dollars a year _ and the cost of extending coverage
to this group is at the root of TennCare's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between rising prescription costs and growing numbers of
these sickest patients, TennCare has slashed its payments to
doctors and HMOs below what they need to break even, according to a
state-financed analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers, a consulting
firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One day in April, 52 of the uninsurable came to testify in the
small basement conference room of a state office building at a
hearing the state called on the proposal to stop enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a sticker proclaiming, ``We are not the problem,'' David
Tignor, 24, said he has hemophilia. Tignor is hobbled by braces for
ankles that internal bleeding has turned arthritic. He caught AIDS
and hepatitis C from a blood transfusion. The state and federal
government pay for his medicine, which costs more than $100,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my work cell phone,'' Tignor said, pulling one from
his jeans and thrusting it at Lapps, who presided but sat mute,
taking notes. Tignor says he uses it to call for help when he
falls. He said his employer pays for the phone. ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise McKown, 49, lugged herself up to the microphone on two
canes that she had decorated with bouquets of violets and daisies.
Ms. McKown has a degenerative brain disease that has slurred her
speech and made noodles of her legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day may come when I can no longer speak, write or type,''
she said. She admonished Lapps, ``This was most definitely not
caused by smoking or drinking.'' She added, ``I do not want your
pity, but I do wish that you understand my reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In his one response to his petitioners' comments, Lapps promised
that those who were already enrolled in TennCare would not be
disenrolled.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration allows states to devise variations of
the basic federally subsidized state Medicaid programs that for the
most part cover parents and their children who are on welfare and,
more recently, parents who are moving from welfare to work at low
wages.
</P>
<P>
   In developing Tennessee's variation in late 1993, Gov. Ned
McWerter, a Democrat, and his commissioner for finance and
administration then, David Manning, thought that by using managed
care and health maintenance organizations to cover the state's
800,000 Medicaid recipients, they could both tame the inflation
then raging in health care and generate savings to cover people who
were uninsured, including the uninsurable.

<P>
   To maneuver around a hostile physicians' lobby and a skeptical
Legislature, then out of session, McWerter and Manning opened the
program overnight, as the new year began in 1994. Health care
institutions and his own administration were ill-prepared, and
abuses, fraud and foul-ups ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `Who's on first? Where's second?,''' said Gordon
Bonnyman, director of the nonprofit Tennessee Justice Center, a
public policy advocacy group. An influential lawyer and lobbyist,
Bonnyman helped assure TennCare's start by trading his support for
the shift to HMOs for McWerter's promise to cover the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the chaos, McWerter, whose left office in January
1995 and was succeeded by Sundquist, had put the state on the road
to the universal care that President Clinton proposed then and that
Congress subsequently blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``TennCare showed that if there is a political will, it could be
done,'' Bonnyman said. ``Now that is being casually, cavalierly,
thoughtlessly tossed aside.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Tenncare is solidly entrenched. It covers 24
percent of the population. Its enrollment includes 768,000 Medicaid
recipients, whose coverage is not threatened, along with the
108,000 uninsurable and 411,000 of the previously uninsured, mostly
workers and their families who either are not offered insurance
through their jobs or cannot afford it if they are.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, TennCare is succeeding. A survey last year by
the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville found that 81 percent of the enrollees were
satisfied with TennCare in 1997 compared with 61 percent at the
outset in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollees using hospital emergency rooms, the survey found, had
fallen by half over the three years, suggesting that people are
getting treated before crises strike.
</P>
<P>
   TennCare's advocates say the program has also succeeded in
keeping many of the uninsured self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have patients at five and six years who are working,'' said
Raffanti of the Comprehensive Care Clinic, the one specializing in
AIDS. ``A lot of these patients I'm going to keep from going to
end-stage disease for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials and health care experts here trace TennCare's
current financial travails to two miscalculations early on. One,
they say, was the McWerter administration's high expectations for
the impact of managed care in reducing costs. Another was a
decision to limit coverage to 1.3 million enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   So appealing was the promise of coverage that the uninsured,
most of them healthy, rushed aboard. The limit was reached within
months, and in late 1994, the state stopped enrolling them, though
it later reopened coverage to uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   But under agreement with the federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which regulates Medicaid and Medicare, it continued
to enroll the uninsurable. And as their numbers grew, the state
lost more and more of the contribution to the cost of their care
that it had received from the largely healthy uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, we should open enrollment to the uninsured, not wait
for people to get sick,'' said John Ferguson, the commissioner for
finance and administration.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other issues, too, said Lapps, the TennCare
director.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his new terrain: For three years, until last October,
he was an uninsurable TennCare enrollee because of a condition he
declines to disclose, and is now covered by the state employee
health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lapps says he wants to preserve TennCare and that ``we are 60 to
65 percent of having it right.'' Problems he wants to tackle, he
said, include insurance companies suspected of dumping patients on
TennCare, signs of illegal enrollments, excessively generous
benefits and neglecting to verify enrollees' incomes.
</P>
<P>
   But TennCare enrollees are an issue, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of responsible poor out there,'' he said.
``But there's a portion who drive up to the doctor's in a BMW.'' He
said, ``The question has to be raised: What is their purchasing
priority?''
</P>
<P>
   Lapps has some support. The Tennessee Medical Association has
fought TennCare from the start, mostly because of cuts in
physicians' fees, which Lapps would partly restore. ``He's talking
the talk that we've been talking for five years,'' said Russ
Miller, the association's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The HCFA must approve the moratorium during which the governor
and Lapps would look into revising TennCare. Negotiations continue,
and federal officials in Washington declined to comment. But
Ferguson, the state commissioner for finance and administration,
said, ``The reading we're getting is, we could close enrollment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnyman said that would be the demise of TennCare as it has
been known. ``It's like the governor woke up and said, `Why are we
covering all these people when other states aren't?''' he said.
``It's a poignant testimony to our national incapacity to develop a
rational and humane health policy.''

LEWIS WIDOW WRITING HER OWN HISTORY OF REGGIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The judge in the Reggie Lewis case has twice issued
gag orders to those directly involved, but that didn't seem to
deter Donna Harris-Lewis. Reggie's widow was calling around,
getting puff pieces written about her over the past two weeks in
this paper and ``People'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Are we supposed to think it is just coincidence this all
happened within days of jury selection? Harris-Lewis is now selling
the story that the reason she decided to sue four doctors for
malpractice was triggered by a story in the Wall Street Journal
that tied Reggie's death to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis now has her own version of history. The first one
ever to publicly link Reggie Lewis to drugs was . . . Donna
Harris-Lewis. Shortly after Reggie was released from the hospital
days after he first collapsed, Harris-Lewis, on the Jimmy Myers
radio show on WEEI in Boston, revealed that the doctors on the
Dream Team questioned Reggie about drugs, and she didn't like that.
In response, she moved him out of New England Baptist Hospital to
Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gilbert Mudge was not part of the Dream Team. He was not
involved with Reggie until Harris-Lewis switched hospitals. When
Lewis died, and well over a year before the Wall Street Journal
story, this writer wrote about the possiblity of drugs being tied
to Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis says in the magazine article that Mudge claimed he
told Lewis that the only explanation for his fatal condition was
cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   Quote from Harris-Lewis: ``You talk about the shock of losing
your husband, I was even more shocked when he said that.'' How
could it be a shock when Reggie was being questioned about drug
use, in her presence, almost two years before by the Dream Team?
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis, even though she is asking for upward of $100
million in damages, says it's not about the money. This statement
has the same ring of truth in it as one from Roger Clemens: It
wasn't about money. Clemens wanted to be with a winner. His
ultimate goal would be to play in Houston, yet when he had a chance
to be traded to Houston, where he lived, he turned it down when the
Astros wouldn't pay him what he wanted. It's never about the money,
is it?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The next Fenway Park will retain some of the park's famous
touches, such as the Green Monster in left field and the Pesky Pole
on the right-field line. The team is finishing its financial plan
and hopes to reveal its project intentions sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who wonder whether it would be smarter for the
Red Sox to sell the team and the park now, and let the next buyer
worry about getting a new park built. But Sox chief John Harrington
says a sale now would set the project back for several years, and
he feels present management _ representing the Yawkey ownership,
which has been in power since 1932, would have a better chance of
getting something done than some newcomer with no prior investment
with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If he had any options left, I wish the Red Sox would have sent
John Valentin to Pawtucket instead of Lou Merloni. Valentin looks
like he is starting to acquire the dreaded Pillsbury Dough Boy
disease that strikes veteran Red Sox players with big contracts.
They seem to grow larger around the waist as the years go past,
like Mo Money and Clemens. The way Valentin has been running this
year to first base, you could time him with an hourglass. Is there
a bakery in the locker room?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Merloni, what was Nomar Garciaparra supposed to say
when the media asked him about his friend being sent down to
Pawtucket? ``Gee, I think it's great.'' Of course he's going to say
he's unhappy. Merloni's his friend. He's going to speak up for him.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Before it all started, if Harry Sinden had had his way, the
Bruins wouldn't be playing Carolina in this tough playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a tough matchup for us,'' Sinden said. ``Buffalo is,
too. I think everyone in our conference hoped they could get to
play Ottawa because they were not playing well at the end of the
year. Carolina and Buffalo have similar styles of play, and we have
trouble with it. Their forwards are very quick, and do a good job
of attacking our defensemen in our own end. When that happens, we
have a tough time playing well. Against both teams it is better if
we can slow the game down and control the play at center ice,
rather than having their forwards pounding our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago Dick Radatz, who is terrific on radio,
said in essence the one thing he never liked about Clemens was the
way he took himself out of close games, and left the finish to the
relief pitchers, even when the Sox didn't have a good bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about that last Sunday afternoon when Pedro Martinez
had one out to get against Cleveland and had thrown more than 120
pitches. Martinez didn't come out. He fought to stay in the game
and struck out the last batter to win, 3-2. He didn't want to leave
it up to the bullpen. Roger would have been into his second
cheeseburger by then.
</P>
<P>

   There is a rumor that the Atlanta Falcons contacted the Patriots
at draft time about making a trade for running back Jamal Anderson.
Anderson, one of the best backs in the league and the reason the
Falcons got to the Super Bowl last year, is in the last year of his
contract and will be looking for a ton of money. Supposedly,
Atlanta would have traded him for a bundle of draft picks . . .
Speaking of draft-day antics, instead of saying that he wasn't up
for trade, why don't the Patriots tell Terry Glenn they put him out
for grabs and that no one was that interested? Then he might wake
up and realize that football is a game you have to love, to work
at, and want to play, if you're going to be great . . . Horse owner
Bill Parcells likes Cat Thief in the Kentucky Derby: ``With this
many horses in a race, the horse that avoids a bad trip has a good
chance to win,'' Parcells said. ``I like his post position. I think
he can get out fast, not get boxed in, and stay with the pace. I
don't see any horse coming from way back in this field, getting
through all the horses in front of him, and winning this race.''. .
. Say a prayer for Leon Hess, the 85-year-old owner of the New York
Jets who is a wonderful gentleman and all class, as he fights for
his life in a New York hospital.

CHINESE LEADERS WARN WORKERS ABOUT FUTURE DEMONSTRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Fearing that members of the Buddhist Law movement
might demonstrate again in coming days, China's leaders issued a
warning this morning to all government officials and employees of
state-run institutions not to take part in any such protests.
</P>
<P>
   The government was clearly rattled and embarrassed by the
surprise appearance last Sunday of some 10,000 followers of the
movement, in the largest public demonstration here since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who maintained an eerie vigil around the
leadership compound in Beijing, have asked for favorable
recognition of their fast-growing group and an end to negative
portrayals of them in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist Law, known here as Falun Gong, was established in the
early 1990s by Li Hongzhi, a martial-arts master who is now 48. He
combined elements of the ancient practice of qigong, involving
breathing and meditation exercises said to mobilize energy forces,
with concepts drawn from Buddhism and his own theories of spiritual
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Membership has soared, largely in urban areas. The group has
attracted many well-educated people, including retired officials
and workers, who often embrace it with a consuming passion.
According to various government officials this week, the number of
followers inside China is anywhere from 20 million to 70 million,
although all may not be fervent devotees.
</P>
<P>
   Li, who said he felt pressure from an uneasy government, moved
to New York in 1998 and is building a global network of adherents.
</P>
<P>
   The group's power to mobilize its members was evident last
weekend as thousands mounted their vigil before the police realized
what was happening. Reflecting the gingerly approach it has
generally taken toward the group, the government allowed
demonstrators to stay through the day and depart peacefully, and a
senior official met with leaders to discuss their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, in a widely broadcast statement, the government
said that differences of opinion about groups like Falun Gong were
permissible, but it sternly warned followers against further
actions that ``jeopardize social stability.'' At the same time, the
official media were instructed to avoid inflaming the situation by
printing any articles about Falun Gong or even, for the time being,
the general subject of qigong.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, leaders of government agencies, research
institutes, publishing companies, newspapers and even state-owned
industrial companies in Beijing and many other cities were given an
urgent message, jointly issued by the General Offices of the
Communist Party and the State Council. These leaders in turn called
meetings of their office heads, who were instructed to pass the
message on to all employees, often including retirees, who were
called at home.
</P>
<P>
   According to an employee of a state publishing company in
Beijing who heard it, the message read: ``It has been learned that
on May 1, 2 or 3, Falun Gong practitioners are likely to stage
large-scale activities nationwide. Government workers must not
believe rumors, spread rumors or take part in such activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Mounting any large protest in coming days will be very
difficult. The Beijing police have been on high alert over the last
week and are certain to remain so over the coming three days, as
China marks the May 1 holiday honoring workers.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The Comoran military announced
Friday that it overthrew the government of the Comoro Islands on
Thursday night. The streets there were quiet Friday after the
apparently bloodless coup, a local journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   The military said it had staged the coup to stop violent
demonstrations on the main island against residents from Anjouan
island, which has been trying to declare its independence from the
Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Comorans from the main island, Grand Comore,
broke into the houses of Anjouanais, beating them and telling them
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to my house when I was at a conference, but my wife
and children and mother-in-law were at home,'' said Kamardine
Mohammed, a journalist and native of Anjouan who lives in a small
house just off the main road through Moroni, the capital.
``Fortunately a friend of mine who is a gendarme persuaded them to
go away. But my family was highly traumatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 people are believed to have left Grand Comore for
Anjouan this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Comoros, a tiny archipelago northwest of Madagascar in the
Indian Ocean, has had 18 coups or coup attempts in the 24 years
since it won independence from France. The volcanic islands are
beautiful but impoverished. Export income comes from vanilla,
cloves and perfume oil from the ylang-ylang, a custard-apple tree.
Tourism, which has enriched Indian Ocean islands like Mauritius,
has never really caught on.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four principal islands, Mayotte, chose to remain a
French colony at independence, and has prospered. About two years
ago, Anjouan and Moheli, feeling bullied by Grand Comore, asked
France to take them back. There is a long history of inter-island
hostility, reflected in a Comoran saying: ``Grand Comore rules,
Anjouan works and Moheli sleeps.''
</P>
<P>
   France declined, and Anjouan and Moheli declared their
independence. A force of 300 ill-prepared soldiers from the main
island tried to invade Anjouan in September 1997 but was beaten
back in a harbor gun battle, with about a third of the force
captured. The Anjounais had plenty of warning because residents of
Grand Comore saw troops commandeering boats in the harbor there for
days.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the separatists on Anjouan have split into two
factions and there have been gun battles in Mutsamudu, the main
city.
</P>
<P>
   Talks in Madagascar to resolve the inter-island crisis led last
week to an agreement giving Anjouan and Moheli more autonomy while
keeping them in the republic. The acting president, Tadjiddine Ben
Said Massounde, signed it, but the Anjouan representatives balked,
saying they had to consult their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Massounde was reported to be at his home Friday. Col. Azali
Hassounani, the army chief of staff, was apparently ruling the
country, and the government was declared dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   No one took responsibility for whipping up sentiment against the
Anjounais, but some members of the old guard, military men who
ruled the country after past coups, went on the radio earlier this
week saying the Anjounais should be driven out, Mohammed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safe now,'' he said. ``The inaction of the authorities
was responsible. The Anjounais have taken a deep sigh of relief
since the coup.''

CHAGRINED ROWLAND `GUY WHO LOST THE PATRIOTS' AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Just hours after he used space-age bravado to
declare that ``failure is not an option,'' Governor John G.
Rowland, father of this city's soured stadium deal, absorbed his
administration's biggest political defeat Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians had clambered further onto a political limb than
Rowland had in offering Patriots owner Robert Kraft the nation's
most generous, taxpayer-subsidized playground.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rowland who negotiated the deal in secret with Kraft. It
was Rowland who sold it to the state Legislature. And it was
Rowland who signed the agreement in a celebratory ceremony that he
hoped would signal Connecticut's _ and his _ arrival in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to known as the guy who lost the Patriots,'' the
42-year-old governor said as the gold-plated stadium deal began to
unravel.
</P>
<P>
   But now, almost certainly, he will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain of the ship is the one who is noticed when the
ship comes in,'' said Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin B.
Sullivan, a West Hartford Democrat. ``Unfortunately, he also gets
noticed when the ship sinks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He himself said his political future rests on this outcome,''
said State Representative Michael P. Lawlor, an East Haven
Democrat. ``It has to be a major political blow.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been few issues that Rowland, the nation's youngest
governor, has pursued with such passion _ a risk, he said, for
which he has no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get past the shoelace mentality,'' Rowland said in
an interview in his office last week before the stadium deal
collapsed. ``Everybody's looking down at their shoelaces, saying no
one's going to want to come to Connecticut. No one's going to come
to UConn basketball. We can never get an NFL stadium here. We're
not a big enough state. I'm trying to get people to have a little
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Connecticut's high-stakes roller-coaster ride with
Kraft has ended in defeat and despair, the political fallout is
certain to represent the severest test yet of Rowland's well-earned
reputation as his state's most agile politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hurt the state's reputation nationally,'' said Edward L.
Marcus, the state's Democratic state chairman. ``He's spent a lot
of money. This kind of takes the wind out of Rowland's sails. He
was all pumped up acting like he was the king of the world. He
comes out of this looking extremely foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the framed newspaper story headlined ``Touchdown!'' that
hangs in Rowland's outer office now seems a cruel -- and certainly
premature -- bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   The gregarious Rowland, who was voting for Ronald Reagan's MX
missiles at an age when most politicians run for the school board,
insisted he never wanted to be known simply as the man who brought
pro football to the banks of the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd rather concentrate on trimming taxes, creating
jobs, fighting crime, and _ blessed by the most bouyant economy
since World War II _ helping Connecticut forget the fiscal storms
that ravaged the Constitution State in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's supporters say he will ultimately emerge bruised, but
not broken, by his quixotic quest for New England's Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   He is, after all, a politician's son from a blue-collar city
whose defining moment came not when he became Connecticut's first
GOP governor in 20 years in 1995, but when he conceded defeat in
his first bid for the governor's office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, had Rowland not been vanquished in 1990 by
Republican-turned-Independent Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the imperious
governor whose successful support for a state income tax touched
off a political uproar, his political fortunes _ still bright by
all measures _ would certainly have been different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luck is a word that ought to be attached to him,'' said Thomas
J. D'Amore Jr., Weicker's former chief of staff and a former state
Republican chairman. ``Rowland was very lucky to lose in 1990. The
reason he's successful is because of the state income tax, which he
stood against.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether underpinned by luck, timing, fate or diligence, John
Grosvenor Rowland's easy-going style and elastic political
philosophy has propelled him far beyond his own expectations and
past opponents who have underestimated him at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm an old Waspy, trust-fund Republican,'' said
Rowland, seated in a wing-back chair in his second-floor office.
``I'm more of an Irish-Catholic guy, who grew up in the city _ a
three-decker _ the oldest of five kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland was reared in Waterbury, a working-class city 35 miles
west of Hartford known in Rowland's youth for its brass products
and bare-knuckle politics, where both his father and grandfather
served as city comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waterbury is one of the toughest political places that you can
find,'' said John F. Droney Jr., a former Democratic state
chairman. ``If you can make it in Waterbury, you can make it
anywhere.'' A Republican in a Democratic city, Rowland made it.
</P>
<P>
   After spending a year in his family's insurance business, he
spent $1,300 in 1980 to win a seat in the state House of
Representatives, the first GOP lawmaker from that district in 100
years. Mustached and heavier-set in those days, the backslapping
Rowland quickly moved into the House GOP leadership, railing
against high taxes and trumpeting programs to prop up Connecticut's
sagging cities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when he was 27, Rowland became the youngest member of
the US House of Representatives, where he won a seat on the Armed
Services Committee, supported Reagan's military buildup, and earned
a reputation as the state's staunchest conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the other Republicans and Democrats in the
Connecticut delegation I was a stark raving lunatic conservative,''
Rowland said. ``In my own caucus _ I came in with (GOP Texas
conservatives) Tom DeLay and Dick Armey _ they thought I was a
communist. They thought I was the biggest liberal in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland chafed against the conventions of Washington, a city he
called full of self-important automatons, where seniority, not
smarts, counts. ``I hated it,'' he said. ``It was not real. Not
even close to being real. Self-important as can be. It's
Disneyworld. It's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   When he quit in 1990 to run unsuccessfully for governor, he
tacked to the ideological center, softening his views and acquiring
a reputation as a chameleon _ a criticism that rankles him still.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland's blend of fiscal conservatism, social moderation
and his open willingness to compromise with the
Democratic-controlled legislature has been enormously popular.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps a plaque on his desk that says it's amazing how much
you can accomplish if you're willing to share the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're better making a bad decision and doing something than
making no decision at all,'' Rowland said. ``You have to create
your own opportunities. You've got to take risks and have guts.
Politicians who have luck are politicians who take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   And in defeat, even Rowland critics are willing to give him
credit for trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ought to be congratulated for making the effort,'' D'Amore,
the former GOP party chairman said. ``There was a lack of
experience, of being too quick to the altar. He should have paid
more attention to details _ everything from the siting to the
finances. But, on balance, it was a good thing to try.''

EVEN JUSTICES UNSURE ABOUT DISABILITY LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, May 2)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A one-eyed truck driver, a mechanic on medication
for high-blood pressure and twin sisters who wear eyeglasses tried
to persuade the Supreme Court last week that they had been
illegally rejected for jobs because of those disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   At question was whether Congress, in passing the 1990 Americans
with Disabilities Act, intended to protect from job discrimination
only the most severely disabled or a much broader range of people,
including those with minor, treatable impairments.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their questions and comments during arguments in the
three cases, the justices themselves are uncertain of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The three cases involve Albertsons Inc. trucking company, United
Parcel Service Inc. and United Air Lines Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA, a civil rights act for the disabled, has divided the
business and disability rights communities ever since it was first
being debated in Congress 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Companies continue to fear that the law's prohibition on bias
against the disabled will compel them to hire people even with the
most minor ailments, lest the businesses be sued for
discrimination. But advocates for the disabled counter that only a
strong anti-discrimination law, one that covers the gamut of
infirmities, will remove the entrenched stereotype that disabled
people are unable or unwilling to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last week took a tentative step into this
breach between employers and employees, with justices echoing the
companies' anxiety about increased litigation and the advocates'
fear that invidious stereotypes will persist unless the law is
interpreted broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, in each of the cases, pressed the employees'
lawyers on why their clients with common afflictions should be
protected under the statute. But the justices just as vigorously
asked company lawyers whether their clients perhaps ran afoul of
the law by regarding the employees and job applicants as disabled
and, hence, unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in particular, expressed concern that a
broad interpretation of ``disability'' _ one that would include
easily treatable impairments _ would enable every rejected job
applicant and fired employee to sue under the law. ``This statute
wasn't meant to apply to all Americans,'' Scalia said during
arguments in a case that addressed whether Albertsons was justified
in firing a driver with vision in only one eye.
</P>
<P>
   But disability rights advocates, in contrast to Scalia's
comment, do seek an interpretation of the law that would embrace
infirmities that can be remedied with corrective lenses or
medicine. The groups argue that the law's goal of debunking
stereotypes about the disabled can best be achieved if the statute
applies to all Americans whose abilities are limited due to
physical or mental impairments.
</P>
<P>
   ``By expanding the class of individuals (covered by the law),
you are assuring that people with high blood pressure, back
problems or severe myopia have the same opportunities that the rest
of us have in the workplace,'' said Patricia Yeager, executive
director of the California Foundation for Independent Living
Centers. ``This is about ending discrimination and leveling the
playing field, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which supported the employees in the
three cases, argued before the high court that disabilities should
be judged on a case-by-case basis regardless of how easily they can
be treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assessing the existence of a disability without regard to
mitigating measures is most consistent with the ADA's basic purpose
to eliminate the exclusion of individuals from the workplace
because of outdated stereotypes and myths about those individuals'
abilities,'' the government argued in a legal brief to the
justices.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bokat, a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
conceded that Congress intended the disability rights law to
protect many Americans from discrimination, but not those with
minor afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress intended to only have the act apply to people whose
disabilities substantially interfere with major life activities,''
Bokat said. Lawmakers never meant for the law to cover
``practically everyone in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law to end discrimination against the disabled was
modeled after federal civil rights statutes designed to abolish
bias against minorities and women. The act prohibits employers of
at least 15 people from discriminating against disabled workers and
job applicants, defined in the law as people with a disability that
``substantially limits'' their ability to perform a major life
function, such as walking or seeing.
</P>
<P>
   The statute also prohibits companies from discriminating against
employees and applicants whom the employers regard as disabled. But
the act is largely silent on the breadth of the term
``disability,'' leaving it primarily to the courts to define the
law's contours.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, during the argument sessions last
week, called the law ``unusual'' in that it is a civil rights act
in which neither the employer nor employee can be sure the worker
enjoys the statute's protection. Other civil rights laws _ which
protect minorities, women and older workers _ cover physical
characteristics, such as skin color, that are easily identifiable,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor indicated that the confusing
issue of what constitutes a disability might be irrelevant under
the law. The real question judges must answer in resolving whether
someone has suffered discrimination under the act is whether a
company illegally regarded that person as disabled.
</P>
<P>
   What an employer thinks about the physical or psychological
fitness of an employee or candidate ``really hits at the heart of
what the statute was aimed at,'' O'Connor said, noting that the law
seeks to end stereotypes about disabled employees. O'Connor made
her comment during arguments in the case of Vaughn Murphy, who
suffers from hypertension and was fired from his job as a mechanic
for Atlanta-based UPS, a position that requires driving company
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the three Supreme Court cases concerned employment in
the transportation industry, the justices asked, often with humor,
whether the disability rights law also applies to them and baseball
players. Scalia, for example, said he is ``close to blind'' but
does not consider himself disabled because his vision is corrected
with glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not do my current job, I could not do many other jobs,
without my glasses,'' the justice said during arguments in the UPS
case. ``A lot of Americans wear glasses and couldn't function
without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter, in a separate case, also addressed the
relevance of poor vision in questioning how substantial a
disability must be before it is protected under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have difficulty reading restaurant checks in dim light,''
Souter said. He jokingly added that waiters regard this impairment
as substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Souter's comments came in a case brought by Karen Sutton and
Kimberly Hinton, twin sisters who say Chicago-based United violated
the ADA by refusing to hire them as pilots because their vision,
without corrective lenses, fails to meet the airline's safety
standard.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments in the United case, Scalia said the company's
refusal to hire the women might not have been due to their alleged
disability. Rather, the airline might have rejected them because
they were unqualified to be pilots based on their failure to pass a
legitimate vision test, Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The justice, using a baseball analogy to illustrate his point,
said the Boston Red Sox could legally choose Hall-of-Fame slugger
Ted Williams _ the last player to hit over .400 for a season _ over
another hitter with inferior vision without running afoul of the
disability rights law. The Red Sox could not be held liable for
discrimination when they merely opted to retain a player whose
ability to hit, for whatever reason, was better than another's,
Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Souter, picking up on Scalia's theme: ``If there's a .400
hitter out there, I don't want to hire a .200 hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The employers in the three cases are urging the court to read
the ADA narrowly, to count as disabled only those employees whose
disabilities, even after treatment, substantially limit their
ability to perform a major life function. The employees, by
contrast, are pressing for a broad definition that includes workers
whose disabilities, before treatment, are substantially limiting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Albertsons case, Hallie Kirkingburg contends
the company illegally fired him as a truck driver because he is
blind in one eye. The U.S. District Court for Oregon dismissed the
lawsuit, saying Kirkingburg had failed to meet federal vision
regulations for truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, saying that
Kirkingburg is certainly disabled in the major life activity of
seeing and that the company regarded him as disabled. The 9th
Circuit, noting that the Federal Highway Administration had granted
Kirkingburg a waiver from its vision standard, told the district
court to hold a trial to determine if he is qualified to drive a
truck regardless of his disability.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy alleges that UPS violated the rights law when it fired
him after a company nurse concluded that his unmedicated blood
pressure of 160/90 exceeded federal guidelines for truck drivers.
The U.S. District Court for Kansas and then the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled against Murphy, saying he is not disabled
because his blood pressure is treatable with medication.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Hinton argue that United illegally rejected them to
be pilots because of their poor vision, even though their sight is
fine when they wear corrective lenses. But the U.S. District Court
for Colorado, followed by the 10th Circuit, ruled for the airline
after concluding that the women are not disabled but merely have a
visual impairment that can be corrected with lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decisions in the three
cases by July.

 &HT;    Web auction brings sacred Torah to Texas congregation
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One hundred twelve years ago, a Jewish
congregation danced through the streets of Yemen's capital,
carrying their new Torah to the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   They had waited years for the Jewish scribe painstakingly to pen
the Old Testament on narrow panels of heavy goatskin parchment sewn
together with catgut. As the synagogue doors parted in Sanaa, the
jubilant crowd paraded in to honor their sacred text _ a Torah that
one day would enter cyberspace, destined for Austin.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, Lynda Baker passed out glasses of kosher
champagne as a small group crammed into the North Austin office of
her husband, Rabbi Kerry Baker, to toast the new Torah of
Congregation Kol Halev.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor was dressed in cardboard, a 25-by-24-inch box
stamped with scores of postal cancellation marks and a big red
sticker: Fragile Handle With Care. Cost of shipping: $21.30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a congregation I know buying their Torah over
the Internet,'' Rabbi Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that the 2-year-old congregation, which has
borrowed Torahs from Congregation Agudas Achim and Congregation
Beth Israel, should find the historic scroll on an Internet
auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our congregation has gone to great lengths to be as electronic
as we can because it goes to inclusivity,'' said Dennis Passovoy,
the congregation's president. ``I think, out of our 124 families,
all but a small handful are on e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, the Torah is to be used for the first time as part of
a weekend celebration when Baker is officially installed as Kol
Halev's first and founding rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   A prize on eBay
</P>
<P>
   It was a new congregation member, Samantha ``Sam'' Gerow, who
spotted the Torah on March 11 on eBay, an Internet auction house,
and sent an e-mail to Baker. Early the next morning, a Friday,
Baker forwarded it to congregants Dee Seligman and Errol Stone,
members of the Torah search committee.
</P>
<P>
   Stone e-mailed the dealer who had placed the Torah on eBay. The
next afternoon, Stone sent the dealer's information to Passovoy,
Seligman, Baker and Lisa McCready, the synagogue's administrator.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Seligman went to the symphony wondering how the
congregation could find the money to bid on the Torah. Her answer
came during intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Another couple from the synagogue talked with Seligman during
the break and offered to lend the congregation up to $10,000 to bid
on the Torah. After the concert, Seligman went home and e-mailed
everybody. The last day to bid on the Torah would be Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation knew little about the Torah other than it was
Sephardic, which is associated with Jews whose heritage is Spanish
or Portuguese, and it was in St. Petersburg, Fla. Questions swirled
in their heads: Was the deal legitimate? Was the Torah kosher? Was
it readable?
</P>
<P>
   Baker turned to Rabbi Mark Sack of Tampa, the former rabbi of
Austin's Agudas Achim. Sack, who had a prior commitment, enlisted
the help of St. Petersburg Rabbi Stephen Moch. Moch looked at the
Torah on Monday, giving Congregation Kol Halev the green light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I knew on Monday, Dennis Passovoy called me and
said, we are going to bid on it tonight,'' Gerow recalled. Passovoy
asked Gerow to do the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I have this nice, placid little life, and then
Monday it was in a whirlwind,'' Gerow said. ``I've only been a
member of the congregation three months. ... I don't really know
that many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on history
</P>
<P>
   An anxious Gerow turned to her best friend and boss, Barbara
Carr, a Christian who had introduced her to eBay a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never bid anything higher than $30,'' Carr said of her eBay
experience.
</P>
<P>
   After the women finished work at the University of Texas
Humanities Research Center, they took off for Carr's home computer.
In fact, many of Kol Halev's members fired up their computers,
including one who was on vacation in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was on one telephone line, and I was on another ...
two different telephone lines and two different computers watching
it,'' Seligman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding was scheduled to end at 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Carr submitted Kol Halev's first bid an hour earlier: $5,300,
just over the minimum bid allowed but well under the seller's
lowest acceptable sales price.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone watched. Would someone else submit a bid?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Carr upped the bid to $7,000. They waited again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous,'' Gerow said. No one counterbid.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Carr's machine was disconnected from eBay. That
made Gerow very, very nervous, Carr said. Calm and relaxed, Carr
quickly reconnected. ``Nothing had changed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Carr entered $7,700 _ the minimum the seller would
take. Would someone, in the final seconds, add 50 cents to their
price, walking off with Kol Halev's Torah?
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept hitting the reload button to see the time expire,''
Carr said. ``It was almost like a New Year's countdown _ 30
seconds; OK, 15 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was zero, Kol Halev had its Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bargain,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Most used Torahs sell from $10,000 to $17,000; new ones can cost
from $20,000 up, Passovoy said.
</P>
<P>
   The news got better when the couple who offered the loan decided
to donate the money for the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   Small but precious
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 inches high, this Sephardic Torah is not much larger
than a book. ``In the universe of Torahs, this is a small one,''
Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   For Kol Halev, a congregation without a synagogue building, the
Torah offers the ease of portability.
</P>
<P>
   The most common Torahs in the United States are Ashkenazi,
meaning they come from Jews whose heritage is central eastern
Europe. The cultural difference between the Sephardic and Ashkenazi
is in how they are read.
</P>
<P>
   The Sephardic Torah is held in a hard case with the rabbi
reading from the scroll with his back to the congregation. It
allows the congregation to see the text as it is being read.
</P>
<P>
   The large, cloth-covered Ashkenazi scroll is spread out on an
inclined table as the rabbi _ facing the congregation _ reads from
it. After the reading, the rabbi holds the text up for the
congregation to view. When the rabbi reads from the Torah, the
congregation can follow along from the Old Testament books in the
pew.
</P>
<P>
   In the synagogue, both types of Torahs are stored in an ark, or
niche, that designates its place of honor. The early Christian
church replaced the ark with the crucifix.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, every Torah scroll _ which contains the first five
books of the Old Testament _ is penned by a specially trained
scribe, as it was in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
   Kol Halev's Torah was used in the Yemen synagogue until 1949,
when virtually all of the country's 45,000 Jews boarded planes in a
clandestine mission dubbed ``Operation Magic Carpet.'' They, like
many Jews in Arab countries who fled persecution, landed in the
year-old state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Congregation members at a synagogue in Rosh Ha Ayin, located
east of Tel Aviv, held a celebration to welcome the Torah to its
new home. Twenty years later, the Torah was put up for sale and
purchased by a Yemen family who had emigrated from Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the family, which specializes in Torahs _ including
scribing new ones _ sent the Torah to a relative in St. Petersburg,
where it was to be purchased by a Jewish day school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day school was donated a Torah, so this one was
orphaned,'' said Bill Marger, the eBay dealer who specializes in
antique manuscripts and documents. ``The relative of the Israeli
owners ... contacted me to see if I could sell it through the
Internet on eBay.''
</P>
<P>
   The first viewing
</P>
<P>
   In Baker's office, Passovoy used his pocketknife to carefully
break the seal of the box. In an envelope was a note from Marger
asking Baker to use the four crisp $1 bills enclosed to return his
bar mitzvah prayer shawl, which was neatly wrapped around the
Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Torah is thought of as a living thing; it's God's living
word,'' Baker said. ``You treat it like a person _ you dress it and
undress it. It's the beautification of God's commandment.''
</P>
<P>
   When a Torah can no longer be used because of torn pages or
flaking text, it is buried in a funeral service.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation is still looking for a vestment, the case that
dresses the scroll. That's the only thing that could delay the
Torah's May 15 debut.
</P>
<P>
   As Baker and Passovoy gently scooped out the foam peanuts and
stripped away the bubble wrap, those in the room became cautiously
quiet. Everyone knew the true test would come when Baker examined
the scroll. Carefully, the prayer shawl was unfolded and the Torah
was exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' Gerow said, half her voice filled with
excitement and the other with relief.
</P>
<P>
   Baker bent over, parallel to the table, to squint at the small
Hebrew lettering. ``Kerry, you'd better get new glasses,'' Stone
said, breaking into a broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   Under his breath, Baker could be heard reading the Hebrew. The
Torah was opened to the laws of sacrifice in Leviticus.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Baker used a tissue to wipe her husband's brow. ``This
opening of the Torah is breaking you out in a sweat, honey,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting,'' the rabbi replied.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah was rolled on its two dowels as congregation members
took turns checking the quality of the ink lettering. ``I see no
reason to send it back,'' Baker said. ``It's in good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way from Yemen,'' Lynda Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Passovoy went home to e-mail the good news to the congregation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   America's economic boom _ already the second-longest on record _
shows no signs of flagging.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a decline in auto production and another sharp
deterioration in the nation's trade balance, the U.S. economy grew
at a surprisingly robust 4.5 percent annual rate during the first
quarter of 1999, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That is the sort of heady pace usually associated with the
first, not the ninth, year of an economic expansion. Moreover, most
forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, had been
expecting a visible slowdown from the previous quarter's frenetic 6
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This economy continues to defy the aging process,'' said Bill
Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
in Boston. ``The only discernible weakness is the trade deficit.
And this has merely slowed the economy from warp speed.''
</P>
<P>
   To William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, the latest
report on America's gross domestic product ``in some ways was even
stronger than the fourth quarter's.''
</P>
<P>
   It was too strong for some. Investors in the financial markets,
who had been basking in an earlier report showing that wage
pressures had eased, were stunned by the economy's momentum. Fears
that the Fed might raise interest rates to cool things off sent
bond prices down sharply. The stock market headed south as well.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 89.34 points to close at
10,789.04.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of domestic spending fueled last quarter's gains.
Consumers, who account for more than two-thirds of the nation's
buying, spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Home
purchases shot up at an annual rate above 15 percent. And business
investment in new plant and equipment, which had faltered last
summer, continued to rebound, advancing at a 7.6 percent rate. Even
state and local governments, flush with cash these days, helped
fuel the boom by plowing their surpluses into road repairs and
highway construction.
</P>
<P>
   All figures in the Commerce Department report are adjusted to
account for inflation and predictable seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the virtual absence of inflation now, Dudley said,
growth this fast always increases the risk that wages and prices
will start to creep steadily upward.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the so-called GDP deflator _ which measures
changes in the prices of domestically produced goods _ jumped to a
1.4 percent annual rate compared with eight-tenths of a percent in
the fourth quarter, the increase appeared mostly to reflect a
one-time pay increase for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Landefeld, director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis,
pointed out that prices on everything that businesses and consumers
actually buy, including cut-price imports, rose no faster last
quarter than in the fall, at a 1.1 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   How long can the good times last? An economist who has spent the
last 15 years studying American business cycles from the time
before the Civil War to the present says the short answer is:
Pretty much as long as the Federal Reserve, committed to preventing
another outbreak of inflation, remains convinced that the danger is
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Long periods of uninterrupted growth, explains Christina Romer
at the University of California at Berkeley in a forthcoming
article in The Journal of Economic Perspectives, are a post-World
War II phenomenon. Between the early 19th century and the 1960s,
the longest interval between recessions was half a dozen years or
fewer. But the 1960s boom lasted nearly nine years, the 1980s
growth cycle stretched for almost eight years, and the expansion of
the 1990s has now passed its eighth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   What changed? In the late 1940s, Romer said, ``We learned
something from Keynes about how to prevent recessions, i.e., how to
use monetary policy to counter economic shocks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the newfound competence eventually turned into hubris,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   During the Vietnam War and the years after the 1973 oil shock,
she says, ``we expanded too much and created a lot of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   To undo its own mistakes, the Fed had to create some truly nasty
recessions, including the severe recession of 1980-82 engineered by
Paul Volcker, then the Fed's chairman. Ever since, central bankers
have managed to avoid overexpansion, and the only recession, the
one largely precipitated by a consumer pullback in response to the
outbreak of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf war, was relatively
short-lived and shallow.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed's having shown restraint in the past, Romer said,
``We don't have to create a recession to get inflation down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Romer says that Alan Greenspan, who has been in charge at
the Fed since 1987, has been lucky as well as smart. Trouble in the
rest of the world, paradoxically, turned out to be a boon for the
American economy. Tough times abroad helped hold inflation down as
the prices of raw materials and imports collapsed and foreigners
poured their money into Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   As for American consumers, they are behaving as if bad times are
far, far away. With unemployment at a 30-year low,
inflation-adjusted take-home pay rising handily, and spirits about
as high as they have ever been, consumers are spending all of their
income _ and then some. In addition, the well-heeled are cashing in
some of their stock market gains while just about everyone else is
taking advantage of easy credit to borrow more.
</P>
<P>
   After-tax personal income soared at a 4.6 percent annual rate
this winter, but spending rose at an even headier 6.7 percent
annual rate and the personal savings rate, already around zero,
fell into negative territory to the lowest level, minus five-tenths
of a percent, ever recorded. (The measure, while seriously flawed,
nonetheless clearly shows that Americans are saving less than they
were just a year or two ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Business, which has been having trouble passing higher costs
along to customers, is spending freely once again as well to
improve its efficiency. Although the growth of computer purchases
slowed this winter, businesses invested heavily in low-technology
gear, new office space and the like.
</P>
<P>
   What could go wrong? A meltdown in the stock market could spook
consumers into becoming born-again savers. Another deterioration in
growth abroad _ at the moment things look a bit firmer _ could
reverse the budding spring revival in manufacturing that seems to
be under way. And inflation may start to simmer again.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, these are just risks, not realities.

STUDENTS TO RECREATE PRECEDENT-SETTING MASSACRE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Law student Anthony Dellorfano will don a black robe
and powdered wig Saturday afternoon, and thrust out his chest with
corpulent pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law will not bend to the uncertain wishes, imaginations,
and wanton tempers of men,'' he will declare, in a voice strong
enough to blow away the cobwebs of history.
</P>
<P>
   At Faneuil Hall, Dellorfano and about 60 other law students and
young lawyers plan to recreate John Adams's defense of the British
soldiers in the Boston Massacre _ one the greatest, but least
remembered, chapters in American legal history.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the growing fervor of Boston in 1770, with the colony
edging to the brink of revolution, Adams stood in the teeth of
local passions and forged legal principles for an emerging nation:
the virtue of reason over mob rule; the absolute right to a defense
attorney; the responsibility of a lawyer to defend even the most
unpopular clients; and the need to erase any reasonable doubts
before determining guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Over the succeeding years, however, the trial of the soldiers
became a footnote to the story of the massacre itself, which was
etched in the public mind through an inflamatory _ and historically
inaccurate _ engraving by Paul Revere. The trial of the soldiers
was chronicled by Superior Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel in his 1970
book, ``The Boston Massacre,'' but otherwise slumbered in the back
stacks of American history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Zobel, Suffolk Law Professor Joseph McEttrick, and the
Bostonian Society, assisted by scores of local luminaries, are
piecing it together again, from a transcript prepared at the time
by journalist John Hodgson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the upheaval, the soldiers got a fair trial in a
public courtroom in Boston,'' says McEttrick. ``That was a triumph
of the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellorfano, 32, who did some community-theater acting before
entering Suffolk's night law program, prevailed over 11 other
contenders for the role of Adams. Playing the pigeon-chested
patriot will be a daunting challenge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great combination of erudition and articulateness,
but he was an earthy guy _ stocky, down-to-earth,'' said
Dellorfano.
</P>
<P>
   But for him, the appeal was not the chance to act, but to learn
about the trial itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person studying the law, and an aspiring lawyer, it's not
hard to get up there, even in a silly costume, at a time of such
cynicism about the law, and speak these powerful lines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Adams's summation is replete with famous lines,
including ``Facts are stubborn things,'' but his legal artistry is
even more apparent in the context of the turbulent political
atmosphere in which the trial was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre was the culmination of months of protests by
colonists, chafing under the British military occupation of Boston.
However, as Zobel points out, the troops were oppressors only in
the eyes of certain politically charged colonists; they functioned
as policemen to protect British customs officials, and rarely used
force.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sons of Liberty, led by Samuel Adams, were in the
midst of a campaign to discredit British rule, largely over the
taxes and duties sent back across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Sam Adams's rhetoric unleashed forces he couldn't
control. Mobs of colonists repeatedly taunted and fought with
British loyalists. Just weeks before the massacre, a British
customs official had been chased back to his home. The mob circled
his house, pelting it with enough rocks and debris to knock out all
the windows. Even when he and another man waved shotguns in the
windows, the mob persisted. Finally, he shot back _ and the spray
of pellets struck and killed an 11-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before the massacre, the British official was
convicted of murder and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   On March 5, King Street _ as State Street was then known _
shimmered in the moonlight under a glaze of ice. A lone sentry
stood outside the Custom House, located near the present-day Court
Street. Inside, a squadron of officers led by Captain Thomas
Preston, 40, were on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the evening, the sentry had scuffled with a group of
young apprentices, leaving an apprentice injured and the sentry
ruffled and angry. As the night wore on, various men and youths
gathered, taunting him. Later, as taverns emptied, the mob grew
louder and more threatening. Soon, the guard was surrounded, unable
even to return to the Custom House.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Preston decided to march his group of seven additional
soldiers out to protect his man. Within minutes, the mob enveloped
the soldiers, threatening their lives and daring them to shoot.
They did. Five colonists died in the volley, and word of their
martyrdom spread throughout Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Most colonists demanded death for the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Blood requires blood,' is the way they referred to it,''
says Zobel.
</P>
<P>
   By one account, Preston appealed directly to Adams, already, at
35, one of the colony's most respected lawyers. Adams, believing
that everyone deserves the best possible defense, agreed to
represent him and all his men.
</P>
<P>
   But Zobel offers another scenario. He found evidence that Sam
Adams, John Adams's cousin but otherwise not particularly close to
him, appealed directly to John Adams's co-counsel, Josiah Quincy,
to take the case. Zobel suggests that Sam Adams was worried that
less prominent defenders would turn the trial into a circus,
putting the victims on trial in a way that would spark such anger
that even he, Sam Adams, would lose control.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sam Adams clearly expected the soldiers to be found
guilty. He even appeared daily at the trial, shoving his way to the
front of the courtroom to offer advice to the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, meanwhile, straddled a thin line, suggesting that
the soldiers were reasonably in fear of their lives, but avoiding
pinning blame for the clash on the colonists; in one apparent nod
to prejudices of the time, he steered responsibility away from
Boston, noting that one victim was from Ireland and another was a
``molatto'' from Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Adams's soaring rhetoric framed the issues in a
way that all but compelled the judges to side with the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Preston, who was tried separately, was acquitted of all charges;
six of the soldiers were also acquitted. Two soldiers were found
guilty of the lesser offense of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the trial of the soldiers, Rex v. Wemms, was a
lively affair, featuring many of the most prominent Bostonians of
the day: the Adamses, Josiah Quincy, prosecutor Robert Treat Paine,
and even the future Revolutionary War General Henry Knox, then a
bookseller who happened to witness the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   At the reenactment, three of the judges will be played by
present-day Massachusetts judges: Peter W. Agnes Jr., Robert Rufo
and Paul K. Leary. Zobel will narrate and Congressman Joseph J.
Moakley will introduce the play.
</P>
<P>
   It will be repeated Sept. 8, when Suffolk opens its new campus
on Tremont Street. Directly across from the new building, the five
victims of the massacre lie in the Granary Burial Ground.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Dellorfano and many other students involved in the
reenactment, it will be Adams's genius that they remember most.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, the law is inexorable to the cries and
lamentations of the prisoners,'' Adams said, in a speech that could
be culled from a present-day trial. ``On the other, the law is deaf
as an adder to the clamors of the populace.''

 &HT;    Coke plaintiffs seek halt to e-mail
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ E-mail messages from Coca-Cola Chairman M. Douglas
Ivester to salaried black employees about a discrimination lawsuit
against the company violate a federal rule and should be stopped by
court order, plaintiffs' attorneys said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys, who represent one former and four current
African-American employees, filed a motion in federal court in
Atlanta seeking to bar Ivester and any other company official from
discussing the substance of the suit with any potential plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed last week, seeks class-action status in hopes of
adding 1,500 other salaried African-American employees in the
United States. It alleges Coca-Cola has a ``companywide pattern and
practice'' of discriminating against black employees in pay,
promotions, performance evaluations and terminations.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester has defended the company against these allegations in
two e-mails sent to all 10,000 of the company's U.S. employees,
including potential members of the class-action suit. He has said
the allegations of systematic discrimination are untrue and that
the suit contains ``significant errors of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the plaintiffs' attorneys allege, Ivester has violated a
federal rule for the Northern District of Georgia that prohibits
such communication with potential members of a class-action suit
without prior court approval. As a result, they seek an emergency
hearing and court order banning any future communication about the
lawsuit from the company to potential plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   In his April 28 e-mail, Ivester said he ``plans to continue to
update all associates as information warrants in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorneys also allege Ivester violated the
federal rule by meeting with senior African-Amercian employees to
discuss the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ivester's actions suggest that Coca-Cola believes the
court's rules do not apply to the company,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola defends its right to communicate with employees on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a legal maneuver by plaintiffs' attorneys typical in
this sort of litigation,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin.
``There is no validity to the claims in this filing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the plaintiffs' attorneys said they have been
``severely handicapped'' by following the federal rule and not
communicating with nearly 100 potential class-action members who
have contacted them over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys want a court order saying they can now communicate
with these people, even though they want Coca-Cola's communications
with them stopped.
</P>
<P>
   That is because ``interviews with prospective class members are
a critical means for plaintiffs to gather evidence to the existence
of classwide racial discrimination at Coca-Cola,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   It argued that case law supports the right of plaintiffs'
attorneys to talk to potential members of the class they may
eventually represent, even when restrictions are placed on the
defendant's rights to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyers argue they already have the beginnings
of an attorney-client relationship with potential class members
that the company should not be able to interfere with.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate motion Friday, the lead attorney in the case,
Cyrus Mehri of Washington, told the court he was adding a
prestigious Atlanta law firm to his team. The firm of Bondurant,
Mixson &AMP; Elmore represented many Coca-Cola bottlers in a
decade-long contractual dispute against Coca-Cola Co.

KRAFT SHOWED COURAGE IN DECISION   TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When they had talked it out for four hours,
Connecticut Governor John Rowland looked at Bob Kraft and wanted to
make sure the message he was getting was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me get this straight,'' said Rowland. ``Those politicians
up there (in Massachusetts) dumped on you for years, and gave you a
lousy deal. We've put a billion dollars on the table down here. You
and your kids will never have to worry again about a stadium.
Everything would be in place for another 30 years. And you're
worried about delaying this thing for just one more year? I don't
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame Rowland? How many people can walk away from the
richest deal offered by a state to an owner in the history of
sports?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Bob Kraft did Friday, and he deserves all of the
credit in the world for doing it.
</P>
<P>
   No deal anywhere, in any sport, was more lucrative than the one
Rowland put on the line.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, Kraft stayed here for short money.
The Massachusetts deal is just about the worst any owner has had to
accept to stay put in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's hope that everyone involved on this end lives up to
their word. The NFL. The state. The local business community. Gov.
Cellucci, Tom Birmingham, and Tom Finneran all deserve credit for
opening the door for Kraft to come back and keep the franchise
where it has been for the past 40 years, and where it should be for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Kraft has proven for the second time that it is not
about the money, it is time for the state to act as expeditiously
as possible to move this project forward. Time is money in the
construction industry, and the sooner a project starts, the less it
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when he purchased the team from James B. Orthwein
(who wanted to move it to St. Louis), Kraft turned down millions to
let the Patriots get out of their lease in Foxoboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like him personally, or whether you like the way he
has run his football team, it shouldn't make any difference. He
deserves all the credit he can get for passing on the money, and
for he way he did it. Kraft could have carried it out, gone to the
league meeting, and made the NFL owners vote him down, which would
have taken some of the heat off him. But he didn't. He took
whatever is coming from Connecticut on himself, even though it was
personally distasteful to turn down Rowland, who had treated him so
well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hidden hero in the Foxboro Stadium play is Dan Rooney, owner
of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney orchestrated the entire move to get the Boston business
community to work with the NFL to get the state leaders to approve
the plan. Why Rooney? Although he is a Pittsburgh native, he loves
Boston. As president of the Ireland Fund across America, Rooney has
become very good friends with most of the top business leaders in
the city. Boston raises more money each year than any other city in
America for the Ireland Fund, which distributes it to need
organizations all across Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk was brought in by commissioner Paul Tagliabue to head
the Boston business push. Kirk and Tagliabue became friends years
ago when Kirk was heading up the Democratic National Committee in
Washington and Tagliabue was working for a top law firm there at
the time. However, it was Rooney who was quarterbacking the deal
from long distance to keep the team in Massachusetts.

what team, but with all of that money on the table, someone not in
good financial shape will go after it. With the way this league is
giving out bonuses now, you need to have a ready supply of cash to
compete, and that's what this Hartford deal would do for any
team.''

AOL, MICROSOFT MAY HELP COMCAST ACQUIRE MEDIAONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disturbed by AT&AMP;T Corp.'s cable television ambitions, America
Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp. may back Comcast Corp. in its fight
against AT&AMP;T to acquire Mediaone Group Inc., the big cable
television carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Mediaone said Friday that America Online, the No. 1 Internet
service provider, and Microsoft, the No. 1 maker of personal
computer software, had entered into confidentiality agreements with
the company.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the two titans of cyberspace access to
Mediaone's secret internal financial information as part of due
diligence in deciding whether to assist Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast held preliminary discussions with America Online and
Microsoft early in the week, but the talks have since become more
serious, executives close to the negotiations said. The executives
added that Paul Allen, who was a founder of Microsoft but left that
company in 1983, is among the other parties who have expressed
interest in joining Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, one of the nation's biggest cable operators, needs help
because its agreement to acquire Mediaone for $53 billion in stock
is in serious jeopardy. Last week, AT&AMP;T tried to break up that deal
with its own unsolicited offer to acquire Mediaone for $58 billion
in stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T wants to build on its recent acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable television provider, by
acquiring Mediaone so it can offer consumers across the United
States integrated packages of television, telephone service and
high-speed Internet access over cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T, already the nation's biggest phone company, were to
succeed in acquiring Mediaone, it could end up with cable links to
as many as 60 percent of the nation's homes.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is especially worrisome to America Online, which
has already emerged as a critic of AT&AMP;T, if not an ``avowed
enemy,'' as one executive close to the negotiations put it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that cable television carriers, unlike local phone
companies, are not obligated to open their networks to outsiders
(except local broadcast television stations).
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that as AT&AMP;T begins to deliver high-speed
Internet access to millions of homes using cable systems, the
company is under no obligation to let America Online offer service
to those customers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and other Internet companies are trying to
persuade Congress and regulators in Washington to change the rules,
but that initiative is not moving quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For now, AT&AMP;T is winning the battle of influence at the Federal
Communications Commission by saying that it will not spend the
billions needed to upgrade cable systems to deliver advanced
services if it then has to share those systems with others.
Moreover, AT&AMP;T is promising to use the upgraded cable networks to
deliver not just Internet service, but local telephone competition
as well.
</P>
<P>
   So for America Online, the reasons to help Comcast fight AT&AMP;T
are clear. If a combined America Online-Comcast succeeds in
acquiring Mediaone, America Online will get a guaranteed channel
for selling its services to consumers over cable modems. (Even if
America Online does not end up participating in a bid for Mediaone,
it will still get high-speed links to millions of homes through its
deals with local Bell phone companies.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem for America Online may be that Comcast needs cash.
While Comcast's standing offer for Mediaone is all stock, AT&AMP;T has
offered most of an AT&AMP;T share plus almost $31 in cash for each
share of Mediaone. And in the largest syndicated financing to date,
managed by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and Chase Manhattan Bank, AT&AMP;T has
already lined up $30 billion in commitments from lenders to back up
its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast does not have that kind of financial firepower, and
America Online may not either. At the end of the last quarter,
America Online had only $1.8 billion in cash on hand. Even if it
could raise a few billion more, it would still not be in AT&AMP;T's
league.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious solution for America Online would be to use its
stock, which has given the company a market value of about $130
billion. But Mediaone's shareholders may have qualms about taking
America Online shares, which trade at about 400 times estimated
earnings. Valuations of that nature may not be sustainable,
especially if America Online becomes part owner of a cable company,
since cable companies are generally valued much more
conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, accepting a bundle of America Online and Comcast
shares would not be wholly tax-free for Mediaone's shareholders _
although taking a mix of cash and AT&AMP;T stock would not be wholly
tax-free either.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Microsoft's position is the opposite of America
Online's. Microsoft has almost $22 billion in cash on hand, but
does not seem to have an obvious strategic reason to go to war
against AT&AMP;T. Microsoft would like to sell software for high-speed
Internet connections, but Microsoft and AT&AMP;T could find many
mutually profitable ways to work together. Microsoft has invested
$1 billion in Comcast, but that alone would not seem reason enough
to make a strategic enemy of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Allen may be the most intriguing candidate for Comcast. He has
already invested heavily in the cable television industry, and he
may not care about working with AT&AMP;T in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Under its original deal with Comcast, Mediaone has until
Wednesday to accept another offer. The company is almost sure to
accept AT&AMP;T's offer, if only in the hope (or knowledge) that
Comcast and whatever friends it is able to enlist will be able to
respond with a higher one.
</P>
<P>
   Mediaone's board is set to meet this weekend but could very well
wait until the last minute to accept AT&AMP;T's offer. That is because
once Mediaone formally accepts, Comcast will have only five days to
respond. Mediaone might want to wait in order to give Comcast more
time to prepare its second offer.

<P>
   Do They Have An Annuity for You &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The variable-annuity business may never be the same. TIAA-CREF,
the $255 billion pension plan, has begun offering the public a
no-load, extremely low-cost variable annuity, Personal Annuity
Select, in seven states and is planning to roll it out nationwide.
The fund previously offered variable annuities only to employees of
educational and research institutions as part of their retirement
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The annuity charges a total of just 0.37 percent in expenses,
lower than any other annuity available to the public, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. By contrast, the
average total expense for variable annuities is 2.10 percent,
Morningstar said. And there are no surrender charges for investors
who withdraw their money. The fund's plans were reported in Fund
Action, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will have a choice of a fixed annuity that currently
pays 5.75 percent, net of expenses, or a portfolio indexed to the
Russell 3000 Index. Tom Pinto, director of media relations for
TIAA-CREF, said the fund would consider offering other options.
</P>
<P>
   The expense ratio includes a so-called mortality and expense
charge of 0.1 percent that insures that heirs at least receive the
value of the amount invested, regardless of the direction of the
market, after the investor's death.
</P>
<P>
   As of early April, the annuity _ which needs states' approval _
was available in New York, Iowa, South Dakota, Arkansas, Ohio,
Indiana, Alabama and the District of Columbia. &QL;

   A White-Hot Growth Fund &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Janus 20 fund has closed to new investors, a
less-known fund seems poised to replace it as the most popular
actively managed fund for new money: Alliance Premier Growth.
</P>
<P>
   The fund had the third-highest net inflows of all funds in the
first quarter of 1999, drawing $2.9 billion _ pushing assets over
$10 billion, four times what they were a year ago _ according to
the Financial Research Corp. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with first-quarter net inflows of $4.7 billion and
$4.5 billion, respectively, for the two leaders _ Janus 20, which
stopped taking new money in April, and the Vanguard 500 Index fund.
</P>
<P>
   While having a lower profile than the Janus or Vanguard funds, a
function of the fact that it is mostly sold with a sales charge
through brokers, the Alliance fund posted an impressive 35.5
percent annual return for the three years ending March 31, placing
it in the top 1 percent of its category, according to Morningstar
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As the flagship offering of Alliance Capital, a growth-oriented
fund company, Premier Growth has no big surprises in its portfolio.
Its top holdings as of March 31, included Nokia, Airtouch
Communications, Dell Computer, EMC and McKesson. (McKesson
contributed to the fund's 4 percent drop last Wednesday, when the
drug wholesaler fell by almost half due to accounting problems).
</P>
<P>
   The fund's success helped propel the Alliance fund family to a
43.4 percent gain in assets in the year ended March 31, to $39.2
billion, the second-best performance of fund families with at least
$20 billion. Only Janus, with a 69.7 percent gain, to $96.1
billion, fared better.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the stock of Janus' parent, Kansas City Southern
Industries, which returned 32.3 percent over the last 12 months,
Alliance Capital Management partnership units have been pretty
sedate, returning 11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Majority owned by the Equitable Companies, the partnership,
which oversees $301.4 billion in assets and pays out most of its
earnings through dividends, trades for about 15 times earnings. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people call it communicopia. Others call it convergence.
But as AT&AMP;T's $58 billion cash and stock offer for Mediaone Group
amply illustrates, the move toward an intertwined landscape of data
and voice communications, entertainment programming and electronic
commerce also deserves to be called expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T offer, which outstripped the $53 billion stock deal
that Mediaone struck in March with the Comcast Corp., seems to
validate the argument that cable, not the telephone, is the
preferred technology to deliver information, because of its
broad-band capability.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe AT&AMP;T won't win. Salvatore Muoio, a media and
communications analyst who runs SM Investors LP, took some time
last week to discuss developments in the industry, as well as why
AT&AMP;T can't afford to lose. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did AT&AMP;T's bid for Mediaone surprise you? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I was a little surprised, but I shouldn't have been. Buying
Mediaone is strategically very important for Comcast, but to AT&AMP;T
it is survival.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance telephone service will be open to competition this
year, and at least one company, probably Bell Atlantic, is going to
start offering it. Once that door gets open, AT&AMP;T is going to lose
market share, and they need to reach out and offer local service.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they can't do that without a wire, either a local phone
company or cable. And there is no way regulators will let them buy
a local telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   After they bought TCI they would have liked to have negotiated
agreements with other cable operators, but they were having trouble
doing that. The Comcast/Mediaone deal threatened their national
strategy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There have been news reports that Comcast has been talking
with Microsoft and America Online about joining it in making a new,
higher bid for Mediaone. Do you think that's possible? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think Microsoft wants to invest that much money in
cable. And I don't think America Online wants to go there, if only
because the chances seem slim they could make a bid that tops
AT&AMP;T's.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Mediaone shareholder, you want AT&AMP;T, which is a
cheap stock. America Online's stock is not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Comcast comes back, I think AT&AMP;T would counter by
raising their own bid somewhat. They cannot let someone else own
Mediaone, which is the last of the Mohicans. All of the other big
cable companies, Adelphia, Cox, Comcast and Cablevision, are
family-controlled companies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So competitors, in your view, can't keep AT&AMP;T from completing
this deal. What about the regulators? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Regulatory concerns are the only area where they may run into
some problems, whether it means unwinding some ventures they are in
or putting properties in escrow pending sale. But I think the
regulators understand AT&AMP;T's need to buy local telephone
operations. The regional Bells will be in long distance. So where
is the competition in the local market going to come from? AT&AMP;T is
the only company that could do that on a big scale. So, I am not
sure this will be an issue they can't surmount. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you agree with those who think cable, not the telephone
wire, is the technology of choice for the communications business,
because it is easier and faster to use? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the fight for the broad-band customer has just begun.
Digital subscriber line is the equal of cable modems, and Bell
Atlantic says they will start rolling it out later this year.
</P>
<P>
   People love their local telephone companies. Generally, they get
better service from them than the cable companies. But at the
moment, investors are completely overlooking local telephone
franchises. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which local phone franchises do you like? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I like to focus on some of the smaller rural telephone
companies. In rural America, they don't have any competition.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone and Data Systems, Cincinnati Bell, Century Telephone
and the AllTell Corp. are great franchises selling at very low
price-earnings multiples.
</P>
<P>
   But my favorite stock is Citizens Utilities, a big local utility
company that in June will be split in two. One company will own
communications, and the other part, which will retain the company's
name, will own gas, electric, water and sewer utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Tow, a cable guy and one of the real entrepreneurs in
the business, runs this company, and it has a lot of great assets.
It is a terrifically underpriced stock with great potential. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the cable companies? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. As we see with this fight for Mediaone, cable companies are
fabulous franchises. But the stocks have priced in a lot of their
future growth opportunities. Once this consolidation wave ends, we
think that going forward the stocks will be faced with something of
a head wind.

DECISION MAKES BUSINESSMAN KRAFT MR. NICE GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Almost since he bought the New England Patriots in
1994, Robert Kraft has been engaged in a tug of war over his image.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's decision to choose Massachusetts over Connecticut,
Kraft did more than simply select a home for the team. He also took
a giant step in defining his public image, emphasizing the
soft-hearted public citizen over the hard-nosed businessman.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kraft insisted he was from the start.
</P>
<P>
   When he purchased the team, the Brookline native said he had
done it in no small part because he wanted to keep the franchise in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his boyhood disappointment when the Boston Braves left
town in 1953, Kraft said: ``It really impacts the psychology and
the fabric of the community, and this is my hometown and I just
believe this hometown wouldn't have been the same if this team had
left here.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't been the way critics have portrayed the
57-year-old businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Most pointed among them has been House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran, who variously denounced Kraft as ``a whining
multimillionaire'' and ``a fat-assed millionaire,'' a comment
Finneran later claimed was meant to apply to Baltimore Ravens owner
Art Modell.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, after a long, frustrating search for a new
Masschusetts home, Kraft announced he would take his team to
Connecticut, where the political establishment greeted him with
open arms, Finneran was scathing.
</P>
<P>
   `It is about nothing but money,'' the speaker charged.
``Expressions of loyalty to Massachusetts, affection for the fans .
. . is propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in word and deed, Bob Kraft demonstrated that that
accusation wasn't true. In doing so, he turned his back on what is,
by all measures, the most lucrative stadium deal in history of
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut offer would have paid off in ways Kraft could
have scarcely imagined before he opened negotiations with the
Nutmeg State. The state would have spent $374 million in public
money to build the stadium. When various revenue guarantees and
other perks were added in, the package would have been worth more
than $1 billion over 30 years, according to some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Massachusetts proposal, on which Kraft has
yet to comment, would require him to spend $250 million or so to
build the stadium _ though a recently approved funding mechanism
from the National Football League could dramatically reduce the
out-of-pocket hit. The Bay State would chip in $70 million for
public infrastructure improvements like roads, sewers, and
pedestrian ways.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some skeptics will say Kraft never intended to go,
that used Connecticut to get Massachusetts to make him an offer.
But others insist the Connecticut deal wasn't so much a matter of
``if'' as it was ``when.'' Even though the new Hartford stadium
would likely have not been ready until 2003, two years later than
originally planned, it will be a rush to get a new facility built
before then in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   By deciding to eschew Connecticut's offer, Kraft has made a
large statement about himself and his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking less money to keep the team here, he is making a
contribution to the community unlike any we have seen in a long
time,'' said Republican political consultant Charles Manning. ``I
think he will be seen as a public hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: status of that sort is important to the Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd, tough, and sometimes impolitic businessman he may be
in some endeavors, but as a football franchise owner, the man who
toured the field after victories in a golf cart and who gloried in
exchanging high-fives with Patriots fans, likes to be seen as a
good guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a gregarious guy who likes to be liked, and I think to
be liked in your own hometown is the most important thing,'' said
US Representative Joseph Moakley, who has known Kraft since his
days working in the office of then Senate President Maurice Donahue
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who last year negotiated
an agreement with Kraft much like the deal Beacon Hill leaders
okayed this week, also felt all along that Kraft's was motivated by
much more than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember an easier negotiation than the one I had with
Bob Kraft,'' Birmingham said of their 1998 talks. ``He clearly
wanted to get to `yes,' and he clearly was willing to sacrifice
more advantageous terms in other jurisdictions because he wanted to
keep the team in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham called Kraft's decision ``a credit to him,'' but
joked his family might not think so. ``I don't know what his heirs
will say about him taking the exit door,'' the Senate president
said. ``They are a family of substantial means right now, but they
would have been enriched greatly had the Hartford agreement come to
fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a conciliatory Finneran offered some praise. ``I think Mr.
Kraft deserves an awful lot of credit for making the decision that
he made,'' said the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Words of that sort will no doubt sound sweet to Kraft. In the
last several years, the Krafts, while readily pleading guilty to
accusations of political incompetence, have chafed under
accusations that they only care about the bottom line. For a family
that gives generously to charity, the mockery as money-grubbers,
like that which Finneran leveled at Kraft at this year's St.
Patrick's Day breakfast, has clearly stung.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, after Robert Kraft signed the deal to take the team
to Connecticut, his son Jonathan took two Globe reporters on a tour
of an elaborate mockup of the club seats and amenities the
organization had built in the basement of BankBoston to pitch their
aborted South Boston stadium plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our vision,'' Jonathan Kraft said wistfully. ``I just
hope it comes across how much effort we put in. It wasn't a fool's
errand. We wanted to spend our own money and keep the team here.''
</P>
<P>
   With his decision not to head to Hartford, Kraft showed that he
was sincere all along. In the end, he decided he'd rather earn
accolades from his home state than millions more from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   And in the debate over whether Kraft is just another bottom-line
businessman or a public citizen truly concerned about his
community, Friday's decision to remain in Massachusetts has to be
considered Exhibit A in support of Kraft as public citizen _ just
what he has said all along.

   WASHINGTON _ Defiant in the face of the most withering NATO
attacks yet, Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic vowed Friday that
he would ``never surrender'' to U.S. and allied demands for placing
a NATO-led peacekeeping force in the embattled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Milosevic laid out his own terms for ending the
conflict -- a proposal immediately rejected by the United States --
and retaliated with a charm offensive, allowing the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to visit with three American soldiers held captive by
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling pretty healthy, a little mentally drained,'' one
prisoner, Army Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, told
Jackson during a session broadcast by the Cable News Network (CNN).
``Really miss home and hope to be back soon.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN aired some 20 minutes of Yugoslav-censored footage showing
the soldiers -- clean-shaven, in fair spirits and, by all
indications, relatively good health -- meeting and chatting with
Jackson, who brought them each a bible and words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was scheduled to meet Saturday with Milosevic, but the
White House has insisted, publicly at least, that Jackson bears no
message from President Clinton and is on a strictly personal
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's visit is being conducted against the backdrop of the
most intensive air strikes since NATO launched its campaign on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   After flying more than 600 sorties and dropping an estimated 300
bombs Thursday night and early Friday, the alliance was taking
advantage of clear skies to plan at least as many missions
overnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding mightily to NATO's firepower, 10 B-52 Stratofortress
heavy bombers were scheduled to fly from U.S. air bases Friday
night, to join the NATO armada with a scheduled arrival at a
British air field on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sounded Friday evening in Belgrade, cutting
short Jackson's visit with the captives, as NATO bombs struck again
at military targets across Yugoslavia and fielded forces inside
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attacks on fielded forces have intensified,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea, describing furious allied strikes early
Friday on command posts, tanks, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft
weapons and even individual tanker cars, two of which were
destroyed Thursday night as they sat stranded on railroad tracks
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With a month of heavy cloud cover lifting, Shea said, Serb
forces in Kosovo would find it difficult to hide from the aerial
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``As spring gives way to summer and despite the excellent use of
camouflage and deception techniques,'' Shea told reporters at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, ``their destruction becomes
inescapable.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO tightened its noose, Milosevic offered to reduce his
forces inside Kosovo to some 12,000 troops, if NATO would withdraw
its forces from the bordering nations of Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do it in one week,'' Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic rejected a key element of NATO's terms, however,
saying he would accept lightly-armed United Nations monitors but
not a military peacekeeping force made up by his country's
attackers, even if holding out means accepting prolonged and
escalating air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more day (of bombing) is too much,'' Milosevic said in an
interview with the United Press International news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what choice do we have if NATO insists on occupying
Yugoslavia? To that we will never surrender,'' Milosevic said. ``We
Serbs are as one on this life and death issue of national honor and
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, said his country stood no
chance of prevailing militarily against NATO, but he said he was
heartened by the U.S. aversion to American casualties and the
emerging resistance in Congress to support the ongoing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed his country as a victim of NATO aggression,
insisted that Serb army troops had not committed widespread
atrocities in Kosovo but conceded that heavy handed methods had
been employed by paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials blame Milosevic for overseeing a
campaign that has resulted in the execution of at least 4,000
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and has left another 1.5 million
homeless over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not angels,'' Milosevic said. ``Nor are we the devils
you have made us out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said he would admit lightly-armed United Nations
monitors into Kosovo, but not a military force made up of his
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to accept a U.N. presence and are ready to
negotiate its composition,'' Milosevic said in the UPI interview.
``But please understand that after all those crimes
</P>
<P>
   against our nation and its people, we cannot accept
representatives of the countries that committed aggression against
us. We would like to see representatives of neutral countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was immediately rejected by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for the people of Serbia,'' said State
Department spokesman James Rubin, ``that plan was not serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies have insisted on NATO-led
peacekeepers being allowed into Kosovo as a central demand to a
halt in the bombing. Milosevic's plan appeared to fall into the
category U.S. officials have consistently characterized as an
effort to try to split the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's televised visit marked the first time the American
soldiers have been shown on camera since state-run television in
Yugoslavia showed footage of them April 1, with bruised faces and
downcast eyes, the day after Serb forces captured them near
Kosovo's border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The men said they were fed three square meals a day, were housed
separately in small cells with a bed and table and were visited
regularly by Yugoslav officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's adequate,'' said Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of
Smiths Creek, Mich., who turned toward the camera at one point to
address his wife and four-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my wife Tricia and my son Ryan, 'I love you,''' Stone said,
welling up with tears before breaking out with a broad grin.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told Gonzales, ``You are a hero. People know about you
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning toward the camera, Gonzales delivered an impromptu
message to the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks everybody, for all your thoughts and all your
prayers,'' he said. ``They've been needed and they're a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson prepared to meet with the third captive, Staff Sgt.
Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, air raid sirens sounded and
Jackson's Yugoslav hosts told him the exchange would have to be cut
short for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, wearing a dark three-piece suit, white shirt and tie,
urged the men to consider how prison terms had strengthened the
will of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., South
African apartheid foe Nelson Mandela and even the New Testament
Apostle Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people around the world are praying for you and
they're praying for reconciliation so we can all live in peace
together,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can have the tailwind push them, but sometimes in life
there are headwinds and crosswinds and nobody can see the wind,''
said Jackson, admonishing the captives to ``turn pain into power
and use this time wisely . . . time to write, time to think and
time to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is scheduled to meet Saturday with Milosevic, told
reporters after the meeting with the American soldiers, ``Our
country should be proud of them.''

KRAFT SHOWED COURAGE IN DECISION   TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When they had talked it out for four hours,
Connecticut Governor John Rowland looked at Bob Kraft and wanted to
make sure the message he was getting was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me get this straight,'' said Rowland. ``Those politicians
up there (in Massachusetts) dumped on you for years, and gave you a
lousy deal. We've put a billion dollars on the table down here. You
and your kids will never have to worry again about a stadium.
Everything would be in place for another 30 years. And you're
worried about delaying this thing for just one more year? I don't
understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame Rowland? How many people can walk away from the
richest deal offered by a state to an owner in the history of
sports?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Bob Kraft did Friday, and he deserves all of the
credit in the world for doing it.
</P>
<P>
   No deal anywhere, in any sport, was more lucrative than the one
Rowland put on the line.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the day, Kraft stayed here for short money.
The Massachusetts deal is just about the worst any owner has had to
accept to stay put in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's hope that everyone involved on this end lives up to
their word. The NFL. The state. The local business community. Gov.
Cellucci, Tom Birmingham, and Tom Finneran all deserve credit for
opening the door for Kraft to come back and keep the franchise
where it has been for the past 40 years, and where it should be for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Kraft has proven for the second time that it is not
about the money, it is time for the state to act as expeditiously
as possible to move this project forward. Time is money in the
construction industry, and the sooner a project starts, the less it
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when he purchased the team from James B. Orthwein
(who wanted to move it to St. Louis), Kraft turned down millions to
let the Patriots get out of their lease in Foxoboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like him personally, or whether you like the way he
has run his football team, it shouldn't make any difference. He
deserves all the credit he can get for passing on the money, and
for he way he did it. Kraft could have carried it out, gone to the
league meeting, and made the NFL owners vote him down, which would
have taken some of the heat off him. But he didn't. He took
whatever is coming from Connecticut on himself, even though it was
personally distasteful to turn down Rowland, who had treated him so
well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hidden hero in the Foxboro Stadium play is Dan Rooney, owner
of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney orchestrated the entire move to get the Boston business
community to work with the NFL to get the state leaders to approve
the plan. Why Rooney? Although he is a Pittsburgh native, he loves
Boston. As president of the Ireland Fund across America, Rooney has
become very good friends with most of the top business leaders in
the city. Boston raises more money each year than any other city in
America for the Ireland Fund, which distributes it to need
organizations all across Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk was brought in by commissioner Paul Tagliabue to head
the Boston business push. Kirk and Tagliabue became friends years
ago when Kirk was heading up the Democratic National Committee in
Washington and Tagliabue was working for a top law firm there at
the time. However, it was Rooney who was quarterbacking the deal
from long distance to keep the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From one well-traveled NFL owner this week: ``If Connecticut
keeps the deal alive, some other team will move there. I don't know
what team, but with all of that money on the table, someone not in
good financial shape will go after it. With the way this league is
giving out bonuses now, you need to have a ready supply of cash to
compete, and that's what this Hartford deal would do for any
team.''

ANTITRUST DIVISION PROBES TOP INVESTMENT BANKS' IPO FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government has started an investigation
into the way some of Wall Street's largest investment firms set the
fees they charge companies to sell their stock to the public in
initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's Antitrust Division blanketed the
financial community's most prestigious securities houses with
subpoenas Thursday for information about the fees for initial
public offerings, the companies' lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said, ``The
Antitrust Division is looking at the possibility of anticompetitive
practices in the underwriting services for initial public
offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry follows a wave of public offerings, particularly of
high technology and Internet companies. Last year 374 companies
went public, raising nearly $37 billion, according to Securities
Data Co. By contrast, in 1990, 172 companies raised $4.5 billion
when they went public.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the subpoenas was disclosed in documents filed
Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co., which is preparing to go public Tuesday and raise more
than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said it had received a subpoena from the Justice
Department ``requesting information with respect to its
investigation of an alleged conspiracy among securities
underwriters to fix underwriting fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Goldman said they did not expect the subpoena
would affect its plans to go public.
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of the Justice Department inquiry was far broader
than just Goldman. Lawyers and executives involved in the cases
said that the list of subpoena recipients included Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Credit
Suisse First Boston, Lehman Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, in its initial stages, surprised Wall Street
executives who have already denied accusations in a related civil
lawsuit that they conspired to set a standardized fee. Studies have
shown that Wall Street firms typically charge about 7 percent for
smaller public offerings of up to $80 million, and less for the
larger ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were genuinely shocked that Justice took this on,'' said an
executive at one of the larger firms that received a subpoena this
week.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for another firm said it was ``a true mystery'' why the
Justice Department's Antitrust Division had felt compelled to get
involved in a market that he said ``remains very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department inquiry follows a series of private
class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders against 25 of the
nation's largest and smaller securities firms that were recently
consolidated in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   That case, filed by the New York law firm of Kirby McInerney &AMP;
Squire, accuses the underwriters of violating Section 1 of the
Sherman Antitrust Act and various provisions of the Clayton Act by
conspiring to keep the fee that underwriters charge companies
issuing stock at a nearly uniform fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fee is a major source of underwriters' profits and has
been called, `the last bastion of the clubby cigar-smoking world of
investment banking,''' the law firm said in a civil complaint filed
in March. ``The underwriter fee for IPO offerings in the United
States is uniformly 7 percent. This uniformity cannot be justified
on the basis of costs and risks and would not exist in a
competitive market free of collusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also quotes from a 1997 article in The Wall Street
Journal quoting the head of underwriting at one investment bank
saying, ``The fact is, we'd be cutting our own throats to compete
on price.'' It notes that in foreign countries, where there is even
greater risk to the underwriters, fees may be as low as 3 percent
or 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large numbers of underwriters competing for business in
IPO offerings, and the healthy economy and stock market of the last
six years, should have resulted, in our highly developed and
extraordinarily efficient securities markets, in lower and more
competitively negotiated fees,'' the complaint said. ``In fact, as
the demand for IPO securities has increased and underwriter risk
has decreased, the percentage fees on IPO securities have held
constant.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice McInerney, a lawyer who helped draft the civil complaint,
said the shareholders had been harmed by the collusive efforts of
the underwriters because the value of their stock is diminished by
the size of the fee.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers representing the underwriters have disputed that
claim. Earlier this week, they moved to dismiss the case, partly on
the theory that shareholders do not have standing to bring a
lawsuit under federal antitrust laws because they are neither
competitors nor direct purchasers of underwriting services. In
court papers, the defense lawyers noted that not a single company
that has issued stock had joined the case.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers also argued that the mere existence of
similar pricing by the underwriters does not prove any collusion to
violate antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs have failed to allege any facts that, if proven,
would be sufficient to establish concerted action,'' the defense
lawyers wrote in their brief seeking to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs, instead, rely on conclusory allegations that
unspecified meetings were held through which prices were allegedly
fixed and agreements enforced. But they do not allege a single fact
that lends even an inference of concerted action or any overt act
in furtherance of the conspiracy by any of the 25 named defendants,
many of which were not even syndicate members in the offerings in
which plaintiffs participated.''

EVEN JUSTICES UNSURE ABOUT DISABILITY LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, May 2) 
 
(Eds.: Subs 4th graf to correct to Albertsons Inc. supermarket
chain) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A one-eyed truck driver, a mechanic on medication
for high-blood pressure and twin sisters who wear eyeglasses tried
to persuade the Supreme Court last week that they had been
illegally rejected for jobs because of those disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   At question was whether Congress, in passing the 1990 Americans
with Disabilities Act, intended to protect from job discrimination
only the most severely disabled or a much broader range of people,
including those with minor, treatable impairments.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by their questions and comments during arguments in the
three cases, the justices themselves are uncertain of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The three cases involve Albertsons Inc. supermarket chain,
United Parcel Service Inc. and United Air Lines Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA, a civil rights act for the disabled, has divided the
business and disability rights communities ever since it was first
being debated in Congress 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Companies continue to fear that the law's prohibition on bias
against the disabled will compel them to hire people even with the
most minor ailments, lest the businesses be sued for
discrimination. But advocates for the disabled counter that only a
strong anti-discrimination law, one that covers the gamut of
infirmities, will remove the entrenched stereotype that disabled
people are unable or unwilling to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last week took a tentative step into this
breach between employers and employees, with justices echoing the
companies' anxiety about increased litigation and the advocates'
fear that invidious stereotypes will persist unless the law is
interpreted broadly.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, in each of the cases, pressed the employees'
lawyers on why their clients with common afflictions should be
protected under the statute. But the justices just as vigorously
asked company lawyers whether their clients perhaps ran afoul of
the law by regarding the employees and job applicants as disabled
and, hence, unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in particular, expressed concern that a
broad interpretation of ``disability'' _ one that would include
easily treatable impairments _ would enable every rejected job
applicant and fired employee to sue under the law. ``This statute
wasn't meant to apply to all Americans,'' Scalia said during
arguments in a case that addressed whether Boise, Idaho-based
Albertsons was justified in firing a driver with vision in only one
eye.
</P>
<P>
   But disability rights advocates, in contrast to Scalia's
comment, do seek an interpretation of the law that would embrace
infirmities that can be remedied with corrective lenses or
medicine. The groups argue that the law's goal of debunking
stereotypes about the disabled can best be achieved if the statute
applies to all Americans whose abilities are limited due to
physical or mental impairments.
</P>
<P>
   ``By expanding the class of individuals (covered by the law),
you are assuring that people with high blood pressure, back
problems or severe myopia have the same opportunities that the rest
of us have in the workplace,'' said Patricia Yeager, executive
director of the California Foundation for Independent Living
Centers. ``This is about ending discrimination and leveling the
playing field, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which supported the employees in the
three cases, argued before the high court that disabilities should
be judged on a case-by-case basis regardless of how easily they can
be treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assessing the existence of a disability without regard to
mitigating measures is most consistent with the ADA's basic purpose
to eliminate the exclusion of individuals from the workplace
because of outdated stereotypes and myths about those individuals'
abilities,'' the government argued in a legal brief to the
justices.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bokat, a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
conceded that Congress intended the disability rights law to
protect many Americans from discrimination, but not those with
minor afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress intended to only have the act apply to people whose
disabilities substantially interfere with major life activities,''
Bokat said. Lawmakers never meant for the law to cover
``practically everyone in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law to end discrimination against the disabled was
modeled after federal civil rights statutes designed to abolish
bias against minorities and women. The act prohibits employers of
at least 15 people from discriminating against disabled workers and
job applicants, defined in the law as people with a disability that
``substantially limits'' their ability to perform a major life
function, such as walking or seeing.
</P>
<P>
   The statute also prohibits companies from discriminating against
employees and applicants whom the employers regard as disabled. But
the act is largely silent on the breadth of the term
``disability,'' leaving it primarily to the courts to define the
law's contours.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, during the argument sessions last
week, called the law ``unusual'' in that it is a civil rights act
in which neither the employer nor employee can be sure the worker
enjoys the statute's protection. Other civil rights laws _ which
protect minorities, women and older workers _ cover physical
characteristics, such as skin color, that are easily identifiable,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor indicated that the confusing
issue of what constitutes a disability might be irrelevant under
the law. The real question judges must answer in resolving whether
someone has suffered discrimination under the act is whether a
company illegally regarded that person as disabled.
</P>
<P>
   What an employer thinks about the physical or psychological
fitness of an employee or candidate ``really hits at the heart of
what the statute was aimed at,'' O'Connor said, noting that the law
seeks to end stereotypes about disabled employees. O'Connor made
her comment during arguments in the case of Vaughn Murphy, who
suffers from hypertension and was fired from his job as a mechanic
for Atlanta-based UPS, a position that requires driving company
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the three Supreme Court cases concerned employment in
the transportation industry, the justices asked, often with humor,
whether the disability rights law also applies to them and baseball
players. Scalia, for example, said he is ``close to blind'' but
does not consider himself disabled because his vision is corrected
with glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not do my current job, I could not do many other jobs,
without my glasses,'' the justice said during arguments in the UPS
case. ``A lot of Americans wear glasses and couldn't function
without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter, in a separate case, also addressed the
relevance of poor vision in questioning how substantial a
disability must be before it is protected under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have difficulty reading restaurant checks in dim light,''
Souter said. He jokingly added that waiters regard this impairment
as substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Souter's comments came in a case brought by Karen Sutton and
Kimberly Hinton, twin sisters who say Chicago-based United violated
the ADA by refusing to hire them as pilots because their vision,
without corrective lenses, fails to meet the airline's safety
standard.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments in the United case, Scalia said the company's
refusal to hire the women might not have been due to their alleged
disability. Rather, the airline might have rejected them because
they were unqualified to be pilots based on their failure to pass a
legitimate vision test, Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The justice, using a baseball analogy to illustrate his point,
said the Boston Red Sox could legally choose Hall-of-Fame slugger
Ted Williams _ the last player to hit over .400 for a season _ over
another hitter with inferior vision without running afoul of the
disability rights law. The Red Sox could not be held liable for
discrimination when they merely opted to retain a player whose
ability to hit, for whatever reason, was better than another's,
Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Souter, picking up on Scalia's theme: ``If there's a .400
hitter out there, I don't want to hire a .200 hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The employers in the three cases are urging the court to read
the ADA narrowly, to count as disabled only those employees whose
disabilities, even after treatment, substantially limit their
ability to perform a major life function. The employees, by
contrast, are pressing for a broad definition that includes workers
whose disabilities, before treatment, are substantially limiting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Albertsons case, Hallie Kirkingburg contends
the company illegally fired him as a truck driver because he is
blind in one eye. The U.S. District Court for Oregon dismissed the
lawsuit, saying Kirkingburg had failed to meet federal vision
regulations for truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, saying that
Kirkingburg is certainly disabled in the major life activity of
seeing and that the company regarded him as disabled. The 9th
Circuit, noting that the Federal Highway Administration had granted
Kirkingburg a waiver from its vision standard, told the district
court to hold a trial to determine if he is qualified to drive a
truck regardless of his disability.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy alleges that UPS violated the rights law when it fired
him after a company nurse concluded that his unmedicated blood
pressure of 160/90 exceeded federal guidelines for truck drivers.
The U.S. District Court for Kansas and then the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled against Murphy, saying he is not disabled
because his blood pressure is treatable with medication.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Hinton argue that United illegally rejected them to
be pilots because of their poor vision, even though their sight is
fine when they wear corrective lenses. But the U.S. District Court
for Colorado, followed by the 10th Circuit, ruled for the airline
after concluding that the women are not disabled but merely have a
visual impairment that can be corrected with lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decisions in the three
cases by July.

STOCK PRICES FALL AT END OF ROBUST MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Signs that a bustling economy might finally produce a
long-feared bout of inflation sent stock and bond prices tumbling
Friday. But the spring revival of cyclical stocks was still strong
enough to push the Dow Jones industrial average to a gain of 10.2
percent in April, the biggest monthly gain in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this year, traders have remained satisfied that the
economy, while strong, would continue its path of moderate,
noninflationary growth. But their hopes were fractured, if not
shattered, Friday morning when the Commerce Department reported
that a key inflation indicator rose sharply in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That led traders first to sell bonds, then stocks. The price of
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 28/32, to 94 5/32. The
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose Friday to
5.66 percent from 5.52 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stock followed bonds lower, with the Dow Jones industrial
average falling 89.34 points, or eigth-tenths of 1 percent, to
10,789.04. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.65, or
six-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,335.18.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market had spent much of the morning shrugging off the
Commerce Department's report that the economy grew at an annual
rate of 4.5 percent in the first quarter, faster than the 3.4
percent rate that many economists expected. By noon the Dow
industrial average, which barely a month ago passed the 10,000
level, had gained 83 points and was only 40 points below the 11,000
mark.
</P>
<P>
   The worries of bond traders, however, carried the day. Bond
market participants said they were particularly unnerved by the
rise in an indicator known as the GDP price deflator, which
measures inflation across the economy. The deflator rose at a 1.4
annual rate in the first quarter, well above the 1 percent rate
that was expected and the fastest rise since 1997's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bond markets were further weakened at about 12:30 p.m. by a
spate of heavy selling in the bond futures market. That decline, in
turn, finally convinced stock traders that there might be something
to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m., the Dow industrials had fallen nearly 300 points from
their peak and were down 200 for the day. Cyclical stocks like
Alcoa succumbed to a quick round of profit taking. Despite
finishing the day down 2 7/16, at 62\, Alcoa gained 51 percent in
April, making it the month's biggest gainer in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   A rebound in the last half hour of the session retraced some of
the losses in the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500. And with technology and
Internet stocks again leading the way, the Nasdaq composite index
moved back into the black, gaining 14.41, or six-tenths of 1
percent, to 2,542.85.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Friday's drop, the Dow had a remarkable month. Powered
by a surge in stocks of cyclical companies like Caterpillar, which
rose 40 percent in April, and International Paper, which gained 26
percent, the bellwether industrial average gained more than 10
percent, its best monthly showing since January 1987, when it rose
13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last three years, cyclical stocks have lagged
behind the more popular technology and consumer-product shares that
have been favorites of mutual fund managers and individual
investors. But the cyclical stocks perked up in the first quarter
as it became evident that last year's robust growth had in all
likelihood carried over into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've definitely had a broadening of the market, with a lot
more stocks participating in the gains,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, of
Birinyi Associates, regarding the Dow's outstanding April
performance. ``While some cyclicals, like Georgia-Pacific and
United Technologies, have been doing OK, they've recently attracted
new buyers,'' whose additional interest has added to the gains.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Dow also benefited from a strong performance by its two
biggest technology components, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. On the
strength of better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, IBM gained
18 percent in April, Friday rising 4], to 209 3/16. Hewlett-Packard
gained 16 percent for the month, Friday rising {, to 78~.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, energy stocks, long in the doldrums, perked up as oil
prices rose and the approach of the summer driving season pushed up
gasoline prices. Exxon, for example, rose nearly 18 percent in
April, even after losing 1 7/16, to 83 1/16 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   YPF, the Argentine oil company which on Thursday received a
takeover offer from Repsol, Spain's largest oil producer, rose 7
15/16 Friday, to 43~. But most of the other big gainers on the last
day of the month were technology stocks. Cisco Systems jumped 4~,
to 114 1/16, and Apple Computer rose 3, to 46.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks, which two weeks ago underwent a sharp but brief
selloff, rallied again, with some hitting new highs. Infospace.com,
whose network of Web sites provide phone listings, maps, stock
quotes and other information, rose 24 11/16, to 143 5/16, after
reporting a smaller-than-expected loss for the first quarter. And
Priceline.com, which sells airline tickets over the Internet,
jumped 24 9/16, to 162].

 &HT;    NATO LAUNCHES HEAVIEST BOMBING YET, MILOSEVIC USES DIPLOMATIC
CHARM
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-REFUGEES-0501.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defiant in the face of the most withering NATO
attacks yet, Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic vowed Friday that
he would ``never surrender'' to U.S. and allied demands for placing
a NATO-led peacekeeping force in the embattled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Milosevic laid out his own terms for ending the
conflict -- a proposal immediately rejected by the United States --
and retaliated with a charm offensive, allowing the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to visit with three American soldiers held captive by
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling pretty healthy, a little mentally drained,'' one
prisoner, Army Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, told
Jackson during a session broadcast by the Cable News Network (CNN).
``Really miss home and hope to be back soon.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN aired some 20 minutes of Yugoslav-censored footage showing
the soldiers -- clean-shaven, in fair spirits and, by all
indications, relatively good health -- meeting and chatting with
Jackson, who brought them each a bible and words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was scheduled to meet Saturday with Milosevic, but the
White House has insisted, publicly at least, that Jackson bears no
message from President Clinton and is on a strictly personal
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's visit is being conducted against the backdrop of the
most intensive air strikes since NATO launched its campaign on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   After flying more than 600 sorties and dropping an estimated 300
bombs Thursday night and early Friday, the alliance was taking
advantage of clear skies to plan at least as many missions
overnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding mightily to NATO's firepower, 10 B-52 Stratofortress
heavy bombers were scheduled to fly from U.S. air bases Friday
night, to join the NATO armada with a scheduled arrival at a
British air field on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sounded Friday evening in Belgrade, cutting
short Jackson's visit with the captives, as NATO bombs struck again
at military targets across Yugoslavia and fielded forces inside
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attacks on fielded forces have intensified,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea, describing furious allied strikes early
Friday on command posts, tanks, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft
weapons and even individual tanker cars, two of which were
destroyed Thursday night as they sat stranded on railroad tracks
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With a month of heavy cloud cover lifting, Shea said, Serb
forces in Kosovo would find it difficult to hide from the aerial
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``As spring gives way to summer and despite the excellent use of
camouflage and deception techniques,'' Shea told reporters at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, ``their destruction becomes
inescapable.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO tightened its noose, Milosevic offered to reduce his
forces inside Kosovo to some 12,000 troops, if NATO would withdraw
its forces from the bordering nations of Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do it in one week,'' Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic rejected a key element of NATO's terms, however,
saying he would accept lightly-armed United Nations monitors but
not a military peacekeeping force made up by his country's
attackers, even if holding out means accepting prolonged and
escalating air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more day (of bombing) is too much,'' Milosevic said in an
interview with the United Press International news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what choice do we have if NATO insists on occupying
Yugoslavia? To that we will never surrender,'' Milosevic said. ``We
Serbs are as one on this life and death issue of national honor and
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, said his country stood no
chance of prevailing militarily against NATO, but he said he was
heartened by the U.S. aversion to American casualties and the
emerging resistance in Congress to support the ongoing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed his country as a victim of NATO aggression,
insisted that Serb army troops had not committed widespread
atrocities in Kosovo but conceded that heavy handed methods had
been employed by paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials blame Milosevic for overseeing a
campaign that has resulted in the execution of at least 4,000
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and has left another 1.5 million
homeless over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not angels,'' Milosevic said. ``Nor are we the devils
you have made us out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said he would admit lightly-armed United Nations
monitors into Kosovo, but not a military force made up of his
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to accept a U.N. presence and are ready to
negotiate its composition,'' Milosevic said in the UPI interview.
``But please understand that after all those crimes
</P>
<P>
   against our nation and its people, we cannot accept
representatives of the countries that committed aggression against
us. We would like to see representatives of neutral countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was immediately rejected by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for the people of Serbia,'' said State
Department spokesman James Rubin, ``that plan was not serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its NATO allies have insisted on NATO-led
peacekeepers being allowed into Kosovo as a central demand to a
halt in the bombing. Milosevic's plan appeared to fall into the
category U.S. officials have consistently characterized as an
effort to try to split the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's televised visit marked the first time the American
soldiers have been shown on camera since state-run television in
Yugoslavia showed footage of them April 1, with bruised faces and
downcast eyes, the day after Serb forces captured them near
Kosovo's border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The men said they were fed three square meals a day, were housed
separately in small cells with a bed and table and were visited
regularly by Yugoslav officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's adequate,'' said Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of
Smiths Creek, Mich., who turned toward the camera at one point to
address his wife and four-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my wife Tricia and my son Ryan, 'I love you,''' Stone said,
welling up with tears before breaking out with a broad grin.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told Gonzales, ``You are a hero. People know about you
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning toward the camera, Gonzales delivered an impromptu
message to the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks everybody, for all your thoughts and all your
prayers,'' he said. ``They've been needed and they're a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson prepared to meet with the third captive, Staff Sgt.
Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, air raid sirens sounded and
Jackson's Yugoslav hosts told him the exchange would have to be cut
short for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, wearing a dark three-piece suit, white shirt and tie,
urged the men to consider how prison terms had strengthened the
will of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., South
African apartheid foe Nelson Mandela and even the New Testament
Apostle Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people around the world are praying for you and
they're praying for reconciliation so we can all live in peace
together,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can have the tailwind push them, but sometimes in life
there are headwinds and crosswinds and nobody can see the wind,''
said Jackson, admonishing the captives to ``turn pain into power
and use this time wisely . . . time to write, time to think and
time to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is scheduled to meet Saturday with Milosevic, told
reporters after the meeting with the American soldiers, ``Our
country should be proud of them.''

 &HT;    South faces strict rules as smog there grows
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Sunday, May 2
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hazy days. Air thick enough to gag on.
</P>
<P>
   The grimy byproducts of mechanized America once hung primarily
over the industrial Northeast and sprawling Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Deep South, cities inundated by new residents,
factories, roads and cars also mark the start of smog season. From
Charlotte, N.C. to Birmingham, Ala., Atlanta to Augusta, the South
goes on alert for ground-level ozone _ the main ingredient in smog.
</P>
<P>
   Areas with too much ozone, which can cause breathing problems
and damage plants, receive the dreaded ``nonattainment'' stamp from
the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Nonattainment
potentially prohibits areas from spending federal money on road
projects until their air is cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   The South's poster child for bad air is Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But other cities, because of stricter federal guidelines this
year, may join Atlanta on the dirty air list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're predicting large numbers of new nonattainment areas,''
said Linda Anderson-Carnahan, chief of the EPA's Air Planning
branch for eight Southern states. ``Rapid growth in the South is
really generating this. More people need more electricity. Making
electricity causes pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   And dirty air spreads beyond big cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee and North Carolina, the Great Smoky Mountains are
becoming the Great Smoggies. Last summer, the national park
recorded 43 days of unhealthy air. Atlanta last year exceeded the
federal ozone standard 22 times.
</P>
<P>
   An advocacy group for national parks lists the Smokies as one of
the 10 most endangered parks in the federal system. Pollutants from
power plants and factories in neighboring states blow through the
Smokies, said Don Barger, Southeast Regional Director for the
National Parks and Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to illustrate the most extreme threats,'' Barger
said, ``and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is that in
relation to air pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, the view on a clear day from a park peak averaged
92 miles. Today, it is 22 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-level ozone is a low-altitude version of its helpful,
high-atmosphere cousin. In the stratosphere, ozone screens out
harmful sunlight. Low-level haze emerges when small particles of
pollution and natural matter get baked by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's new ozone rules allow lower amounts of ground-level
ozone, but measurements are taken for a longer period _ 8 hours now
compared to 1 hour last year.
</P>
<P>
   That puts even small cities on the bubble. In Georgia, Augusta,
Columbus and Macon may fall into nonattainment when the EPA issues
new designations in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Former ozone violators Memphis, Knoxville and Nashville in
Tennessee have cleaned their air within the last six years. So have
Charlotte, Greensboro and Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina. In
Florida, Jacksonville and Miami came clean in 1995 followed in 1996
by Tampa-St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   But ozone in those areas may climb over new limits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, a marginal nonattainment city, exceeded healthy
ozone limits just five times last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may change this year with the tighter, 8-hour
standards,'' said Sam Bell, who helps monitor the Ozone Action
Program in metro Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Around Baton Rouge, La., the area has violated ozone caps the
entire decade. Petrochemical plants and oil refineries along the
Mississippi River contribute to the air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry plays a large part,'' said Steve Murrell, an air
monitor for Louisiana's Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   When ozone reaches unhealthy levels, environmental experts
suggest telecommuting, carpooling and postponing activities like
mowing lawns and pumping gas. Some communities, including metro
Atlanta, ban homeowners and developers from outdoor burning from
May 1 through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce car emissions, gas stations in Atlanta and Birmingham
soon will dispense a low-sulfur fuel this season. The new gasoline
helps a vehicle's catalytic converter more efficiently remove
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA also mandated that 22 states _ including Alabama,
Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky _
reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides they emit. Alabama and the
Carolinas are suing the EPA over the mandate, disputing the
assertion they are causing pollution downwind.
</P>
<P>
   Factories and power plants with high smoke stacks release
so-called ``NOx'' gases, an ingredient in ground-level ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Gottschalk, an air quality manager for the Georgia
Environmental Protection Division, said power plants can use a
chemical process that ``destroys nitrogen oxides before they come
out of the stacks.''
</P>
<P>
   When the NOx elimination plan is fully implemented in 2003,
smaller cities may return to ozone compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the better steps in the right direction,'' said
the National Parks and Conservation Association's Barger. ``It will
have far-reaching effects.

BAFFERT OK IN OAKS, TOO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Bob Baffert scratched Excellent Meeting from
the Kentucky Oaks, then watched her barnmate Silverbulletday score
an expected easy victory in front of an Oaks-record 101,034 fans at
Churchill Downs on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pegram's Silverbulletday, never whipped by jockey Gary
Stevens, got the lead on the turn and beat Dreams Galore by three
lengths for her 10th victory in 11 lifetime starts.
</P>
<P>
   The 1[-mile time (1:49.92) was far from a record. But
Silverbulletday's superiority over the six others in the so-called
fillies' derby was reflected in her 1-10 odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the toughest race to win _ when you're expected to,''
Baffert said afterward. ``I probably felt more pressure than I will
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   Today, three Baffert horses, including Excellent Meeting, will
try to give him a record third straight Derby victory and make him
the first trainer to win the Oaks and Derby in the same year since
Ben Jones in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and owners John and Betty Mabee had entered Excellent
Meeting in the Oaks and Derby. The trainer announced Friday morning
the filly will go in the Derby. He thinks she has the size and
stamina to win the 1\-mile race and wasn't as sure of
Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 124-year history of the Derby, three fillies have won.
</P>
<P>
   Yer out: Aljabr, the lesser half of the Dubai-owned entry, was
scratched from the Derby. A Kentucky Racing Commission official
said the colt was lame.
</P>
<P>
   Aljabr was to have started from post 5, so each horse from 6 up
moves closer to the rail.
</P>
<P>
   Where to bet: Hollywood Park will open its gates at 7:30 a.m.
and take bets on the entire Churchill Downs card, which starts at 8
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby is scheduled for 2:27 p.m. PDT.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Park races start at noon.

JACKSON DENIED IN BID TO FREE THREE US SOLDIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They prayed for morning to come after their ``long,
dark night'' of captivity. They expressed love for their families.
And after 30 days of solitary confinement in a Yugoslav military
prison, one of the three US soldiers issued a touching apology to
his parents amid the horror of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry I put you through so much pain and agony,'' Army
Specialist Steven M. Gonzales said Friday as his Serb captors
permitted a poignant, videotaped visit by the Rev. Jesse Jackson
with the American prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, stymied in his attempt to free the captive soldiers,
instead brought them Bibles and messages of hope, as he huddled
briefly with the prisoners in a military courtroom in Belgrade
under the constant scrutiny of Serb authorities and a military
judge.
</P>
<P>
   In a rarity of military conflict made possible by modern
technology, videotaped images of the encounter were quickly beamed
around the world, as the soldiers presented themselves as ordinary
men trying to summon the strength to endure their grim ordeal. Serb
military officers cut short the visit when air-raid sirens began to
blare.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my wife Tricia and my son Ryan, I love you,'' said Staff
Sergeant Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., when
asked if he had a message for his family. Stone's face then grew
red and his eyes filled with tears, according to a pool report.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, appeared to have found
solace in Bible verses his parents had sent him through the
International Committee of the Red Cross. ``Thanks for those you
sent,'' he said. ``I know them by heart. I recite them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his face remained bruised from injuries he suffered
during his capture a month ago, the third prisoner, Staff Sergeant
Andrew A. Ramirez, assured his family he was well. ``I feel pretty
good actually,'' said Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The servicemen told Jackson they have been segregated from each
other and confined to one-room cells since shortly after they were
captured during a routine patrol near Macedonia's border with
Yugoslavia on March 31. They are the only NATO troops to have been
captured since the airstrikes against Serb forces began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no contact,'' Stone said. But he said they have been
allowed to exercise regularly and eat adequately.
</P>
<P>
   All three soldiers, still clad in the camouflage fatigues they
were wearing when captured, said they were in good physical health
and hopeful for their freedom. They met individually with Jackson
and as a group. At one point, they all smiled at the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great sense of honor for what they are doing for
the country,'' Jackson said told reporters after the visit. ``They
met us today with a great sense of dignity, and their youth
generation should be proud of them, and our country should be proud
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House had discouraged Jackson from
undertaking the mission, expressing concerns for his safety and the
prospect that his visit could be used for anti-American propaganda,
the Pentagon credited Jackson for visiting the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contact with the Rev. Jackson is helpful to the POWs, and
it's a good sign,'' spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said Friday. He
renewed the US demand that Yugoslavia release the servicemen on the
grounds that they were not involved in a hostile mission and were
abducted illegally.
</P>
<P>
   With their heads bowed and Jackson's arms around them, the
soldiers prayed with him during the visit. The tape, censored by
Serb authorities, showed Jackson telling the captive soldiers:
``Even though it's dark and stormy, if we hold onto our faith, the
storm will pass away and night will give to day.''
</P>
<P>
   He implored them ``use the time to reflect and think and pray
and be grateful.'' He prayed for their families ``to know that we
are alive and healthy and help is on the way, hope is in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said later that he urged the soldiers ``to hold onto
until the morning cometh because it has been for them a long, dark
night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taught in scripture,'' he explained, that ``weeping may
endureth for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said their ``spirits were lifted'' by the visit. ``They felt
quite good about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's mother, Vivian Ramirez, said she hoped Jackson's visit
will help bolster her son's resolve during the ordeal. In an
interview with CNN, she said she is certain her son ``will hang in
there now that he has gotten our letters and knows everybody in the
whole United States is behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing him on television, Mrs. Ramirez said, ``He's
looking really good.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Democratic presidential candidate in 1984, Jackson traveled
to Syria and secured the release of Navy Lieutenant Robert O.
Goodman Jr., whose jet was shot down during a raid over Syrian
anti-aircraft positions in Lebanon. He also secured freedom for
prisoners in Iraq and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he was accompanied to the prison by Representative Rod
R. Blagojevich, an Illinois Democrat who serves on the House
National Security Committee, and several journalists.
</P>
<P>
   To their dismay, members of a delegation of US religious leaders
were not allowed on the visit with the soldiers. The list of
delegates includes the Rev. Raymond G. Helmick of Boston College,
and Landrum R. Bolling, who is associated with the Conflict
Management Group and Mercy Corps International in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Before Jackson's visit, Yugoslavia's Assistant Foreign Minister
Nebojsa Vujovic met with the soldiers, then told reporters ``their
release is not on the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the delegation will be able to see them and assure
themselves they are in good health,'' Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
   In stronger terms, Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic insisted
Jackson had no chance of fulfilling his hope of securing the
servicemen's release. ``We outlasted Hitler's bombing,'' Jovanovic
said. ``We survived Soviet pressure ... and we are not going to
capitulate to NATO bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before visiting the soldiers, Jackson, who hopes to meet
Saturday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, toured the
scene of an errant NATO missile raid that struck a residential
neighborhood of Belgrade, reportedly killing three civilians and
injuring 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing cannot be a solution,'' said Jackson, who appeared
visibly upset by the destruction. ``But the same goes for the
forceful displacement of ethnic Albanians from their homes in
Kosovo.''

 &HT;    Pranks, absenteeism mar school week in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A fearful week of pranks, high absenteeism and arrests
at Atlanta schools continued Friday with more commotion but no
serious incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb scares prompted the evacuation Friday of Chattahoochee and
Milton high schools in north Fulton County, Forest Park High and
Babb Middle School in Forest Park, Shiloh High near Snellville and
North Cobb High. At each school but Shiloh, no device was found.
</P>
<P>
   At Shiloh, pipes and wires in a paper bag were found behind a
toilet in a boys' restroom, leading administrators to evacuate
students to the gym. The Gwinnett County bomb squad exploded the
item.
</P>
<P>
   In Douglas County, 28 students and one adult have been arrested
for making terroristic threats at schools since the April 20
Colorado massacre. The first student was arrested the day after the
killings when he arrived at Chestnut Log Middle School dressed in a
black trench coat, boasting of having a ``hit list'' of people he
planned to kill. As many as 15 students appeared in Douglas County
Juvenile Court on Friday to face the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these kids have really done damage to their academic
careers,'' said assistant superintendent Donald Remillard, noting
that the students could be expelled or forced to attend an
alternative school.
</P>
<P>
   At Chattahoochee High, the bomb squad was called when a student
heard a ticking sound in a locker. It turned out to be a
voice-activated tape recorder that had inadvertently turned on and
run out of tape.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, days of frightening rumors ended without incident at
Collins Hill High School in Suwanee, where word had spread that
another student ``hit list'' would be acted on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The recurring threats have fueled widespread alarm among
students and parents, many of whom already were on edge following
the slayings last week of 12 high school students and a teacher in
Littleton, Colo. The Atlanta incidents echo similar scares across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the anxiety, absenteeism at area schools was high
Friday, including 51 percent at Woodstock Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Police and school officials have been scrambling to chase down
the rumors and threats.
</P>
<P>
   Punishing the culprits is one way to slow the spate of
anti-social behavior, said John E. Williams, a social psychologist
at Georgia State University. That way students understand they they
cannot pull off these stunts with impunity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County police arrested Eric Lee Williams after he was
accused of calling in a bomb threat that forced the evacuation of
Chapel Hill Middle School on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged the 25-year-old Decatur man with making
terroristic threats and he was incarcerated at the county jail.
``He thought he was cute,'' said DeKalb school spokesman Spencer
Ragsdale, ``but now he's laughing through bars.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A nail-bomb ripped through a gay bar in London's Soho
district Friday night, killing at least two people and injuring 73
and leaving the city on edge after two other bomb attacks this
month in minority neighborhoods. The police said Friday that they
believed all three attacks were linked to extreme right-wing
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's fatalities were the first in the series of bombings
that started on April 17 in Brixton, a south London district with a
large Afro-Caribbean population, injuring 39, and moved last
Saturday to Brick Lane, in east London's Bangladeshi community,
wounding seven. Coupled with the still-unsolved murder this week of
a celebrity television presenter, Jill Dando, the attacks have
spread deep foreboding in this normally easy-going capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole community must feel threatened because it was clear
that if it was the black community first, it could be the Jewish
community next,'' said Angela Mason, spokeswoman for a gay and
lesbian rights group. ``Who knows where it's going to stop?''
</P>
<P>
   After extreme right-wing groups took responsibility for the
first two explosions, the police warned gay and lesbian groups that
they might also be targeted, according to Friday's edition of Pink
Paper, a gay newspaper. Paul Condon, head of London's Metropolitan
Police, told reporters Friday night that a London radio station had
received an anonymous telephone call from someone claiming the most
recent attack was carried out by the White Wolves, an offshoot of
the extreme right-wing Combat 18 that has issued threats against
black legislators. Both groups claimed responsibility for the
earlier bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they had no evidence to corroborate the claim of
the radio station. But Alan Fry, a senior anti-terrorist police
officer, said he was linking the three attacks. Like the earlier
two, he told reporters, Friday evening's blast had been caused by a
nail-bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb struck on a limpid spring evening with a breath of
summer in the air. The streets were thronged with thousands of
people anticipating a long, Bank holiday weekend in a district
known for its theaters, restaurants, clubs, sex-shops and bars.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene turned to carnage: 13 of the 73 injured were hurt
seriously and two of them had limbs torn away in the blast,
hospital officials said. ``This is a terrible outrage committed by
people who have no humanity whatever,'' said Jack Straw, Britain's
home secretary. ``We are dealing with people who have warped minds,
right-wing extremists who are obviously racist and homophobic. That
we know.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion went off at 6:37 p.m., the police said, at the
Admiral Duncan pub on the corner of Dean and Old Compton streets at
the start of a holiday weekend that, along with sudden, summer-like
weather, had drawn thousands of strollers, drinkers, foreign
tourists and theater-goers onto Soho's streets. The timing
coincided with what would normally be a relaxed, busy time with
thousands of Londoners stopping to socialize after work in advance
of the weekend. The owners of the Admiral Duncan _ Scottish and
Newscastle Breweries _ said there was no indication of a warning
before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the blast left the injured and dead flattened on
the sidewalk outside the pub. ``I thought they had been blown
apart,'' said James Fullum, an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath, wounded with blood running from arms
and faces staggered out of the Admiral Duncan, described by gay
rights advocates as a well-known and almost exclusively gay
meeting-place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the whole front blown out and bodies lying around in the
street,'' said Sean Given, the manager of another bar in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, Peter King, said, ``It reminded me of my
childhood during the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Londoners said the explosion revived memories of Irish
Republican Army bombings. ``Everyone is just very frightened about
what's going on,'' John Laycock, a restaurateur, told British
television.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Inside the pub, witnesses said people had been hurled to the
ground, their limbs askew. A hospital spokeswoman, Louise Boden,
told reporters most of the injured were young men suffering from
``burns, lacerations, the trauma of being thrown about. When a bomb
goes off, if it's near you, it shreds flesh. It's pretty horrible
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon, the London police chief, warned that no one should feel
immune from the bomb campaign. ``They might be targeting
minorities, but these are hate attacks on all of us. The impact of
these bombs will affect all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon made no specific reference to London's widely spread
Jewish population, but other police officers said Jewish groups had
been warned to be on their guard against the possibility of similar
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   For miles around, London's streets filled with the wailing of
sirens Friday night as officers in at least 30 ambulances, and many
police cars and fire engines, wove through densely packed Soho to
take away wounded, and seal off the area in case further bombs had
been planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of glass everywhere, and a lot of confusion and
a lot of walking wounded,'' said Martin Ireland, another witness,
shortly after the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came only hours after police announced they had
arrested a man suspected of responsibility for the Brixton bombing
following the release of photographs taken from closed circuit
television cameras that had overlooked the busy, Saturday afternoon
market. The man on the video images seemed to be in his late teens
or early 20s and wore a light-colored baseball cap. The police said
they believed he had been filmed while reconnoitering the area in
preparation for an attack.
</P>
<P>
   In both previous attacks, the bombs _ described by police as
crude, home-made devices combining explosives with scores of nails
_ were left in sports bags at crowded areas. The casualties last
weekend at Brick Lane, which has a large Asian population, were
lower because a man put the bag containing the bomb into the trunk
of his car to take it to safety at a police station. The targets of
the attack in racially mixed Brixton seemed to be black immigrants
from Britain's former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Some Londoners have speculated that the attacks may be connected
to Britain's participation in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The
execution-style murder of Ms. Dando, the television celebrity _
shot in broad daylight by a single bullet to the head outside her
home after she had spoken on air of the plight of Kosovo Albanian
refugees _ fanned the speculation about reprisals by Serbs. But
Condon said investigators were making no such connection.
</P>
<P>
   The groups that have claimed responsibility for the last two
explosions are called Combat 18 _ an extremist, right-wing group
named for the position in the alphabet of Adolf Hitler's initials _
and a more radical breakaway group called the White Wolves. Police
anti-terrorist experts have said the groups may consist of no more
than a handful of extremists operating in small, clandestine cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very small, elite Nazi operation,'' said Gerry Gable
of Searchlight, a private group opposed to violent racist groups.
``They hate black people, they hate gay people and they hate Jews.
They want to spread terror.''

DECISION MAKES BUSINESSMAN KRAFT MR. NICE GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Almost since he bought the New England Patriots in
1994, Robert Kraft has been engaged in a tug of war over his image.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's decision to choose Massachusetts over Connecticut,
Kraft did more than simply select a home for the team. He also took
a giant step in defining his public image, emphasizing the
soft-hearted public citizen over the hard-nosed businessman.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kraft insisted he was from the start.
</P>
<P>
   When he purchased the team, the Brookline native said he had
done it in no small part because he wanted to keep the franchise in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his boyhood disappointment when the Boston Braves left
town in 1953, Kraft said: ``It really impacts the psychology and
the fabric of the community, and this is my hometown and I just
believe this hometown wouldn't have been the same if this team had
left here.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't been the way critics have portrayed the
57-year-old businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Most pointed among them has been House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran, who variously denounced Kraft as ``a whining
multimillionaire'' and ``a fat-assed millionaire,'' a comment
Finneran later claimed was meant to apply to Baltimore Ravens owner
Art Modell.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, after a long, frustrating search for a new
Masschusetts home, Kraft announced he would take his team to
Connecticut, where the political establishment greeted him with
open arms, Finneran was scathing.
</P>
<P>
   `It is about nothing but money,'' the speaker charged.
``Expressions of loyalty to Massachusetts, affection for the fans .
. . is propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in word and deed, Bob Kraft demonstrated that that
accusation wasn't true. In doing so, he turned his back on what is,
by all measures, the most lucrative stadium deal in history of
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut offer would have paid off in ways Kraft could
have scarcely imagined before he opened negotiations with the
Nutmeg State. The state would have spent $374 million in public
money to build the stadium. When various revenue guarantees and
other perks were added in, the package would have been worth more
than $1 billion over 30 years, according to some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Massachusetts proposal, on which Kraft has
yet to comment, would require him to spend $250 million or so to
build the stadium _ though a recently approved funding mechanism
from the National Football League could dramatically reduce the
out-of-pocket hit. The Bay State would chip in $70 million for
public infrastructure improvements like roads, sewers, and
pedestrian ways.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some skeptics will say Kraft never intended to go,
that used Connecticut to get Massachusetts to make him an offer.
But others insist the Connecticut deal wasn't so much a matter of
``if'' as it was ``when.'' Even though the new Hartford stadium
would likely have not been ready until 2003, two years later than
originally planned, it will be a rush to get a new facility built
before then in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   By deciding to eschew Connecticut's offer, Kraft has made a
large statement about himself and his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking less money to keep the team here, he is making a
contribution to the community unlike any we have seen in a long
time,'' said Republican political consultant Charles Manning. ``I
think he will be seen as a public hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: status of that sort is important to the Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd, tough, and sometimes impolitic businessman he may be
in some endeavors, but as a football franchise owner, the man who
toured the field after victories in a golf cart and who gloried in
exchanging high-fives with Patriots fans, likes to be seen as a
good guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a gregarious guy who likes to be liked, and I think to
be liked in your own hometown is the most important thing,'' said
US Representative Joseph Moakley, who has known Kraft since his
days working in the office of then Senate President Maurice Donahue
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who last year negotiated
an agreement with Kraft much like the deal Beacon Hill leaders
okayed this week, also felt all along that Kraft's was motivated by
much more than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember an easier negotiation than the one I had with
Bob Kraft,'' Birmingham said of their 1998 talks. ``He clearly
wanted to get to `yes,' and he clearly was willing to sacrifice
more advantageous terms in other jurisdictions because he wanted to
keep the team in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham called Kraft's decision ``a credit to him,'' but
joked his family might not think so. ``I don't know what his heirs
will say about him taking the exit door,'' the Senate president
said. ``They are a family of substantial means right now, but they
would have been enriched greatly had the Hartford agreement come to
fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a conciliatory Finneran offered some praise. ``I think Mr.
Kraft deserves an awful lot of credit for making the decision that
he made,'' said the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Words of that sort will no doubt sound sweet to Kraft. In the
last several years, the Krafts, while readily pleading guilty to
accusations of political incompetence, have chafed under
accusations that they only care about the bottom line. For a family
that gives generously to charity, the mockery as money-grubbers,
like that which Finneran leveled at Kraft at this year's St.
Patrick's Day breakfast, has clearly stung.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, after Robert Kraft signed the deal to take the team
to Connecticut, his son Jonathan took two Globe reporters on a tour
of an elaborate mockup of the club seats and amenities the
organization had built in the basement of BankBoston to pitch their
aborted South Boston stadium plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our vision,'' Jonathan Kraft said wistfully. ``I just
hope it comes across how much effort we put in. It wasn't a fool's
errand. We wanted to spend our own money and keep the team here.''
</P>
<P>
   With his decision not to head to Hartford, Kraft showed that he
was sincere all along. In the end, he decided he'd rather earn
accolades from his home state than millions more from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   And in the debate over whether Kraft is just another bottom-line
businessman or a public citizen truly concerned about his
community, Friday's decision to remain in Massachusetts has to be
considered Exhibit A in support of Kraft as public citizen _ just
what he has said all along.

 &HT;    S.C. governor wants more cops in state's schools
 &HT;    By Lyn Riddle
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Gov. Jim Hodges wants $14 million to hire a
police officer for every secondary school in South Carolina to
``ensure that the tragedy in Colorado'' isn't repeated in his
state.
</P>
<P>
   The money would add 350 officers to the 170 already employed in
schools. In all, 33 of South Carolina's 46 counties have officers
in some schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question on the lips of every South Carolina parent right
now is `What are you going to do to make schools safer?''' Hodges
said.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal was met with enthusiastic support from law
enforcement, including the public safety director and the head of
the State Law Enforcement Division. Richland County Sheriff Leon
Lott said the 23 officers in schools there make schools safer.
</P>
<P>
   But educators say putting police in schools does not guarantee
safe buildings. Two police officers were on duty at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., last week, when two teens killed 12
students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to shy away from making our schools look like prisons
or holding pens,'' said Lenor Hersey, deputy executive director of
the National Association of Secondary School Principals.
</P>
<P>
   Her group has taken no position on stationing law enforcement
officers in schools and she knows of no definitive research done on
its effectiveness. But she believes that hiring police officers is
not a cure-all if a school does not implement programs to deal with
problems that arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy duty surveillance equipment and strutting uniforms
around can actually make the situation worse,'' she said. ``There
is no guarantee if they have a whole army that these incidents
won't erupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Brook, the governor's spokeswoman, said Hodges agrees a
total approach to school safety is needed. She pointed to Richland
County, where an officer is available to all schools, including
elementary schools, for assemblies, one-on-one meetings with
students and to help administrators identify troubled youngsters.
In addition, officers can get special training in dealing with
children from the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``School safety is a total package between parents, teachers and
law enforcement,'' Brook said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges made improving education his main campaign issue last
fall when he became the first Democratic governor in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler, a Republican, accused Hodges of
politicizing the issue. ``The fallen students in Colorado deserve
better than self-serving politicians scrambling to score political
points in the wake of the tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brook said the governor was responding to concerns he heard
in meetings around the state in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The governor believed he needed to act fast because the General
Assembly is working on the budget. Some legislators said the
request is too late to make it in this cycle, but Brook said the
governor believes otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total budget is $5 billion,'' she said. ``The General
Assembly surely can come up with $14 million if they want to make
South Carolina schools safe.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2)  
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A longtime fan of Manchester United, the English soccer team,
Steven A. Chamberlain, manager of the Invesco European fund, can do
something that most other sports enthusiasts can't: control a chunk
of the sports franchise he follows so passionately.
</P>
<P>
   But Chamberlain's strong affection for ``Man United'' is not the
reason he invests in it, or in the two other soccer clubs in his
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   As an aggressive, growth-oriented manager, he is focused on the
fact that soccer is the most popular sport in Britain and across
Europe, and that major clubs are reaping increasing shares of
television advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, these companies are actually very good leisure
plays,'' he said by telephone from his London office.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer club shares account for just 1.75 percent of the fund's
portfolio, which contains 79 stocks. The fund, with $631 million in
assets, has returned 18.7 percent, annualized, for the three years
ended April 23, compared with 16.8 percent for the average European
stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been problems this year; the fund is down 7.2
percent, versus a decline of just 1.3 percent for the peer group.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain attributes the recent performance to the portfolio's
high-growth stocks, which carry big price-to-earnings multiples.
Manchester United, with a P/E of over 50, is down 12.3 percent this
year. ``These companies have come in for profit-taking as investors
shift to deeper cyclicals,'' he said, referring to oil, chemical,
and some mining and steel companies. Some investors are also
returning to Asian stocks, out of favor until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, 34, grew up near Sheffield in northern England _
not far from Manchester _ and has been with the Denver-based
Invesco Funds Group since 1987, working in a centuries-old complex
in the City of London. He became manager of the European fund in
1990, when he was just 25.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's assets are spread around Europe, mostly in
large-capitalization companies. ``What we really want to do is find
companies that are operating in business areas that are growing,
where they are well positioned to also be able to grow in that
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To zero in on stocks, he analyzes industries, visits companies
and uses computer screening. He pays special attention to companies
that have shown above-average return on equity over the last six
years. ``If they have a proven record over that sort of time
period,'' he added, ``it usually shows that they're doing something
right.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fund, like others invested in Europe, has been hurt by
slower growth in economies, by the shaky start of the euro and by
negative market sentiment from the conflict in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   One top holding is Vodafone Group of Britain, the wireless
network provider. It took a big step into the American market in
January, announcing its plan to buy Airtouch Communications for
more than $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings growth has been strong, but earnings are still at a
low level, because the company is reinvesting lots of capital,''
Chamberlain said. ``This is what we like. We want companies that
are generating cash, hopefully sufficient amounts to be able to
expand their businesses, and they're hopefully operating in markets
where they have lots of room to grow.''
</P>

   Chamberlain said he first bought Vodafone stock in January 1997
at 2.54 pounds, it closed Friday at 11.45 pounds, and he has a
target of 15.40 pounds for 12 months.

   A smaller company, Tomra Systems of Norway, specializes in
so-called reverse vending machines. Customers return empty
recyclable bottles and cans to the machines and receive tickets
that can be redeemed at store checkouts. More than half of Tomra's
revenues come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomra has more than 90 percent market share globally in those
machines,'' he said. ``We liked it because we thought that it had a
big target market in which to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought Tomra stock in August 1995 at about 30 Norwegian
kroner. It now trades at 310 kroner, and his 12-month target price
is 430.
</P>
<P>
   Telepizza, the largest fast-food company in Spain, also has
outlets in Portugal and other European countries. Chamberlain said
Telepizza has a 60 percent share of the Spanish pizza market, ``and
it's a fast-growth market because fast food in Spain is
underdeveloped.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, he said, an average person spends $300 a
year on fast food. ``In Spain, it's about $15,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Telepizza delivers by moped. ``The pizzas themselves are pretty
good, but it's really the fact that they're very good at marketing
and they offer a very good service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He started buying the stock in February 1998 at the equivalent
of 4.95 euros. It now trades at 6 euros; his target is 9.18 by next
April.

 NATO BEEFS UP ITS PUBLIC-INFORMATION STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO has called up reserves of spin in the
information battle over Kosovo, trying to take the initiative after
suffering earlier tactical reverses in news briefings in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The overall commander is still Jamie Shea, the gray-haired,
45-year-old Londoner who has personified the alliance's public face
to the world since the bombing of Yugoslavia began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two weeks, Shea's original staff of six, tucked
away with support personnel behind the cafeteria, the bank and the
library, has been augmented by a multinational ``information
strategy cell'' of about 20 high-powered public officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are P.J. Crowley, a member of the White House
national security staff; Jonathan Prince, one of President
Clinton's speechwriters, and Alastair Campbell, Prime Minister Tony
Blair's spokesman, who commutes occasionally from London to
Brussels. Officials from France, Germany, the Netherlands and other
allied countries are expected to arrive within days.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he expected to be here, Crowley said, ``My wife
asked me that question, too.'' Nobody knows, apparently, just as
nobody knows how long the war will last, but the information
strategy cell is already pumping out information from a secret war
room situated next to the North Atlantic Council, the
decision-making heart of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've helped enormously,'' said Shea, who became NATO
spokesman in 1993 but stumbled early in the air war, trying to
explain events like the bombing of a railroad bridge as a passenger
train started to cross, and later the mistaken bombing of ethnic
Albanian civilians fleeing Yugoslav military units on a road near
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   The second attack, in mid-April, posed one of Shea's greatest
problems when precise and timely information proved difficult to
obtain from the NATO military command in Mons, Belgium, which, as
one new information officer remarked Friday, is not exactly joined
at the hip with the policy-making civilian side of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   After first acknowledging that NATO bombs might have killed
civilians north of Djakovica, Shea and an allied military spokesmen
then said for four days that they did not know what had actually
happened, and retracted an earlier statement about a bombing of the
road east of the town, where Serbian television had broadcast
pictures of carnage that it said was caused by allied bombs.
</P>
<P>
   It took until April 19 for Shea's boss, Secretary-General Javier
Solana, and the alliance's top military commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, to sort out the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Daniel Leaf, of the U.S. Air Force, then took the
stand in Brussels to explain, in copious detail, how allied pilots
had indeed attacked what they thought was a Yugoslav military
convoy southeast of Djakovica and might have hit civilians by
mistake. That ended a daily barrage of reporters' questions about
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to that sequence, when Yugoslav news media reported
this week that NATO had bombed a civilian neighborhood in
Surdulica, the allies' new information machinery swung into
operation quickly. Officials say Campbell personally saw to it that
the military headquarters got an explanation for the bombing to
Shea within 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Shea, later backed up by a military spokesman,
Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani, told reporters that at least one
laser-guided bomb aimed at a military garrison had drifted off
target. Though Yugoslav officials said at least 20 people had been
killed at Surdulica, the accident never acquired the prominence of
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Shea now talks with Clark daily by telephone, something he had
been unable to do before all his new help arrived. He now holds
morning news briefings on overnight bombing attacks, including
accidents like the missile hit on a residential building in Sofia,
Bulgaria, on Wednesday night, in addition to the televised
briefings at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to get the message across better,'' a NATO
official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Paris a French Foreign Ministry official said several
information officers with experience in the Balkans would be
dispatched to Brussels soon to help deliver the message of France's
extensive contribution to the bombing to news media besides those
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, who never served a day in uniform because, he said,
Britain abolished compulsory military service when he was a small
boy, is actually a professor who still teaches at five institutions
in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``His students always rate him tops,'' said George Delcoigne, a
fellow professor at the Center of International and Strategic
Studies of the Free University of Brussels. ``He is friendly,
considerate and above all very entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea received a B.A. in modern history and French from Sussex
University in 1977 and a doctorate in modern history from Oxford
University (Lincoln College) in 1981. But he could hardly keep
racing out of NATO headquarters to go off and teach classes in the
middle of a war, so things have changed: Shea now has a small army
of specialists to help him concoct sound bites and focus the
alliance's message on the issues that its political masters want to
get across.
</P>
<P>
   That still sometimes seems to mean more information about what
the Yugoslavs are doing in Kosovo than about what the allies are
doing there, a peculiarity of these briefings since they began.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for example, the briefing opened with a long
disquisition by Shea on what he said were cracks in the facade of
unity behind President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now over the last few weeks we have had an impression that the
support of President Milosevic is virtually total,'' he said,
``that the whole country is radicalized behind a form of extreme
nationalism, that there is no opposition, that nobody dares to
speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe that this unity, based on fear, is beginning to
fragment in Serbia today and that opposition from within the
country to the campaign of `ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo and to the
course of confrontation with the international community, that that
opposition is beginning to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea named Vuk Draskovic, a Yugoslav deputy prime minister; the
mayor of Kacak, Serbia, and the heads of two Serbian political
parties as figures who had dared to dissent, going on to cite
reports that nine Yugoslav generals had been placed under house
arrest and that morale was cracking in the Yugoslav armed forces,
claims that were echoed later the same day at apparently
coordinated news briefings in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But only an hour after Shea spoke, Draskovic was fired, and
later in the week American and NATO officials, speaking on
background, contradicted many of Shea's assertions about weakening
morale.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth in Belgrade, NATO's main public relations job
here, Shea says, is to tell as much as it can about its own
operations, which include not only the air war but also extensive
aid to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have poured out of
Kosovo since the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   But, acknowledging the battering he has taken, he said the other
day, ``I think after this is all over I'll take a lesson in
humility and go back to teaching.''

KRAFT WOULD BENEFIT FROM NFL FINANCING FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- If New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft accepts
Beacon Hill's new stadium offer, up to half his estimated $250
million construction costs would be offset by money from the
National Football League's ``G-3'' plan.
</P>
<P>
   The financing scheme, approved by NFL owners in February, was
designed to stop the exodus of big-city franchises lured to smaller
markets by sweet stadium deals. The Patriots, whose package with
Hartford was considered the most lucrative in the history of the
league, were candidate Number 1.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how G-3 works:
</P>
<P>
   Teams seeking money to finance stadium costs would give up their
share of revenue from luxury box and club seat sales on away games.
That annual flow of money would go instead to the NFL, to offset
the NFL's borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Teams considered ``large market'' teams could apply to league
owners for up to half the cost of their stadiums (smaller market
cities would be able to apply for 34 percent of their stadium
building costs), and would receive it if three-quarters of the
owners approve it.
</P>
<P>
   This ``loan'' would cost the Patriots between $3.3 million to $5
million a year that they normally would have received in visiting
club seat and luxury box revenue. That figure would fluctuate based
on where the Patriots played on the road in a given year. The team
would still receive 34 percent of the general gate from road games,
but would forgo the more expensive club seating and luxury box
revenue they would normally be entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   The team would pay this for an unspecified amount of time, but
the NFL would, in individual cases, forgo the repayment of the
entire principal of the loan, provided Bob Kraft held on to the
team for at least 10 years after the loan was issued.
</P>
<P>
   While the loan sounds like a great deal, it's still money the
Patriots won't have to pay other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great system the owners came up with to help
one another come up with the money to build these stadiums,'' said
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.

REBUFFED BY GREECE, BOEING PINS F-15 HOPES ON ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Israel now appears to be the last best chance for the
Boeing Co. to keep alive its highly profitable F-15 fighter line in
St. Louis following Friday's announcement that Greece will buy
fighters from the French and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Boeing executives had been courting the
Greek government to buy the F-15 Eagle, which would have extended
production for at least a year _ time for Boeing to possibly win
still more orders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Boeing's best hope to keep the line from being shut down,
at least temporarily, is a pending fighter plane order by Israel,
which like Greece is also considering Lockheed Martin's popular
F-16.
</P>
<P>
   But even if F-15 production stops, industry analysts said it
would not have any significant long-term impact on Boeing. That's
because Boeing has the new F-18E/F Super Hornet that it is building
for the U.S. Navy. Production of that plane is just getting
started.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Hornet will more than make up for lost F-15 revenue,
but it will take time for the program to become as profitable as
the F-15, which has been in production since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 workers in St. Louis build the F-15. The line has
been an important revenue stream for Boeing. The company has said
it would deliver 38 of the fighters this year. The F-15 sells for
about $60 million, so the 39 deliveries will make about $2.3
billion for Boeing in 1999. And that is nearly 20 percent of
Boeing's projected 1999 revenue of $12 billion for its entire
military aircraft and missiles unit headquartered in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was clearly disappointed in losing the Greek order. The
Greek Air Force reportedly favored the Boeing plane to the end, but
the government decided on the F-16 because it is significantly
cheaper than the $60 million F-15. The Greek Air Force already flys
the F-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision by Greece makes the Israeli order that much more
important,'' said industry analyst Peter Jacobs of Seattle's Ragan
MacKenzie firm. ``The good news is that Israel is much more
inclined to buy the F-15 than was Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Israel ordered 25 of the most advanced version of the
Boeing fighter, the F-15I. The last of those planes were delivered
just this week.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Arens, Israel's defense minister, has been in the United
States since last Saturday, primarily to discuss the next fighter
jet deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our full focus now shifts toward winning the Israeli aircraft
competition and working on other near-term opportunities,'' Boeing
said in a statement. ``We currently have F-15 deliveries continuing
into the early part of next year. An Israeli buy could extend
deliveries through 2000. Additional near-term sales are needed to
ensure deliveries beyond that time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential F-15 customer is Saudi Arabia, which previously
ordered 72 of the jets. The last of thsoe planes will be delivered
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had hoped Greece would buy upwards of 35 F-15s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Greece announced that it would buy 50 Lockheed Martin
F-16s, as well as 15 Mirage 2000-5 fighters built by France's
Dassault.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 billion order is less than half the estimated $4.2
billion that Greece would have spent to buy Boeing's F-15. The F-15
has greater range and can carry a heavier payload of bombs than the
F-16. But it's about twice as expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Israel plans to spend an estimated $2.5 billion for either 30
F-15 or 60 F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that could effect the decision is the radar system
used on the F-16. Arens told reporters yesterday that Israel wanted
F-16D jets to be equipped with radars built by Israel's defense
ministry, which he said were superior to the Westinghouse-built
radars now on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   It is U.S. policy for the fighters to come equipped with the
Westinghouse radar.
</P>
<P>
   The F-15I uses a different radar system.

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of diversification-minded investors are gravitating toward
a group of indexed stock mutual funds that may seem a far wiser
choice than the familiar version tied to the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   The funds, called total market funds, track several thousand
stocks to mimic the spectrum of American securities, not just a
chosen 500 of the biggest companies. Though the retail assets in
such funds are still relatively small, at $11.1 billion versus
$116.3 billion in S&AMP;P 500 index funds, they have grown more than
14-fold percent since 1994, when only the Vanguard Group had such
an offering.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, in fact, see total market funds as a kind of
all-in-one solution for investors' stock fund needs, giving them
exposure to all kinds of equities _ large and small, value and
growth. And they have rock-bottom expenses, too. But this is where
investors can go wrong, because the easiest tack is not always the
best.
</P>
<P>
   Investors flocking to total market funds, which track the
Wilshire 5000 index, may not be aware of the funds' limitations.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying the growing popularity of total market
funds, helped by well-publicized endorsements of the Wilshire 5000
by the likes of John C. Bogle, senior chairman of Vanguard, and
Burton G. Malkiel, the Princeton economics professor and author of
``A Random Walk Down Wall Street'' (W.W. Norton).
</P>
<P>
   ``I now believe the best general United States index to emulate
is the broader Wilshire 5000-stock index _ not the S&AMP;P 500,''
Malkiel said in the book.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and longest-established of this handful of funds is
the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund, which began in 1992 and
now has more than $10 billion in assets. Newer entries are Fidelity
Spartan Total Market Index, the T. Rowe Price Total Equity Market
Index and, since Feb. 1, Wilshire Associates' own version, the
Wilshire 5000 Index Portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of such funds is based on a major failing of the S&AMP;P
500: that it contains only large companies and is weighted by
capitalization so that the biggest stocks have undue influence.
</P>
<P>
   When examined, however, the Wilshire 5000 _ now expanded to
include all 7,200-plus publicly traded companies headquartered in
the United States with readily available prices _ has a weight
problem, too. Like the S&AMP;P 500, it is weighted by market
capitalization, so there is not as big a difference between the two
as one might expect.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as much as 80 percent of the Wilshire's value is in
companies that are also part of the S&AMP;P 500. This striking overlap
means that an investor who may think he is getting stakes in a
healthy portion of small and midsize companies is actually looking
at a quite meager side dish.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the price-to-earnings ratios of many big stocks in
the stratosphere, risk-conscious investors may conclude that such
indexing still gives them an uncomfortably large exposure to
expensive stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two kinds of index funds track each other closely:
Vanguard Total Stock Market has returned 19.9 percent annually on
average from its inception seven years ago through April 23, versus
21.4 percent for the Vanguard Index 500, according to Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A better idea may be allocating assets to put more emphasis on
mid-cap and small-cap index funds, thereby balancing the risks of
stocks with high P/E ratios against those whose valuations are less
exalted. That is something you cannot do in a total market fund.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, an investor with a total market fund, or some
combination of benchmark-linked funds, has indexed all his assets.
What's wrong with that? While it is accepted that indexing makes
sense for large-cap stocks, the jury is still out on indexing when
it comes to smaller issues.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 18.97 percent average annual return of the S&AMP;P 500
for the 10 years ended March 31. That beat every category of
general equity fund over the period, according to Lipper Inc., the
research firm in Summit, N.J. But the average small-cap fund
returned an average of 13.60 percent annually over the same period,
handily beating the 9.68 percent average of the Russell 2000 index
of small-cap companies.
</P>
<P>
   (The average mid-cap fund returned 14.55 percent, annualized,
over the 10 years, versus 17.43 percent for the S&AMP;P 400 index of
mid-cap stocks).
</P>
<P>
   The lesson: A total market index fund is a good core holding.
But if you choose it as an all-in-one substitute for a genuinely
diversified set of stock-market assets, you are likely to pay for
the convenience.

   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, head of the coalition
government that lost a confidence vote, said he would lead that
same coalition into elections as its prime ministerial candidate.
He also said in an interview with the magazine India Today that
``it might be highly improper'' for his caretaker government to
sign the nuclear test ban treaty by the September deadline if the
election is delayed until then. The date for new elections is not
expected to be set until next week.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, April 30 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GROUND
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 249-180, a measure requiring
congressional authorization before President Clinton can send
ground forces into the Balkans. Supporters said Clinton needs to
consult Congress before risking the lives of American men and women
by sending them into a ground war in Serbia. Opponents said the
measure undermines Clinton's authority as commander-in-chief. A
``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: WITHDRAW
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 139-290, a measure calling on
President Clinton to remove American troops from the Balkans.
Supporters said the NATO air strikes are not preventing Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic from forcing ethnic Albanians out of
their native Kosovo and that Clinton should just bring the troops
home. Opponents said withdrawing troops would only strengthen
Milosevic's resolve. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: WAR
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 2-427, a measure declaring war
on Yugoslavia. Supporters said that if the troops are going to stay
in the Balkans, then the United States needs to commit to war.
Opponents said a declaration of war would only exacerbate the
atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 213-213, a resolution to
support the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia. Although the bombing
has been going on for over a month, the House measure would have
given a symbolic stamp of approval to the air war. Supporters said
the measure would show that the House stands behind American troops
involved in the conflict in Yugoslavia. They also said to vote
against it would send a mixed message to both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the troops. Opponents said they could not
support the air war because President Clinton has not shown a clear
objective and he has not properly consulted Congress regarding the
NATO mission. A ``yes'' vote favors the resolution.

 &HT;    Student vigilance urged in rally against violence
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Just like the ``freaks,'' the ``dorks'' and
other fringe groups in their schools, the 1,000 young North
Carolinians who rallied here Friday against violence suffer from
derogatory nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   They're called ``snitch'' and ``narc.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Center for the Prevention of School
Violence's fourth annual summit in Raleigh hailed the students as
heroes, particularly in light of the school slayings last week in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Moore, secretary of the N.C. Department of Crime Control
and Public Safety, urged the students to become even more vigilant
for tension that could erupt in violence.
</P>
<P>
   Moore noted two recent incidents in which high school students
turned in classmates who had carried handguns to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not ratting on someone,'' he told the elementary, middle
school and high school students from 88 Students Against Violence
Everywhere chapters across North Carolina. ``This is what we are
supposed to do as a collective society.''
</P>
<P>
   Threats, warnings and rumors of bloodshed have swept communities
across the country since the Colorado massacre. That attack, on
April 20, coincided with Adolf Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, thousands of students around the country stayed home,
and some schools closed because it was the 54th anniversary of
Hitler's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Classes were canceled for thousands of students around the
country after menacing letters, messages and things that looked
like explosives were discovered. Such devices included something
resembling a pipe bomb in Marathon, Wis., and a propane tank in a
suburb of Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   The device that looked like a pipe bomb did not contain
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have been circulating among students and on the Internet
that something bad would happen on the date Hitler killed himself
in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the 900 students at Scituate High School and Middle
School in Scituate, R.I., stayed home after someone scrawled on a
wall in the girls' bathroom Monday and Tuesday: ``You die on April
30th.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raleigh-based school violence prevention center has spread
nationwide since its creation in 1993. Its roots go back to 1989,
when high school students in Charlotte gathered to promote
nonviolence following the slaying of a classmate at an off-campus
party.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 400 SAVE chapters in 15 states, the center trains
its 35,000 members to educate their classmates about the
consequences of violence. Working with law enforcement officers in
the schools, the students also mediate conflicts among classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, students led sessions that included role-playing by two
men who were handcuffed by police after they got into a fight.
Another group produced a video depicting the harsh consequences of
drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Tacked to the walls of an auditorium, T-shirts and posters read,
``Start Saving Lives'' and ``What's your friend packing for
lunch?''
</P>
<P>
   Students and administrators said such messages took on urgency
following the string of school shootings over the past two years,
culminating with last week's shootings in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence on TV is not real,'' said Jennifer Ackiss, 15, a
freshman at H.L. Trigg Community School in Elizabeth City, N.C.
``It was a shock that it really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate having reminders as tragic as this one, but it is
possible in a lull to think that things are getting better when
they are not getting better,'' said Joan Michael, dean of North
Carolina State University's College of Education and Psychology,
where the center is based.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged that the North Carolina students who
gathered Friday can't be expected to prevent violence in schools,
nor resolve all conflicts among their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley believes the organization's efforts have contributed
to a reduction of violence in North Carolina's schools. Over the
past five years, the reported possession of firearms on school
campuses has fallen by 65 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee that Littleton, Colo., will not happen
here,'' Riley said. ``We have to remain vigilant.

KRAFT WOULD BENEFIT FROM NFL FINANCING FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- If New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft accepts
Beacon Hill's new stadium offer, up to half his estimated $250
million construction costs would be offset by money from the
National Football League's ``G-3'' plan.
</P>
<P>
   The financing scheme, approved by NFL owners in February, was
designed to stop the exodus of big-city franchises lured to smaller
markets by sweet stadium deals. The Patriots, whose package with
Hartford was considered the most lucrative in the history of the
league, were candidate Number 1.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how G-3 works:
</P>
<P>
   Teams seeking money to finance stadium costs would give up their
share of revenue from luxury box and club seat sales on away games.
That annual flow of money would go instead to the NFL, to offset
the NFL's borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Teams considered ``large market'' teams could apply to league
owners for up to half the cost of their stadiums (smaller market
cities would be able to apply for 34 percent of their stadium
building costs), and would receive it if three-quarters of the
owners approve it.
</P>
<P>
   This ``loan'' would cost the Patriots between $3.3 million to $5
million a year that they normally would have received in visiting
club seat and luxury box revenue. That figure would fluctuate based
on where the Patriots played on the road in a given year. The team
would still receive 34 percent of the general gate from road games,
but would forgo the more expensive club seating and luxury box
revenue they would normally be entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   The team would pay this for an unspecified amount of time, but
the NFL would, in individual cases, forgo the repayment of the
entire principal of the loan, provided Bob Kraft held on to the
team for at least 10 years after the loan was issued.
</P>
<P>
   While the loan sounds like a great deal, it's still money the
Patriots won't have to pay other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great system the owners came up with to help
one another come up with the money to build these stadiums,'' said
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.

THORNTON PERFORMANCE PURE ARTISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ In a series virtually devoid of artistry, Joe
Thornton has been the Rembrandt amid the crayon splotches.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bruins and Hurricanes have devoted themselves to
meat-and-potatoes hockey, the second-year Boston center has been
one of the few performers who has created something other than
havoc.
</P>
<P>
   The prettiest works in his gallery were a pair of third-period
assists in Game 4 that provided the Bruins with a 4-1 victory and a
2-2 tie in this best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal
entering Friday night's return engagement at Greensboro Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton helped snap a 1-1 tie Wednesday when he retrieved Ray
Bourque's power-play slap shot from the end boards, worked the puck
to the side of the net, stretched his 6-foot-4-inch, 225-pound
frame to its full length, and poked a cue shot that bounced off the
shoulder of Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe across the crease to Landon
Wilson, who deposited the gimme for a lead the Bruins never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   For insurance, Thornton displayed the muscle that complements
his guile. He worked the puck to Anson Carter behind the net barely
five minutes later, setting up a Steve Heinze score.
</P>
<P>
   That came on top of perhaps the Bruins' lone bright moment of a
3-2 loss in Game 3, when Thornton gathered up a loose puck after a
Carolina giveaway and threaded it across the slot for a Sergei
Samsonov goal that forged a short-lived 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the sort of thing he did in junior hockey,'' said
president-general manager Harry Sinden. ``He's a creative
playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's also a confident playmaker, and the playoffs have
become his personal exhibit after a 16-goal, 41-point regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing really well lately,'' said Thornton, who
missed the series opener with a strained sternum but is
experiencing no ill effects. ``In the playoffs, I feel great every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a heartening departure from last year, when Thornton was
feeling, and looking, lost almost every night. At the end of his
rookie season, he was basically a fourth-line afterthought as the
Bruins bowed out to the Washington Capitals in the first round. Now
he's giving them an auxiliary second-line threat as they make a
legitimate run at Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later in the season as it's progressed, I've felt pretty
good,'' said Thornton. ``I've felt a lot more confident with the
increased ice time. When you have confidence, you can do a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   As an 18-year-old rookie in 1997-98, Thornton mostly displayed
bewilderment. After being the top overall pick in the 1997 NHL
draft, he was used like fine china by coach Pat Burns, and the
major highlight of his professional indoctrination was avoiding a
demotion to juniors. Burns insisted that a talent of Thornton's
tender years had to be groomed gradually; critics who witnessed his
play and statistics (3 goals, 7 points in 55 games) wondered if the
Bruins' alleged prize investment had been a colossal waste.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the carping, Sinden never lost faith. ``I had seen so
much in junior,'' recalled the boss, ``that I couldn't discount
what my eyes told me.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Sinden's vision has been proven accurate and
Burns's tutelage has been vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staying up last year was a big help for me,'' said Thornton.
``I learned a lot just by observing.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach, ever the demanding mentor, grudgingly concedes
Thornton's progress with one caveat: ``You never know that until he
really grows up. I hope there's a lot more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden is sold already. ``I saw pretty early this year that Joe
was going to be the player we saw in junior,'' he said. ``He's
developed a confidence that's remarkable shift to shift and game to
game. He's got it all, and if all goes right, he should develop
into one of the elite players.''
</P>
<P>
   He's providing glimpses at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was more or less on the fourth line in the
playoffs,'' said Thornton. ``This year I have more pressure to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem. ``He thrives on competition,'' said Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   And putting on a show.

UNIDENTIFIED CONSPIRATORS COULD RETURN TO CLASS, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As frustration mounted about the pace and
progress of their investigation, authorities acknowledged Friday it
was possible that co-conspirators in the Columbine High School
massacre might return to classes Monday among the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also grew increasingly defensive about their
response to warnings that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were
potentially violent, complaining about what they called speculation
based on ``20-20 hindsight.''
</P>
<P>
   They pursued the complaints as far as possible without
developing evidence of a crime, authorities said. Also, they asked
a deputy assigned to the school to keep a watchful eye on Harris
and Klebold, neither of whom acted hostile or aggressive in his
presence. That deputy, Neil Gardner, exchanged gunfire with one of
the killers during the seige.
</P>
<P>
   While defending their actions, authorities acknowledged that
danger signs were either missed or misinterpreted. ``We all learned
a lesson,'' said Lt. John Kickbush of the sheriff's department.
``We need to take these things in a more serious fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, authorities announced a second arrest they said was
peripherally connected to the case, involving a 34-year-old woman
accused of phoning a bomb threat to a nearby high school. One day
earlier, a hardware store clerk was charged with lying to
investigators about having sold propane tanks and other bomb-making
materials to Harris and Klebold before the attack in which they
took 15 lives, including their own.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators have repeatedly said they believe others
were involved in lugging weapons or planning the attack, there have
been no arrests directly connected to the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Dave Thomas, who earlier had to retract his
prediction of an imminent arrest on a gun-related charge, Friday
said only that ``closure'' of that piece of the investigation was
expected ``in the near future.'' Steve Davis, spokesman for the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, said no arrests were
expected during the weekend, and no further media briefings were
scheduled until Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   They have not identified any suspects, but investigators said
privately that other students with advance knowledge of the
killers' intent might be fellow members of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said investigators had collected 8,000 to 10,000 pieces of
evidence, and were already pursuing 900 of the 1,200 live leads
received to date, none of which dissuaded them from their belief
that Harris and Klebold did not act alone. But Davis reiterated
that the investigation has turned up ``no indication of any third
suspect in the school at the time of the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of investigators' frustration was the repeated
insistence by a Littleton couple that the sheriff's department
failed to adequately pursue a complaint about homicidal fantasies
and threats against their son on Harris's Internet web page.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Randy Brown supplied a sheriff's deputy with 10
pages of printouts from the web page, which authorities released
Friday along with the ``suspicious incident'' report that resulted
from the complaint. Between profane rantings about annoyances
including people who mispronounce words, phone solicitations, car
insurance, and country music, the printouts include a long tirade
about Brown's son, Brooks, and two threats on Brooks Brown's life.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said a sheriff's investigator, John Healy, tried to access
the web site, but the Internet addresses supplied by Brown were
either incorrect or had been shut down. Healy apparently did not
call Brown to ask about the accuracy of the web addresses, and
Davis said he did not know why.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said that in April 1998, Brown's wife Judy called in
another report saying her son had received a threat via e-mail.
According to Davis, Judy Brown said her son tried to respond to the
sender, but the sender was unknown and Brooks Brown had
accidentally deleted the message.
</P>
<P>
   A second investigator, John Hicks, reviewed that report but saw
no evidence the sender had violated any laws. Authorities said the
main reason the investigation stalled was the Browns wanted to
remain anonymous and did not want Harris or Klebold to know about
the report, out of fear for their son's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the ability to speak to a victim, or positively
identify a suspect, elements of a crime could not be established,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the district attorney, suggested Friday that although
Klebold's parents were cooperating with investigators, Harris's
parents were avoiding police. Thomas said an attorney whom he would
not identify had contacted his office on the Harrises behalf, but
claimed that pressing business elsewhere was preventing him from
putting investigators in direct contact with the couple.
</P>
<P>
   While Littleton investigators prepared to take the weekend off,
authorities in neighboring Denver were cautiously awaiting the
annual meeting of the National Rifle Association. Several marches
and silent vigils were expected to greet the NRA, which refused
requests by city leaders to hold its long-planned convention
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The woman arrested Friday for the bomb threat was identified as
Rae Holt, the mother of a a former student at nearby Pomona High
School. She was charged with filing a false report about explosives
and menacing, both felonies. Thomas said school officials
recognized her voice because they had 40 to 50 contacts with her
previously about her son, who she felt had been treated unfairly by
the school. On Thursday, 50-year-old hardware store clerk Gary
Sowell was charged with making a false report for saying he sold
Harris and Klebold bomb-making supplies.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pleading with parents and students to open a
discussion about the causes of youthful rage, President Clinton
said Friday that he would convene a White House meeting on youth
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday that he was not singling out gun
manufacturers or the makers of violent movies for criticism or
proposed legislation. Instead, he offered to ``bury the hatchet''
in his long-running feud with the National Rifle Association and
invited Hollywood executives to join in the search for a solution
to violence in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be fighting about who takes the blame,'' Clinton
said Friday as he announced a May 10 forum at the White House on
guns, youths and popular culture. ``Instead, we should all be
looking for ways to take responsibility, and we should be doing
that together.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders had asked the president to convene a
conference on violence and values. In the wake of a rampage that
took 15 lives at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., last
week, several congressional committees are planning hearings to
address the causes of school killings, including the possible
contributing role of entertainment and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not specify who would be invited, but said
it would include educators, gun makers, entertainment industry
representatives and Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea to hunters and gun advocacy groups like the NRA to
join in the quest for an answer to outbursts of deadly rage,
Clinton said he had no intention of limiting legitimate access to
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's bury the hatchet and build a future for our children,
together,'' the president said, a day before the NRA opens its
annual convention in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also signaled to Hollywood that his attack on movie
violence would be chiefly rhetorical.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Saban
Entertainment and Time Warner, which have been criticized for
producing particularly violent movies and television programs, are
among the biggest soft-money contributors to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Saban, creator of ``Power Rangers'' and ``Ninja Turtles,'' is
the second largest producer of children's television programming
and the second largest soft-money contributor to the Democrats. The
company and its executives gave $328,776 to the party in the
1997-98 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission
records.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which produced the movie ``Natural Born Killers,''
gave Democrats $211,000 in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The president gently urged Hollywood to reduce the amount of
violence in its products. Still, entertainment executives were
bracing for another assault on their work in the name of ``family
values.''

 &HT;    Ga. school leader proposes Mace, Tasers for administrators
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming and Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia school Superintendent Linda Schrenko will seek
a state law authorizing local school districts to arm
administrators with Mace, pepper spray or an electronic stun device
called a Taser, a spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gambill, Department of Education comptroller and Schrenko's
main go-between with the Legislature, said principals and assistant
principals should have the option of carrying these weapons if
their local system approves and if they are properly trained. His
remarks came at a legal and media conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, I hope not,'' was the immediate reaction from Juvenile
Court Judge Glenda Hatchett, a panelist at the conference. Another
panelist, Emory University public safety expert Arthur Kellermann,
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in spending dollars on school administration, but
not for weapons or surrogate weapons,'' Kellermann said later.
</P>
<P>
   Schrenko did not return phone calls seeking comments on her
proposal. Asked why she was not available for comment, assistant Ed
Floyd said Schrenko authorized Gambill to speak on the proposal,
had no plan to make any other formal statement and probably felt
that was all that needed to be said at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill said the Littleton, Colo., school shooting gave the idea
more urgency, but that Schrenko had talked about it weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no demands from principals for these weapons,
Gambill said. But ``right now, an irate parent, a belligerent
parent or student, if they start getting hysterical or violent,
there's no way to subdue such an individual other than to try to
physical restraint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Puckett, director of the Georgia Association of Educational
Leaders, which represents principals and other administrators, said
he didn't think administrators would be interested in Schrenko's
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seriously doubt that any of our members are interested in
becoming police officers,'' he said. ``I don't mean that as a
criticism of Linda. We're all searching for ways of making schools
safer.

WE TRIED TO WARN YOU

 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's going to be really deep around here now that Bob
(``you like me, you really like me'') Kraft gets to say he turned
down the greatest sweetheart deal in the history of sports because
he loves Boston so much.
</P>
<P>
   It's right there on paper. Check the balance sheet. Given the
choice to let Connecticut build him a $374 million playpen, or stay
in Foxboro to construct a stadium with his own money (plus $70
million worth of state-subsidized infrastructure), Kraft Friday
chose to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   What a guy. In the pantheon of local gods, this puts him up
there with Arthur Fiedler, Cardinal Cushing, Ted Williams, Larry
Bird, and Natalie Jacobson. For this, Kraft is granted at least
five years of immunity from criticism. Like Dennis Rodman he can
write a book _ ``Insufferable As I Wanna Be.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of insufferable, need anyone be reminded that some of
us knew all along that Kraft wasn't moving? It wasn't that hard to
deduce, really. When you grow up around here, you know certain
truths: Every construction job will take twice as long and cost
twice as much as originally planned; the Red Sox will choke in the
end; a guy like Kraft wants to be BMOC in Boston, not Yahoo
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   As they wallow in their now-monsterous sense of inferiority, the
good people of Hartford should see this as a victory. They've been
spared the indignity of paying through the snout to make a rich man
richer.
</P>
<P>
   There are other winners, of course. Patriot fans don't have to
make that tedious 200-mile round trip to Hartford eight times a
year. This will save untold thousands in speeding tickets and
sunglasses. (Bird always hated the Hartford ride because the sun
was in his eyes all the way down.)
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas ``Guardian-at-the-Gate''
Finneran gets to say he stared-down the behemoths from the NFL
while protecting Massachusetts taxpayers from corporate welfare.
Finneran should have the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' playing in
the background next time he delivers a speech. He's even taking
credit for changing NFL stadium support by-laws. If the league's
new instant replay system succeeds, look for Finneran to claim it
was his idea.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader is a big winner. Nader was one of
the first to expose the Hartford deal as a turkey for Connecticut's
taxpayers. He urged Kraft to ``go back to Massachusetts.'' The
implosion of Hartford's stadium package deal is probably Nader's
best work since he vaporized the Corvair.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, Father Donald Monan and the rest of the Boston
College business posse also deserve a round of applause. They
sparked the new Massachusetts offer and brought Finneran together
with Senate President Thomas Birmingham and Governor Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser, naturally, is Connecticut Governor John Rowland.
Yeesh. Rowland looks like Flounder of ``Animal House'' fame _ after
the Delta members trashed his brother's car. In this spirit, the
Krafts would be the frat boys who turned to Flounder and said,
``You (expletive) up. You trusted us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland messed up. He trusted the Krafts. He thought a handshake
was good and that a deal was a deal. Instead, he was used like a
rented dump truck. If he'd like, we can supply him with names and
numbers of guys who were burned by Kraft in the past. Maybe they
could form a self-help group. If might make Rowland feel better to
know that he is not alone. The Guv will probably have to sue
somebody to save face.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forgive me while I revisit some old stories from
Globe library files.
</P>
<P>
   It was fun to look back at those photographs of a smiling Kraft
and Rowland shaking hands while the ever-vigilant Connecticut
legislators stood in the background, applauding.
</P>
<P>
   I came across that phony, mid-December (just in time for the
State House vote) letter Kraft wrote in the Hartford Courant in
which he said, ``In hindsight, relocating to Hartford is something
we should have done years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Another knee-slapper was Rowland's annual Christmas poem to the
local Chamber of Commerce that concluded, ``To the whining masses
in Boston, I just have to laugh . . . We may be a bunch of Yahoos,
but we managed to land the Krafts.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was affable mayor Mike Peters, who said, ``Unlike
what's been written, we've got a lot to offer. And I believe in Bob
Kraft. I don't think anyone would pull on the emotion of these
people and then pull the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, Mr. Mayor. Can I sell you some authentic moon rocks I dug
out of my driveway?
</P>
<P>
   We tried to warn you guys that you were being used. Nonetheless,
we're gonna miss our friends in the Nation's File Cabinet. Things
won't be the same around here without the rhetoric of Nader, those
Connecticut legislators in Patriot hard hats, the intransigent
steam plant, the forced smiles of the Kraft boys, and daily toxic
waste updates from Yo Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   John Rowland is Charlie Brown. Bob Kraft is Lucy. And poor
Charlie Brown is lying on his back because Lucy has pulled the
football away at the last second. Again.

ONE MORE TO GO: BAFFERT ON A ROLL ENTERING KENTUCKY DERBY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif, Ore.)   (See also RAC-DERBY-BET) 
(rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ On the eve of the Kentucky Derby, this was the
easy part of Bob Baffert's weekend: Silverbulletday winning her
seventh straight race and her 10th in 11 starts, dominating the
Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs before a record crowd of 101,034
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult part for Baffert unfolds on Saturday when he
attempts to become the first trainer in racing history to win the
Kentuck Derby three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert, who already trains two Derby favorites in General
Challenge and Prime Timber, added another weapon to his powerful
arsenal Friday when he decided to start another star filly,
Excellent Meeting, against colts in the Derby instead of running
her against fillies in the Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   So he will take aim on history with three horses in the 125th
Derby: the entry of General Challenge and Excellent Meeting, owned
by Betty and John Mabee of Golden Eagle Farm in California, and
Prime Timber, owned by Marie and Aaron Jones of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   If Baffert wins, he will become the first trainer to win both
races in the same year since 1952, when Ben Jones won the Oaks with
Real Delight and the Derby with Hill Gail.
</P>
<P>
   The 125th Derby will be run on a dry, fast track before a throng
that could surpass last year's crowd of 143,215, if Friday's
attendance gives any clue. In its 125th running Friday, the Oaks
shattered last year's record total of 94,415.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby lost one horse from its full field of 20 Friday when
Aljabr, one of the ``mystery'' horses from Dubai, was scratched
with some lameness. But while the 19 Derby candidates were resting
or exercising lightly for their wide-open Run for the Roses, the
Oaks provided little suspense once Silverbulletday got rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old superstar, owned by Mike Pegram, who also owned
last year's Derby winner, Real Quiet, stalked the pace set by
Marley Vale until they reached the far turn. Then jockey Gary
Stevens asked Silverbulletday to run, and she shot forward. At the
close, she had two lengths on Dreams Galore, who had 4} lengths on
Sweeping Story, while Marley Vale under Jerry Bailey faded to
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The winner ran the mile and one-eighth in 1:494/5 and paid $2.20
for a $2 bet to win as the 1-9 favorite in a lopsided betting
situation that cast the rest of the field of seven as far out as
58-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have lost half of my fans if we had lost the race,''
Baffert quipped afterward. ``Now I can relax and go for the double.
Tomorrow will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Asmussen, the trainer of Dreams Galore, put it gallantly:
``She ran a great race, but ran into a bear. They could've gone
around again and not caught the winner. Silverbulletday is a
champion, and she proves it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert ended the suspense about his weekend lineup Friday
morning outside Barn 33, where he unleashed Real Quiet and Silver
Charm onto the Derby scene as winners in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent Meeting will run in the Derby,'' he said, wasting no
time on preliminaries. ``I wanted to see how she trained this
morning. She's been training great, and I think she deserves the
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got a favorable post, I figured it was fate and she
should run in the Derby. She's one who can take the heat, doesn't
mind dirt in her face and is peaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, who drew the No. 6 post position for the Oaks
and and has the No. 5 post position for the Derby, has run nine
stakes in a row that were rated Grade I or II. She is a bay
daughter of General Meeting and granddaughter of Seattle Slew and
Chief's Crown, and she has won seven of her 11 starts and finished
in the money in all 11, with earnings of $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to separate these three horses,'' Baffert said.
``General Challenge is probably the most talented of the three, and
I think Prime Timber is ready to run his best race, which he'll
need to win. I just hope that when they're turning for home, I
don't have to say to myself, `I wish I had run Silverbulletday in
there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to cover all bases. I think we're in a position to
win. Now it's a matter of racing luck.''

COLORFUL JAIR HAS ZENGA'S CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They taught Anselmo ``Jair'' Ribeiro a
different way of life when he moved to Roxbury from Cape Verde.
Jair taught his new countrymen soccer.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similar storyline for millions of immigrants in the
United States but Jair has taken things to another level. Not only
did he excel in local soccer leagues as a youngster, he became a
professional with top clubs in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, destiny played a large part in Jair's progress. Anyone
named after a Brazilian national team star might be expected to be
more than competent in soccer. And, since the Revolution were
created for New England, it would seem natural that Jair was made
to play for them.
</P>
<P>
   When the Revolution meet Colorado Saturday night, Jair will
likely be on center stage, in the central midfield position that
fits him best. He played there last week, combining with Kris
Kelderman to give the Revolution their most fluent offensive
performance of the season in a 3-2 victory over D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to play wherever I am needed,'' Jair said Friday.
``We have some injuries, so maybe I will have a chance to play in
the center again. I will try to do the same as last week or better.
Hopefully, things will go well because it is important we get the
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this game is totally different than last week. We have to
keep our concentration on Colorado, stay together, play good
soccer, and keep possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Jair and Kelderman accomplished just that against D.C. United.
Their composure on the ball allowed the Revolution to control the
pace of the game, and will be a key in this contest. In fact, the
direction Jair provided, sometimes in an understated way, was
crucial to the Revolution last season. After Jair was injured in
his seventh game, the Revolution won only three games in regulation
time in failing to earn a playoff berth. Jair returned from a
broken left ankle, but did not regain his early-season form and was
benched.
</P>
<P>
   But player-coach Walter Zenga has regained faith in Jair this
year, starting him at an outside midfield position. Jair moved into
the middle and will stay there while Edwin Gorter (stomach virus)
and John Harkes (sprained knee) remain out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more belief in ourselves this year,'' Jair said. ``A
lot has changed. The mentality of the team is changing, we are
understanding what Walter wants. It's a new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean we are just playing defense, because what we
are doing is combining defending with attacking. This is good for
me, because I want to become a better player. If I can defend well,
it makes me more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of goals, and the first one is to make the
playoffs. If we play together and do well, everyone will be
watching us and it will be better for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Jair is often one of the most visible players on the field
because of his skillful approach. This season, he became more
conspicuous by dying his hair yellow, then changing it to red for
this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a secret why I did it,'' Jair said. ``But if I score a
goal in this game you will see why.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 12,735th spectator to enter Foxboro Stadium will be the
millionth for regular-season Revolution games and will be involved
in a halftime kick on goal worth $1 million . . . Richard Goulooze
(strained calf) will likely return for the Miami game May 8. The
returns of Imad Baba (groin) and Harkes are undetermined.

OUT OF ASIA: THE MOVE TOWARD GLOBAL REGULATION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Asian crisis is subsiding. Even Russia is
reviving a bit. But for all the relief that brings, the global
financial meltdown remains a haunting memory _ not as searing as
the Depression for a generation of Americans, but scary enough.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the Depression brought regulation to America's
financial markets, the Asian and Russian crises are forcing rules
on the global market.
</P>
<P>
   That is a striking shift in course. The thousands of lenders and
borrowers who move money among themselves in what is called the
global financial market had counted on markets to heal themselves
without much oversight. Many economists encouraged that view, until
Asia took a dive. And now public officials with the power to
regulate global markets are speaking more explicitly than ever
about actually doing so.
</P>
<P>
   They are not thumping pulpits about it. But in interviews,
speeches and forum discussions at the spring meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, held here last
week, some officials offered views they would not have dared to put
on the record six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing acceptance in the official international
community that you tremendously increase the risk of triggering
volatility and crisis if rules are not made for the proper
structuring of debt,'' Jack Boorman, the IMF's director of policy
development, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility is a euphemism for the panicky rush of foreign
lenders out of Asia, then Russia, and then Brazil. Credit even
dried up in the United States last fall, until a worried Federal
Reserve abruptly cut rates.
</P>
<P>
   While the World Bank had spoken out for global rule-making, the
IMF had held back, and so had the Clinton administration. But it
was clear at last week's meeting that they, too, have now come on
board.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis has imposed on all of them a common frame of
reference. It goes like this: The global capital market, like
national markets, is neither self-regulating nor self-curing. Left
alone, lenders and borrowers tend to operate with too much
exuberance, on the one extreme, and then pull back too far in
panic, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crises are, in a sense, accidents,'' said Lawrence H. Summers,
the deputy Treasury secretary, in a speech last Sunday. ``As with
accidents, crises will never be eliminated, and are not amenable to
silver-bullet solutions. Think of auto accidents: If one looks back
at any auto accident, there are always many things that could have
combined to produce greater safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that recognition, the new rule-making _ or accident
prevention, as Summers put it _ is under way. It is now openly
recognized that lenders must be regulated, and negotiations have
begun over what strictures to impose on them. (Hapless borrowers
have been lectured from all sides since the global crisis started
in 1997 on how they should have behaved and must now behave.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more belief now in the necessity of controls on both
the lending and the borrowing side,'' said Stanley Fischer, the
IMF's first deputy managing director.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders, after all, are part of a system that can swing too
easily from optimism to pessimism. These swings are facilitated by
short-term loans, which lenders prefer to long-term lending. Loans
of less than a year are less expensive for lenders because banks
need not keep as large a percentage of the loans' value in reserve.
And short-term loans can be withdrawn quickly in a crisis, which
makes the lenders whole but tends to deepen the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers are also tempted by short-term loans. They can often
borrow abroad for the short term at relatively low interest rates
and re-lend the borrowed money long term at home at higher rates.
They gamble that the short-term loans will be renewed indefinitely,
not suddenly withdrawn in panic.
</P>
<P>
   One goal of the new rule-making is to discourage short-term
lending in favor of long-term loans, which are less likely to
finance speculation and more likely to finance factories and
similar investments. Not surprisingly, this shift is turning out to
be the hardest part of the new rule-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders, naturally, are opposed. ``Presumably the market, on its
own, will find the right balance between short- and long-term
credit,'' said James Chessen, chief economist of the American
Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Public officials are sensitive to this resistance. Still, there
is much talk of raising reserve requirements on short-term loans,
and of requiring bondholders to postpone repayment in the event of
a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Tougher proposals come more slowly to the table. One is the
so-called Chile approach: When short-term foreign loans enter in
great quantity, Chile requires the foreign lenders to deposit a
percentage of each loan in a noninterest-bearing account _ a tax,
in effect, that raises a loan's cost. Such a strong deterrent never
entered Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's speeches, until April
21, the eve of the meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some countries,'' he said, ``may deem more comprehensive
measures _ such as Chilean-style taxes on short-term capital
inflows _ to be appropriate.'' Caveats filled the next three
sentences, but no rejection. The rule makers, mindful of Asia, are
clearly moving forward.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever stood and fumed while the person who got to the
airport pay phone ahead of you seemed to tie it up endlessly, you
won't like what AT&AMP;T has done with 20 pay phones in Terminal 4 at
John F. Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In place of ordinary phones, the company is testing interactive
touch-screen devices called Public Access Links, made by Imagic
Infomedia Technology, a small Hong Kong company. By swiping a
credit card, calling card or smart card through the device and
touching symbols on its screen, a user can call up flight
information and make reservations on airlines that use the
terminal, order flowers, rent cars, book hotel rooms and even send
e-mail, following instructions that can be displayed in five
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Data connections for laptop computers and Internet access are
planned, threatening to stretch the average duration of a single
person's use of the phone even longer.
</P>
<P>
   Imagic and AT&AMP;T certainly don't mind if users of the devices
stick around awhile: They will see more of the ads that often flash
across the phone's screen for Perrier, Hilton hotels and others.
</P>
<P>
   If the phones, already widespread in Hong Kong, catch on at JFK,
Imagic hopes to place them at airports, hotels and convention
centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the phones' new capabilities, the absence of one
feature may also set harried would-be callers fuming: They do not
take quarters, or any other coins. &QL;

   Compliance officers at brokerage houses think of themselves in
white hats, helping to protect the investing public by making sure
that their colleagues play fair. So it is no small deal in their
world that what is probably the first movie to feature a compliance
officer as a main character makes him one of the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   The film is ``Boiler Room,'' described as a cross between
``Glengarry Glen Ross'' and ``Wall Street.'' Written and directed
by Ben Younger and planned for release by New Line Cinema late this
year or early in 2000, the film is set in a none-too-reputable
brokerage firm in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A cast of glib young men led by Ben Affleck rake in riches by
cold-calling investors and talking them into buying dubious
securities _ the kind of thing compliance officers are supposed to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance Reporter, a newsletter for the profession, put a
report about ``Boiler Room'' on its latest front page and quoted
Younger as saying the film ``does not give a wonderful view'' of a
compliance officer ``in the back pocket'' of the shady firm.
</P>
<P>
   It also quotes real compliance officers saying that taking such
a job would end their careers and wondering whether the film will
appeal to a wide audience, though ``a lot of regulators will go see
it.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's going to be really deep around here now that Bob
(``you like me, you really like me'') Kraft gets to say he turned
down the greatest sweetheart deal in the history of sports because
he loves Boston so much.
</P>
<P>
   It's right there on paper. Check the balance sheet. Given the
choice to let Connecticut build him a $374 million playpen, or stay
in Foxboro to construct a stadium with his own money (plus $70
million worth of state-subsidized infrastructure), Kraft Friday
chose to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   What a guy. In the pantheon of local gods, this puts him up
there with Arthur Fiedler, Cardinal Cushing, Ted Williams, Larry
Bird, and Natalie Jacobson. For this, Kraft is granted at least
five years of immunity from criticism. Like Dennis Rodman he can
write a book _ ``Insufferable As I Wanna Be.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of insufferable, need anyone be reminded that some of
us knew all along that Kraft wasn't moving? It wasn't that hard to
deduce, really. When you grow up around here, you know certain
truths: Every construction job will take twice as long and cost
twice as much as originally planned; the Red Sox will choke in the
end; a guy like Kraft wants to be BMOC in Boston, not Yahoo
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   As they wallow in their now-monsterous sense of inferiority, the
good people of Hartford should see this as a victory. They've been
spared the indignity of paying through the snout to make a rich man
richer.
</P>
<P>
   There are other winners, of course. Patriot fans don't have to
make that tedious 200-mile round trip to Hartford eight times a
year. This will save untold thousands in speeding tickets and
sunglasses. (Bird always hated the Hartford ride because the sun
was in his eyes all the way down.)
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas ``Guardian-at-the-Gate''
Finneran gets to say he stared-down the behemoths from the NFL
while protecting Massachusetts taxpayers from corporate welfare.
Finneran should have the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' playing in
the background next time he delivers a speech. He's even taking
credit for changing NFL stadium support by-laws. If the league's
new instant replay system succeeds, look for Finneran to claim it
was his idea.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader is a big winner. Nader was one of
the first to expose the Hartford deal as a turkey for Connecticut's
taxpayers. He urged Kraft to ``go back to Massachusetts.'' The
implosion of Hartford's stadium package deal is probably Nader's
best work since he vaporized the Corvair.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk, Father Donald Monan and the rest of the Boston
College business posse also deserve a round of applause. They
sparked the new Massachusetts offer and brought Finneran together
with Senate President Thomas Birmingham and Governor Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser, naturally, is Connecticut Governor John Rowland.
Yeesh. Rowland looks like Flounder of ``Animal House'' fame _ after
the Delta members trashed his brother's car. In this spirit, the
Krafts would be the frat boys who turned to Flounder and said,
``You (expletive) up. You trusted us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland messed up. He trusted the Krafts. He thought a handshake
was good and that a deal was a deal. Instead, he was used like a
rented dump truck. If he'd like, we can supply him with names and
numbers of guys who were burned by Kraft in the past. Maybe they
could form a self-help group. If might make Rowland feel better to
know that he is not alone. The Guv will probably have to sue
somebody to save face.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forgive me while I revisit some old stories from
Globe library files.
</P>
<P>
   It was fun to look back at those photographs of a smiling Kraft
and Rowland shaking hands while the ever-vigilant Connecticut
legislators stood in the background, applauding.
</P>
<P>
   I came across that phony, mid-December (just in time for the
State House vote) letter Kraft wrote in the Hartford Courant in
which he said, ``In hindsight, relocating to Hartford is something
we should have done years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Another knee-slapper was Rowland's annual Christmas poem to the
local Chamber of Commerce that concluded, ``To the whining masses
in Boston, I just have to laugh . . . We may be a bunch of Yahoos,
but we managed to land the Krafts.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was affable mayor Mike Peters, who said, ``Unlike
what's been written, we've got a lot to offer. And I believe in Bob
Kraft. I don't think anyone would pull on the emotion of these
people and then pull the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, Mr. Mayor. Can I sell you some authentic moon rocks I dug
out of my driveway?
</P>
<P>
   We tried to warn you guys that you were being used. Nonetheless,
we're gonna miss our friends in the Nation's File Cabinet. Things
won't be the same around here without the rhetoric of Nader, those
Connecticut legislators in Patriot hard hats, the intransigent
steam plant, the forced smiles of the Kraft boys, and daily toxic
waste updates from Yo Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   John Rowland is Charlie Brown. Bob Kraft is Lucy. And poor
Charlie Brown is lying on his back because Lucy has pulled the
football away at the last second. Again.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While stock investors applauded the Dow Jones
industrial average's assault this week on another nice round number
_ 11,000 _ it is likely that few of them were participating in the
profits. That's because most investors have money in stocks listed
not in the Dow but in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, which has risen
only half as much as the Dow this year.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that no investment trend lasts forever, the S&AMP;P is now
the laggard after years of beating the Dow. And this is occurring
just as mutual funds that mimic the S&AMP;P's moves have been flooded
with money.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout reflects a shift in sentiment among some investors
that began about two weeks ago. Sensing a revival of economic
growth around the world, investors plunged into stocks of
industrial companies, like paper, steel, cement and chemical
concerns, seeing them as likely beneficiaries of the recovery. At
the same time, investors started to exit the technology and health
care stocks that had made the S&AMP;P a star.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Dow, which is weighted by its stocks' prices, the S&AMP;P
500 is weighted by its stocks' market capitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for investors? Just as the impressive
performance of the S&AMP;P has masked a bear market in many smaller
stocks since last summer, its current malaise masks a bull market
in stocks with lower market caps, which are not big contributors to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment officer of asset allocation
at Trust Company of the West in New York, said investors should
prepare for a stealth bull market. ``The averages will be in a
trading range,'' he said. ``But within the confines of that trading
range there will be wonderful moves in stocks that will not show up
in the indexes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is already happening. Shares of Dow Chemical, for example,
rose 40.8 percent in April. But because it is such a tiny component
of the S&AMP;P _ 0.267 percent of the index's value _ its rise has had
little impact on the 500. Microsoft, with a weighting of 3.77
percent, fell 9.6 percent in April, producing a significant impact.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P is vulnerable because it is dominated by the companies
investors have been selling in recent weeks. Technology and health
care companies account for 19 percent and 12 percent of the index's
value, respectively. In contrast, chemical companies make up 1.9
percent of the index; paper and forest products account for 0.6
percent, and aluminum concerns represent 0.3 percent. Because these
stocks make tiny contributions to the S&AMP;P, as they have surged, the
index has shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   It may be premature to say that the era of momentum investing is
over. But buying what has been going up is no longer working. Even
the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks, left for
dead in recent months, was up 8.8 percent in April, versus the
S&AMP;P's 3.8 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey M. Warantz, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney, reports that even the tiniest stocks have improved. While
companies with less than $250 million in market value were, on
average, down 6.7 percent for the year in early April, they are now
down only 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is very positive for investors whose holdings are
diversified among small stocks and large, value and growth. It is
not good news for those who have placed all their eggs in the S&AMP;P
500 basket.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROBLEM REPAIRED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE HUNT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Repairmen finally fixed Friday a telecommunications problem that
briefly shut down the entire Southern California horse racing
simulcast system Thursday morning, blacked out Santa Anita and
another site and cost Hollywood Park more than $2 million in
handle, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Karwackie, general manager of Southern California Offtrack
Wagering Inc., said a worker for one of Pacific Bell's
subcontractors ``snipped the wrong wire'' while working in a
manhole on the perimeter of Los Alamitos Race Course, near
SCOTWINC's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He said the subcontractor was installing a fiber network for a
newly constructed building near Los Alamitos Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, everybody went down, the system went down,''
Karwackie said. ``At 9:30 a.m., everything went down. Immediately
Autotote started switching over to backup. Santa Anita came back on
line, then they dropped out and we haven't been able to determine
why. At 6 o'clock last night we got Santa Anita up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the National Orange Show (in San Bernardino) wasn't up at
all and we couldn't get them up at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mooney, director of publicity and public relations at
Hollywood Park, said it was difficult to obtain information about
the problem Thursday. Neither he nor Karwackie said they knew if
anyone would be held liable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure it cost us $2 million minimum in handle yesterday,''
Mooney said. ``Because Santa Anita was down and San Bernardino was
down.''
</P>
<P>
   George Haines, director of pari-mutuels at Santa Anita, said
Friday that 1,767 bettors were at the Arcadia track when the
problem occurred Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure occurred at 12:15 p.m. and we canceled at 1:35
p.m.,'' he said. ``We probably lost about $600,000 in wagers. We
refunded the gate and gave out rainchecks (to patrons).''
</P>
<P>
   Haines said Santa Anita's backup system came on after the
initial problem arose around 9:30 a.m. Neither Karwackie nor Haines
knew what caused the backup system to go out at 12:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a satellite (site) we're so dependent on technology and
telecommunications,'' Haines said. ``The National Orange Show was
never able to come back up, but Del Mar never had a problem all day
long. Barona (Casino) and some of the Indian sites, their lines
were up and down all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Haines said Santa Anita was operating on its backup line as of
1:30 p.m. Friday, but planned to switch over to its primary line
after the running of the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karwackie said there was great concern about the problem
initially because the Kentucky Derby was only two days away. Last
year on Derby day, the total handle from the Southern California
satellite wagering sites was a record $23.5 million, according to
Mooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had us all on edge because it was so close to the Derby,''
Karwackie said. ``AT&AMP;T and Pac Bell were involved. We got everybody
on the same page finally. They just finished (at 12:10 p.m.). Thank
God we got it straightened out.''

PUTTING A BRAVE FACE ON JAPAN'S BAD BANK LOANS

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ ``He's Don Quixote,'' said Jun Satoh, chief
manager of credit policy for the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
motioning to his senior colleague, Eiichi Haruki. ``I'm Sancho.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Japanese bankers came to the United States on a mission
that some of their peers regard as nearly as crazy and embarrassing
as tilting at windmills, though it is likely to accomplish a lot
more. The quest: enticing institutional money managers, beyond a
small circle of bargain-hunting specialists, to invest in Japan's
mountain of defaulted bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banks have traditionally hated to sell nonperforming
loans, because acknowledging that some or all of what was owed will
never be recovered is seen as humiliating in a culture that takes
humiliation hard.
</P>
<P>
   When economic times were good, banks could afford to be
unrealistically patient and optimistic about a few bad debts. But
the bursting in 1992 of the country's ``bubble economy'' of soaring
real estate and stock prices and the seven long years of recession
that followed have left the country's banks with nonperforming
loans that by some estimates total $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   By tying up capital that could otherwise be lent anew, they
throttle bank earnings and starve the economy of credit.
</P>
<P>
   The dead weight dragged a few weaker banks into liquidation and
forced others to merge. Ultimately, it prompted the government to
design a $64 billion bailout plan, announced last October, to help
the survivors cope by injecting capital into banks that took
write-offs before the end of the fiscal year, on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among Japan's biggest banks, though, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi has stood aloof from the bailout and tried to
solve its problems on its own. And that's where the delicate
journey of Satoh and Haruki comes in.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi was among the first Japanese
lenders to start selling its defaulted mortgages on factories,
stores and office buildings. So far it has sold loans totaling $7
billion in face value in 17 deals with Wall Street ``vulture''
funds and hedge funds in Britain and America.
</P>
<P>
   These are the same kinds of investors who moved in early when
the United States had a similar problem, the collapse of the
savings-and-loan industry in the late 1980s, and who made big
profits buying up dud loans at 50 cents on the dollar,
restructuring them and selling them at 60 or 65 cents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the investors who wield money on the scale that Japan needs
_ the big pension fund managers _ came late to the bulk auctions of
S&AMP;L loans by the Resolution Trust Co. This time, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi wants to lure those managers into the game
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken a lead role in reaching out to nontraditional
investors because it will broaden the market and speed
liquidation,'' said Jack Rodman, a managing director of a Los
Angeles accounting firm that specializes in real estate, E&AMP;Y
Kenneth Leventhal, and one of Japan's leading bad-loan deal makers.
</P>
<P>
   Outreach is what Satoh and Haruki were doing in California,
trying to prepare the ground for future sales by preaching the
general advantages of investing in dud Japanese loans on Japanese
terms. They paid calls on two of the United States' largest
institutional investors, the California Public Employees Retirement
System, known as Calpers, and the treasurer of the University of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Squiring the two bankers into the offices of the fund managers
was William J. Popejoy, who has experienced the pain of real-estate
cycles first hand. At federal regulators' behest, Popejoy was
chosen in 1984 to try to forestall the demise of American Savings,
the nation's largest S&AMP;L. It ultimately failed despite his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we aren't here to do a deal,'' said Popejoy, now the
president of Pacific Capital Investors of Irvine, Calif. ``When the
Japanese came and bought assets in the U.S., they bought them the
U.S. way,'' he said he told the portfolio managers. ``We'd like you
to think about buying Japanese assets the Japanese way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Capital has already bet its own money on that kind of
thinking. It recently completed a deal to buy 40 loans with a face
value of $370 million from the bank, and wants to buy another
package of loans five or six times that size, preferably with
pension funds as partners.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Capital's deal with the bank requires it to stick to
nonconfrontational tactics in trying to collect on the defaulted
loans. The aim is to get partial repayment from the debtors without
resorting to repossession, an intense humiliation in Japan that the
bank still wants to spare its customers, even nonpaying ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're concerned with how we treat their borrowers,'' Popejoy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors are likely to consider such a deal
attractive if it includes an American partner to service the loans,
said Martin J. Whitman, chairman of the Third Avenue Value fund,
who has been an outspoken advocate of changes in Japanese law to
ease the bad-debt problem. Spokesmen for Calpers and for the
University of California treasurer would not comment on their
meetings with Satoh and Haruki. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To help it make its case to investors, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
discarded its historical ways of analyzing nonperforming loans in
favor of approaches drawn from the RTC's experiences, like valuing
the loans based on cash flow. In the process it pioneered a
secondary market that was new for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, you couldn't liquidate nonperforming loans,''
Haruki said. ``This is very new. The effort was put into finding
out what the investors' appetite is for.'' When the bank's
bulk-sale plan passed muster with Japanese tax authorities, other
banks followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened, the bank is considering securitizing some of the bad
loans, another strategy rare in Asia but common in the United
States. ``In Japan, when you want to change things, it takes a long
time,'' said Sachio Mikumo, a bank executive who accompanied them
on their California trip. ``There were skeptics, but not any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman of E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal estimates that $40 billion of
nonperforming Japanese loans have been sold in the last three years
at prices averaging 10 percent of face value, much lower than was
typical in RTC sales.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers have included CS First Boston, Salomon Smith Barney,
Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Sales should accelerate this
year as once-hesitant banks, spurred by the bailout, begin writing
off and selling bad loans the way Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi has,
American investors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's waiting for the tap to open,'' said Thomas J.
Barrack Jr., chairman of Colony Capital.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, Satoh and Haruki hope that the pension funds they
are evangelizing will be ready to buy in bulk _ and help buoy
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only way the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi survives,''
Satoh said.

   A Lively Discussion About Executive Pay &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal minces executives, not words. He plans to get the
last one in his feud with Linda J. Wachner, chief executive of
Warnaco Group, a New York apparel company.
</P>
<P>
   In his newsletter, crystalreport.com, Crystal lambasted Ms.
Wachner for receiving $73.8 million last year for ``positively
awful performance.'' Her pay demonstrated that ``complete and utter
greed'' is not confined to men, he said. Comparing Warnaco's size
and shareholder returns with more than 300 other companies', he
said later, she makes almost 20 times as much as she should.
</P>
<P>
   When Thestreet.com reported Crystal's analysis, Ms. Wachner
described it as ``misleading and erroneous and, therefore,
malicious and slanderous,'' and put lawyers on standby. On Friday,
the company noted that its stock had outperformed the industry and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index in four of the last eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal has rallied his supporters. ``We cannot afford to have
our sources silenced,'' said Sarah Teslik, executive director of
the Council of Institutional Investors. Not to worry: Crystal plans
to rebut Ms. Wachner on his Web site Monday. By week's end, she was
tiring of the contest, saying, ``This is not a game of
Ping-Pong.'' &QL;

   Never Say Die at Intel &QL;

   At age 62, Andrew S. Grove sees a big difference between today's
Internet entrepreneurs and the founding team of Intel three decades
ago: himself, Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce. ``At Intel, we never
discussed an exit strategy,'' he said during a recent stop in New
York. Squadrons of Silicon Valley start-ups, he added, think that
if they position themselves to intersect with the ambitions of,
say, Cisco Systems or Microsoft, they will probably be bought out
in 18 months. ``At Intel in the early days,'' he said, ``we had
this naive notion that we were building the next IBM or
something.''

   The Tisch family's latest investment technique is the New York
Straddle. Having bet heavily on a Wall Street retreat, the Tisches
hedged their exposure to further losses somewhat by betting $35
million on a continued New York boom. After finishing the
renovation of the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue, flagship of their
Loews Hotels, Jonathan M. Tisch, the Loews Hotels chief, came up
with the week's best publicity stunt: an ultimate power breakfast,
with politicians like the former Mayors David N. Dinkins and Edward
I. Koch, and business people like Louis Rudin, the New York
builder, to mark 25 years of breakfasts there. &QL;

   Anyone annoyed by people who can do several things well, without
sweating, should avoid Pamela Thomas-Graham. The first black woman
partner at McKinsey &AMP; Co., Ms. Thomas-Graham is a Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School. Harvard
Business School, too.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, she's married to the prolific author Lawrence
Otis-Graham. She works 80-hour weeks, serves on three charitable
boards and plans to help her husband run for Congress. Oh, and she
had a baby, Gordon Julian Thomas Graham, 11 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she had time on her hands. Simon &AMP; Schuster has just
published her second novel, ``Blue Blood,'' a murder mystery set on
the Yale campus. Her editor is Michael Korda. ``I find it really
cathartic,'' Ms. Thomas-Graham said. ``Writing is a way to relax,
and open your mind.'' For her consulting clients, in the media
industry, she has new advice: ``I'm much more in favor of large
author advances now.''

   Internet stocks aren't all that's being bid way up in Silicon
Valley. At a March auction for the Menlo School, a prep school in
Atherton, Calif., Emma, a yellow Labrador puppy, fetched $17,000.
The buyer? Robert Swanson, the founder of Genentech. The dog was
donated by a veterinarian, said Maggie Pringle, co-director of the
fund-raiser, which brought in more than $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Four people bid, but only two continued past $10,000: Swanson
and Eff Martin, a Goldman, Sachs partner. That $17,000 buys more
than a best friend; extras included five training sessions and a
portrait of the owners with their new pooch.

WASHINGTON, April 30 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''

<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GROUND
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 249-180, a measure requiring
congressional authorization before President Clinton can send
ground forces into the Balkans. Supporters said Clinton needs to
consult Congress before risking the lives of American men and women
by sending them into a ground war in Serbia. Opponents said the
measure undermines Clinton's authority as commander-in-chief. A
``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: WITHDRAW
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 139-290, a measure calling on
President Clinton to remove American troops from the Balkans.
Supporters said the NATO air strikes are not preventing Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic from forcing ethnic Albanians out of
their native Kosovo and that Clinton should just bring the troops
home. Opponents said withdrawing troops would only strengthen
Milosevic's resolve. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: WAR
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 2-427, a measure declaring war
on Yugoslavia. Supporters said that if the troops are going to stay
in the Balkans, then the United States needs to commit to war.
Opponents said a declaration of war would only exacerbate the
atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 213-213, a resolution to
support the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia. Although the bombing
has been going on for over a month, the House measure would have
given a symbolic stamp of approval to the air war. Supporters said
the measure would show that the House stands behind American troops
involved in the conflict in Yugoslavia. They also said to vote
against it would send a mixed message to both Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and the troops. Opponents said they could not
support the air war because President Clinton has not shown a clear
objective and he has not properly consulted Congress regarding the
NATO mission. A ``yes'' vote favors the resolution.

3 CAPTURED U.S. SERVICEMEN MEET WITH JACKSON DELEGATION IN
BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Mich.)  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE Yugoslavia _ The three U.S. servicemen held by
Yugoslavia described on Friday their days as lonely and monotonous,
interrupted only by perfunctory daily visits from a Serb army
officer and solitary exercise in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   They said they have no contact with each other or with other
prisoners in the same facility. One said he took a walk Friday
outside his cell, only the second time he had been allowed to do so
in his month-long imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Another said he was finally given reading material Friday, but
the books were on Serb history and the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   With the chairman of the military court monitoring the questions
through a Yugoslav army interpreter and a military cameraman
recording their answers, the three young soldiers were allowed to
speak to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Congressman Rod Blagojevich of
Illinois, and a reporter from The New York Times. They were filmed
by CNN.
</P>
<P>
   When they were given the opportunity to send messages to their
families, each of the soldiers turned to face the camera directly
and seemed, suddenly, very young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope it's all over soon,'' said Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of
Huntsville, Texas. ``Mom, Dad, sorry I put you through so much pain
and agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., was
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my wife Tricia and my son Ryan, I love you,'' he said, his
face reddening and his eyes filling with tears. He stopped and
seemed unable to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Blagojevich, a Serbian-American Democrat whose father was raised
in Yugoslavia, seized the uneasy moment, bringing a smile to the
young soldier's face by saying that as a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, he was going to make sure the captives receive
a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, could spend only
a few minutes with the visitors because an air raid siren sounded
just before he was brought into the room, and the Yugoslav military
officers tried to hustle the visitors out.
</P>
<P>
   After pleas from Jackson, he was sent in with his two fellow
soldiers for a final photo shoot and time in front of the
television camera. He had time to do little more than send
greetings to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks everybody for all your thoughts and prayers,'' Ramirez
said. ``They've been needed and they're a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the delegation that met the soldiers, as well as
the length of the meeting, was decided by the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   The visit lasted about 40 minutes. The three soldiers, who had
been seen publicly only once shortly after they were captured along
the Kosovo-Macedonia border, were brought one at a time into a room
at the Belgrade Military Court building, just over the Sava River
from downtown Belgrade, at about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities refused to say where the soldiers are being held
and permitted them to answer only those questions that concerned
their living conditions and their health. The Yugoslav government
also specified that only two journalists and two members of
Jackson's interfaith delegation to Belgrade, which includes several
members of the clergy who had been in contact with the prisoners'
families, could meet the servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, dressed in their laundered U.S. Army camouflage
uniforms, appeared nervous and anxious and sat straight in their
armchairs. They wore their battered Army-issue boots without the
laces, which they said had been taken away by their captors.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were well-fed and had no medical problems and
appeared fit, if tense.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was the first to be brought into the small office of the
general supervising the visit. He appeared tired, with dark circles
under his eyes, and still had a bruise on his forehead, which he
said ``is a mark from our capture.'' He added that he had received
medical attention for the injury immediately after being taken into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   They are provided with three meals a day and a cell furnished
with a bed and a small table. who received th reading material
Friday, said he has only ``caught sight'' of his fellow GIs briefly
during his captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who appeared more rested than the others, ventured the
most elaborate description of his condition. Responding to a
question from Jackson, he said he was ``okay, considering the
circumstances.'' He added that he is also feeling ``a little
mentally drained.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told him, ``You are a hero. People know you all over the
world.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The clergy who came from the United States with Jackson, but
were barred from meeting with the soldiers, had brought bibles and
small Orthodox icons for each of the men, as well as five packages
of Chuckles candies for Ramirez, a tape player and cassette tapes
recorded by each of the men's families.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson showed each of the soldiers the pile of gifts, but the
Yugoslav general, who would not identify himself, did not allow the
soldiers to take the gifts with them, saying they had to pass
military censors first.
</P>
<P>
   To each of the servicemen, though, Jackson offered words of
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many view the jail experience as a time of reflection, a
time to write, a time to think, a time to pray, a time to think
about how they want to build their lives,'' he told Stone, adding
that his imprisonment could be an opportunity to strengthen his
character and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of our scars,'' he said, ``come our stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The men, members of the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry of the 1st
Infantry Division operating in Macedonia, were on patrol when they
were captured at about 4 p.m. on March 31. The government here has
maintained they were seized in Kosovo, although U.S. officials have
accused the Serbs of abducting them and have demanded their
release.
</P>
<P>
   The dazed soldiers, with bruises and dirt on their faces, were
shown on Serb television soon after their capture. The Yugoslav
authorities at first talked of putting the three on trial, although
some government officials have since retracted the threat. However,
the general who supervised the interview with the soldiers
suggested that a trial remains under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The procedure for the indictment has not been in any way
initiated and possible evidence is still being collected,'' he
said, in laying down the limits on what could and could not be
asked of the soldiers. ``And it has to be yet decided whether an
indictment will be raised at all. But until then all matters
pertinent to possible investigation should not be dealt with at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the general also said the three soldiers are prisoners
of war and are being treated in accordance with the Geneva
Convention. The men received their first visit from the
International Red Cross only this week. The general said a
representative of the European and Balkans branch of the Red Cross
also met them, but he did not say when that meeting took place.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who arrived in Belgrade on Thursday with a group of
American Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders, said he still hopes
to persuade the Yugoslav government to release the soldiers as a
humanitarian gesture. He said after the interviews with the men
that he still had no indication that they would be freed. Jackson
and his delegation have met twice with the Yugoslav foreign
minister, Zivadan Jovanovic, and are scheduled to meet President
Slobodan Milosevic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The general's comments indicated that the Yugoslav authorities
may consider it gesture enough to have approved a visit with the
soldiers. He called the arrangement ``out of the ordinary,
especially considering the air raid possibility and air strikes at
any moment.'' Indeed, the interviews with the soldiers were cut
short when an air raid siren wailed outside the window after about
40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are to take this as a gesture of good will by the Foreign
Ministry of our country,'' he told Jackson. ``Because as you are
probably well aware after the aggression by NATO on our country,
three U.S. citizens have been apprehended, having been found on
Yugoslav territory in U.S. uniforms and with arms in hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' final moment with their visitors was spent in
prayer. With his arm around Ramirez and Gonzales, and with Stone
standing close to his side, Jackson thanked God for watching over
the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help is on the way and hope is in the air and soon, very soon
you will know peace and family,'' he said, before the men filed out
of the room, holding their hands behind their backs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Law enforcement officials here acknowledged
Friday that they did little to follow up a complaint a neighbor
made last year that one of the teen-agers responsible for the
killings at Columbine High School last week ``talks often of making
pipe bombs and using them to kill numerous people.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said they told an administrator at Columbine
about the complaint, as well as the police officer assigned to
provide security at the school. The officer engaged in ``light
conversation'' with the teen-ager, Eric Harris, and his friends,
but did not pick up signs that Harris was engaged in a year-long
plot that ended in a massacre at the school.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing a copy of the complaint Friday, the Jefferson
County sheriff's office said it did not confront Harris or his
parents because the neighbor who made the complaint did not want
the Harrises to know he had done so.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the strongest evidence to emerge that law
enforcement officials had warnings before Harris and a friend,
Dylan Klebold, attacked Columbine with 30 pipe bombs and guns,
killing 13 people and themselves. The March 18, 1998, report also
said that Harris and Klebold made and detonated pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, sheriff's officials defended
themselves against mounting criticism that they ignored signs that
the two teen-agers were unstable and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the two-page incident report were copies of Harris'
Web site delivered to sheriff's investigators by the neighbor,
Randy Brooks Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report noted that Harris wrote three times on his
Web site about ``wanting to kill'' Brown's son, Brooks, Lt. John
Kiekbusch said Friday that the investigation did ``not get to the
point where a crime was identified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all learned a lesson on April 20th,'' Kiekbusch said when
asked if his office had mishandled the complaint. ``We need to take
these in a more serious fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that they were unable to call up the Web site
on their own computers, apparently because the site was down. They
said they did not contact the parents of the two young men because,
as Deputy Mark Miller noted in his report, Brown ``was very anxious
in remaining anonymous in making this report and did not want
Harris or Klebold to have knowledge about his reporting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the report said, had reported Harris to the sheriff's
office in 1997, and now feared that he would take revenge on his
son, a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``God I can't wait till I can kill you people,'' a section of
the Web site entitled ``Philosophy'' said. ``I'll just go to some
downtown area in some big ass city and blow up and shoot everything
I can. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I live or die in the shootout, all I want to
do is kill and injure as many of you'' as possible, he said in one
of many diatribes laced with obscenities, misspellings and phrases
in broken German.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who was under some type of psychiatric care at the time,
wrote, ``No I am not crazy, crazy is just a word.''
</P>
<P>
   After three and a half pages listing, ``You know what I hate,''
he described the detonation of a homemade pipe bomb: ``Flipping
thing was heart-pounding, gut-wrenching, brain-twitching,
ground-moving insanely cool!''
</P>
<P>
   In a followup complaint, dated April 11, 1998, a sheriff's
deputy reported that Judy Brown had complained that Brooks, her
son, had just received an anonymous threatening e-mail. The
reporting deputy wrote, ``They are very concerned and requested an
extra patrol for the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Browns' plea for total anonymity, the death threats
were reported in the crime column of the March 25, 1998, edition of
The Columbine Courier, a weekly newspaper that serves the school
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father downloaded and printed 10 pages in which the boy
threatened his son three times,'' read the three-paragraph item.
Without naming names, the article related how the father had filed
a complaint with sheriff's office. ``The boy also explained how to
make pipe bombs and use them against people.''
</P>
<P>
   While the complaint languished as an ``Open Lead'' for a
``Suspicious Incident,'' the sheriff's office did talk to a dean at
Columbine and to Neil Gardner, the deputy assigned to the school.
Steve Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, said that they
were ``briefed'' about the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deputy Gardner, with this knowledge, occasionally engaged
Harris and Klebold, along with several of their friends and
associates in light conversation,'' the sheriff's spokesman said
Friday. ``Deputy Gardner made no observations of inappropriate
behavior and has stated that both Harris and Klebold treated him
with appropriate respect.''

125TH DERBY ON THE LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Joe Morgan was standing on familiar ground,
the Louisville of his minor league baseball haunts. Morgan has
found wisdom in the 40 years since his baseball days at the old
Louisville Fairgrounds. Especially when it comes to horse racing,
and especially when it comes to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never go for favorites, and definitely not in this race,''
said the former Red Sox manager, who had just been chatting up Earl
Wilson, a Red Sox pitcher of the 1960s. ``I'm looking for a horse
to pay $110.''
</P>
<P>
   And so should you.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom in recent years has a Kentucky Derby been so competitive,
and it is still to be learned if these horses in this 125th
Kentucky Derby are equally good or equally mediocre. All but a few
seem equal in talent. No horse stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Derby field looks pretty evenly matched,'' said Bobby
Barnett, the trainer of Answer Lively and a trainer who's been
winning race after race this week at Churchill Downs. ``You can
make a case for so many horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to this mix two fascinating subplots. It is extremely rare
for a girl to try the boys in the Kentucky Derby _ only 36 fillies
have run against 1,523 colts in the 124 previous runnings of the
Derby, three winning _ but Saturday afternoon not only one, but two
fillies will be running. And both of the girls, Three Ring and
Excellent Meeting, have more than a sporting chance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the intrigue of Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum's
attempt to capture one of the most American of sporting events, the
Kentucky Derby. Maktoum paid $5 million for Worldly Manner but
Worldly Manner is a most American horse, bred in Kentucky, born to
race on dirt, and trained for his first four races by that most
American of trainers, fast-talking, wise-cracking Bob Baffert. When
Sheikh Mohammed bought Worldly Manner last fall and brought him to
Dubai, Wordly Manner was one of the pre-race favorites for the
Breeders Cup Juvenile race.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, Americans have belittled Sheikh Mohammed for
what they consider his unorthodox training methods. Trainer Nick
Zito has been most visible with the snide remarks, and others have
chimed in. After all, only 13 Derby starters in history have
attempted to win the Derby without having a previous race in their
3-year-old year and Morvich was the last to try the feat. That was
in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Americans have fallen for the snare that there is
only one way _ the American way _ to train for the Derby. ``Worldly
Manner, coming over from Dubai,'' said Barnett, ``you know they
have him ready.'' Or, as Richard Mandella, the trainer of Desert
Hero put it, ``I know not many people are giving him a chance here,
but I still think World Manner could run a big race.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the scenario. And while keeping in mind that post
position is overrated in a race of a mile-and-a-quarter, empty your
mind of all those Derby trends that pass for analysis. That's
because two strong trends will conflict Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has trained the winners of the last two Derbys and just
missed three in a row when his Cavonnier lost the 1996 Derby by the
shortest of noses. The 140,000 fans who will be at Churchill Downs
are aware of this and are sure to make Baffert's entry of General
Challenge and Excellent Meeting the favorites in the race. No
favorite has won the Derby since Spectacular Bid 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business is to throw out those horses who
have no chance. They are Desert Hero, Ecton Park, Valhol, K One
King, Kimberlite Pipe, Lemon Drop Kid; in other words, the entire
mutuel field. Add Vicar to the toss-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen horses are left and what is clear is this is a most
unusual Derby. Unlike most Derbies there is not an abundance of
oil-burning early (and cheap) speed, which would set up the
late-closing horses very nicely. Indeed, with the late scratch
Friday of Aljabr, the entry-mate to Sheikh Mohammed's Worldly
Manner, there may be only two or three horses with clear early
speed and they are the two fillies, Excellent Meeting and Three
Ring, and possibly Vicar, who is starting far to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting should have run in Friday's Kentucky Oaks for
fillies but Baffert, her trainer, is wise to the ways of the Derby.
Excellent Meeting clearly is in the race as a rabbit, to ensure
that there is an honest pace to the race so Baffert's other two
horses, General Challenge and Prime Timber, can close late. But do
not dismiss Three Ring, the other filly, who may go off at 30 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Also do not dismiss Worldly Manner, who may go off at 14 to 1 or
so. Sheikh Mohammed and his Godolphin Stable are among the most
powerful in the world and they know how to get a horse ready for a
race, snickering Americans or no snickering Americans. And Jerry
Bailey, Worldly Manner's jockey, is the best. Wordly Manner will be
in the running.
</P>
<P>
   This race is so competitive that the reward must be compatible
with the risk. In other words, go for odds; the payoff must be
generous for a handicapper who takes a stand in a race that has no
clear standout. Baffert's three horses and Vicar will be overbet;
their reward is too little. Look elsewhere. The same with Zito's
two horses, Adonis and Stephen Got Even (the favorite in Friday's
early betting); toss them.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the horses to consider: D. Wayne Lukas has been lying
in the weeds but his horses, Cat Thief and Charismatic, are sharp
and their odds will be high. Menifee is in the mix, as well as
Worldly Manner. Three Ring, Answer Lively, or First American could
finish third and light up the tote board.
</P>
<P>
   This is a scenario: Cat Thief first, Worldly Manner second, and
any of this group _ Menifee, Charismatic, Answer Lively, First
American, or General Challenge _ in the third spot. As usual, go
for the gusto.

   Old-time fiddler remembers the music that sustained a region
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
</P>
<P>
   By Lee May
</P>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ The lights are low in the Yellow Jacket
restaurant, and E.P. (Slim) Stewart, longtime country musician, is
singing, passionately, his voice rising and falling in concert with
his six-string flattop Gibson, while his son, Larry, backs him with
voice and fiddle. ``I was danc-ing with my dar-lin' to the
Ten-nes-see Waltz when an old friend I hap-pened to see. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The music, an extension of an interview, drifts sweet and sad, a
song that grabs you no matter how many times you hear it. Or play
it. ``Yes, I lost my lit-tle dar-lin' the night they were play-ing
the beau-ti-ful Ten-nes-see Waltz.'' With that familiar last line
still hanging in the air, Stewart says, softly, seriously:
``Occasionally, when I play, I get a little emotional. Some of 'em
touch me. I used to do solos, but I don't do that anymore; I don't
want to crack up.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this song, familiar worldwide as a Patti Page pop
hit, a wedding favorite, the state song of Tennessee and a
comfortable old country standard, touches untold millions. But for
Slim Stewart, 80, it resonates most deeply. He is the brother of
Redd Stewart, who co-wrote the song with Pee Wee King. (As the
story goes, Redd and Pee Wee were returning to Nashville from Texas
in 1947, with the truck radio tuned to the Grand Ole Opry. Hearing
``The Kentucky Waltz,'' Pee Wee joked that Redd ought to pen a song
about Tennessee. Redd quickly set in, writing words on a matchbox
cover.)
</P>
<P>
   Redd, who is 75 years old, can't sing or play anymore; in 1992
he took a bad fall on the basement steps of his Louisville, Ky.,
home. Says his wife, Darlene: ``He was tired, lost his balance
while carrying a sing-along machine'' and suffered severe injuries
to his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mind's there, but he can't use it,'' Slim Stewart says
sadly.
</P>
<P>
   This reality is far from the one back when they were children in
Louisville, when, as Slim recalls, 4-year-old Redd ``would sit on
the front steps and play the banjo, and people would stop and
listen to him.'' And far from those heady days in the 1940s and
'50s when Redd and Pee Wee (Redd was vocalist with Pee Wee's Golden
West Cowboys) were known in music circles as ``the men with the
golden pens'' because of songs such as ``You Belong to Me,''
``Bonaparte's Retreat'' and ``Slow Poke.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim Stewart, who has lived in McCaysville since 1940, isn't one
to talk much about sad times; in fact, he is known around the
Copper Basin as a man of few words, a man more likely to let his
music do the talking. But on this day, during a two-hour
conversation in a wood-paneled back room of the Yellow Jacket, he
conducts a conversational, musical tour of old country music and
his love for it _ and, like others who grew up with the music,
praises its powerful influence on life in an Appalachia before
television, movies and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Old is gold
</P>
<P>
   The effect that old country had on Appalachian people is
``inestimable,'' says John Rice Irwin, founder and director of the
Museum of Appalachia in Norris, Tenn., which exhibits several dozen
pieces relating to the Stewart family, including photos and costume
items. ``The music has had an unbelievably profound effect on
people in the region. It sustained them, inspired them, brought
tears to their eyes. Fiddlers were heroes of the communities, even
though some were so poor they carried their fiddles in a sack
because they couldn't afford cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, Irwin is talking about old country, the Stewarts' kind
of country, not the rocking-the-jukebox kind ubiquitous on country
music charts today. He's talking about the kind of music whose
guitars and fiddles and banjos and lilting, moaning voices coax and
pull and jerk pain and pleasure from your heart and soul, throw
your emotions around a good-time room or onto the floor for the
drums to stomp.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin compares old country to ``vintage furniture, which never
goes out of style.'' He says the museum gets 100,000 visitors a
year from all over the world, and the song they request most from
the museum band is ``Tennessee Waltz.'' ``I got a letter this
morning from someone saying how difficult it is to find the old
music anymore,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It'll get easier, says Mike Panter, a financial consultant in
Blue Ridge, who also is a music promoter. After listening to 400
singers under age 21 around the South during the past year, he
concludes, ``Some of the old songs are starting to come back and
will be rerecorded by younger artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as new country continues its mainstream course, old
country is in some ways a specialty item, found on some radio
stations (including ``golden oldie'' outlets), at special events
and select entertainment spots. And, on this day at a Southern-food
restaurant in the North Georgia mountains, from the hands and
mouths of Slim and Larry Stewart. (Larry works at Opryland
Productions in Sevierville, Tenn., near Pigeon Forge, mainly
playing steel guitar, harmonica and banjo. Slim's other son, Bob,
who lives in this area, also is an accomplished musician.)
</P>
<P>
   Good times, bad times
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ashland City, Tenn., to musician parents, Eury Pershing
Stewart (whom everyone around here knows as E.P. or Slim) and his
four brothers and two sisters grew to love music at an early age.
At age 10, Stewart and his 13-year-old brother, Al, performed on
radio in Depression-era Louisville as the Newsboys Duo, combining
their guitar and banjo playing (Slim played banjo then) with
delivering The Louisville Courier-Journal. ``We performed each
Saturday morning for 15 minutes,'' he says, ``and received $7
apiece.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade or so Slim Stewart toured with various
groups, singing and playing ``devil's box'' (fiddle) and
``starvation box'' (guitar). Those early touring days had a certain
impoverished richness _ ``the good ol' days when times were bad,''
Stewart calls them.
</P>
<P>
   He tells the story from the late 1930s about when he and Redd
were working together in Pennsylvania: ``We always had to check
around with one guy to see how much money we could spend in the
restaurant in the morning. So, chili being rather cheap, we ate a
great deal of it. After checking with the treasurer and heading for
the restaurant across the street, I said to Redd, `Dad gum, Redd,
it's chilly this morning.' Redd said, `Hunh. If I know anything,
it's chili every morning.' '' The telling, and the memory of the
time, bring Stewart a good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Georgia, he began a 39-year career as a
machinist in the copper and petroleum industries in nearby
Copperhill, Tenn., ``playing my music on the side, appearances at
schools, dance halls, picnics.'' He still plays as often as
possible at ``old-time gatherings. I'll play at the drop of a hat,
and I'll bring the hat.''
</P>
<P>
   For many it has always been that way. Says Larry Stewart: ``The
music is not pretentious. In good times and bad times, people
played. It was a form of release.''
</P>
<P>
   His father adds: ``When I'm having a bad day, I can go pick up
my guitar and feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   `Music in his blood'
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for many mountain people, the music always was the
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Dr. Bill Lee. Thirty years ago, he began organizing country
music concerts, featuring mostly local players. Held for years at
various locations in the area, including a barn, a school and on
Main Street in nearby Ducktown, Tenn., the extraordinarily popular
monthly events were called ``First Tuesday, Ducktown, U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent wet Saturday on Main Street, Lee, 72 and retired
from medicine, pointed out a little gray frame building, half of
which used to house his general practice office. The other half,
outfitted with a potbellied stove and church pews, was home to
First Tuesday at one point, with lemonade, coffee and brownies
provided by Lee's wife, Hattie Lorraine.
</P>
<P>
   Lee called it Circle L Ranch. ``We'd sit around and pick and
grin,'' he recalls, adding that the shows, which drew hundreds of
people, grew too large for the building and spilled out onto Main
Street _ a problem that in 1980 forced the relocation of the
concerts to the school, as the street also is Tenn. 68, and
authorities didn't want it blocked for five or six hours every
month.
</P>
<P>
   The concerts lasted about a year after that move (music fan
Luneta Hamby likened the change to ``when they moved the Grand Ole
Opry from Ryman Auditorium to that new thing''), but what great
good they did while they lived, says Lee, noting that they offered
needed diversion to workers and their families during a bitter
strike at the copper company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a blowout for them,'' he says, ``and it helped a lot.''
Moreover, throughout the lifetime of the concerts, ``We realized
that by encouraging the musicians, we'd uncover hidden talents and
have a good time, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of talent, Lee, who admires E.P.'s, says that during
his appearances he ``would very seldom say anything, but he had
music in his blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Still does.
</P>
<P>
   Music you don't leave
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee Waltz'' will always be there, of course, like a
family member. Says Stewart: ``It gives me a measure of
satisfaction to stand up and sing Redd's song. He did a great job
on it, and he was proud of it, and I am of him. We were all happy
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he's still making his own music: ``You don't
leave the music, and it won't leave you.''
</P>
<P>
   During the restaurant session, Stewart, his voice ranging from
baritone to tenor, sings and plays several songs with his son. The
haunting ``Amarillo by Morning,'' as well as ``Oh, Susanna!'' and
``Georgia on My Mind,'' recorded most notably by that soulful
country singer, Ray Charles. The Stewarts perform with
we-know-each-other's-every-move assurance and show pleasure without
straining, voices and music simple and evocative.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of our visit, the father and son team up for an
especially moving interpretation of ``For the Good Times,'' with
Slim starting, ``Don't look so sad; I know it's over. But life goes
on; this old world keeps on turning.'' And ending on ``Make believe
you love me one more time _ for the good times.''
</P>
<P>
   And the old times. Times remembered happy and sad, conjured up
by music unafraid to make you cry.

 &HT;    Americans debating access and sales in wake of Colorado high
school massacre
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bang! You're dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fun in the spirit of Roy Rogers, when the 1950s television
generation pointed their index fingers at each other in pretend
gunfights.
</P>
<P>
   Horrifying in the late 1990s, when young people take real guns
onto school grounds and murder their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The images from Littleton, Colo., last week _ like those from
Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Oregon _ raise difficult
challenges for people of faith who live in a society that says
freedom requires access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 12 classmates and
a teacher and injured many others before taking their own lives in
Columbine High School. The boys apparently gathered weapons,
including semiautomatic guns, for months before carrying out their
acts on April 20, the birthday of Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the shootings, President Clinton proposed
legislation that mandates child-safety locks on all guns sold, bans
for life gun ownership by people who commit violent crimes as
juveniles, and makes adults criminally liable for allowing children
access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   Recent public opinion surveys show that a majority of Americans
want restrictions on firearms sales, particularly handguns, and
favor background checks and waiting periods. They also oppose the
sale of assault weapons and the influx of cheap, often imported
pistols known as Saturday night specials.
</P>
<P>
   But the same polls show that most Americans are opposed to an
outright prohibition of handguns and other firearms.
</P>
<P>
   There is a mystique about firearms apparent in the National
Rifle Association, which is planning a meeting in Denver today just
miles from the site of the latest school massacre. It was apparent
earlier this year when more than 1,400 exhibitors displayed their
wares in the Georgia World Congress Center at the industry's
largest trade show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face facts, a large part of the history of man has been
written with some type of firearms,'' says Atlanta history buff and
gun collector Beverly M. ``Bo'' DuBose III, who, with his father,
assembled a collection of more than 200 Civil War arms. ``If we had
not had the right to bear arms, we would never have gained our
freedom from England.''
</P>
<P>
   But guns also evoke passion and raise moral dilemmas, such as
those being played out in debates in Colorado over concealed
weapons and those in Georgia about Atlanta's plan to sue gun
manufacturers. The debates also go on among people of faith.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Clinton Marsh can still feel his horror at the April
1993 newspaper headline that turned him into an activist against
gun violence: ``2 charged in fatal shooting of toddler, 1, in
apartment.'' The article told of the death of Quanesha Smith, who
was shot in the head while sleeping on a sofa in her family's
Carver Homes apartment when someone fired through the window.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh, 82, a retired Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) minister
living in Atlanta, had read many articles about death by gunfire,
but the image of a sleeping child struck him in a way no other had.
He tried to get fellow ministers organized against gun violence,
but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following summer, Marsh watched the news reports, and
the bodies, pile up. In July, four people were shot in a dice game.
In August, a father was killed by his 14-year-old son. In
September, a ninth-grader was shot to death in a high school
lunchroom.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in October of that year, when a 15-year-old girl died
after being caught in cross fire at a bus stop, others started to
listen. Marsh formed Georgians Against Gun Violence with the
support of several civic and religious groups, including the city's
Concerned Black Clergy, the Presbytery of Greater Atlanta and the
North Georgia United Methodist Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killing of people, whether it's willful or accidental, is
contrary to what Christianity teaches,'' says Marsh. ``We feel
we're trying to save lives, limbs and jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has lobbied unsuccessfully each year in the state
Legislature for stricter gun control.
</P>
<P>
   One of his opponents in influencing the Georgia General Assembly
is a fellow Presbyterian, layman Mark Miller of Cedartown.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 36, says he became a ``life member'' of the Georgia
Sports Shooters Association, the state arm of the National Rifle
Association, about 10 years ago because of the ``assault I saw
taking place on my rights and those of other citizens of this
country.'' The issue that drove him into the arms of the NRA, he
says, was the effort to pass a ban on semiautomatic weapons in
Georgia. The effort failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been quite successful here at stopping almost every
piece of legislation that's come down the pike,'' says Miller.
</P>
<P>
   People with sincere convictions quote conflicting Scriptures,
views of the U.S. Constitution, and even statistics to bolster
their arguments for and against firearms ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose any form of gun regulation cite Luke 22:36 in
which Jesus said anyone who has no sword must buy one. Those who
believe guns must be controlled are more likely to quote the
admonition that anyone who lives by the sword _ or the gun _ will
die by it.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to the Bill of Rights, gun rights advocates
maintain that the Second Amendment ensures the rights of
individuals to bear arms. Those who want restrictions on guns say
it applies only to a public militia.
</P>
<P>
   Many who favor restrictions on guns to curb violence use the
numbers in studies by the Center for Injury Control, a part of
Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. In a study
published last year and including both fatal and nonfatal
shootings, the center found that for every time a gun in the home
was used in a legally justifiable shooting, four were used in
unintentional shootings, seven in criminal assaults or homicides,
and 11 in suicides or attempted suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics are dismissed by gun rights advocates, who are
more likely to look to the work of Gary Kleck, a criminologist at
Florida State University and the author of a book called
``Targeting Guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleck claims Americans use guns 2.5 million times a year in
self-defense. A later national study by one of Kleck's critics
produced a figure of 1.1 million self-defense incidents involving
guns in America each year, including many when guns were drawn but
not fired.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Kellermann of Emory's Center for Injury Control said
studies by his institution and others show that many Americans are
less enamored of guns than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look over a 10- or 15-year time frame, it's pretty
clear that the prevalence of gun ownership _ the percentage of
American households that contain one or more guns _ is dropping,''
said Kellermann. A decade ago, about half of American homes had
guns, he said. Today, that figure is about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``gun-owning households have more
guns than they used to.'' And, more of the guns sold today are
handguns than in the past. Whereas in the 1980s, about a third of
new guns were handguns, today closer to 40 percent to 45 percent
are, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kellermann, regarded as a pioneer in the study of gun violence
as a health issue, became interested in the field in 1984 in a
snack bar at the University of Washington, where he was a medical
fellow. While eating a hamburger, he heard over the radio of the
death of Motown singer Marvin Gaye, who had been shot by his father
in a dispute over insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Kellermann had grown up with guns in rural Tennessee, shooting
skeet with his father on weekends. Now, he said, he was hearing of
too many cases of ``a wife or a kid or a brother or a parent''
being killed in a domestic incident or accident.
</P>
<P>
   On a moral and ethical level, Kellermann, an Episcopalian, said
families should ask whether they are making their households and
their communities safer by owning a gun. When speaking to groups,
he makes the point by asking, ``Which would make you feel safer,
the knowledge that everyone in this room is carrying a concealed
firearm or the knowledge that no one in this room is carrying a
concealed firearm?''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether people choose to own guns, Kellermann says
he hopes people will give serious thought to their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choosing to have a gun, whether you hunt or target shoot or
collect or even perceive that that gun might be useful to you for
defense, is an incredibly important decision,'' says Kellermann.
``It should never be taken lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  34,040 people died from firearms in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  That same year, the last year for which such statistics are
available, 18,166 people used a firearm to commit suicide, 1,134
unintentional firearm deaths were recorded and 14,037 murders were
linked to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Americans own guns at 3 times the average of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Children in the United States are 12 times more likely to die
from firearm injury than are children in other industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  31 states have right-to-carry laws permitting citizens to
carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  84 percent of Americans believe citizens are guaranteed the
right to keep and bear arms under the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  As of 1991, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
reported that in the 1900s, more than 211 million firearms were
manufactured in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There are 230 million guns in the United states, including 75
million to 80 million handguns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The wholesale dollar value of all firearms and ammunition
manufactured in the United States in 1995 was about $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  99.8 percent of firearms and 99.6 percent of handguns will not
be used to commit violent crimes in any given year.

 &HT;    TLC and Monica are his `babies
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, May 2.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While his musical peers are dancing beside their artists in
videos and rapping along with them on record, Dallas Austin is
still the producer hidden neatly in the liner notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very happy being in the background,'' the
28-year-old Columbus native says. ``If I have to be noticed at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the past three years, he really hasn't been. That's when
Austin, who co-produced TLC's new CD, ``FanMail,'' dropped off the
musical radar to write songs for the Atlanta R&AMP;B trio, the
best-selling female group of all time, and establish his Freeworld
Records label.
</P>
<P>
   His labors have met with mixed results. ``FanMail'' made the
second-highest debut of the year in February, becoming the first
No. 1 album for the threesome _ Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins, Rozonda
``Chilli'' Thomas and Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a slower climb for Austin's record label. Freeworld
has signed only one artist, but rapper JT Money's single ``Who
Dat?'' is in the Top 5 on the R&AMP;B and rap charts and debuted at No.
22 on the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   As for other potential artists, well, Austin has been in the
clubs and on the radio asking people to call him if they think they
have talent.
</P>
<P>
   And he's giving them the right number.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if Austin is that 16-year-old student at College
Park's M.D. Collins High School again. That's when he got his first
break as a producer with a local R&AMP;B band named Princess &AMP; Star
Breeze.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up by phone with the multi-Grammy nominee _ who made
million-sellers out of bite-size Atlanta hip-hop act Another Bad
Creation and Boyz II Men _ in a Nashville studio.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are you working in Nashville these days?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a music city. Totally. I mean, here it's not uncommon
for the bag boy at Kroger to be a songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Plus there are so many distractions in Atlanta. When we did ABC,
Atlanta was a new, youthful music scene. But now I've been there a
long time and my identity is kind of out there. And it's really
gotten kind of distracting. Every other minute the phone is
ringing, someone is at the door or outside.
</P>
<P>
   So I started coming here about three or four years ago. It's
just felt comfortable ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Three years ago was when people started asking what was
happening to you. You went from the guy Michael Jackson, Madonna
and the Rolling Stones were calling to the guy we weren't really
hearing from.
</P>
<P>
   A: But people weren't exactly coming up to me asking, ``Where
have you been?'' Just like they don't ask the producers in the
videos with the Rolls-Royces, ``Is that all you're about?'' But
that may be what they're thinking.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been making music. During my so-called time away, I
was working on (R&AMP;B vocalist) N'Dea Davenport and (rock act) Bjork
overseas. And writing for (Atlanta R&AMP;B vocalist) Monica and TLC.
Those are my babies. And when you make that kind of commitment to
an act, you can't just accept every other project that's being
offered to you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was with the talk from Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes about
your almost not being a part of this TLC album?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lisa was out of the loop when she was doing all that talking.
Concentrating on her solo record.
</P>
<P>
   Q: She went on Hot-97.5 and said you had gotten too expensive.
More expensive than Babyface.
</P>
<P>
   A: I am expensive. And that's because I don't go off working on
a lot of people's stuff. My value is in my longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you really asking for $4 million?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was a figure that was out there to do the whole album,
including all the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth about me producing the album came down to
this: I was not coming on to this project to do one single or two.
Not when I've helped build the first two albums. I didn't want to
make `CrazySexyCool' again. Just fill a record with whatever
producer that's hot. I'm glad that `CrazySexyCool' did what it did,
but we want to continue to set trends. Not follow them.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm like the fourth member of TLC. So when ``L.A.'' (Reid,
LaFace co-president) came to me and said, ``We're trying to do this
TLC album. And we want you involved in the whole album,'' we shook
hands on it and left. It wasn't about money.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you worry about how having Chilli's vocals up front on
this record would be perceived? Considering you two are
romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   A: I was just thinking about reinventing the group. Giving the
people something new.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're also reinventing yourself as record label president.
You started out with Rowdy Records, and had some success. And now
you've got Freeworld Records going.
</P>
<P>
   A: And we're starting all over again. See, to me, the fun is
taking the drive to get to your destination. I love what Puff Daddy
and David Geffen have done, and the level they've gotten to in this
business. But I feel like at a certain point consumers can assume
you're too big and untouchable in a sense. That's when you need to
get back out there, get back on the road and find out what's
driving, or moving, the people.

COMMENTARY: PEOPLE OF THE LAW?
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ One of Israel's notable achievements, in the 50
years since the state was reborn, has been the development of a
respected legal system. The Israeli Supreme Court is known for
protecting the civil liberties of citizens. Its judges are esteemed
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   That achievement is at stake in Israel's upcoming elections. To
an extent that is hard for outsiders to appreciate, the very idea
of the rule of law is under attack by substantial forces in Israeli
society.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Avigdor Lieberman, a powerful figure among the one
million Russian immigrants to Israel and the former director
general of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. He has a new
Russian party to compete in the election against Natan Sharansky's
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not one iota of faith in the justice system,''
Lieberman said when he launched his party, calling for the system
to be ``overhauled.'' He has made ferocious attacks on the police _
attacks that the police suggest are designed to deter investigation
of international crime syndicates and his possible connection with
them. He called the head of the international crimes unit, Brig.
Gen. Moshe Mizrahi, a ``champion of anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Orthodox rabbis and their followers also denounce the
Supreme Court. In February, 250,000 Orthodox Israelis held a
protest in Jerusalem against the court.
</P>
<P>
   Judaism over the ages has been a religion devoted to law and its
interpretation by sages. How, then, can one explain Orthodox
antagonism to the Supreme Court?
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down,'' said Mordechai Kremnitzer, professor of law at
Hebrew University, ``many, though not all, want a halachik state''
_ one governed by Jewish law, the halacha. It would be not a
democracy but a theocracy, ruled by rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a straightforward political explanation. Religious
parties have had enormous influence in Israel's multiparty
political system, able to make and unmake governments. They have
used that power to get benefits from the state, such as funds for
their schools and housing.
</P>
<P>
   They view the Supreme Court as a threat to that position: the
one institution that might curb their privileged treatment. The
court lately held, for example, that no statute authorizes the
practice of automatically exempting all yeshiva students from
military service so long as they do not take jobs _ a practice that
has led to many thousands of permanent students, financed by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the rule of law has come to a head now over the
case of Aryeh Deri. He is the political leader of Shas, a religious
party made up largely of Jews from Morocco. Deri has long been a
kingmaker in Israeli politics, bringing Shas into coalitions in
return for promises of favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial that extended over nine years, Deri was convicted
recently of taking bribes while in office, and sentenced to four
years in prison. His followers responded by claiming he was
victimized because he was Orthodox and Moroccan: ``Deri is
Dreyfus.''
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual leader of Shas, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, said: ``The
words of the Torah are as a thorn in the eyes of all the secular
judges. This accounts for what happened at the trial.'' Deri put
out a video comparing his trial, amazingly, to that of Adolf
Eichmann.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of other politicians to Deri's conviction has been
telling. Netanyahu said he would still negotiate with Deri, after
the election, so long as he remained free during an appeal. The
leading opposition candidate for prime minister, Ehud Barak, said
after some delay that he would not negotiate with Deri.
</P>
<P>
   The taint of possible criminality reaches into the Netanyahu
Cabinet. The police have reportedly recommended prosecution of the
foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, for fraud, bribery and witness
tampering. The minister of justice, Tzahi Hanegbi, is also being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   All this has brought the rule of law into the election. In the
bribery scandals, and Netanyahu's silence about the Deri
conviction, legal observers see the danger of what one called a
culture of illegalism in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot kill the rule of law with one shot,'' professor
Kremnitzer said, ``the way Prime Minister Rabin was killed. You
kill it with a process _ by showing the public that there's a
different law for a Deri who takes bribes.''

CURBS SOUGHT ON POLLUTION BY SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has approved strict federal rules
to control pollution from the tailpipes of automobiles and end the
special treatment for sport utility vehicles for the first time
since federal emissions standards were drafted in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Government and industry officials said the long-awaited
decision, which Clinton is to announce in his weekly radio address
on Saturday, would force oil companies to produce cleaner fuel and
compel automakers to redesign their engines and install larger
catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry warned that gasoline prices could rise up to 6
cents a gallon as a result. The auto industry said prices could
rise by hundreds of dollars for some automobiles, particularly
large sport utility vehicles, which tend to pollute the most.
</P>
<P>
   But David Cohen, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection
Agency, said the regulations would add no more than 1 or 2 cents to
the price of a gallon of gasoline, an extra $100 for a new car and
an extra $200 for a new sport utility vehicle, minivan or pickup
truck. While the effect on gasoline prices may be lasting,
technological advances should reduce the extra auto costs over
time, Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are meant to address two broad trends that are
threatening to reverse decades of improvements in air quality.
Americans are driving more miles each year. At the same time, cars
are gradually being replaced by light trucks, a category that
includes sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks. Under
current rules, light trucks are allowed to emit up to several times
more smog-causing gases per mile than cars.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have given special treatment to light trucks
ever since the earliest emissions rules were imposed in the 1970s,
when they reasoned that light trucks were mainly used by small
businesses for difficult tasks like hauling building materials
across construction sites. But sales of light trucks have soared in
recent years and now account for half of all new automobile
purchases by families, mainly because of the popularity of sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations would tighten pollution standards somewhat
for cars and minivans built in the 2007 model year and afterward.
Virtually all sport utility vehicles and pickups would have to meet
these same tighter standards by the 2009 model year, auto industry
officials said. For some of the larger sport utility vehicles, like
the Chevrolet Tahoe, this would mean a 93 percent reduction in
allowable pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles already on the road by then would not be affected by
the emissions standards, but they would pollute less with the
cleaner gasoline, which would be required starting in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules will be issued for public comment on Monday. The
product of months of strenuous lobbying already, the rules are
unlikely to be changed much, if at all, before becoming official at
the end of this year. Congress could pass legislation to change the
rules, but this could be politically difficult and would probably
face a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules do not cover Suburban full-sized sport utility
vehicles with four-wheel drive or the even larger Excursion sport
utility that Ford Motor Co. plans to put on sale this autumn. These
vehicles are so huge, weighing as much as two midsized sedans or
three small cars, that they are exempt from the weight-based
emissions rules that the government has used for decades. As a
result, the administration will also invite public suggestions on
how to regulate these huge vehicles, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's approach has divided the oil industry and
the auto industry. The rules will force oil companies to refine
their gasoline to remove virtually all sulfur, which clogs
catalytic converters. This will make it much easier for automakers
to design low-emissions vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Auto lobbyists said Friday that they generally supported the new
standards because of the sulfur provisions, while adding that it
was not yet clear whether building such clean sport utility
vehicles was technologically feasible. But oil industry lobbyists
denounced the administration's plan as unnecessarily stringent and
expensive, particularly because it would include gasoline sales in
rural areas with good air quality.
</P>
<P>
   While some environmentalists said they had wanted the crackdown
on sport utility vehicles to come sooner, most were delighted with
the administration's action.

3 CAPTURED U.S. SERVICEMEN MEET WITH JACKSON DELEGATION IN
BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Mich.)   (SUBS to shorten 19th graf beginning ``Stone, who x x x '' and to

 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE Yugoslavia _ The three U.S. servicemen held by
Yugoslavia described on Friday their days as lonely and monotonous,
interrupted only by perfunctory daily visits from a Serb army
officer and solitary exercise in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   They said they have no contact with each other or with other
prisoners in the same facility. One said he took a walk Friday
outside his cell, only the second time he had been allowed to do so
in his month-long imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Another said he was finally given reading material Friday, but
the books were on Serb history and the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   With the chairman of the military court monitoring the questions
through a Yugoslav army interpreter and a military cameraman
recording their answers, the three young soldiers were allowed to
speak to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Congressman Rod Blagojevich of
Illinois, and a reporter from The New York Times. They were filmed
by CNN.
</P>
<P>
   When they were given the opportunity to send messages to their
families, each of the soldiers turned to face the camera directly
and seemed, suddenly, very young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope it's all over soon,'' said Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of
Huntsville, Texas. ``Mom, Dad, sorry I put you through so much pain
and agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., was
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my wife Tricia and my son Ryan, I love you,'' he said, his
face reddening and his eyes filling with tears. He stopped and
seemed unable to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Blagojevich, a Serbian-American Democrat whose father was raised
in Yugoslavia, seized the uneasy moment, bringing a smile to the
young soldier's face by saying that as a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, he was going to make sure the captives receive
a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, could spend only
a few minutes with the visitors because an air raid siren sounded
just before he was brought into the room, and the Yugoslav military
officers tried to hustle the visitors out.
</P>
<P>
   After pleas from Jackson, he was sent in with his two fellow
soldiers for a final photo shoot and time in front of the
television camera. He had time to do little more than send
greetings to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks everybody for all your thoughts and prayers,'' Ramirez
said. ``They've been needed and they're a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the delegation that met the soldiers, as well as
the length of the meeting, was decided by the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   The visit lasted about 40 minutes. The three soldiers, who had
been seen publicly only once shortly after they were captured along
the Kosovo-Macedonia border, were brought one at a time into a room
at the Belgrade Military Court building, just over the Sava River
from downtown Belgrade, at about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities refused to say where the soldiers are being held
and permitted them to answer only those questions that concerned
their living conditions and their health. The Yugoslav government
also specified that only two journalists and two members of
Jackson's interfaith delegation to Belgrade, which includes several
members of the clergy who had been in contact with the prisoners'
families, could meet the servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, dressed in their laundered U.S. Army camouflage
uniforms, appeared nervous and anxious and sat straight in their
armchairs. They wore their battered Army-issue boots without the
laces, which they said had been taken away by their captors.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were well-fed and had no medical problems and
appeared fit, if tense.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was the first to be brought into the small office of the
general supervising the visit. He appeared tired, with dark circles
under his eyes, and still had a bruise on his forehead, which he
said ``is a mark from our capture.'' He added that he had received
medical attention for the injury immediately after being taken into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who received the reading material Friday, said he had
only briefly ``caught sight'' of his fellow GIs during his
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who appeared more rested than the others, ventured the
most elaborate description of his condition. Responding to a
question from Jackson, he said he was ``okay, considering the
circumstances.'' He added that he is also feeling ``a little
mentally drained.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told him, ``You are a hero. People know you all over the
world.''

<P>
   The clergy who came from the United States with Jackson, but
were barred from meeting with the soldiers, had brought bibles and
small Orthodox icons for each of the men, as well as five packages
of Chuckles candies for Ramirez, a tape player and cassette tapes
recorded by each of the men's families.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson showed each of the soldiers the pile of gifts, but the
Yugoslav general, who would not identify himself, did not allow the
soldiers to take the gifts with them, saying they had to pass
military censors first.
</P>
<P>
   To each of the servicemen, though, Jackson offered words of
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many view the jail experience as a time of reflection, a
time to write, a time to think, a time to pray, a time to think
about how they want to build their lives,'' he told Stone, adding
that his imprisonment could be an opportunity to strengthen his
character and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of our scars,'' he said, ``come our stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The men, members of the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry of the 1st
Infantry Division operating in Macedonia, were on patrol when they
were captured at about 4 p.m. on March 31. The government here has
maintained they were seized in Kosovo, although U.S. officials have
accused the Serbs of abducting them and have demanded their
release.
</P>
<P>
   The dazed soldiers, with bruises and dirt on their faces, were
shown on Serb television soon after their capture. The Yugoslav
authorities at first talked of putting the three on trial, although
some government officials have since retracted the threat. However,
the general who supervised the interview with the soldiers
suggested that a trial remains under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The procedure for the indictment has not been in any way
initiated and possible evidence is still being collected,'' he
said, in laying down the limits on what could and could not be
asked of the soldiers. ``And it has to be yet decided whether an
indictment will be raised at all. But until then all matters
pertinent to possible investigation should not be dealt with at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the general also said the three soldiers are prisoners
of war and are being treated in accordance with the Geneva
Convention. The men received their first visit from the
International Red Cross only this week. The general said a
representative of the European and Balkans branch of the Red Cross
also met them, but he did not say when that meeting took place.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who arrived in Belgrade on Thursday with a group of
American Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders, said he still hopes
to persuade the Yugoslav government to release the soldiers as a
humanitarian gesture. He said after the interviews with the men
that he still had no indication that they would be freed. Jackson
and his delegation have met twice with the Yugoslav foreign
minister, Zivadan Jovanovic, and are scheduled to meet President
Slobodan Milosevic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The general's comments indicated that the Yugoslav authorities
may consider it gesture enough to have approved a visit with the
soldiers. He called the arrangement ``out of the ordinary,
especially considering the air raid possibility and air strikes at
any moment.'' Indeed, the interviews with the soldiers were cut
short when an air raid siren wailed outside the window after about
40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are to take this as a gesture of good will by the Foreign
Ministry of our country,'' he told Jackson. ``Because as you are
probably well aware after the aggression by NATO on our country,
three U.S. citizens have been apprehended, having been found on
Yugoslav territory in U.S. uniforms and with arms in hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' final moment with their visitors was spent in
prayer. With his arm around Ramirez and Gonzales, and with Stone
standing close to his side, Jackson thanked God for watching over
the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help is on the way and hope is in the air and soon, very soon
you will know peace and family,'' he said, before the men filed out
of the room, holding their hands behind their backs.

RADIO EPISODES GO BEYOND THE `STAR WARS' TRILOGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By JON GERUNG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Long ago (well, December 1979), in an efficiency
apartment far away (North Hollywood, actually) Brian Daley sat down
to write the script for the radio adaptation of ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact it would have in the audio galaxy was almost as big
as the film had in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Radio's golden age may have faded with the demise of shows like
``The Shadow'' and ``Suspense,'' but, thanks to public
broadcasting, commuter boredom and the Internet, a silver age of
audio drama _ boosted by ``Star Wars'' _ seems to be dawning.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're saying so what, consider this: It was George Lucas
himself who sold the radio rights to ``Star Wars'' to his alma
mater, USC, for a buck because he loved the medium, says Tom
Voegli, who produced all three of the radio adaptations (``Star
Wars,'' ``The Empire Strikes Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi'').
</P>
<P>
   Voegli says that while there are several ``Star Wars'' offshoots
from toys to other audiotapes, Lucas considers the movies and radio
dramas the official ``Star Wars'' canon.
</P>
<P>
   After USC partnered up with National Public Radio for additional
funding, Voegli and director John Madden were brought in to create
the 13 half-hour segments.
</P>
<P>
   Madden's been making a splash of his own lately: He directed the
Oscar-winning ``Shakespeare in Love.'' But in the late '70s, the
BBC sent him to work for NPR in Minnesota, where he met Voegli, and
they became close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``John directed all three of the radio adaptations, including
`Return of the Jedi,' which was only done about four years ago,''
says Voegli.
</P>
<P>
   Madden has said people thought it was crazy to adapt a
special-effects-dependent film for radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, they miss the point that it'll be, in a way, better
to do it on radio, because the effects will be stunning. Sound
effects are very evocative ... you can sit at home and have the
whole galaxy whizzing around your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Voegli sees ``Star Wars'' radio appeal differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what really brought a lot of the fans to the radio
productions is that there are scenes that aren't in the films. So
that there's new material. I think that's part of the secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley, who died of cancer after the completion of ``Return of
the Jedi,'' wrote more than 30 new scenes into the radio adaptation
of ``Star Wars.'' He called them the ``lost scenes,'' some of which
were in Lucas' original script, while others were there to fill in
the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was run by the story editors at Lucasfilm to make
sure it fit properly into the ``Star Wars'' universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``And most of that new material lives in a dramatic area that
radio does very well, which is the relatively more quiet,
reflective scenes,'' says Voegli.
</P>
<P>
   He points to a segment in ``The Empire Strikes Back'' that's not
in the film, where Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are huddled in a
tent on the ice planet of Hoth wondering if they will ever be
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really terrific scene because of the two of them
talking in a very intimate tone ... it's a very wonderful radio
point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Voegli admits, though, that dramatic scenes don't work as well.
``We have to be much more deliberate, telling people where they
are, such as describing a battle scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, a groundbreaking special effects tour de force, was
also a landmark film in terms of its soundtrack, due to John
Williams' stirring score and Ben Burtt's amazing sound design.
</P>
<P>
   Voegli built up the radio adaptation from scratch using the
basic sound design from the film and the music, which is authentic
though highly re-edited. He relied on the Lucasfilm library.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their roles of Luke
Skywalker and C3P0, respectively. Harrison Ford was off doing a
little film called ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' and Perry King took
over the role of Han.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that radio drama is really fun for
people,'' says Voegli. ``For the actors, it's a hoot. They don't
have to memorize lines. It challenges their ability to tell the
truth in dialogue in a way that film and stage don't, with just
vocal characteristics. And it's fun, and they're sort of in and
out, so people of major stature are happy to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamill says he tried things on the radio series that he never
would have tried in front of the camera. ``In radio, what you say
and how you say it has to reflect the action of the story. For
example, if I'm supposed to be hanging from a weather vane, I put
myself in that position. You can't worry about how foolish you
look, because people won't see that. What matters is how your voice
comes across the air.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Star Wars'' debuted on NPR in 1980 there was a 40 percent
increase in the overall audience plus an unprecedented number of
letters and calls. There was a similar response for ``The Empire
Strikes Back,'' but years later when it came to ``Return of the
Jedi'' Highbridge Audio in Minnesota stepped in for what was one of
the most expensive audio ventures ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely one of the top two,'' says Voegli, ``and I
don't know what's No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Neall, a vice president and general manager at
Highbridge, puts it in perspective. ``This isn't even the same
animal as a book on tape. A typical book on tape of about three
hours costs about $10,000,'' she says. ```Return of the Jedi' cost
about $350,000. It's a huge difference. It's got all the bells and
whistles in terms of technology, 24 tracks instead of two tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, Voegli and Daley again were brought in, and they
returned to the same studio in Hollywood. There were other
characters by this time. Ed Asner played Jabba the Hutt, John
Lithgow was Yoda, and Billy Dee Williams was Lando Calrissian.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cost, ``Jedi'' has turned a profit, says Neall, and
recently has gotten a bump in sales thanks to the upcoming
``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one sad note. Daley died of pancreatic cancer the day
the production wrapped on ``Return of the Jedi.'' Voegli thinks
Daley hung on to make sure everything was all right. ``Star Wars''
was important to Daley, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept a picture of him on the computer post-production system
while it was put together,'' says Voegli.
</P>
<P>
   So, will there be a radio version of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _
The Phantom Menace''? Lucasfilm isn't saying, although Voegli says
he and Madden are willing to do one. And the original ``Star Wars''
and ``Empire'' might not even be rebroadcast on public radio after
September, when their agreement with Lucasfilm runs out, says Andy
Trudeau, executive producer of culture programming on NPR.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau says NPR has asked Lucasfilm about renewing the
broadcast rights but has not heard back. In the meantime, NPR will
release ``Star Wars'' and ``Empire'' to local station during the
summer. KCRW-FM (89.9), which has run them in the past, was unsure
if it would air it.
</P>
<P>
   All three, as well as ``Star Wars'' offshoot series, are
available on CD or cassette from Highbridge (800-755-8532), as well
as from local bookstores.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ When NATO bombed residential areas of
Belgrade for the first time early Friday morning, two errant
missiles, meant for military office buildings, hit houses instead.
</P>
<P>
   Dejan Filipovic, 26, was in his upstairs bedroom on Miruliceva
Street when a missile nearly blew him out of the window.
</P>
<P>
   He scrambled out the rest of the way, over the wreckage of the
Zlatni Ovan restaurant, the Golden Goat, breaking only his leg,
said his sister, Alexandra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the living room and Dejan was upstairs,'' Alexandra
said, pulling at the sleeves of her sweatshirt as she shifted
through the rubble. ``My mother went through the window and I
followed her, but my father stayed because my brother was upstairs.
When he realized Dejan was alive, he climbed out, too. And then it
all collapsed, and we all thought we were very lucky to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Branko Filipovic, her uncle, said: ``These are crazy people to
do this _monsters. There's no military building here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra, an economics student, laughed harshly. ``This is one
of the `mistakes' of NATO,'' she said with all the venom she could
muster. ``It's just another of those `mistakes.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced that the air war against
Yugoslavia had entered the ``domination phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton described improving weather and said NATO had planned
670 air sorties through the day and night. ``So today's a big
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly seemed that way in Belgrade, which had its worst
night of bombing, coupled with a presumably unrelated earthquake
about 5:30 a.m. People joked that ``if NATO doesn't get you, an
earthquake will.''
</P>
<P>
   After the earthquake, one shaken person interviewed on Studio B
radio said: ``Nothing can surprise us now. Only Armageddon,
maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deep percussion of high explosives lasted for hours, as
NATO chose targets in the heart of Belgrade _ the massive paired
1970s-era buildings of the Defense Ministry and Army General Staff
Headquarters, just across the street from the elegant Foreign
Ministry, and the federal Interior Ministry, which had seemed to be
pretty effectively destroyed earlier in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Four people died, none of them in the houses that were destroyed
in the Vracar district, near the Kalenic market, one of the city's
largest. At least one police officer died; he had been doing guard
duty by the Interior Ministry, officials said. At least 37 people
were hurt; 13 of them seriously. But officials insisted that the
Defense and Army buildings had been emptied of workers weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, the scene around the buildings was somber and
eerie, as shocked Belgraders picked their way over a carpet of
broken glass and shattered masonry.
</P>
<P>
   Some gathered on the corners to stare, speaking in hushed
voices; others walked along fixedly. Some stopped to pick up a bit
of shrapnel and put it in their pockets. Some diplomats, who had
come to work to find their windows blown in all over their offices,
milled around outside, staring at the shrapnel pockmarks gouged out
of the sculpted stones of the facade.
</P>
<P>
   Workmen with long straw brooms swept the sidewalks and streets,
making little heaps of glistening, broken trash before shoveling
them into trucks to cart away.
</P>
<P>
   The oddest sight was of other city workers carefully pulling the
weeds from the dirt around trees _ some of which had bent or broken
in the blast _ as if a long-ordered city beautification project was
being carried out on schedule amid the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really makes me angry is the Foreign Ministry,'' said a
passer-by named Ilija. ``It's one of the most beautiful buildings
in the city, and it's like the old civic Belgrade is being
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry, begun in 1903 and finished in 1936, has
lovely arches and windows, with a marble reception area now left
open to the elements. Pretty iron bollards on the sidewalks had
been broken off and elegant street lights bent or severed.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats had made nervous jokes in recent weeks about being
across the street from such likely targets. The huge defense
buildings, faced with pink stone, were known as Sutjeska, after a
Bosnian mountain where Tito fought a grand battle in 1943 and was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something shocking about the home of Yugoslav
diplomacy being shattered in this remote-control war, an irony
immediately seized upon by the ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic,
who noted that the bombing occurred only hours before the arrival
of the Russian special envoy for the Balkans, Victor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO wants to bury under concrete and steel, under the debris,
not only the civilian victims but the idea of a diplomatic
settlement itself,'' Vujovic said. ``This is an attack on diplomacy
as a method to solve the crisis in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Vracar district, an end to the war seemed quite far away.
The history of bombing cities in this century is a mixed one, but
tends to reinforce patriotism and anger, not diminish it.
</P>
<P>
   Branko Filipovic had nothing but imprecations for NATO. ``This
will go on until they have the mercy to stop it,'' he said. ``If
the international community does nothing, we won't exist. But we
won't give up Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra said: ``I think they cannot know our people and our
life here. We're a small country but educated and proud. We're
proud to live in this city and we're proud to be Serbs and we will
stay proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she laughed, describing how her uncle often slept in their
house, because he lives so close to the Defense Ministry. ``He
slept here for 10 days, thinking it was safer,'' she said. ``And
now they're both destroyed. Only five minutes before our street was
hit, he called us and said everything is smoke and dust.''

 &HT;    The ultimate tune-up
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Robert Sewak, Ph.D., has some far-out
cures he can't wait to tell you about. So please, have a seat in
his music studio. And try to keep an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   You see, your organs each emit their own vibrations or sounds,
Dr. Bob explains as you ease into an old green recliner. Together,
those vibrations form a ``fundamental tone'' or musical note for
your body. And keeping your mind and body in harmony by exposing
them to music can do wonders for your health, he says.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, that's a vintage, 1943 La-Z-Boy rocker you're
sitting in. And _ whoa _ it's starting to vibrate to the chimes of
New Age music coming from . . . somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bob, as friends and patients call Sewak, evidently has
flicked a switch hidden behind his chair to make a point about
vibration. Transducers send the musical tones buzzing through your
body. He keeps talking, though, deadpan, as if nothing's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is totally noninvasive. You can't overdose on it,''
Sewak says. His voice is deep, smooth and hypnotic. The musical
tones _ ding-dong _ ripple through the La-Z-Boy, making your eyes
and fingers tingle.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bob, who works out of an old house in Delray Beach, explains
how he's expanded students' reasoning skills by exposing them to
Mozart. He explains how chanting, the basis of shamanism, can heal
the body. And he tells how ``guided imagery,'' visualization
exercises put to music, has improved his patients' mental health.
</P>
<P>
   He can remedy much of what ails you, he says, using CDs,
synthesizers or voice exercises. Using gadgets here in The (Voice)
Academy, as his clinic is known, he can pinpoint your fundamental
tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through your ears and skin, sound resonates through your
body,'' he says. ``I'll let you `experience' your voice.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the chair stops vibrating. A feeling of calm washes
over you. Step this way, Bob says. He wants to show you something
new.
</P>
<P>
   You're now standing in a sunny back room, near a black keyboard
synthesizer and racks of CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thought precedes any sound you make with your voice,'' Dr. Bob
says, and any thought will skew the tone of your voice. To find
your ``fundamental'' tone or note, you must emit one of the two
sounds you don't trigger with thought: a sigh or a yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Breathe in deeply, then exhale, he instructs. Good. Again. When
you're relaxed, he says, sigh slightly on the exhale without
influencing the tone.
</P>
<P>
   You do, and Dr. Bob is there, gently holding a sensor for an
electronic tuning device _ about the size of beeper _ on your neck
near your voice box. He has you breathe and sigh again, placing the
sensor near your chest and then your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   You're an F sharp, the tuning device says (your tone might
actually be something else, but for the sake of illustration, let's
go with F sharp).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bob slips behind the keyboard and tells you to rest your
palms on the speakers. ``Tell me which of these tones you find
stimulating, depressing, irritating or pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Without telling you the notes, he blasts out a series of chords
that reverberate up your arms and down through your abdomen. The
notes all sound OK. But one definitely feels irritating, another
depressing, another stimulating.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant, warm-feeling chord _ an F sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Bob spends hours compiling libraries of songs in keys that match
your tone and can stimulate your body and mind back into
``harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   He also urges patients to try chanting their note themselves and
try to guide the vibration through their bodies to remedy anything
from a cold to constipation.
</P>
<P>
   (Still with us?)
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to dismiss Dr. Bob as eccentric or ``New Age''
if science didn't already support some of his music-therapy
concepts. And Sewak seems to know his stuff: bachelor's degree in
music education and voice; master's degree in psychology; Ph.D. in
voice pathology; all from decent schools.
</P>
<P>
   Research on sound therapy is relatively new. But a number of
findings indicate music can work like drugs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore found that 30
minutes of classical music played in the critical-care unit
produced the same effect as 10 milligrams of Valium.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1980 study of disabled children in Norway found that a
``musical bath'' reduced spasms and and increased the range of
movement in their spines, arms, hips and legs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists at the University of California at Irvine confirmed
that students who listened to Mozart performed better on
spatial-reasoning IQ tests. Music therapists like Sewak already had
been experimenting with what's now known as the ``Mozart effect''
on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a profound relationship between music and the
human body and mind, Dr. Bob says.
</P>
<P>
   Take a seat in that tall chair over there.
</P>
<P>
   Got any problems or issues you'd like to deal with better each
day?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, you've been stressed lately, with dozens of urgent
tasks pulling you in all directions. You need help focusing.
</P>
<P>
   Close your eyes, Dr. Bob says. Breathe deeply. You hear him
fiddling briefly with with a plastic CD case.
</P>
<P>
   From the stereo flows Samuel Barber's ``Adagio for Strings.'' In
his mellow voice, Dr. Bob walks you through a visualization
exercise. The dramatic music triggers an emotional connection with
your mental picture, the way a music score adds drama to a movie
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Picture the list of all the things you have to do today . . .
now imagine doing the one thing you need to do first ... now you're
holding a mound of cool, wet clay . . . you're sculpting it,
spinning it . . . and it begins to form a vessel . . . now you take
all the other things on your list . . . you place them in the
vessel . . . you close the clay over those other things . . . and
you set the clay aside . . .
</P>
<P>
   The music ends. You feel relaxed, focused.
</P>
<P>
   You've just experienced ``guided imagery,'' an old technique
boosted by the power of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to health is harmony,'' Dr. Bob says.

ISRAEL'S PRIME-TIME POLEMICS HEAT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Interior Ministry is a gray institution, a
well-worn, humdrum place of civil servants, paper piles and rubber
stamps. But this week it grabbed the Israeli public by the lapels
in a way that nothing has thus far in a personality-based campaign
for the election May 17.
</P>
<P>
   In catchy, hard-hitting television commercials, the Russian
immigrant party led by Natan Sharansky demanded that it be given
control of the Interior Ministry, long controlled by the
ultra-Orthodox, Sephardic Shas Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas is in control? No! We are in control,'' says the slogan,
which rhymes in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   In power circles, the position of defense minister is considered
most important in a security-alert state like Israel. But it is the
job of Interior Minister that is being fought over _ by Shas, the
Russian party and Meretz, the big party on the left.
</P>
<P>
   In a society torn over the relationship between religion and
state, the Interior Ministry controls birth registry, marriage,
divorce and identification cards _ rituals of ordinary life that
define who is a Jew or how Jewish the Jew is.
</P>
<P>
   The ads feature individuals whose right to citizenship was
challenged because the Interior Ministry raised questions about
their Jewishness. A Russian balladeer talks about the songs he used
to write in Russia about the promised land. ``I did not dream of
the humiliation I'd go through in Israel,'' he said, referring to
when his family was forced to take blood tests to prove they were
related _ and Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Deri, the leader of Shas, who was recently convicted on
corruption charges stemming from his tenure as interior minister,
proclaimed that it was war between the new immigrants from Russia,
who he said were given ``red-carpet treatment,'' and the Sephardic
immigrants of the 1950s, whose absorption was ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   His words made it clear that the Russians have reason to doubt
that they are accepted. ``We absorbed hundreds of thousands of
Russian immigrants with joy, despite my being interior minister,
even though I knew, to my regret, that hundreds of thousands were
goyim,'' Deri said, using a slur for non-Jews. ``We understood
there was no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cities like Ashkelon and Ashdod,'' he continued, referring
to places with large Russian populations, ``there are entire
quarters where you think you are in little Russia _ churches and
shops selling pork, a completely different culture, and we don't
say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A Spirited Political Moment
</P>
<P>
   It is a shame that Rabbi David Batzri is not running for office,
because his ratings were high this week for the way he went about
getting rid of a dybbuk.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jerusalem yeshiva, Batzri, who specializes in mystical
Judaism, claimed to have coaxed the dybbuk, or spirit, out of
Yehudit Sigvatker, 38. It was said to be her late husband, as
possessive after life as during it.
</P>
<P>
   As if it were a soccer game, the four-hour exorcism was
broadcast live, with commentary, on the pirate religious radio
stations. Clips from a videotape found their way onto evening news
broadcasts. Israel was gripped.
</P>
<P>
   The low voice of a man issued from Mrs. Sigvatker. The voice
said he was floating between heaven and hell ``after three months
in intensive care,'' and discussed his children. When the rabbi
asked whether Deri, the Shas leader convicted of corruption, was
innocent, the voice said he is guilty, until the rabbi grew
agitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave via the small toe on the left foot,'' the rabbi ordered.
</P>
<P>
   A Symbolic Party Battle
</P>
<P>
   The catchiest visuals in this week's political ads came from the
religious parties. The National Religious Party featured a knitted
yarmulke, like a coiled rope, unraveling. The ultra-Orthodox
parties, whose symbol is the Hebrew letter gimel, introduced a
cartoon version of the gimel, bending in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Of Horses, Carts and Apes
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Likud Party have been grumbling that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is campaigning solely for himself and not for
the party's Parliament ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eitan, a leading Likudnik, spoke bluntly, if
metaphorically, about this feeling. The campaign, he said, was
putting ``the horse before the cart without checking to make sure
the cart was well fastened.'' He also criticized Deri, an ally of
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   He got his in return. Doron Shmueli, a Likud colleague, said
Eitan has ``the brain of an ape.''
</P>
<P>
   Propaganda by the Hour
</P>
<P>
   Political advertising is not presented in Israel as it is in the
United States. It runs in a block of time every night for the three
weeks before elections. Israelis sit down and watch ``the
propaganda hour,'' when Labor ads spill into Likud spots, which
tumble into promos for the new marijuana smokers' party (whose
producers seemed to have inhaled).
</P>
<P>
   Likud presents Netanyahu in two poses. First he is Franklin D.
Roosevelt, in an armchair, as if fireside, wearing a V-neck
sweater. Then he is Theodor Herzl, on a balcony, gazing out at
Jerusalem, in an echo of the famous pose of Herzl, the father of
political Zionism, in Basel.
</P>
<P>
   Labor shows Netanyahu in a different light. In their desire to
show him as untrustworthy, Labor partisans use a shot of the prime
minister on the floor of Parliament, swiveling in his chair and
winking at someone off screen. The wink is a recurring motif.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Ehud Barak, the Labor Party candidate and a former
general, is introduced as a ``warrior for peace,'' with many images
of him in uniform and medals. By the end of the week, Ofer Shelah,
a writer for the newspaper Maariv, said, ``If I see Barak
liberating the Sabena airline once again I will open fire in all
directions.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials bore Russian subtitles, indicative of a stark
political reality: in a country where many people are born Labor or
Likud, the swing votes are seen as belonging to the newest
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Early this week, a skit on the satire show ``Hartzufim'' showed
all the candidates in tutus. They were dancing ``Swan Lake'' for
the Russian prime minister.

 LITTLETON, Colo.: appropriate respect.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   That respect was thrown to the winds on the morning of April 20,
when Gardner responded to a call of gunfire at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The first police officer to encounter the attackers, Gardner has
described how a man he believed was Harris fired a fusillade of
about 10 rounds of semiautomatic rifle fire at his patrol car. The
sheriff's deputy has said that he fired back four or five shots,
then jumped behind a nearby Blazer and fired another three or five
times.
</P>
<P>
   Before retreating into the school, Harris apparently raked the
Blazer with another volley, shattering the windshield and rear view
mirrors and sending bullets ricocheting underneath the car. The
deputy, one of two policemen to fire at the assailants, was not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, officials said they had identified the person who
furnished the young men with the semiautomatic handgun, a Tec-DC9.
Dave Thomas, the county district attorney, said that investigators
had interviewed the last owner of the gun, as well as the pizza
store employee who apparently served as a go between.
</P>
<P>
   This high-powered 9mm pistol, the district attorney confirmed,
went from the manufacturer in Miami to a wholesaler in Illinois, to
a gun shop in a suburb north of Denver, to a gun show outside of
Denver last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of a handgun to a minor is a federal offense. Klebold
died at age 17. Harris turned 18 on April 9. The district attorney
hinted that arrests could be made in the gun case in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Crime laboratory technicians are conducting ballistics tests to
determine which guns fired the fatal shots. If bullets fired by the
Tec-DC9 did not kill anyone, the gun seller may face charges only
of illegal gun peddling, rather than being implicated in the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities said Friday that they still had not
talked to the parents of the two suspects. The parents hired
lawyers the day after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   For the living, Columbine students picked up their class
schedules Friday at Chatfield High School, long an athletic
archrival. On Friday, a new banner greeted the Columbine students:
``Rivals No More. Friends Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Some high school students have pledged to channel their grief
into a demonstration Saturday morning against the National Rifle
Association, which is holding its annual meeting in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short term, we want to show the NRA that we are not going to
be receptive,'' said Ben Gelt, an 18-year-old Denver high school
senior who has leafleted about 20 area high schools for the
protest. Referring to victims of gun violence, he said, ``If there
are a lot of kids there, it will show them that today's young
people, who are tomorrow's leaders, are not going to stand for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Friday, Wellington Webb, who faces
reelection as Denver's mayor next week, called on the gun group
``to cancel or postpone out of respect for the grieving families of
Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the angry atmosphere following the shootings, there have been
a series of threats _ bomb threats to the hotel where the NRA
members arrived Friday for their convention, and death threats to
the Klebold family. Doug Dean, a Colorado Springs state
representative who sponsored a bill this spring to loosen rules on
the granting of concealed weapons permits, has said that he has
received so many telephone threats that he may leave politics.
Dean, a Republican, is the House majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as a cold rain fell on a county park adjacent to the
school, a massive, spontaneous memorial was temporarily wrapped in
long swatches of white plastic sheeting. Famous worldwide, the
memorial has started attracting pilgrims from outside Denver.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Martin Luther King III, a son of the civil rights
leader, quietly walked among the rows of flowers, handmade
placards, artwork, poetry inscriptions, votive candles and teddy
bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation is judged by how it treats its most precious
resource, and our most precious resource are our children,'' said
King, who came here from Atlanta to attend the funeral of Isaiah
Shoels. ``This kind of behavior shows we are not treating our
children justly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Vice President Al Gore brought a bouquet to the
park. On Tuesday, it was the turn of Sarah Ferguson, the dutchess
of York. She said that the massive outpouring of popular mourning
reminded her of the public response to the death of her
sister-in-law, Diana, the Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has the feel of Kensington Palace,'' she said as
she surveyed the damp field of bouquets. ``Everyone was there to
pay their respects. It certainly feels like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Historical Society has established an agreement
with county park officials to start removing the memorial on May
10. Each item that can be saved is to be cataloged and warehoused.
Some pieces may go into a traveling exhibit. Others may be
integrated into a permanent memorial at the site.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One month after their battered faces were beamed
around the world, three American soldiers held captive in
Yugoslavia were shown meeting Friday in Belgrade with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, bearing encouraging words, the Holy Bible and
letters from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling pretty healthy, a little mentally drained,'' one
prisoner, Army Spc. Steven Gonzales told Jackson. ``Really miss
home, and hope to be back soon.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes welling up with tears, a second captive, Staff Sgt.
Christopher Stone turned toward a camera recording the meeting to
address his wife and four-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my wife, Tricia and my son, Ryan, 'I love you,''' said
Stone, struggling with his emotions before breaking into a broad
grin.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's visit -- televised by the Cable News Network (CNN) --
appeared to be part of a charm offensive launched by Serb leader
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, who also granted
an international news agency an extensive interview Friday in the
face of the most withering NATO air strikes since the campaign
began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's meeting marked the first time the American soldiers
have been shown on camera since state-run media in Yugoslavia
released footage of them April 1 -- with bruised faces and downcast
eyes -- the day after Serb forces captured them near Kosovo's
border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The men said they were fed three square meals a day, were housed
separately in small cells with a bed and table and were visited
regularly by Yugoslav officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's adequate,'' Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., said of
their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jackson bowed with the two men and the third
captive, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, for a word
of prayer, as air raid sirens echoed from the streets of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, whose mission has received no support from the Clinton
administration, was scheduled to meet Saturday with Milosevic, as
allied air strikes continued.
</P>
<P>
   After flying more than 600 sorties and dropping an estimated 300
bombs Thursday night and early Friday, the alliance was taking
advantage of clear skies to plan at least as many missions
overnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding mightily to NATO's firepower, 10 B-52 Stratofortress
heavy bombers were scheduled to fly from U.S. air bases Friday
night to join the NATO armada with a scheduled arrival at a British
air field on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sounded Friday evening in Belgrade, cutting
short Jackson's visit with the captives, as NATO bombs struck again
at military targets across Yugoslavia and at troops, tanks and
staging areas inside the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attacks on fielded forces have intensified,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea, describing furious allied strikes early
Friday on command posts, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and
railroad tanker cars.
</P>
<P>
   With a month of heavy cloud cover lifting, Shea said, Serb
forces in Kosovo would find it difficult to hide from the aerial
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``As spring gives way to summer,'' said Shea, ``their
destruction becomes inescapable.''
</P>
<P>
   Defiant in the face of the onslaught, Milosevic vowed that he
would ``never surrender'' to U.S. and allied demands for placing a
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Milosevic set forth his own terms for ending the
conflict, a proposal immediately rejected by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said he would accept lightly-armed United Nations
monitors but not a military peacekeeping force made up by his
country's attackers, even if holding out means accepting prolonged
and escalating air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more day (of bombing) is too much,'' Milosevic said in an
interview with the United Press International news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what choice do we have if NATO insists on occupying
Yugoslavia? To that we will never surrender,'' Milosevic said in
the UPI interview. ``We Serbs are as one on this life-and-death
issue of national honor and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Belgrade was ``willing to accept a U.N. presence
and are ready to negotiate its composition. But please understand
that after all those crimes against our nation and its people, we
cannot accept representatives of the countries that committed
aggression against us. We would like to see representatives of
neutral countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixing the rhetoric of resolve with the softer edge of an
accommodating host, Milosevic gave a green light to Jackson's
personal mission, but declined to release the captives.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, Stone and Ramirez came under
fire, were surrounded and captured on March 31 as they patrolled a
mountainous area along the Kosovo-Macedonia border on what the
Pentagon described as a routine training mission.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces claim the men strayed into the territory of
Serbia -- Yugoslavia's main state. The Pentagon has not said
whether the men, who were part of a larger NATO force stationed in
Macedonia, crossed the border. U.S. officials have said they might
not know for certain what happened until they are able to talk
freely with the captives.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon reiterated Friday the U.S.
position that the men are being held illegally and should be
immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson offered the men words of comfort and later told
reporters they were bearing up with ``dignity,'' adding, ``our
country should be proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Gonzales at one point, Jackson said, ``You are a
hero. People know about you all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning toward the camera, Gonzales told his parents, ``Sorry I
put you through so much pain and agony,'' then delivered an
impromptu message to the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks everybody, for all your thoughts and all your
prayers,'' he said. ``They've been needed and they're a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, wearing a dark three-piece suit, white shirt and tie,
urged the men to consider how prison terms had strengthened the
will of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., South
African apartheid foe Nelson Mandela and even the New Testament
Apostle Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people around the world are praying for you and
they're praying for reconciliation so we can all live in peace
together,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can have the tailwind push them, but sometimes in life
there are headwinds and crosswinds and nobody can see the wind,''
said Jackson, admonishing the captives to ``turn pain into power
and use this time wisely . . . time to write, time to think and
time to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO offered no security guarantees for Jackson. President
Clinton's spokesman Joe Lockhart said the administration does not
support Jackson's visit, which Lockhart described as a personal
initiative by the civil rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   In his most extensive interview since the NATO bombing began
nearly six weeks ago,
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said his country stood no chance of prevailing
militarily against NATO, but he said he was heartened by the U.S.
aversion to American casualties and the emerging resistance in
Congress to support the ongoing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed his country as a victim of NATO aggression,
insisted that Serb army troops had not committed widespread
atrocities in Kosovo but conceded that heavy-handed methods had
been employed by paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials blame Milosevic for overseeing a
campaign that has resulted in the execution of at least 4,000
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and has left another 1.5 million
homeless over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not angels,'' Milosevic said. ``Nor are we the devils
you have made us out to be.''

NEW ROCKET AND SATELLITE FEARED LOST IN ORBIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A giant rocket and a powerful communications
satellite worth over $1 billion were feared lost after a launch in
Florida Friday in the Air Force's third straight space-mission
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a very disappointing day,'' Brig. Gen.
Randy Starbuck told an early-evening news conference at Cape
Canaveral, confirming that a Titan 4B rocket costing $433 million
had failed to lift a satellite worth $800 million into proper
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of disappointment was heightened by the apparently
successful beginning of the mission. The 20-story rocket had lifted
off from the cape at 12:30 p.m. with the 10,000-pound Milstar
communications satellite in its nose cone. Mission planners dared
to be optimistic as the solid-fuel main booster rocket burned like
a giant Roman candle, carrying the satellite toward an orbit some
22,000 miles above the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But an hour later, Air Force officials at the cape canceled a
scheduled news briefing about the mission. Friday evening, Starbuck
confirmed rumors that the upper-stage liquid-fuel booster had
failed to lift the satellite into its orbit over the equator once
the solid-fuel first stage had done its job by placing the
satellite in an initial orbit 3,000 miles up.
</P>
<P>
   The lost satellite was to have been used for military
communications around the globe, ``phones, computers, just about
anything,'' in the words of a Defense Department official who said
he was familiar with the mission. Both the satellite and the Titan
rocket were manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's failure was the third consecutive disappointment for
the Air Force. Last Aug. 12, a Titan 4 carrying a spy satellite
blew up shortly after launching from Cape Canaveral at a cost of
well over $1 billion. And on April 9, a $250 million
missile-warning satellite was accidentally stranded in the wrong
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Starbuck said the failure of the upper-stage Centaur liquid-fuel
burner had left the satellite launched Friday stranded in a
lopsided orbit thousands of miles below its intended 22,300-mile
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   He said that mission controllers would try to use thrusters and
whatever liquid fuel remains to get the satellite into its proper
orbit, but that they were uncertain of their chances.
</P>
<P>
   The first Milstar satellite was placed in a 22,300-mile orbit in
1994 and a second in 1995. The Pentagon had planned to place six in
orbit altogether to provide secure and jam-proof communications
between commanders and troops.
</P>
<P>
   Starbuck, who is in charge of the Air Force's Cape Canaveral
launch site as commander of the 45th Space Wing, said it was too
early to speculate on causes for Friday's mishap. ``When we have
three failures in a row of any system,'' he told the press
conference, ``something is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said Friday's failure, if it cannot be
corrected, would not hamper the military's communications or the
nation's security.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One month after their battered faces were beamed
around the world, three American soldiers held captive in
Yugoslavia were shown meeting Friday in Belgrade with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, bearing encouraging words, the Holy Bible and
letters from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling pretty healthy, a little mentally drained,'' one
prisoner, Army Spc. Steven Gonzales told Jackson. ``Really miss
home, and hope to be back soon.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes welling up with tears, a second captive, Staff Sgt.
Christopher Stone turned toward a camera recording the meeting to
address his wife and four-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my wife, Tricia and my son, Ryan, 'I love you,''' said
Stone, struggling with his emotions before breaking into a broad
grin.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's visit -- televised by the Cable News Network (CNN) --
appeared to be part of a charm offensive launched by Serb leader
Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, who also granted
an international news agency an extensive interview Friday in the
face of the most withering NATO air strikes since the campaign
began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's meeting marked the first time the American soldiers
have been shown on camera since state-run media in Yugoslavia
released footage of them April 1 -- with bruised faces and downcast
eyes -- the day after Serb forces captured them near Kosovo's
border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The men said they were fed three square meals a day, were housed
separately in small cells with a bed and table and were visited
regularly by Yugoslav officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's adequate,'' Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., said of
their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jackson bowed with the two men and the third
captive, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, for a word
of prayer, as air raid sirens echoed from the streets of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, whose mission has received no support from the Clinton
administration, was scheduled to meet Saturday with Milosevic, as
allied air strikes continued.
</P>
<P>
   After flying more than 600 sorties and dropping an estimated 300
bombs Thursday night and early Friday, the alliance was taking
advantage of clear skies to plan at least as many missions
overnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding mightily to NATO's firepower, 10 B-52 Stratofortress
heavy bombers were scheduled to fly from U.S. air bases Friday
night to join the NATO armada with a scheduled arrival at a British
air field on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sounded Friday evening in Belgrade, cutting
short Jackson's visit with the captives, as NATO bombs struck again
at military targets across Yugoslavia and at troops, tanks and
staging areas inside the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attacks on fielded forces have intensified,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea, describing furious allied strikes early
Friday on command posts, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and
railroad tanker cars.
</P>
<P>
   With a month of heavy cloud cover lifting, Shea said, Serb
forces in Kosovo would find it difficult to hide from the aerial
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``As spring gives way to summer,'' said Shea, ``their
destruction becomes inescapable.''
</P>
<P>
   Defiant in the face of the onslaught, Milosevic vowed that he
would ``never surrender'' to U.S. and allied demands for placing a
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Milosevic set forth his own terms for ending the
conflict, a proposal immediately rejected by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said he would accept lightly-armed United Nations
monitors but not a military peacekeeping force made up by his
country's attackers, even if holding out means accepting prolonged
and escalating air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more day (of bombing) is too much,'' Milosevic said in an
interview with the United Press International news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what choice do we have if NATO insists on occupying
Yugoslavia? To that we will never surrender,'' Milosevic said in
the UPI interview. ``We Serbs are as one on this life-and-death
issue of national honor and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Belgrade was ``willing to accept a U.N. presence
and are ready to negotiate its composition. But please understand
that after all those crimes against our nation and its people, we
cannot accept representatives of the countries that committed
aggression against us. We would like to see representatives of
neutral countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixing the rhetoric of resolve with the softer edge of an
accommodating host, Milosevic gave a green light to Jackson's
personal mission, but declined to release the captives.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, Stone and Ramirez came under
fire, were surrounded and captured on March 31 as they patrolled a
mountainous area along the Kosovo-Macedonia border on what the
Pentagon described as a routine training mission.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces claim the men strayed into the territory of
Serbia -- Yugoslavia's main state. The Pentagon has not said
whether the men, who were part of a larger NATO force stationed in
Macedonia, crossed the border. U.S. officials have said they might
not know for certain what happened until they are able to talk
freely with the captives.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon reiterated Friday the U.S.
position that the men are being held illegally and should be
immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson offered the men words of comfort and later told
reporters they were bearing up with ``dignity,'' adding, ``our
country should be proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Gonzales at one point, Jackson said, ``You are a
hero. People know about you all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning toward the camera, Gonzales told his parents, ``Sorry I
put you through so much pain and agony,'' then delivered an
impromptu message to the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks everybody, for all your thoughts and all your
prayers,'' he said. ``They've been needed and they're a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, wearing a dark three-piece suit, white shirt and tie,
urged the men to consider how prison terms had strengthened the
will of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., South
African apartheid foe Nelson Mandela and even the New Testament
Apostle Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people around the world are praying for you and
they're praying for reconciliation so we can all live in peace
together,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can have the tailwind push them, but sometimes in life
there are headwinds and crosswinds and nobody can see the wind,''
said Jackson, admonishing the captives to ``turn pain into power
and use this time wisely . . . time to write, time to think and
time to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO offered no security guarantees for Jackson. President
Clinton's spokesman Joe Lockhart said the administration does not
support Jackson's visit, which Lockhart described as a personal
initiative by the civil rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   In his most extensive interview since the NATO bombing began
nearly six weeks ago,
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said his country stood no chance of prevailing
militarily against NATO, but he said he was heartened by the U.S.
aversion to American casualties and the emerging resistance in
Congress to support the ongoing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed his country as a victim of NATO aggression,
insisted that Serb army troops had not committed widespread
atrocities in Kosovo but conceded that heavy-handed methods had
been employed by paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials blame Milosevic for overseeing a
campaign that has resulted in the execution of at least 4,000
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and has left another 1.5 million
homeless over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not angels,'' Milosevic said. ``Nor are we the devils
you have made us out to be.''

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to its advertising, Dean Witter measures its success
``one investor at a time.'' But it might also say that behind each
of its 11,450 brokers is one Leah Modigliani.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Modigliani, among other things, is day-to-day manager of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's list of 10 stocks it recommends most
strongly for purchase, called its fresh-money buy list. When she
makes a new choice _ on Wednesday, for example, it was the Mead
Corp. _ many thousands of customers get calls from brokers
suggesting they follow her lead.
</P>
<P>
   The chosen company's market capitalization then typically swells
by hundreds of millions of dollars. Mead jumped $4.75, or 12
percent, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But what really distinguishes Ms. Modigliani, 34, a slight,
roller-blade enthusiast, from most Wall Street strategists is
intellectual firepower, no doubt related to one of the best
economic pedigrees this side of Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy
Treasury secretary. (Both his parents are economists and two
uncles, Paul A. Samuelson and Kenneth J. Arrow, are Nobel laureates
in economics.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Modigliani is the daughter of academics _ in social
psychology and education _ and a distant cousin of Amedeo
Modigliani, the painter and sculptor. And her grandfather is Franco
Modigliani, winner of a 1985 Nobel in economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather's enthusiasm for economics is absolutely
contagious,'' she said. ``But I never expected to be particularly
interested in economics. It's just that it was my favorite subject
at Oberlin.'' She is now known for developing, with her
grandfather, a new way to judge the performance of mutual funds and
other portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Byron R. Wien, her mentor and boss, had complained that most
comparisons ignored the amount of risk that managers took. He asked
that she try to figure out why. What Ms. Modigliani found was that
existing methods were either not rigorous or precise enough _ she
cited Morningstar's star system _ or were too difficult to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept thinking there's got to be a better way,'' she
recalled in an interview in her 11th-floor office in Morgan
Stanley's theater-district headquarters on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Her solution began over the dinner table at her grandfather's
house in Boston, not long after she joined the firm in 1995. He
asked her what she was working on. After a brief discussion, she
said, ``we knew we were on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on her grandfather's pioneering work on corporate
leverage, she developed over the next year a measure that she
called risk-adjusted performance. It soon became well known as
Modigliani-Modigliani, or M-squared.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the approach first adjusts leverage artificially, to
make all portfolios as risky as a benchmark, like the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index. Then it measures returns. It is the kind of
challenge that taps Ms. Modigliani's intellectual heritage _ from
Oberlin College and Harvard Business School as well as her
ancestors _ and also earns people money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really love is combining the two _ taking the academic
ideas and making them applicable,'' she said. ``And it's about
human behavior as well as finance and math.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she follows Wien's prescription to have fun at work,
though nobody would confuse the Morgan Stanley version with, say,
fraternity high jinks. ``My idea of fun is choosing stocks for the
portfolio,'' she said, and ``to think about risk and talk about
risk to investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Her style of living, which must allow for a 7:30 meeting with
analysts each workday morning to discuss stocks, is anything but
yuppie indulgence. Ms. Modigliani, who in June plans to marry
Nicholas McGrane, a venture capitalist for Bankers Trust, lives in
Manhattan's West Village, where, she says, ``I hardly ever run into
people on the street from work.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she is something of an activist. Last week, she was
exulting because Eulia Charles, a young woman she had been
mentoring for four years through a group called the Student Sponsor
Partnership and whose parents never finished high school, had won a
full scholarship to Fordham University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Modigliani took Ms. Charles to a family reunion of her
Italian-Jewish clan _ transplanted to the United States after Italy
adopted anti-Semitic laws in the 1930s _ in Boston for Passover
last month.
</P>
<P>
   She is also involved with Girls Inc., an after-school program
that teaches girls about money, and serves on the investment
committee of Oberlin's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Since she has had a high income for only a short time and is
repaying large student loans, Ms. Modigliani's own stock portfolio
is relatively modest. Still, she insists on backing her opinions
with her own cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really be advising people what stocks to buy unless
I'm doing it myself,'' she said. ``Byron, he wants me to feel the
pain when the stocks go down _ and I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Oberlin and Harvard, Ms. Modigliani worked for six years
at Marsoft Inc. in Boston, where she managed the production of
software for economic forecasting in the bulk-shipping industry.
But she went on to business school, she said, because she wanted to
put her academic background to use in a practical setting.
</P>
<P>
   At Morgan Stanley, she and Wien _ whose job she is likely to
inherit someday _ share the view that the stock market is about 25
percent overvalued. They have been adding some cyclical stocks,
like DuPont, and small-cap companies, like Cyprus Amax, a metals
concern, to the firm's hypothetical model portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Modigliani said she doesn't feel pressure to conform.
``I'm allowed to have my own opinion on whatever I want,'' she
said. ``When I talk to the brokers and the clients, they know I'm
saying what I really think. That intellectual freedom really is
important to me.''

I.G. FARBEN: A LINGERING RELIC OF THE NAZI YEARS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Germany is still haunted by many ghosts
from the dark years of Nazi rule, but few are as enduring or as
strange as the specter of I.G. Farben.
</P>
<P>
   Once the world's biggest chemical conglomerate, I.G. Farben
played so important a role in Hitler's war machine and in the
Holocaust that it came to be called ``the devil's chemist.'' It
manufactured Zyklon B, the gas-chamber poison, among many other
products, and its factories exploited more than 35,000 slave
laborers, many from Auschwitz. It even built a concentration camp
of its own to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials broke up Farben after the war and distributed
most of its assets to new companies. The old headquarters, a grim
concrete fortress here, was converted into American military
offices and is now being turned into university classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But I.G. Farben AG never disappeared. It survives as a legal
entity, kept alive by lawyers and real estate speculators,
outlasting the Allied occupation, the Berlin wall and the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has been ``in liquidation'' since 1952, its securities
are still traded on the Frankfurt exchange. It has offices in a
bland yellow building here. And Farben continues to haunt German
courts, pursuing billions of dollars' worth of legal claims dating
to the twilight of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years is undoubtedly too long,'' acknowledged Volker
Pollehn, a cheerful lawyer who was appointed by a Frankfurt court
as one of two new liquidators of the company last October. ``But
the law is absolutely clear about our responsibilities, and it
doesn't give us much leeway in how we fulfill them.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way. Soon after the Allies
defeated Germany in 1945, they decided that Farben had acted too
villainously during the war to be allowed to remain intact. The
company's top scientist, Fritz Termeer, was convicted by the
Nuremburg war crimes tribunal of mass murder, slavery and
plundering.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factories became the basis of three new
chemical companies that went on to become international giants in
their own right: Bayer, Hoechst and BASF.
</P>
<P>
   But some loose ends remained, like paying pensions to retired
workers and settling with the former company's creditors. So the
old parent company became, formally, I.G. Farbenindustrie in
Abwicklung _ the last two words mean ``in liquidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, it was also given the job of pursuing any legitimate
claims on behalf of shareholders and creditors of the old giant.
</P>
<P>
   Few people expected it to last more than a few years. But few
people foresaw just how many new twists, odd angles and blind
alleys separated it from any final reckoning. Through trial after
trial, the legal machinery ground on for decades as Farben's
liquidators, creditors and debtors meticulously untangled claims
and counterclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Farben got a new lease on life with German reunification in
1990. West Germans suddenly could file legal claims on property in
eastern Germany that had been confiscated under either the Nazi
regime or Soviet occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for real estate experts to discern that
Farben might be poised for a windfall. The Soviets had seized
thousands of acres and dozens of factories from Farben, and under
German law, the company had a strong case for reclaiming them.
</P>
<P>
   Farben's liquidators pursued billions of dollars in such claims,
and speculators bid up its shares _ technically liquidation
certificates _ from 12 marks to 39 marks.
</P>
<P>
   But German courts resoundingly rejected the claims. Among other
objections, they cited a 1994 German law prohibiting the government
from returning property taken from companies that violated human
rights. The company paid about $17 million to former slave laborers
in the 1950s, but adamantly refused to recognize further legal
responsibility for decades afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Farben's lawyers turned their sights abroad. They filed claims
of $2 billion against UBS, the giant Swiss bank, arguing that in
the Nazi era, Farben executives had fraudulently sold to a
component of the bank overseas Farben operations that rightfully
belonged to Farben shareholders. These claims were also rejected by
German courts.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company had spent so much on lawyers' fees in the
two crusades, it began running desperately short of cash. The
court-appointed liquidator at the time, Gunther Minninger, a
Cologne real estate developer, tried to earn a better return on
Farben's money by acquiring two apartment buildings instead of
investing in more liquid assets like stocks or bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the company could not afford to pay salaries or perform
maintenance on the buildings. And Farben's books were so neglected
that Minninger could not put together an annual report for 1997. He
sold his stake and resigned last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust survivors are furious that the company even exists.
Rather than continuing to pursue forlorn ancient claims, they argue
that the company should shut down immediately, sell everything and
use its remaining money to build a new museum at Auschwitz or to
compensate survivors directly. Protesters tried to disrupt Farben's
annual meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have told us time and again that they would bring this to
a close,'' said Hans Frankenthal, who lost his family in Auschwitz
and was forced to work at Farben's synthetic rubber plant.
Frankenthal, who is 72 and lives in the German city of Dortmund,
has been fighting for 10 years to shut down the company.
</P>
<P>
   But he will have to wait. The new court-appointed liquidators
are convinced that Farben still has rightful claims against UBS.
Undeterred by the earlier defeat in court, Pollehn said he had
stumbled onto new evidence that Farben executives arranged a
fraudulent sale of all the company's foreign operations to Swiss
Bank, which became part of UBS last year.
</P>
<P>
   The value of those assets, he said, was now about 4.4 million
marks ($2.39 billion). UBS, which agreed with other Swiss banks to
settle Holocaust-era claims for $1.5 billion, says it has no
intention of paying Farben.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from his predecessors, Pollehn said last month
that most of the money from any legal victories would be put in a
new fund for former slave laborers, a plan that was approved at the
annual meeting but derided by protesters as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became involved with this originally because of the legal
issues,'' he said in a recent interview at Farben's modest offices.
``But then I became preoccupied with the history. I think we have a
chance here to make a historic change.''

MILOSEVIC, IN INTERVIEW, SAYS NATO HAS `MISCALCULATED'  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, insisted
in an interview released here Friday that Yugoslavs were ``willing
to die'' to defend their rights but at the same time outlined what
he described as a six point plan for settlement of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparently carefully timed insight into his thinking,
Milosevic rejected outright a military presence in Kosovo composed
of an army but said that the ``United Nations can have a huge
presence if it wishes.'' Questioned more closely by Arnaud de
Borchgrave from United Press International, Milosevic said these
U.N. peacekeepers could bear sidearms for self-defense, and include
troops from non-NATO nations.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic rarely speaks in public, or grants interviews to
foreign media. His interview, which UPI said was given on Thursday
but was not released until Friday, appeared designed to coincide
with proposals aired more privately to the Russian envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who rarely speaks to his own public, made no
reference to the more than 600,000 ethnic Albanians who have been
expelled by his forces in the last five weeks and denied that
ethnic Albanian villages had been torched by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Milosevic, which included a draw down of his
forces in Kosovo as NATO withdrew its forces in neighboring Albania
and Macedonia, was far from meeting the five demands laid out at
the NATO summit last weekend. NATO has said that it wants an
international security force in Kosovo and that it stands ready to
create such a force.
</P>
<P>
   Giving an idea of the kind of non-military presence he would
accept, Milosevic said: ``There is no job for forces. What would
forces do? Just ruin our roads with tracked vehicles.'' He said
that members of any U.N. presence could carry ``self-defense
weapons'' but ``no offensive weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave, 72, asked Milosevic few adversarial questions and
allowed Milosevic to ruminate at length unchallenged. UPI said the
two-hour interview took place at a modest house outside Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted in English, according to UPI.
Milosevic was a banker in New York for the Communist government of
Yugoslavia during the 1980s and learned idiomatic English during
that period.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration dismissed Milosevic's ideas on a
settlement as ``falling far short of what's needed to end the
bombing,'' according to David Leavy, a spokesman for the National
Security Council. Leavy described Milosevic's statements as
``propaganda spewing from the highest source.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader said that in order for a ``compromise'' to
be worked out with NATO, he would demand that the alliance withdraw
its troops ``now concentrated on our borders in Albania and
Macedonia,'' and at the same time he would draw down Serb forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic gave a far higher number of Serb forces in Kosovo _
100,000 _ than NATO has announced. NATO has said that Milosevic has
about 40,000 troops in the province. NATO's supreme commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, said earlier this week that despite NATO bombing,
Milosevic had managed to reinforce his troops in Kosovo and had a
higher number there now than at the start of the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically by de Borchgrave if he had increased his
troops from 40,000 to 100,000, Milosevic said he had done so after
hearing ``NATO voices urging political leaders to order ground
forces into action.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other points in Milosevic's proposal were ``the return
of all refugees, regardless of their ethnic or religious
affiliation.'' He made no reference to the fact that all of the
refugees now in neighboring countries are ethnic Albanians and that
those Serbs who have left Kosovo during the NATO bombardment
largely went to Serbia proper.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission that he proposed would, he said, come to Kosovo
as ``our guests'' and would be there to ``observe that all is
peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times in the interview, Milosevic said he could not accept
any foreign forces in Kosovo because they represented an
``occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Listing countries that he he would find acceptable in the U.N.
mission, Milosevic named Ireland as a European country that was not
a member of NATO. He also favored contingents from Russia, Ukraine
and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic described the negotiations at Rambouillet in France,
where Washington, four European countries and Russia failed to
persuade the Serbs to agree to 28,000 strong peacekeeping force, as
a ``diktat.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the peacekeeping force of 28,000, including 4,000
Americans, was planned with tanks, armored personnel carriers and
heavy weaponry and, hence, was unacceptable. ``Aid not arms is what
Kosovo needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of Milosevic's proposal was what he called the
``political process'' that he said he was conducting with the
ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and its NATO partners have questioned
whether Rugova, the head of the moderate political forces in
Kosovo, was acting voluntarily in his talks with Milosevic. A
German newspaper reporter who said she was with Rugova at his home
in Pristina after the NATO bombing began said Rugova was a hostage
of Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said that he would ``continue direct negotiations with
Mr. Rugova in the presence of the international community.'' But he
said the international community could not act as mediators.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing language from the proposed Rambouillet accords,
Milosevic said, ``We want to achieve the widest possible autonomy
for Kosovo within Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Milosevic fell short of one of NATO's key demands, which
states that Kosovo would be set up as ``an international
provisional administration'' with ``substantial autonomy'' within
Yugoslavia. Serbia is the dominant of the two republics in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Milosevic's most revealing comments came when he
described his version of what had gone on in Kosovo. In some
respects, his descriptions appeared to be the obverse of those
heard in the West.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrillas of the
ethnic Albanians who make up the majority of the Kosovo population,
as wanting to achieve a ``racially pure state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is precisely the opposite of what is happening in the
world. Ethnically mixed states is the trend in the new global
village,'' Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has frequently charged Milosevic with the
``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo by expelling nearly half the ethnic
Albanian population in the last five weeks. Several weeks ago the
British defense secretary, George Robertson, described Milosevic as
a ``serial ethnic cleanser.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic denied that his forces had torched entire villages of
ethnic Albanians. ``Individual houses, yes. But not whole villages
as we saw on TV in Vietnam when American forces torched villages
suspected of hiding Viet cong.''
</P>
<P>
   He allowed that his forces were ``not angels'' but that they
were not the ``devils'' they were made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our regular forces are highly disciplined. The paramilitary
irregular forces are a different story,'' he said. Painting a
picture of the rule of law that Western governments insist has not
existed under Milosevic's authoritarian rule, he said: ``We have
arrested those irregular self-appointed leaders. Some have already
been tried and sentenced to 20 years in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   On his interpretation of American strategy, Milosevic was
sarcastic: ``Your leaders are not strategic thinkers,'' he said.
``Short term quick fixes, yes. They said let's bomb Yugoslavia and
then figure out what to do next. Some said Milosevic would give up
Kosovo after a few days of aggression from the air.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said, NATO had ``miscalculated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not willing to sacrifice lives to achieve our
surrender,'' he said. ``But we are willing to die to defend our
rights as an independent sovereign nation.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ On the eve of the Kentucky Derby, this was the
easy part of Bob Baffert's weekend: Silverbulletday winning her
seventh straight race and her 10th in 11 starts, dominating the
Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs before a record crowd of 101,034
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult part for Baffert unfolds on Saturday when he
attempts to become the first trainer in racing history to win the
Kentucky Derby three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert, who already trains two Derby favorites in General
Challenge and Prime Timber, added another weapon to his powerful
arsenal Friday when he decided to start another star filly,
Excellent Meeting, against colts in the Derby instead of running
her against fillies in the Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   So he will take aim on history with three horses in the 125th
Derby: the entry of General Challenge and Excellent Meeting, owned
by Betty and John Mabee of Golden Eagle Farm in California, and
Prime Timber, owned by Marie and Aaron Jones of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   If Baffert wins, he will become the first trainer to win both
races in the same year since 1952, when Ben Jones won the Oaks with
Real Delight and the Derby with Hill Gail.
</P>
<P>
   The 125th Derby will be run on a dry, fast track before a throng
that could surpass last year's crowd of 143,215, if Friday's
attendance gives any clue. In its 125th running Friday, the Oaks
shattered last year's record total of 94,415.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby lost one horse from its full field of 20 Friday when
Aljabr, one of the ``mystery'' horses from Dubai, was scratched
with some lameness. But while the 19 Derby candidates were resting
or exercising lightly for their wide-open Run for the Roses, the
Oaks provided little suspense once Silverbulletday got rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old superstar, owned by Mike Pegram, who also owned
last year's Derby winner, Real Quiet, stalked the pace set by
Marley Vale until they reached the far turn. Then jockey Gary
Stevens asked Silverbulletday to run, and she shot forward. At the
close, she had two lengths on Dreams Galore, who had 4} lengths on
Sweeping Story, while Marley Vale under Jerry Bailey faded to
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The winner ran the mile and one-eighth in 1:494/5 and paid $2.20
for a $2 bet to win as the 1-9 favorite in a lopsided betting
situation that cast the rest of the field of seven as far out as
58-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have lost half of my fans if we had lost the race,''
Baffert quipped afterward. ``Now I can relax and go for the double.
Tomorrow will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Asmussen, the trainer of Dreams Galore, put it gallantly:
``She ran a great race, but ran into a bear. They could've gone
around again and not caught the winner. Silverbulletday is a
champion, and she proves it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert ended the suspense about his weekend lineup Friday
morning outside Barn 33, where he unleashed Real Quiet and Silver
Charm onto the Derby scene as winners in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent Meeting will run in the Derby,'' he said, wasting no
time on preliminaries. ``I wanted to see how she trained this
morning. She's been training great, and I think she deserves the
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got a favorable post, I figured it was fate and she
should run in the Derby. She's one who can take the heat, doesn't
mind dirt in her face and is peaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, who drew the No. 6 post position for the Oaks
and and has the No. 5 post position for the Derby, has run nine
stakes in a row that were rated Grade I or II. She is a bay
daughter of General Meeting and granddaughter of Seattle Slew and
Chief's Crown, and she has won seven of her 11 starts and finished
in the money in all 11, with earnings of $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to separate these three horses,'' Baffert said.
``General Challenge is probably the most talented of the three, and
I think Prime Timber is ready to run his best race, which he'll
need to win. I just hope that when they're turning for home, I
don't have to say to myself, `I wish I had run Silverbulletday in
there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to cover all bases. I think we're in a position to
win. Now it's a matter of racing luck.''

STATE DEPTARTMENT DROPS IRAN AS TERRORIST LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what U.S. officials described as a move they
hoped would ease relations with Iran, the State Department on
Friday dropped its designation of the Tehran government as the
world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing its annual report on global terrorism, the department
accused Iran and six other nations of sponsoring terrorist groups.
But it did not single out Tehran as the worst offender, as it has
in the past, even though evidence cited in the report suggests that
Iran might still hold that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the list was unchanged from last year, Cuba, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Department officials said
Afghanistan, which is largely under the control of the militant
Taliban Islamic movement, would have been included on the list if
it had had a government widely recognized by other nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the report last year, Iran was identified as ``the most
active state sponsor of terrorism.'' The report in 1996 identified
Iran as the ``premier'' terrorist state.
</P>
<P>
   The designation infuriated Iranian leaders, who have cited it as
an example of why relations between the United States and Iran
remain so hostile.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has sought to improve relations with
Iran since the election in 1997 of a relatively moderate president,
Mohammad Khatami. This week, the administration relaxed trade
sanctions to allow the sale of food and medicine to Iran, Libya and
other nations that are accused of supporting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The annual terrorism report, which Congress requires, found that
the number of terrorist attacks fell again last year, a trend that
began several years ago. But the study found a record number of
deaths and injuries as a result of terrorism, 741 people killed and
5,952 people injured.
</P>
<P>
   Most casualties resulted from the nearly simultaneous bombings
in August of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in which
about 300 people were killed. Twelve Americans died in terrorist
attacks last year, all as a result of the Kenya bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has blamed the attacks in East Africa on Osama
bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi-born Muslim militant who has called on
all Muslims to wage war on Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report said bin Laden, who has recently
operated from bases in Afghanistan and is being sought in the
United States on murder charges, had ``global reach'' and offered
``logistical help to extremists not directly affiliated with his
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Department officials insisted that the decision not to designate
Iran as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism was not meant as a
gesture of good will toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said, it reflected a reduction in terrorist
attacks that could clearly be attributed to organizations supported
by Iran. The report found that Iran apparently killed fewer Iranian
dissidents abroad last year than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a slight improvement in their record, and we wanted
to reflect that in our conclusions,'' said a department official
who insisted on anonymity. ``We just didn't feel the need to single
them out in the way we have in the past. We obviously want to
encourage better behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the administration said the report had been worded in
a fashion that they hoped would make clear to Iran the willingness
of Washington to improve ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would obviously be tough for us to go out there and brand
Iran as the world's premier terrorist state while at the same time
talking about our hope for better relations,'' said a U.S. official
who insisted on anonymity. ``If the Iranians read this as a signal
for better ties, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that Iran ``continued to be involved in the
planning and execution of terrorist acts'' and that it might have
been responsible for the murders of five leading Iranian writers
and political figures last year. The department also said Iran
continued support a variety of terrorist groups in the Middle East,
including Hamas, Hizballah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of at least four nations on the State Department
list _ Cuba, Libya, North Korea and Syria _ are not accused of
involvement in any recent acts of international terrorism. They
remain on the list, the department said, because they continue to
provide sanctuary for terrorist fugitives or provide other support.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement with the report, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said: ``governments on the list that would like to see
their names removed know exactly what they must do. Stop planning,
financing and supporting terrorist acts and stop sheltering or
interfering with the apprehension and prosecution of those who
commit them.''

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It has always been hard to be the one called
a freak, geek, dweeb, weirdo.
</P>
<P>
   For many, it just got a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   In scattered reports from around the country, high school
students who dress defiantly, or who are computer lovers, or who
qualify in any way as outcasts, say that since the killings in
Littleton, Colo., last week, they feel as if they have become
perceived not only as different but as threats.
</P>
<P>
   In Brookline, Mass., Tom DeRocco, a high school sophomore
wearing a heavy chain around his neck bearing a lock engraved with
the word ``Macho,'' a black T-shirt depicting the punk band
Exploited and thick-soled shoes, said that since the massacre,
random people on the street have called him names and asked,
``Going to blow up your school?''
</P>
<P>
   In a Los Angeles suburb, David Yarovesky, a Calabasas High
School senior who wears black nail polish and has a pierced
eyebrow, tongue, ears and nipples, said that his mother had been
fairly understanding about his Gothic style. But since the two
Columbine High School gunmen struck, killing 12 students, a teacher
and themselves, Yarovesky's mother has worriedly asked, ``What's
the difference between you and them?''
</P>
<P>
   In a small town in South Florida, a dozen high school students
who periodically link their computers to play games and exchange
information said they had been hauled in by school authorities to
be questioned in front of a school police officer about their
group, which calls itself Evilcon. The students said their Web site
had been downloaded and inspected, all because a fellow student had
told her parents she was afraid of the computer nerds.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet magnet for complaints of outsider misery and
harassment has emerged in the person of Jon Katz, media critic for
Rolling Stone and the Slashdot Web site, whose recent online
columns sympathizing with high school nonconformists have brought
an outpouring of thousands of e-mail messages, what he calls a
``river of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teen-agers were already subjected to daily harassment, Katz
said in a telephone interview, ``and since the Littleton massacre,
these kids perceive this national witch hunt for the abnormal,
where kids are basically being singled out if they're wearing
trench coats, if they're called Goths, if they're on the Internet,
if they play Quake and Doom. These kids who already felt like
outsiders are being made to feel like killers as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The messages pouring in to Katz have included reports of
students being expelled or suspended from school for
``anti-social'' behavior or sent home to change clothes similar to
what the killers wore; of clampdowns by parents on computer use; of
increased scrutiny and determined offers of counseling from adults,
especially when students say that though they do not condone the
shootings, they can understand what motivated them, and of more
hostility from other students.
</P>
<P>
   These descriptions of added ostracism contrast sharply with the
message many teachers and administrators sent after the shootings:
that the deaths might have been prevented if only peers and adults
had granted the two killers more acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, have been described
as consummate outsiders, derided by more popular students, and
diary entries describe the rage brought on by rejection.
</P>
<P>
   They also were known to play riveting computer games like Quake
for hours; to listen to techno-pop music; to wear all-black
ensembles associated with the gloomy subculture known as Goth, and
to have ties to the school's little anti-clique known as the trench
coat mafia.
</P>
<P>
   So, suddenly _ and despite overwhelming odds that the vast
majority of ``outsider'' teen-agers will never hurt anybody _ any
resemblance to that profile can put a teen-ager under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of that suspicion is already spawning jokes among some
teen-agers. At Brookline High School, Ben Pulli, a junior, said he
was recently sitting off by himself when a friend came up and
joked, ``Uh-oh, you're showing warning signs.'' Another student
mentioned warning somebody, ``Don't make me go trench-coat on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Fluckiger, a senior who wears his hair in dreadlocks
and heads the school's Strategic Games Club, whose members tend to
dress in black and be self-described outcasts, sounded as if the
extra attention the group had been getting from the headmaster was
more a source of amusement than concern: ``It's just like, `Oh,
hello, how's it going?' Smile smile, nod, nod, and he's looking,
`Do any of these people look homicidal today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Others scoffed at the weak adult grasp on teen-age culture they
saw in the knee-jerk linking of the shootings and music or computer
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys in Colorado were just messed up,'' said Adam Loren,
a black-clad sophomore at Stevenson High School in the Chicago
suburb of Lincolnshire. ``I'm not going to go out and kill anybody,
I just like to dress a certain way. I guarantee you if those kids
had been wearing Tommy Hilfiger or Abercrombie and Fitch shirts you
wouldn't see them banning Tommy Hilfiger or Abercrombie shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But judging by reports reaching Katz and others, outsiders'
sense of unease about ``geek profiling'' often reaches serious
proportions. Katz has received handfuls of messages from students
who have been told to take off black clothes or computer-game
T-shirts or trench coats, he said; a half-dozen from students
called into counseling because they spoke angrily, and three or
four from students who were sent home for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest number have been kids who were spoken to because
of the way they dress or look,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 60s, that rebellious look would have meant long hair and
peace signs; in the late 1990s, it is the macabre Goth look, which
often includes white makeup or black lipstick; or the punk look of
heavy shoes, metal chains and leather; or the tribal look of
piercings and colorful makeup and hair, or a dozen other variations
that stand out in part because they are meant to.
</P>
<P>
   As some of those noticeably different students lounged on nearby
park benches after Brookline High let out on Thursday, a couple
commented that they did not usually mind being designated
``freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   But some teen-agers in less tolerant places comment that
freak-hood is often the product of natural differences that have
brought years of torment by cruel children.
</P>
<P>
   Of his Goth crowd in suburban Los Angeles, Yarovesky said, ``We
all looked the same in kindergarten. Not Goth, but we were all made
fun of. As we started to get older, we started materializing into
what they were saying to us. We made ourselves come off as
different. The group of friends that always got made fun of became
the Goth group, the outcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarovesky, like many self-described high school outcasts, said
he sympathized with the Colorado gunmen but did not support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that it had to happen,'' Yarovesky said. ``Someone had
to notice that something is wrong at school.'' Now, he said, he
hopes that ``people will ease up on the dorks.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some will. At Bethesda Chevy Chase High School in
suburban Bethesda, Md., Jonathan Hare, a baseball-capped junior,
said between lunch bites at McDonald's: ``You don't know who to
mess with now. I'm being friends with everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But judging by messages to Katz, the opposite is happening in
many places _ from a Dungeons and Dragons player who wrote that his
private school counselor had demanded he give up the game or enter
therapy, to the ``Quake freak'' who wrote that after the killings,
people started talking to him as if he might kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like they were really afraid of me,'' he wrote.
``They just seemed to think it was OK to hate me even more.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PIN PATTER _ BRONCOS' STAR GOES BOWLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Terrell Davis showed up at Bryant Park in Manhattan
on cue Friday afternoon. About 100 children, and a number of
noontime diners, cheered as Davis, the Denver Broncos' All-Pro
running back, hopped up on the elevated bowling lanes that had been
constructed for a clinic as part of the Professional Bowlers
Association's first outdoor championship Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis joined Walter Ray Williams Jr., the 1998 PBA player of the
year, and Chris Barnes, the tour's rookie of the year. He addressed
the young students about studying and working hard, being
persistent and respecting one another. They listened and fidgeted.
This was too nice a day to sit still too long for speeches. They
wanted to watch Davis bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is an avid bowler, though admittedly not a super bowler.
``If I didn't play football, I would have tried to become a
bowler,'' he said. ``We have a league we start up every year with a
lot of guys on the team. Players are addicted. When I retire,
bowling might be my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That provided a neat transition into the topic of the hour in
sports: John Elway's retirement announcement Sunday in Denver.
Davis said he knew when last season ended that Elway wasn't coming
back. ``To be honest, I didn't give him much chance of coming back
last year,'' Davis said. ``I knew this year that this was
definitely going to be his last season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are ending one era and beginning another. ``This is
a huge challenge for us, an uphill struggle for us,'' Davis said.
``It's one thing I never wanted to see, but it's inevitable. I
don't want to see him go, but I think it's the right time for him.
People had to be prepared to live life without John. I'm not
prepared, but I have no choice, so I'll make the necessary
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a sentiment in New York, percolating just below the
surface, that the Jets, who lost to Denver in last season's
conference championship game, are somehow the heirs apparent to the
Elway-less Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a strong squad,'' Davis said of the Jets. ``But I
don't think a team like the Jets should be looking at us and
saying, `All right, Denver's out of the way and we've got easy
sailing.' You have a lot of teams out there. Jacksonville is
strong, Pittsburgh's coming back up, Seattle's going to be strong.
Just don't look at us and focus on the wrong thing. The team you're
not looking at is the dude who's going to hit you in the side of
the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added: ``Losing John, we're going to lose a lot; I'm not
going to lie to you. I just think it will be a different kind of
team with a different chemistry. I think we will be a very great
team. The team is still going to be good, because we had core
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said when he returns to Colorado, these football-related
issues will become dwarfed by the events that have shaken the
nation and put a new emphasis on young people and family. Davis was
in Washington last week, testifying before a task force for youth
sports and recreation. He was trying to persuade the government to
help refurbish playing fields and recreation centers.
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington, he watched the horrible news coming out of
Littleton, Colo. For the next 24 hours he and Sara Murphy, who runs
his foundation, brainstormed about a way the foundation could help.
Davis flew to Denver and went to the hospital where some of the
wounded Columbine High School students were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to even describe,'' he said of his visit. ``It was
just so sad, man. These were kids who hadn't done anything to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, called Terrell Davis Salutes Kids, focuses on
developing a range of after-school programs. Davis wants to bring
Pop Warner football to Denver in the middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that maybe we could do a fund, but then I saw where
there were millions of funds already out there,'' Davis said.
``What can you do that's unique but that still gives back to the
kids, without seeming like you're doing it just because you want
publicity. Throwing money at projects is easy. How do you put time
in with these kids? I spoke to a lot of students after the
shooting. When they start healing, maybe that's when I can start
being involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Terrell Davis left it. On this bright, sunny
afternoon in Manhattan, Davis, who turns 27 in October, cut through
a midtown crowd and signed a few more autographs. Saturday he
returns to a sports world without John Elway, a business world with
a fledgling foundation and a state desperately in need of
inspiration.

N.J. TOWN SHUTS SCHOOLS AFTER E-MAIL THREAT OF MAYHEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBOROUGH TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Friday may have been a perfect
spring day, but 6-year-old Cynthia Ditunnariello and her friends
weren't going anywhere near the candy-cane-colored jungle gym that
beckoned from across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get killed,'' said Cynthia, explaining why
her mother was forcing her to play Friday in the parking lot of
their garden apartment complex. ``There are bad people there trying
to hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the distant purr of a lawn mower, the playground and
the adjacent middle school were eerily quiet Friday as students and
teachers stayed away and police officials continued to search
frantically for the author of an e-mail message that promised
mayhem at the school and prompted widespread hysteria in this
central New Jersey suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think what happened in Colorado was bad, wait until you
see what happens at HMS on Friday,'' read the message _ using the
initials for Hillsborough Middle School _ that was sent to the home
computers of at least five students Wednesday night, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   After word of the threat spread Thursday, the school was emptied
of students, bomb-sniffing dogs were dispatched and police officers
swept through classrooms. But as of Friday night, nothing untoward
had been found. Neither had the person who had sent the nebulous
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without having a crystal ball, it's safe to say that it's
probably a teen-ager and it's probably a prank,'' said Hillsborough
Police Chief Robert Gazaway on Friday afternoon during a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schools Superintendent Robert Gulick, who ordered that
the district's seven schools shut Friday, said they would not
reopen until ``the emergency'' had passed. That move that seemed to
please most parents and students in this expanding town of 40,000,
about 50 miles southwest of from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Although her two children are elementary school students,
Johanna Latocha said she was plagued by the fear that a
grudge-holding gunman might bypass the middle school and go
straight to her children's school nearby, seeking revenge on a
former teacher. ``You never know, some crazy person could just be
lurking out there,'' said Mrs. Latocha, 33, nervously watching
Jake, 7, and Jessica, 8, as they wrestled with fast-melting ice
cream cones. ``I'm so afraid for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Neuweiler, an eighth-grade science teacher, stood in the
middle school's deserted parking lot and tried to fight back tears.
As word of the e-mail message spread from classroom to classroom
Thursday morning, she recalled, many of her students began to panic
and cry. ``I know I need to be strong for the young ones,'' she
said sobbing, ``but this is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   All across the region Friday, the specter of school violence
seemed to be jangling nerves in normally placid communities. In
Cheektowaga, N.Y., students at the middle and high schools were
sent home early after a letter referring to the Littleton, Colo.,
massacre was sent to the principal. In Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., a
13-year-old eighth grader was arrested after writing that he wanted
to ``kill the whole school.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Piscataway, eight Rutgers University students shooting a
film were arrested because they were wearing long black trench
coats and carrying BB guns as props.
</P>
<P>
   In Hillsborough, where horse farms and apple orchards have
recently given way to look-alike housing developments, the low
crime rate and the fact that many people leave their doors unlocked
were all the more reason to be terrified. ``They said it couldn't
happen in Colorado either, but it did,'' said Lillian Rios, 26, a
mother of three school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   School officials seemed to agree with that assessment. Even
before Wednesday's menacing e-mail message, they were preparing
their students for the new era of school-based terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the middle school principal established a new
emergency procedure to deal with Littleton-style incidents.
Although the authorities would not offer details, 11-year-old Eric
Sutherlin described the so-called lock-down mode as follows: ``When
they announce a special code on the intercom, everyone has to get
away from the door and the windows, and get down on the floor,'' he
said. In much the same way as duck-and-cover drills during the Cold
War, students were told that by cowering under their desks, they
might minimize harm from a deadly assault.
</P>
<P>
   All last week at Hillsborough High School, students were
instructed to notify school officials of overheard threats,
bomb-making bluster and even odd behavior. The announcements,
several students said, came daily over the school's public address
system. ``They warned us that anyone who acts strange will get
suspended and the only way they can return to school is to get a
note from a psychiatrist,'' said Melissa Morgan, a ninth grader.
She said talk of death and guns was especially frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   Most students seemed to agree that the precautions were
warranted. Matt Clark, 15, a ninth grader, said that since the
shooting in Colorado, his head had been swirling with bloody
images. ``I'm always afraid that someone is carrying a gun,'' he
said. ``These days I don't trust people I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the streets that weave through housing developments with
names like Hillsborough Village and Majestic Knolls, it wasn't easy
finding children outdoors Friday. Some parents took their children
to the Bridgewater Commons Mall, while a few teen-agers hung out at
the Taco Bell on Route 206, the community's commercial spine.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Moises Alou, who had surgery in February to repair a torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, said Friday his
rehabilitation remains on schedule for an August return to the
Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to rush myself to play before I'm ready,'' said
Alou, who made his first appearance with the Astros since last
October prior to Friday's game with the Florida Marlins at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure I'm 100 percent,'' he said. ``My doctors
won't let me come back. Things are going great. Right now things
are on schedule, if not ahead of schedule. I'm supposed to be back
sometime in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, 32, has remained distant from the Astros since he fell off
a treadmill during a workout in the Dominican Republic. He went
onto the disabled list prior to the start of spring training and
had surgery a week after the initial diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   He has been doing rehab six days a week in nearby Fort
Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros in town for a three-game series, Alou couldn't
resist coming to the ballpark Friday. He sat in the clubhouse
wearing a black brace on his left knee and watching television with
several teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me,'' Alou said. ``As soon as I saw the guys
coming (to Miami), I had to come see my friends. I miss being here.
It just makes me want to come back sooner. I know I can't play
right now. I just have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, a key contributor in the Astros' franchise-record 102-win
season a year ago, finished third in voting for National League
Most Valuable Player after a season in which he had 38 home runs,
124 RBIs and a .312 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes he can come back from the fourth major
injury of his career and help the team over the final two months of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I am in the prime of my career coming off a great
year, and I was looking forward to an even better year,'' Alou
said. ``This is a big blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who has an offseason home in Weston, Fla., a suburb of
Fort Lauderdale, said he has tried not to keep up with how the
Astros are doing in the standings or watch games on television.
</P>
<P>
   Among the games he has watched: Jose Lima's start in San
Francisco on April 14 and Jeff Bagwell's three-homer game April 21
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The more he watches, Alou says, the more he misses the game.
</P>
<P>
   When he first hurt his knee, Alou did not think the injury would
cause him to miss an extended period. He flew to Houston for a
magnetic resonance imaging test, which revealed the torn ligament.
</P>
<P>
   The first few days after learning he would miss five to six
months were especially difficult, Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week was real bad,'' Alou said. ``I never thought it
was this bad. When they told me, my face fell to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou has been on the disabled list seven times during his career
for an assortment of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1990, he suffered a torn rotator cuff in his right
shoulder while diving back to first base on a pickoff attempt in
the Dominican winter league.
</P>
<P>
   That forced him to have surgery and miss the 1991 season.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he suffered a dislocated left ankle and a
broken leg when his spikes caught in the AstroTurf as he made a
quick stop after rounding first base. He missed the final three
weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this so many times,'' Alou said. ``Of all my
surgeries or injuries, I would rank this the third-worst.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Astros continue to take a cautious approach
with Alou's rehab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put a timetable on it, because it's a serious
injury and there's no sense creating expectations,'' general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``The fact is historically the
best-case scenario for an injury like this is coming back in five
to six months. That's how I'm playing it. In my mind, if we have
him back for the month of September I'll be extremely happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens a little quicker, so be it. But I don't think
August is out of the question. But certainly it isn't going to be
before then.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida left fielder Cliff Floyd, who began the season on the
disabled list with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his
left knee, went through rehab workouts with Alou for several weeks
and was impressed with his dedication to return to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks good, real good,'' said Floyd, who was activated
earlier this week and started Friday against the Astros. ``He's
been working hard. His leg is a little weak, but he doesn't think
it will take as long as they say.''

A DEFIANT NRA GATHERS IN DENVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING and related stories.) 
(mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Gathering here for their annual convention just a day
after Littleton, Colo., finished burying its slain children,
officials of the National Rifle Association on Friday rejected any
suggestion that the gun lobby was responsible for the shooting
rampage that left 15 people dead, and insisted that they would
stand fast against any new gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and in remarks prepared for the convention, the
officials said that no additional laws could have prevented the
shootings, that prosecutors needed to enforce existing laws and
that as long as 18-year-olds could be sent to war, they should be
allowed to have firearms at home.
</P>
<P>
   The convention has already been scaled back from three days to
Saturday only, in sympathy with Littleton, just 10 miles away. In
fact, there will be only a business session _ no celebrations or
gun displays _ and the leaders expect it to last no more than two
hours or so.
</P>
<P>
   But the NRA, in the cross hairs once again, as it was after
earlier mass shootings, is determined to go forward with what
remains of the convention, even as the mayor of Denver, Wellington
Webb, and others call on the group to scrap it altogether and
hundreds of protesters plan to demonstrate against it on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not peddling heroin,'' the actor Charlton Heston,
president of the association, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for the meeting, Heston said the gun lobby
was often unfairly cast as the villain after shootings and that any
new controls would be a slippery slope toward losing the right to
bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to remain a steady beacon of strength and
support for the Second Amendment, even if it has no other friend on
the planet,'' he said in his prepared remarks. ``We cannot let
tragedy lay waste to the most rare and hard-won human right in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Friday, Heston and other NRA officials rejected
calls for them to stay away, saying they were part of every
community _ that workers, teachers, parents and law-enforcement
officers are all members of the rifle association. ``Every
community in America is our home,'' Heston said.
</P>
<P>
   James Jay Baker, the association's chief legislative lobbyist,
added, ``We're not going to be chased out of any venue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president, said the
association was proud of upholding ``the freedom'' of Americans to
own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre added that the nation needed to focus on prosecuting
lawbreakers. He said that 6,000 students were found to have brought
weapons to school in 1997 and 1998 and that only 13 were
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the young gunmen in Littleton had violated at least
20 laws and that one or two more statutes would not have prevented
the killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say the association's stance is
disingenuous, since it is calling for more law enforcement on one
hand while fighting current restrictions on gun owners,
particularly through state legislatures, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center
in Washington, said he agreed that current laws needed to be
enforced but that they did not adequately deal with the problem.
``The bulk of laws on the books try to address possession or
point-of-retail sales,'' Sugarmann said. ``Few deal with the
manufacture or distribution, and that's the big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugarmann agreed with NRA officials that most of the gun-control
measures proposed this week by President Clinton would probably
have little effect on the real world of gun violence, though he
supports one such proposal: to require background checks, currently
mandated on gun buyers at federally licensed dealers, on those who
buy at gun shows as well. LaPierre, in remarks prepared for
delivery on Saturday, said the rifle association too would consider
support for checks at gun shows, if Congress rather than the
purchaser paid the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposals also include limiting handgun
purchases to one a month per person and raising the legal age for
handgun possession to 21 from 18, both of which the rifle
association officials said they opposed. Baker, the association's
legislative lobbyist, said that limiting purchases to one a month
could lead to ``none a month.'' Of raising the legal age for
possession, he said: ``If you can be sent to Kosovo and serve in
our armed forces, we certainly think you ought to have the right to
have a firearm.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said the rifle association was backing its own package
of legislative proposals, which, he said, were more comprehensive
and promised greater effectiveness than the president's. They
include a zero-tolerance policy on guns in schools _ violators
would be expelled _ and an increase in penalties for people who
transfer guns to minors. LaPierre said he supported the president's
proposal for a lifetime gun-ownership ban for any juvenile
convicted of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association has canceled the public part of its
long-planned convention here in gun-friendly Colorado, where before
the Littleton shootings Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, had said he
looked forward to ``20,000 cash-carrying'' conventioneers. (The
governor has had nothing to say about the convention since the
killings.) The NRA will not, for example, hold the exhibition of
new weapons that is usually a staple of its annual meeting. Nor
will it bestow awards or hold banquets.
</P>
<P>
   But it is sticking with the business portion, saying its charter
and New York state not-for-profit rules under which it is organized
make it impossible to reschedule for another time and place at this
late date. The association's leaders said they expected more than
500 members to show up.

ALBANIAN WOMAN TELLS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BY SERBIAN SOLDIERS

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Her tormentor told her she was chosen for
her beauty. But it is her determination that sets her apart.
</P>
<P>
   Sherife Alickaj, 18, is one of a small group of ethnic Albanian
women willing to say openly that they were sexually assaulted by
Serbian soldiers during the chaotic exodus from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alickaj said the attack occurred a month ago when she, her
sister and four female friends studying at the University of
Pristina fled their apartment in Pristina after NATO bombing began.
Their landlord warned them that Serbian soldiers were expelling
people from nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   She, her friend Teuta Elshani, 20, and a third woman, who
requested anonymity, gave matching accounts of the attack in
separate interviews. They said Serbian policemen stopped the group
at a nearby checkpoint and ordered them to produce identity cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the six young women hesitated. They were all from the
Drenica region in northern Kosovo, the birthplace of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the guerrilla group battling Yugoslav forces, and
feared retaliation. They said they did not have their identity
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Several officers then ordered them into a nearby building and
searched their bags. Relieved when they were allowed to quickly
exit the building, a sense of dread fell over the group when two of
the policemen announced they would escort the young women back to
their apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alickaj and the other two women said that after following
them into their living room, the policeman ordered the women to
turn over all the money in the house. When the women said they had
none, they tore a necklace from one young woman's throat, and
ordered all six to go into a small room.
</P>
<P>
   The living room had no curtains in the window, Ms. Elshani said.
``They were afraid someone would see us.''
</P>
<P>
   The policemen, saying they were conducting another search,
ordered all six women to take their clothes off. Five burst into
tears as they undressed. Ms. Alickaj maintained her composure and
tried to reason with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you do this?'' she asked. ``Don't you have sisters?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sisters, but they don't want a republic,'' one
policeman retorted, referring to some Kosovar Albanians' demands
for an independent country.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the women were menstruating, the young women said, and
the police tried to force those who were not into another room.
When they began to scream, the police relented.
</P>
<P>
   One of the policemen then ordered five of the women to get
dressed and leave. Ms. Alickaj was told to stay with him in the
apartment. ``We are letting the other girls go because you are the
most beautiful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The five young women, escorted by the other policeman,
reluctantly left the apartment. The officer, Ms. Alickaj said, then
forced her to perform oral sex. ``I was lucky to not be raped in
another way because I was having my period,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The policeman hurriedly left the apartment after the attack, Ms.
Alickaj said, and she ran to her uncle's home. Her friends returned
to the apartment later that day, found Ms. Alickaj gone, and feared
her dead. The group reunited the following day and joined the
exodus to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights investigators and medical aid workers say that so
far relatively few women are reporting sexual assaults, but that
does not mean they are not occurring. The intense social stigma
that accompanies rape in Kosovar Albanian society, particularly for
women from small villages, may be leading victims to simply not
report attacks, they said. The process of coming to grips with the
trauma of such assaults can take weeks, they added, and crowded
refugee camps makes it difficult to discuss such matters with
strangers or even relatives in private.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent Iacopino, an expert on torture and rape who heads a
Physicians for Human Rights team surveying refugees here, said the
scope of the attacks may not be known for months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to tell,'' he said. ``Some of the people who
are experiencing the worst may still be trapped inside Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Few other issues have become as highly charged as rape in the
former Yugoslavia. During the war in Bosnia, Serbian forces were
accused of systematically raping women as a deliberate tactic of
war, a particularly cruel means, human rights investigators said,
of terrorizing and demoralizing one's enemy. Bosnian Serbs were
accused of operating ``rape camps'' where Muslim women were held
captive and repeatedly assaulted by Serbian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But Bosnian Serb officials vehemently dismissed such charges as
propaganda. They accused women of inventing the attacks and
journalists and human rights investigators of exaggerating their
scope.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, NATO officials said they had evidence
corroborating allegations that the Hotel Karagac in the town of Pec
in Western Kosovo was being used as a ``rape camp'' where young
Albanian women were repeatedly assaulted by Serbian soldiers.
Reports of rape have also emerged from refugees fleeing a handful
of other towns, particularly refugees from western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia,
the first such body to classify rape as a war crime, has experts on
sexual assault. Investigators from the tribunal have been
interviewing refugees in Albania and Macedonia, but tribunal
officials declined to comment on the status of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As she told her story last week, Ms. Alickaj spoke in a calm,
matter-of-fact tone. Her face flashed anger at times, but she
seemed determined to not be debilitated by what had occurred. She
freely gave her name and talked openly what the Serbian police had
done to her.
</P>
<P>
   But even for Ms. Alickaj, a young woman described by her friends
as unusually strong, admitting such an attack is both trying and
dangerous. Her female friends discussed the attack without
mentioning what happened to Ms. Alickaj until she arrived and
disclosed it herself.
</P>
<P>
   A male friend who knew of the attack angrily shooed away a
middle-aged man eavesdropping on the conversation. And in a seeming
effort to protect her, the young man blurted out in English ``he
made her do oral sex'' so it would not be understood by other
Albanians nearby.

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR, TALKING SUIT, VENTS IRE AT KRAFT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Robert Kraft has turned overnight from
community savior to Public Enemy No. 1 here.
</P>
<P>
   With carefully chosen words that dripped with scorn and
disbelief, Governor John G. Rowland said Friday evening it looked
as if the New England Patriot's owner had apparently used
Connecticut in a bid to get a better stadium deal elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let him peddle that this was the wrong site,'' Rowland
said at a state capitol news conference. ``Don't buy this
scheduling difficulties and location stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said Connecticut will sue the Kraft family and
``presumably'' the National Football League over the breakdown of
the deal to move to a $374 million publicly financed stadium in
downtown Hartford, after Massachusetts legislators worked this week
to craft a still-undone deal to help Kraft build a new stadium in
Foxboro, next to the current Patriots home.
</P>
<P>
   State lawyers will investigate, Rowland said, whether Kraft
spoke with Massachusetts politicians and others about a new stadium
plan. ``Connecticut is not going to be used as leverage against
other stadium proposals,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always looking for a way out,'' Rowland said, adding
that Kraft never appeared convincingly enthusiastic about the move.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long negotiations reached a denouement on Thursday,
Rowland said, when he gave Kraft 24 hours to ``fish or cut bait.''
Kraft asked for an extension of 30 to 60 days, but Rowland
declined. The Patriots owner had until Sunday to pull out without
financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants hired by Kraft are said to have told him the stadium
site on the Connecticut river had environmental and other problems
that could delay completion of the facility a year beyond its
anticipated opening, into 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Friday, about 4:30 p.m., Kraft called Rowland to pull the
plug. The decision appears to have stunned the governor. ``No one
walks away from a $374 million proposal because the plan might
happen a year later then expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who on Thursday had said that ``failure is not an
option,'' defended his efforts to lure the Patriots to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure on my part is not an option'' Rowland said. ``But
unfortunately, on Mr. Kraft's part, it is an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's anger was echoed by House Speaker Moira K. Lyons,
who said, ``I am extremely disappointed in the Patriots and the
lack of good faith and good principles shown by the Kraft family.''
Lyons said she believed that Rowland ``did everything he could to
try to accommodate the team for the benefit of Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the ornate capitol turned funereal, as state
officals absorbed the news they had been abandoned by a suitor on
whom they had pinned much of Hartford's hope for revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   When Hartford scribe, Mark Twain, said that the reports of his
death were exaggerated, he was not making a prediction for the
Hartford Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Mike Peters was openly disdainful of Kraft. ``I shook
hands with Mr. Kraft eight weeks ago and he said he would be here
in 2002,'' Peters recalled. ``I'll probably never talk to him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said Hartford might join a law suit against the NFL.
``It's almost like defamation of city,'' Peters said. ``We are
going to send a loud message to the NFL and other communities that
have been abused that we shouldn't put up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Kevin Sullivan said that Kraft's decision was
akin to losing a prize fight. ``Dealing with a major sports
franchise is not for the meek or faint of heart. It is a loss for
Hartford, a loss for Connecticut,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate leader said he sensed the deal had soured after NFL

NASA WORKING TO UPGRADE SHUTTLE FLEET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ Without a replacement ship on the
horizon, NASA managers have begun to accelerate plans for upgrades
to keep the venerable space shuttles launching for at least another
decade and potentially for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle fleet quietly marked the 18th anniversary of flight
operations in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we continue to maintain them as well as we have up
to this point, as long as we continue its evolution, this vehicle
could fly another 20 or 30 years,'' said Jim Halsell, an Air Force
test pilot and shuttle commander who is preparing for a fifth
mission in December.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's staunchest proponents believe that with the
blessing of White House policy makers and major alterations that
bolster safety and lower operating costs, the delta-winged ships
could fly for some time.
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans to spend $100 million in upgrades each year, but
would need a formal directive from the White House to expand that
program. A decision could be made next year.
</P>
<P>
   They may have little choice. A $1 billion effort by the space
agency and Lockheed Martin to offer an alternative to the shuttle
has not unfolded smoothly. The development of the VentureStar, a
technically challenging single-stage-to-orbit, reusable rocket has
been delayed. Early this year, its development team delayed until
mid-2000 the test of a suborbital prototype called the X-33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak officially for the administration, for what the
national space policy should be, but I can tell you as a practical
matter, it's prudent for the shuttle program to assume that for the
next few years we will be it,'' said Elric McHenry, who manages the
upgrade effort from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a panel of experts enlisted by the National Research
Council endorsed efforts to upgrade the shuttle. In its report, the
research council called it premature for NASA to proceed with a
sweeping change of the launch propulsion system that would replace
the shuttle`s twin solid fuel rocket boosters. Many engineers favor
replacement of the solid rockets with a liquid fuel rocket that
could make an automated landing after being jettisoned by the
shuttle early in its ascent.
</P>
<P>
   At the present time, the cost of developing the ``liquid fly
back booster'' system, at least $5 billion, is not justified, the
research council concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The primary mission for the shuttle is the assembly of the
international space station, a six-year task initiated late last
year. The shuttle likely will support the station's cargo and crew
rotation needs for much of the 10-year operations period that
follows. Demands for the shuttle could rise if Russia withdraws
from the station partnership in response to financial problems or
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry and others involved in the shuttle upgrade effort
gathered at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida last week to
preview the latest in shuttle improvements _ a $200 million
electronic cockpit display system that is to fly aboard the shuttle
Atlantis late this year.
</P>
<P>
   Its multicolored displays could replace many of the 2,000
mechanical dials, gauges and switches that protrude from every
surface of the shuttle crew cabin. The glass cockpit, as the new
display system is called, is already standard on the latest
commercial airliners, such as Boeing's 777, and new military
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The new display system will allow each shuttle crews to
customize the cramped cockpit for each mission. Once a crew reaches
space it can electronically store the displays needed for the
launch phase and replace them with those needed just for the
orbital phase. Flashing but silent displays with yellow and red
graphics will alert the astronauts to potential mechanical
problems, replacing a distracting system of audible alarms that
often did not reveal specifically which systems were in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when engineers were developing the shuttle a quarter
of a century ago, they were pioneering innovations in flight
control, rather than embracing them.
</P>
<P>
   As Columbia lifted off on the inaugural shuttle mission April
12, 1981, it helped to pioneer another now standard feature on
modern aircraft: fly-by-wire, or computer managed flight control
systems.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry said forthcoming upgrades likely will be focused on
furnishing additional external shielding to protect the shuttle
from micrometeoroids; improving the electrical power generation
system; and installation of more capable flight computers.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers plan to lace the shuttles with a network of fiber
optic sensors that can tip off ground teams as well as shuttle
crews to failing components that do not present a hazard but
require maintenance or replacement once a ship lands.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers also will consider replacement of the outdated
hydraulic power system with one that relies on electro-mechanical
devices and the installation of a new orbital steering system. In
each instance, the use of highly toxic chemicals would be
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency believes the shuttles are robust enough to
justify the new investments.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the orbiters was designed for 100 flights. Columbia and
Discovery are the fleet leaders with 25 flights each. Endeavour has
logged 13 and Atlantis, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger was lost on its 10th mission during a 1986 launch
accident that killed seven crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The airframes, which undergo regular exhaustive inspections,
have held up well, said McHenry.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 safety modifications followed the loss of
Challenger, most notably the redesign of the solid-fuel booster
that triggered the disaster. Just a few years ago, the orbiters
were upgraded so they could dock with Russia's Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   As that mission was completed, the ships were modified again so
they could assemble the new space station. One of the changes
successfully introduced last year was a new external fuel tank that
shaved nearly 8,000 pounds from the shuttle's launch weight.
</P>
<P>
   Safety assessments commissioned by NASA place the odds of a
shuttle loss during the risky launch phase of flight at one in 438,
a considerable improvement over the one in 70 chance of loss in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new safety margin was derived from a $1 billion
upgrade of the shuttle's reusable rocket engines. When it is
complete next year, the engines will sport better turbopumps and
combustion chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think this is old technology,'' said Chris Singer,
NASA's chief engineer for the shuttle's rocket engines. ``But it's
modern, cutting edge. Reusable rocket engines are unheard of
outside of this program.''

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR, TALKING SUIT, VENTS IRE AT KRAFT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Robert Kraft has turned overnight from
community savior to Public Enemy No. 1 here.
</P>
<P>
   With carefully chosen words that dripped with scorn and
disbelief, Governor John G. Rowland said Friday evening it looked
as if the New England Patriot's owner had apparently used
Connecticut in a bid to get a better stadium deal elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let him peddle that this was the wrong site,'' Rowland
said at a state capitol news conference. ``Don't buy this
scheduling difficulties and location stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said Connecticut will sue the Kraft family and
``presumably'' the National Football League over the breakdown of
the deal to move to a $374 million publicly financed stadium in
downtown Hartford, after Massachusetts legislators worked this week
to craft a still-undone deal to help Kraft build a new stadium in
Foxboro, next to the current Patriots home.
</P>
<P>
   State lawyers will investigate, Rowland said, whether Kraft
spoke with Massachusetts politicians and others about a new stadium
plan. ``Connecticut is not going to be used as leverage against
other stadium proposals,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always looking for a way out,'' Rowland said, adding
that Kraft never appeared convincingly enthusiastic about the move.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long negotiations reached a denouement on Thursday,
Rowland said, when he gave Kraft 24 hours to ``fish or cut bait.''
Kraft asked for an extension of 30 to 60 days, but Rowland
declined. The Patriots owner had until Sunday to pull out without
financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants hired by Kraft are said to have told him the stadium
site on the Connecticut river had environmental and other problems
that could delay completion of the facility a year beyond its
anticipated opening, into 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Friday, about 4:30 p.m., Kraft called Rowland to pull the
plug. The decision appears to have stunned the governor. ``No one
walks away from a $374 million proposal because the plan might
happen a year later then expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who on Thursday had said that ``failure is not an
option,'' defended his efforts to lure the Patriots to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure on my part is not an option'' Rowland said. ``But
unfortunately, on Mr. Kraft's part, it is an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's anger was echoed by House Speaker Moira K. Lyons,
who said, ``I am extremely disappointed in the Patriots and the
lack of good faith and good principles shown by the Kraft family.''
Lyons said she believed that Rowland ``did everything he could to
try to accommodate the team for the benefit of Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere in the ornate capitol turned funereal, as state
officals absorbed the news they had been abandoned by a suitor on
whom they had pinned much of Hartford's hope for revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   When Hartford scribe, Mark Twain, said that the reports of his
death were exaggerated, he was not making a prediction for the
Hartford Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Mike Peters was openly disdainful of Kraft. ``I shook
hands with Mr. Kraft eight weeks ago and he said he would be here
in 2002,'' Peters recalled. ``I'll probably never talk to him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said Hartford might join a law suit against the NFL.
``It's almost like defamation of city,'' Peters said. ``We are
going to send a loud message to the NFL and other communities that
have been abused that we shouldn't put up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Kevin Sullivan said that Kraft's decision was
akin to losing a prize fight. ``Dealing with a major sports
franchise is not for the meek or faint of heart. It is a loss for
Hartford, a loss for Connecticut,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate leader said he sensed the deal had soured after NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue visited Massachusetts' political and
business leaders recently.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Hartford, disappointment was mixed wth a
jilted sense of ``good riddance.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Clements, 46, a stagehand and lifelong Hartford resident,
shouted ``go home Pats!'' as somber state officials gathered at the
capitol across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no match to begin with. Let the Patsies say where
they are,'' Clements said. ``I just can't see where the governor
warrants giving that kind of money to a guy who's got more money
than the Vatican.''
</P>
<P>
   As a father of three and a grandfather of five, Clements said he
would prefer to see the stadium money spent on education and road
work.

NO SUMMER VACATION FOR UCLA QUARTERBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA concludes spring football practice with a
scrimmage today at Spaulding Field that may answer a few lingering
questions but will not determine a starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   For that, coach Bob Toledo will wait until training camp.
</P>
<P>
   None of the competitors _ junior Drew Bennett, sophomore Scott
McEwan, redshirt freshmen Cory Paus and Ryan McCann, and true
freshman J.P. Losman _ has dominated play, although each has
performed well in stretches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all made progress, but I want to see how hard they
work in the summer,'' Toledo said. ``If I make a decision, some of
them might not work as hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As they've done in scrimmages throughout the spring, the
quarterbacks will shed their protective red jerseys today and
become live targets _ enabling Toledo and offensive coordinator Al
Borges to evaluate them under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Other intriguing personnel questions include safety, where Eric
Whitfield and Audie Attar are competing to play alongside Jason
Stephens, and outside linebacker, where Billy Pieper and Ali
Abdul-Azziz have traded time with the starting defense.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The Bruins will have a short practice at 1 p.m.
and then start the scrimmage at approximately 1:30. It is open to
the public. Afterward, the Bruins will host an invitation-only
barbecue for football alumni and family.... Receiver Danny Farmer,
who practiced only three days because of his volleyball commitment,
will not participate in the scrimmage. Farmer and defensive lineman
Pete Holland have been voted captains for the 1999 season.... The
Bruins are 600 season tickets ahead of last year's record pace.

AFTER SEEING MILOSEVIC, RUSSIAN HINTS AT PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A Russian envoy said Friday night that he
had made some progress toward a peace settlement after another six
hours of talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, but
NATO officials were dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian negotiator, former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, told Russian reporters that he had made ``solid
progress'' in his second meeting with Milosevic in just over a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that leaders of the NATO member countries will take
that progress seriously, but I cannot say that they will make a
positive decision,'' Chernomyrdin told the Russian news agency,
ITAR-Tass. Asked whether NATO troops would be part of an
international force to police a Kosovo settlement, Chernomyrdin
replied, ``Let's talk about that later.''
</P>
<P>
   Details were nonexistent. But the progress that Chernomyrdin
spoke about appeared to be a Yugoslav willingness to allow
monitoring of Kosovo by lightly armed U.N. observers from NATO
countries like Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has made it clear from the start that any
settlement would include armed observers, not simply unarmed
civilians as Belgrade first demanded.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with United Press International released Friday,
Milosevic proposed a U.N. peacekeeping force armed only for
self-defense, and the return of refugees in exchange for a halt to
military activities.
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO would have to withdraw its troops on the
Kosovo border with Albania and Macedonia, and that he would reduce
Yugoslav forces to as few as 11,000 men from what he said was about
100,000 currently.
</P>
<P>
   However, an armed U.N. presence by itself falls well short of
NATO demands for a force with NATO troops at its core.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright responded, ``I think we are not anywhere near a serious
proposal,'' Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic, hinted
Friday at some change in the Yugoslav position. He said Belgrade
would accept a solution that passed the U.N. Security Council,
where the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China have
vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Yugoslavia would accept a Security Council decision
that any international monitors for Kosovo be armed, Vujovic said:
``Russia and China are members of the U.N. Security Council too,
and if the U.N. Security Council would move in that direction it
would be supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the news conference he again chose not to repeat
Belgrade's earlier line that only unarmed civilians from non-NATO
countries could participate. ``We would never accept military
occupying forces,'' he said, a clear reference to NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials have said that they do not regard the United
Nations as an occupying force, and even before the bombing, the
Serb legislature had approved the idea of a U.N. presence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Vujovic, pressed later on CNN, stopped dropping hints and
retreated to the previously stated public position. ``We are
speaking about a U.N. international mission, unarmed and
civilian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, however, expects nearly all Serb forces to be
withdrawn, replaced by a NATO-centered force and a newly formed
local police responsible to newly elected local authorities, not to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is also talking of an ``international protectorate'' for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia, meanwhile, insists upon retaining full sovereignty and
says that the bombing must stop before serious negotiations take
place, and that NATO must withdraw its troops from neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   So there seems quite a long way to go before any settlement is
reached, but there also seems to be new eagerness in both Belgrade
and Washington to use Chernomyrdin to help find one.
</P>
<P>
   While the bombing and the negotiations go on, so far on opposing
tracks, Milosevic pursues his own internal solution to the Kosovo
crisis, and the exodus of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo continues.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has also pointed to an agreement on Wednesday by an
ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, and the Serb president,
Milan Milutinovic, to set up a temporary executive in Kosovo and
negotiate a wide autonomy for the province. Foreigners would be
invited to observe the talks, but only as guests.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic called the agreement ``the first joint victory for the
Serbs and the Albanians in the search for peace.'' NATO insists
that Rugova is not a free actor and is being manipulated by
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The official Yugoslav press agency, Tanjug, said that Milosevic
and Chernomyrdin ``expressed their joint commitment in favor of a
peaceful solution to the problems.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One night, maybe soon, the first U.S. Apache
helicopters are supposed to take off from a makeshift base in
Albania, pause to refuel in the rugged northern Albanian hills and
then, with rockets raining ahead of them, fly into Kosovo to try to
do what NATO's high-flying jets have not done: eviscerate
Yugoslavia's armored forces.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks carry enormous risk, though. And for that reason
President Clinton still has not approved their use in combat in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Pentagon touted ``the most capable and lethal
helicopter in the world,'' and parked one on its lawn today for
display, officials said they feared that the Apaches in the Balkans
could be shot down with relative ease and so have withheld the
final authorization.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO's raids have weakened Yugoslavia's air defenses, the
Apaches would still be particularly vulnerable to shoulder-fired
missiles and even small-arms fire, the officials said. Those
missiles, including SA-7s, have been largely unaffected by NATO's
strikes, and Yugoslavia's armed forces are said to have hundreds of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any confidence we have taken any of those out,''
a senior defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``You don't know where some guy is going to come out of the woods
with an SA-7. They could really have those anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they fire, the official added grimly, ``there's no
warning.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been six weeks since NATO's senior commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, requested them and nearly a week since he went to their base
at Albania's main airfield and declared that they would enter the
fray soon. But officials in Washington said it could be many more
days or even weeks before they are ready to risk their use over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is higher risk than dropping bombs at 40,000 feet,'' a
senior military official said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Apaches would open a new phase in a war that so
far has been fought from great heights, at great distances. Apache
pilots, flying no more than 100 feet off the ground, will for the
first time confront Yugoslav troops up close _ in what one officer
described Friday as warfare's equivalent of ``a knife fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern over their use has underscored the Clinton
administration's insistence on minimizing the risk to U.S. and NATO
pilots, avoiding casualties at all cost. It also highlighted a rift
with NATO's commanders, including Clark, who have pressed political
leaders to do more against Yugoslav army and paramilitary units in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with reporters this week, Gen. Klaus Naumann, the
German who is chairman of NATO's military committee, referred to
the divisions over using the Apaches as ``a battle.'' He added,
``What I know for sure is that the Apache is a marvelous instrument
to cope with the situation we are confronted with right now in
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apache helicopter _ officially the AH-6HA _ was designed
during the Cold War to counter thrusts by Soviet tanks, other
armored vehicles and artillery batteries. Narrow and boxy and
bristling with weapons, it hugs the terrain, flying at speeds up to
200 miles per hour just above treetops and telephone wires, even in
the dead of night.
</P>
<P>
   Each Apache carries 16 Hellfire missiles, which can be fired
within eight minutes with a range of nearly five miles, as well as
38 smaller rockets and a 30-mm cannon. Its two pilots have
eyepieces attached to their helmets, letting them scan targets
through a grainy black-and-white image and guide missiles with
lasers.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches were acclaimed for their success during the Persian
Gulf war in 1991, when they destroyed scores of Iraqi tanks and
vehicles. Only one was shot down. But Yugoslavia is not Iraq, and
the terrain, weather and potency of the Yugoslav defenses poses a
significantly tougher challenge.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Friday, Col. Michael Hackerson, a former
Apache pilot who is now the Army's deputy chief of staff for
operations, said the Apaches would make ``deep strikes'' from
Albania with the support of long-range rockets that pounded enemy
air-defense targets. The Apaches, he said, could use their lasers
to identify targets for the higher-flying warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Hackerson said it was unlikely that the Apaches, which usually
fly in pairs, would go into Kosovo and search for targets. Instead,
he said, they would fly to targets already spotted by spy
satellites or reconnaissance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   That could limit the effectiveness of the Apaches, since the
Yugoslav forces, unlike the amassed Soviet columns they were
designed to take out, are dispersed and hidden, in some cases in
churches or barns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a little more disorganized than a normal column of
tanks that you would see and be able to identify, but that's a risk
that, you know, we're prepared to take,'' Hackerson said. Referring
to Yugoslavia's shoulder-fired missiles, he added, ``It could
potentially turn into a bit of a knife fight.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Apaches' deployment has been a bit rocky.
NATO authorized their use on April 5, but their arrival in Albania
was delayed by a sluggish bureaucracy, the austerity of Albania's
airport and finally foul weather. One helicopter broke down in
Italy. On Monday, one crashed while training in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of soldiers and weapons backing them up
continues to grow. Last week, the Pentagon announced that it was
bolstering the force with 15 tanks, 14 more Bradley armored
vehicles, 8 howitzers and other heavy weapons. Those forces, which
officials said were needed to protect the Apaches, are not supposed
to start arriving until next week.

<P>
   Dianne Lawe, a private investigator, arrived early enough on an
overcast morning last November to beat the garbage truck to Harry
Leonhardt's home in a tranquil neighborhood north of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When she lifted the lid of the dark green trash can at the foot
of Leonhardt's driveway, Ms. Lawe found just what the lawyers who
had hired her said she might: a trove of financial documents, many
of them emblazoned with the corporate name of the National Gypsum
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Leonhardt, a consultant and former building industry executive
who had advised National Gypsum as it went through a messy
bankruptcy in the early 1990s, had been ordered in a subpoena to
turn over any papers he had relating to the company. The lawyers
say they sent Ms. Lawe to check Leonhardt's trash the day before
his scheduled deposition because they thought he might be tempted
to throw away whatever documents he had; he later explained that he
did not even realize he still had the papers and simply was
cleaning boxes out of his closets.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other companies that make construction materials,
National Gypsum filed for bankruptcy to help rid itself of
thousands of injury claims that were pouring in from people who had
become ill _ or feared they would _ after inhaling asbestos in the
manufacturers' products.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguished National Gypsum's case was the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   For three prominent investment firms that held most of the
company's senior debt _ Fidelity Management and Research; Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. and the Trust Company of the West, an investment firm
based in Los Angeles _ gypsum turned to gold when National Gypsum
went on to flourish after it emerged from bankruptcy in 1993,
largely in their control. The firms doubled or even quadrupled
their initial investments, making upwards of $240 million in
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of others had claims against National Gypsum _
asbestos-exposed workers, school districts, hospitals and
universities that spent millions ripping asbestos from their
ceilings and walls, investors who bought National Gypsum bonds for
their retirement accounts. At best, they were left with mere
fractions of what they were owed.
</P>
<P>
   Those creditors have been unhappy with the company almost from
the day the trouble started. But now their lawyers _ the people who
hired Ms. Lawe _ say they finally have proof that the resolution of
the bankruptcy case was a miscarriage of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers say documents they have uncovered suggest that
before the bankruptcy was settled, the company and the investment
firms had a secret cost-cutting plan, devised by Leonhardt, that
had the potential to add millions to the company's value _ and
eventually did. Though bankruptcy court judges are supposed to
approve all advisers and professional fees, the court was never
told that National Gypsum had hired Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton, the
consulting firm, to flesh out the plan.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary: The company and the investment firms' experts
said on the witness stand that National Gypsum's expenses had
already been cut to the bone. Documents that might have painted a
different story _ like those in Leonhardt's trash _ are only now
making their way to the courthouse, as part of a long-running
lawsuit now heading to a Texas appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants in that suit _ including the three investment
firms, former executives of National Gypsum, and Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, the company's financial adviser during the bankruptcy
(but not Leonhardt, whose behind-the-scenes role was not initially
known to the plaintiffs) _ all say there was no secret plan and no
misconduct of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fantasy piece,'' said Bryant C. Boren Jr., a Dallas
lawyer who has kept busy representing the company's former officers
and directors in much of the litigation that has trailed the
bankruptcy. What the creditors' lawyers call Leonhardt's secret
plan, Boren added, was nothing more than his sales pitch for a role
in restructuring National Gypsum.
</P>
<P>
   The investment firms, meanwhile, say their gains were their
rightful reward for making the risky choice to take stock in
National Gypsum in exchange for their bankruptcy claims. It was an
unforeseen upturn in the economy and the housing market _ not some
back-room conspiracy _ that led those shares to triple soon after
the company emerged from bankruptcy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the rise in National Gypsum's stock price
subsequent to the reorganization was principally due to an upturn
in the U.S. housing market generally and in gypsum prices in
particular,'' said Scott Beyerl, a spokesman for Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   And in any event, the defendants add, the dispute has already
been aired in court and resolved in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Undisputed, though, is the meager amount that National Gypsum's
bankruptcy left for a long parade of creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been had,'' said Alfred B. Earnest, a retired
human-resources manager from Houston, who invested $1,800 of his
retirement money in the company's junior bonds in 1986. After years
of waiting, Earnest was paid $592.65 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties are high, too, for asbestos-exposed workers counting
on payments from a trust fund established during the bankruptcy
proceedings. Already, 300,000 claims have been filed, even though
the first signs of lung disease often do not emerge until 30 years
after the exposure.
</P>
<P>
   National Gypsum's fund, which has received a total of $518
million to pay claims, may run out of money as soon as 2002,
according to W. Dee Hilton, its managing trustee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the alleged fraud committed during the bankruptcy
process, the trust did not get the money that it would have,''
Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The three investment firms, however, received the entire value
of their bonds _ and, in the end, much, much more. Lawyers for the
asbestos trust, Earnest and the others who held the company's
junior bonds estimate that Fidelity; Goldman, Sachs; the Trust
Company of the West, and a few other senior creditors walked away
with securities that, in total, were eventually worth as much as
$800 million for bankruptcy claims that had a face value of only
about $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because the bankruptcy had driven down the value of
National Gypsum bonds, the stakes actually cost the three
investment firms only about $120 million to acquire.

PATRIOTS OWNER SPURNS HARTFORD STADIUM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft walked away
from the richest stadium deal ever in professional sports Friday, a
joyous victory for Massachusetts sports fans but a devastating blow
to Hartford's revitalization dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Governor John G. Rowland, Kraft explained that
the team did not believe Connecticut could finish the proposed $374
million by 2002 as promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have not seen sufficient evidence to give us
adequate assurance that the planned Hartford stadium can be ready
for the beginning of 2002 season on the terms we contemplated in
our agreement,'' Kraft said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut had struggled to determine how much money and how
much time it would take to prepare the heavily polluted site for
construction. Under his deal with Connecticut, Kraft was free to
back out without penalty by Sunday if he concluded the stadium
could not be completed on time or within budget.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's consultants told him Thursday that it would likely be
2003 at the earliest before the Patriots could play in the new
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who less than 24 hours earlier stood alongside Kraft
and expressed confidence the Hartford deal would go through,
denounced the Patriots' pullout and threatened to sue the Kraft
family and the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one walks away from a $374 million plan because a schedule
not might hit the exact date he would like to see it happen,'' he
said. ``We'll find out soon enough what the real reason was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let the fear of litigation prevent us from doing our
job,'' said Joseph Brown, an NFL vice president. `'In this case, we
went to Massachusetts to see if a viable alternative existed and to
help make one a reality. It was Mr. Kraft's decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The league said it expected to take up the alternative stadium
offer cobbled together earlier this week by Massachusetts when team
owners meet in Atlanta in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's brief statement, which repeatedly praised Connecticut's
efforts over the past year, did not mention the Bay State's rival
bid. But most in Massachusetts thought the message was clear: the
Patriots would stay in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England Patriots will be playing football in
Massachusetts, where they belong,'' said Governor Paul Cellucci
from California, where he was promoting Massachusetts to the film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like winning a game in overtime,'' declared Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham. ``It's a win for Patriots fans, the
state, and taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who many argued drove the
Patriots into Connecticut's arms by blocking a bid last year to use
state funds to help the team build a new facility in Foxborough,
praised Kraft's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Kraft deserves an awful lot of credit for the
decision he made,'' Finneran said. ``Mr. Kraft is the first to
break a very discouraging _ and what I have said is an
inappropriate _ trend, and that deserves commendation.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Bay State leaders said there would be no problem
passing a bill to keep the team in Massachusetts before NFL owners
meet May 25. Birmingham said he expected the Senate to pass the
measure next week.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the agreement Birmingham, Cellucci, and Finneran
negotiated late Tuesday night, the state would provide $70 million
in funds for roads, sewers and other public improvements around a
new Foxboro Stadium. In return, Kraft would build a privately
financed $250 million stadium, with assistance from the NFL. The
Massachusetts plan would also require him to pay up to $1 million a
year to the state to offset the infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Connecticut offered not only a taxpayer-funded
stadium, but also a host of benefits, including a promise that the
state would pick up the tab for any unsold luxury or club seats
over the next 30 years. Sports financing experts have said the
guarantees alone would have been worth more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply unprecedented,'' said Marc Ganis, head of
Sportscorp, a Chicago consulting firm specializing in stadium
development firm. ``That's bankable money the team could count on
for the next 30 years. The idea of walking away from that without
having a another deal firmly in hand is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Local business and political leaders said they were confident
Kraft wanted to keep the team in Massachusetts, but many were
stunned that he chose to terminate his deal in Connecticut before
lawmakers formally adopted a counterproposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a sign that he is committed to his home state in
a way few of us could imagine,'' said former Democratic National
Committee chairman Paul Kirk to whom the NFL turned to orchestrate
a last-minute campaign to keep the team in Foxborough. ``He's put a
lot of trust in the state's political leaders and the business
community living up to their verbal commitments. And I expect all
the parties will.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL tapped Kirk because it wanted to stop the Patriots from
abandoning the nation's sixth-largest media market for Hartford,
ranked 27th. National broadcast revenues, which are split among all
owners, are the lifeblood of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL said it would not comment on Rowland's threat of a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft launched his search for a new stadium because Foxboro
ranks last in the league in the number of premium seats, an
important revenue for team owners. Foxboro Stadium has 39 luxury
suites and no club seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said a new stadium on land Kraft already owns in
Foxborough is likely to sport 100 to 125 luxury suites and 6,000 to
8,000 club seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community's commitment to long-term sales of
luxury boxes is key,'' the source said. ``The Patriots cannot
afford to pay for their own stadium and keep a competitive team on
the field without luxury box sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said that if Kraft accepts the Massachusetts deal, a new
Foxboro Stadium could be built by 2002, perhaps even 2001, because
the site does not suffer from the pollution woes of the property
offered by Rowland along the Connecticut River. Hartford's proposal
was also hampered by delays in arranging the relocation of a steam
plant and its corporate headquarters from the site.
</P>
<P>
   The aborted stadium was slated to be the centerpiece of
Adriaen's Landing, a billion-dollar redevelopment project that
Rowland and Hartford civic leaders hoped would revitalize the
ailing city. Those project, unveiled in May 1998, included a domed
stadium with at least 35,000 seats for UConn, but were greatly
modified when the Patriots agreed to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the project would continue. ``The original
Adriaen's Landing project was very sufficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft had agreed to invest $75 million in the project, building
a hotel, NFL entertainment complex, and fitness center. But a
carefully crafted contract, negotiated with the aid of his son
Jonathan, gave him the right to pull out by Sunday if he was
uncertain the stadium would be ready by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it slipped to 2003, who could tell if would slip to 2004,''
said one person familiar with contract. ``There was too much
risk.''

 UNDATED: to acquire.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman, which put up $31.8 million, acknowledges that it more
than doubled its money. (Those profits are atop the investment
banking fees it made for advising National Gypsum to take on debt
in the mid-1980s.) Trust Company of the West says it quadrupled its
initial investment of $40 million or so. Fidelity has not divulged
details but lawyers for the other creditors believe that it at
least doubled a $30 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge who spent three years shepherding National
Gypsum through bankruptcy has second thoughts about those results.
</P>
<P>
   In a written opinion a year ago _ in which he was in the awkward
position of arguing that his own judgment ought to be re-examined _
Judge Steven A. Felsenthal said he was concerned that the ``very
integrity'' of the bankruptcy process might have been harmed by the
possible concealment of work-force cuts intended to save $30
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was ``keenly sensitive'' to the protection of jobs
during the bankruptcy process, Felsenthal wrote, ``substantial
work-force reductions were not presented to the court'' when he was
asked to confirm National Gypsum's reorganization plan.
</P>
<P>
   During the bankruptcy, Felsenthal had rejected arguments that
the company was underestimating its value, saying there was no
evidence to back up that claim. Had he known that the company would
be announcing layoffs in October 1993, just three months after it
emerged from his court, the case would have ended differently,
Felsenthal said in his January 1998 opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the company would have been greater, and ``unpaid
asbestos claimants and unpaid bondholders would have benefited,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Felsenthal's ruling came on a narrow issue about the payment
of certain legal fees. The fraud case is being argued in Texas
state court, and there the disgruntled creditors' charges have been
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, David C. Godbey, a Texas district court judge,
decided without much explanation to leave the outcome of the
bankruptcy case essentially intact.
</P>
<P>
   That is the decision that the asbestos trust fund and creditors
who owned the junior bonds plan to appeal. They say the district
court gave short shrift to evidence they discovered, largely over
the last year, of a conspiracy to conceal the company's true
financial value during the bankruptcy court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They walked away with $500 million of value that belonged to
other people,'' said James R. Moriarty, a Houston lawyer who
represents the junior bondholders. ``These people have committed an
outrageous fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, however, argue that letting bankruptcies be
reopened because events didn't turn out as some of the parties
expected would destroy the system. ``The consequences of permitting
that second trial would indeed be devastating to the principle of
finality of judgments,'' the lawyers wrote in their motion asking
Godbey to dismiss the case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until late 1997 that the lawyers for the creditors
began to piece together what they now contend took place behind the
scenes of the bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing before Felsenthal, a lawyer for the company's
former executives said the work-force reductions were not
management's idea, but had come from consultants at Booz-Allen.
That was the first that the plaintiffs' lawyers had heard of
Booz-Allen's involvement. But with that lead, the lawyers
subpoenaed Booz-Allen and obtained many key documents, including a
plan prepared by Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   When Leonhardt was confronted last fall with the discovery of
the documents in his trash _ including spreadsheets that showed his
estimates of the company's worth _ he said it was all an innocent
mistake. He had no idea he had any relevant documents, he told the
junior creditors' lawyers at his deposition; he was simply cleaning
his closets, and the spreadsheets and other papers, which he did
not even know he had, must have been in boxes he was tossing.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers say they believe there are many more documents
that the defendants should have turned over long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've put up every conceivable obstacle to try to keep us
from getting at the truth,'' Moriarty said. ``Every single
defendant has said they don't have the documents. It's all part of
their plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren said in response, ``It shouldn't surprise anybody that
people who claim there's a conspiracy but can't find evidence of
that then say there's a conspiracy to hide the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time, however, that National Gypsum has
been accused of being slow to produce crucial documents in a court
proceeding. In June 1990, when the asbestos lawsuits hit a
crescendo, the company lost a case filed by 52 Texas school
districts that had bought its building products and wanted to be
reimbursed for the cost of removing them.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his ruling, the Texas district court judge who
decided the case said he was dismayed by evidence that National
Gypsum had concealed or not produced documents that the schools had
subpoenaed while preparing their case. Later, just before a
subsequent trial was to begin, to decide how much money the Texas
schools should get, the company filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, stopping
that trial and hundreds of similar lawsuits dead in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   By filing for bankruptcy, National Gypsum transferred the injury
claims from the trial courts, where juries don't generally consider
whether a company can afford to pay any damages they might award,
to federal bankruptcy court, where the priority is settling a
company's debts so it can continue its operations.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the bankruptcy, a trust fund was set up to pay the
asbestos claims. The company has contributed $138 million to the
fund, while insurance companies have so far agreed to pay $380
million. But that money will not cover claims expected to reach
$2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With the fund running out of money, asbestos-exposed workers who
are not yet ill wonder what will be left for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors tell me sooner or later it's coming around,'' said
Leroy Gilley, a retired boilermaker in Chickasaw, Ala., who spent
four decades insulating boilers and has buried friends who died
from lung disease. The trust fund should have money ``until all the
people are gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund also was responsible for reimbursing property
owners that had claims against the company. Because money is tight,
that group has received less than half of the cost of their
repairs. The biggest claimant, New York City's schools, sought
about $44 million and have received $20 million, Hilton said.

 UNDATED: Hilton said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonhardt has not been named as a defendant in any of the
litigation, but his work is at the heart of what the angry
creditors are calling fraud in the National Gypsum bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   A consultant with more than 40 years of experience in the
building and gypsum industries, he prepared an analysis _ never
disclosed to Felsenthal _ that concluded that National Gypsum was
paying $40 million a year too much for costs associated with
selling its products and operating its administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Leonhardt is significant because, while he was
preparing it in 1992, the company's executives and other
consultants hired by the investment firms were testifying in court
that those costs could not be reduced and would instead rise with
inflation by about 3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Days after Felsenthal, relying on the testimony, approved
National Gypsum's reorganization plan in April 1993, a series of
private meetings about implementing a cost-cutting program began,
according to documents obtained by the creditors' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Attending the meetings were Leonhardt; Peter C. Browning, chief
executive of National Gypsum, and two men whom Trust Company of the
West hoped to place on National Gypsum's board: Richard Masson, a
managing director of Trust Company of the West, and Vincent J.
Naimoli, now an owner of baseball's Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who was
then chief executive of Anchor Industries International.
</P>
<P>
   According to an April 16, 1993, memo written by Browning, it was
agreed on April 1 that National Gypsum would hire Booz-Allen to
help determine which specific costs could be cut and which workers
could be let go. On April 6, Browning wrote a memo informing
employees of the company's decision to bring in the consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Handwritten notes taken during the April meetings by John E.
McGrath, a Booz-Allen consultant, indicate that one of the
participants said the company could save as much as $40 million, or
50 percent of its selling, general and administrative costs. ``30
percent to 50 percent SG&AMP;A can go!'' he scribbled. His notes also
say that there was an opportunity to increase the value of the
company by $200 million to $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this juncture, the junior creditors contend, that
National Gypsum and the investment firms made a clear choice to
hide their plans from the bankruptcy court. The accusers point to
another passage in Browning's April 16 memo, in which he says that
Booz-Allen's work needed to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it is felt by counsel that the project would require
court approval at this stage,'' the memo says, ``we have decided to
postpone the initial phase'' until either the company emerged from
bankruptcy ``or whenever we have reached a point where obtaining
court approval would be more appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition, Browning testified that it was appropriate for
the men _ all of whom expected to be directors of the new National
Gypsum that would emerge from bankruptcy _ to begin talking about
future plans for the company. But actually spending the money to
hire Booz-Allen was a matter for the new company, which would not
exist until July, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, National Gypsum formally emerged from bankruptcy that
July 1, without ever having informed the court of its dealings with
Booz-Allen. The first announcement of the restructuring was made on
Oct. 5, 1993, when the company announced that it was laying off 12
percent of its work force to save $30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The news came just a month after a key legal deadline; the
creditors had until Sept. 6 to ask Felsenthal to revoke the
company's reorganization plan if they suspected fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Playing out the opportunity that the executives had envisioned,
National Gypsum's cost-reduction plans delighted the stock market.
In the week after the layoffs were announced, the stock rose 20
percent; by February 1994, the company's shares had hit $40 _ more
than three times the $12.50 price at which they had been valued, at
the urging of the company and investment funds, by the bankruptcy
court. Gypsum prices were booming during the period, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the disgruntled creditors estimate that the three
investment firms would have turned their $295 million bankruptcy
claim into $790 million if they held their stock until October
1995, when National Gypsum was acquired for $54 a share, or about
$1.2 billion, by Delcor Inc., a private investment company led by
National Gypsum's former chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the firms held the stock that long. The Justice
Department required Goldman, Sachs to sell its 20 percent stake in
November 1993 after federal antitrust officials learned that
Goldman's Water Street Fund also owned 43 percent of the USG Corp.,
National Gypsum's largest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman made a profit of about $70 million on the deal,
according to a deposition by Barry S. Volpert, who managed the
National Gypsum investment for the Water Street Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Goldman, Sachs said that because the firm sold its
shares so quickly after National Gypsum emerged from bankruptcy, it
could not have reaped any benefit even if there were a secret plan.
They also said Goldman had intentionally taken no role in creating
new business plans for National Gypsum because it knew it would
have to sell its investment quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Trust Company of the West held its stock longer; according to
evidence obtained by the junior creditors' lawyers, the firm sold
its stock and bonds, which had cost $40 million, piecemeal from
1993 to 1995 for $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers sting for people who haven't shared in the good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big money guys took care of themselves,'' said Jackie
Fields, who owns a Phillips 66 distributorship in McAllen, Texas,
and bought some of the company's money-losing junior bonds, ``and
left everybody else in the cold.''

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   METROPOLITAN-OPERA (subslug) (New York) _ There is no other
company like it, and yet the Metropolitan Opera may end up a model
for the future. In the season just closed and the one to come, the
Met continues a practice of self-sufficiency and free enterprise
that is largely unfamiliar to the international opera world. But
now we see the free-spending ways of government-subsidized opera
houses being strenuously curbed. Indeed, the adventurous, the
innovative and sometimes the reckless are no longer automatically
underwritten by generous European ministries of culture. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MASTERPIECES-VIDEO (Undated) _ ``Making Masterpieces'' video
takes you into the conservation lab of the National Gallery in
London and shows you how artists achieve their special effects. By
Deborah Solomon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FLOCKHART-FILM (Los Angeles) _ There were those in the team of
British hair and makeup experts hired to give her the fairy-tale
makeover for Michael Hoffman's adaptation of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' who expected nothing good from Calista Flockhart. And they
told her so. Cast as the lovesick Helena, the television star was
going to pop over from America and proceed to be finicky, imperious
and exasperatingly unaware of just how horribly she was mangling
the Bard's words. Hoffman's version of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' which opens May 14, is contemporary in spirit while being
conscientious about theme, text and Elizabethan diction. By Margy
Rochlin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   STAR-WARS-FILM (subslug) (Hollywood) _ Surveying the
summer-movie landscape, Universal studios had at first intended to
open its high-profile romance ``Notting Hill,'' starring Julia
Roberts and Hugh Grant, a month after the release, on May 19, of
George Lucas's ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace,'' one
of the most anticipated films in years. But then Universal
executives sat down, took a second look and decided on a more
innovative, if riskier, plan: move ``Notting Hill,'' which is about
a Hollywood star and a British bookshop owner who fall in love,
right into the eye of the storm. Now, it will open only one week
after the new ``Star Wars,'' when frenzy over the science-fiction
film is likely to be at a peak. By Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES-SELL (Undated) _ How quaint to recall the days when
doubting a movie's honesty meant wondering whether its hero was
standing on a box. Now there are more important things to question:
whether the box is virtual or real, and whether it contains
anything that the film might want to sell. With the growing
prevalence of the many-tentacled corporate concept known as
vertical integration, we've seen ever more ingenious ways to
undermine what appears on screen. Would-be hits on the summer
horizon offer an invitation to visit the Web site, buy the toys,
wear the T-shirt, hear the soundtrack and play the video game. Oh,
if there's time left over, see the movie too. By Janet Maslin.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILMS-TOYS (Undated) _ The products that spin off from films
serve the same function in our pop cosmogony as religious relics
did in medieval times: They're little bits of the immaterial (too
often literally, alas) made material. That may sound specious: The
toe-joint of a saint is not the same as a Klingon-English
dictionary. On the other hand, have you ever been to a ``Star
Trek'' convention?. By Ty Burr. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN-POWERS-II-FILM (Undated) _ When ``Austin Powers,
International Man of Mystery'' became a surprise hit back in May
1997, the executives at Time Warner did more than just congratulate
the folks at their subsidiary, New Line Cinema. They got to work.
Fo them, the spoof, starring Mike Myers as a foppish secret agent
cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out in the present,
had more than just laughs and an obvious sequel going for it
(``Austin Powers II: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' opens on June 11).
With its goofy characters, accessible irony and catch phrases like
``Shag-a-delic, baby,'' it provided an opportunity to demonstrate
the raison d'etre of the modern entertainment conglomerate:
``synergy.'' By Nancy Hass. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DEEP-BLUE-SEA-FILM (Hollywood) _ For ``Deep Blue Sea,'' the film
director Renny Harlin has assembled more than 300 tracks of
recorded sounds, so that an essentially noiseless sea creature can
chew through metal and flesh _ and, with any luck, the summer box
office after the film's July 30 release _ in deafening Dolby
digital. By Bruce Newman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SEQUELS (Undated) _ The days of the sequel are numbered. Or
rather, Roman numeraled. ``Lethal Weapon,'' the Mel Gibson vehicle
that went from zero to IV in 11 years, will have no '99 model.
Rocky Balboa's five-bout film career ended in 1990, after a savage
critical beating that left him, and moviegoers, with collateral
brain damage. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose most famous film line
is, ``I'll be back,'' won't be: The Terminator's term limit was
two. Thank goodness, because the sequel and prequel have become
cinematic Nyquil, putting audiences to sleep with their metronomic
monotony. By Franz Lidz and Steve Rushin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EURO-SUMMER-FILMS (Paris) _ The wedding lasted from late one
August afternoon through daybreak. At a long table beneath the
shady trees in Normandy, three generations toasted the newlyweds
with homemade Calvados and unlabeled champagne from the in-laws'
vineyards. The table was artfully strewn with fruit and flowers.
Chickens plucked the meadow grass; children feasted on peaches
nearly burst with sweetness. I danced with a queue of expectant boy
cousins under the 3 a.m. stars. Somewhere in the midst of all that,
I stole away inside myself and thought: I feel like I'm in a movie.
For in my New England childhood, long before it was possible to
make such romantic pilgrimages in person, European cinema had
taught me how to dream of a European summer. By Kristin Hohenadel.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENT-FILMS (Undated) _ Production of independent films in
the United States is at an all-time high (about 1,000 starts a
year), and there is an expanding market for them on television,
with the success of cable networks like the Independent Film
Channel, and on the ever-burgeoning festival circuit. But within
the entertainment business, the consensus suddenly seems to be
that, documentaries aside, powerful, innovative independent films
are thin, and that it has been a while since anything has measured
up to the likes of ``Stranger Than Paradise,'' ``She's Gotta Have
It,'' ``Blood Simple,'' ``Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' ``Reservoir
Dogs'' or ``Safe,'' to name some of the high points of the
movement. By Graham Fuller. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JASPERSE-DANCE (Undated) _ If Albert Camus had made dances
instead of writing fiction, they might have looked like the work of
the choreographer John Jasperse. The final image of Jasperse's
``Waving to You From Here,'' which was performed at Dance Theater
Workshop in Manhattan two years ago, still haunts with its
depiction of despair. Jasperse's new work, ``Madison as I Imagine
It,'' a 55-minute abstract dance for four people _ Miguel
Guitierrez, Parker Lutz, Juliette Mapp (who is from Madison, Wis.)
and Jasperse _ with music by Hahn Rowe, received its world premiere
two weeks ago at the Spring Dance Festival in Utrecht, the
Netherlands. Beginning Thursday, the John Jasperse Company will
present it in eight performances at Dance Theater Workshop in
Manhattan, through May 16. By William Harris. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PICKER-MUSIC (Undated) _ It was a signal moment in the rebirth
of tonality. When the curtain rose on Tobias Picker's first opera,
``Emmeline,'' in 1996, the orchestra conjured an atmosphere of grim
foreboding, circling endlessly around a single, brooding chord. As
if to emphasize his immersion in the dark realm of B flat minor,
Picker, 45, prefaced the score with a device long scorned by
modernists: a key signature. Picker's embrace of tonality, though
particularly unambiguous, is hardly unique. Today, it seems, every
composer is eager to be portrayed as a lapsed modernist, newly
liberated from the shackles of Serialism. On Friday evening, the
Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York offers the
premiere of Picker's Cello Suite, performed by the cellist Lynn
Harrell and the pianist Anne-Marie McDermott at Alice Tully Hall.

</P>
<P>
   REVUELTAS-MUSIC (Undated) _ In the calendar of saints, the last
day of the year belongs to St. Sylvester, and it was on that day in
the last year of the 1800s that the Mexican composer Silvestre
Revueltas was born. Now, several months before his centenary, Sony
Classical has released an exhilarating Revueltas album, with
Esa-Pekka Salonen conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its
New Music Group, and other new releases round out the picture. By
Paul Griffiths. (Moved).

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JUNKYARD-SCULPTOR (New York) _ Ms. Nancy Rubins, 46, a sculptor
who creates monumental works out of oversize junkyard debris is in
the Rolodex of certain suppliers of airplane parts. They call her
when something special comes in, like a dismembered fuselage, a
severed wing or a battered engine. For her show that opened
Saturday at the Paul Kasmin Gallery, Ms. Rubins has created an
extravagant aluminum-and-stainless-steel sculpture out of a few
thousand pounds of colorful airplane parts, as well as 600 pounds
of wire. By Elizabeth Hayt. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MATRIX-FILM-ARCH (Undated) _ Despite fortune cookie dialogue and
a dubious Nietschean subtext, ``The Matrix'' is a film that
deserves to be a classic. It will certainly become one for those
who value the power of sci-fi movies to crystallize moments of
urban sensibility. ``Metropolis,'' ``Alphaville,'' ``The Tenth
Victim'' and ``Blade Runner'' are also classics of this genre. By
Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SCULPTURE-FURNITURE (New York) _ The Public Art Fund, a
nonprofit organization that supports projects around New York, is
backing an independent curator Amy Wolf's, ``Comfort Zone:
Furniture by Artists,'' an engaging exhibition of sculpture that is
also furniture. The show remains on view at PaineWebber building
through June 25. The exhibit includes pieces designed by 36 artists
over the last 60 years. By Paula Dietz. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   TOP-40-RADIO (Los Angeles) _ ``American Top 40 With Casey
Kasem'' has been on the air, under slightly different titles but
with virtually the same format, for nearly 29 years. Currently, the
four-hour-long show, heard in most markets on Saturday or Sunday
morning, is broadcast on more than 350 stations nationwide and
heard at any one point in his show by an audience that averages
approximately 1.1 million listeners over age 12. By Andy Meisler.

 Bad Times at Good Guys
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (c) 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Take a consumer electronics chain. Give it attractive stores,
exciting new gadgets to sell like high-definition television,
well-trained staff, good prices, an Ivy League-educated CEO, a
great economy and what have you got?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Good Guys, which is headquartered in Brisbane, you've
got flat sales, three years of losses and a stock that's plunged
from a high of $29.25 in 1991 to $3.63 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything points to (the conclusion) that these guys should
be doing better than they are,'' said Douglas Gordon, an industry
analyst with NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
``The question of why they're not doing well is one everybody in
the industry is asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys chief executive Robert Gunst, who has been with the
company 13 years, the past six as CEO, is throwing in the towel.
Gunst, who is described by those who know him as smart and well
liked, announced last week that he will resign at the end of June,
although he will remain a director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided it was probably time to bring somebody in who could
look at it with fresh eyes,'' said Gunst, who has a bachelor's
degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Good Guys Chief Financial Officer Dennis Carroll also
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers attribute part of the problem to stiff
competition from bigger rivals like Best Buy and Circuit City. Some
shoppers say its salespeople are too aggressive and that it takes
too long to complete a purchase. The company also has incurred
expenses from its store remodeling program, and its
renovation-related closures have hurt sales.
</P>
<P>
   But given all of the pluses, industry watchers say, the chain
should be doing better than it is.
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys, which started in 1973 as a single store in San
Francisco, was not alone in its lackluster performance until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the consumer electronics sector was generally
anemic. Prices on staple items like video cassette recorders were
falling and there were no innovative products to pry open
consumers' wallets. Best Buy, a national chain that has just
started opening stores in the Bay Area, was believed to be on the
verge of going under.
</P>
<P>
   But all that has changed _ for some retailers more than others.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Best Buy stores open at least a year, considered the
best gauge of a retailer's strength, jumped 13.5 percent in 1998
while total sales grew 21 percent to $10 billion. No.2 Circuit
City's sales at mature stores increased a healthy 8 percent last
year while total sales rose 17 percent to $9.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, sales at Good Guys stores open at least a year rose
just 3 percent in fiscal 1998 while total sales grew 4 percent to
$928.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's better than the revenue declines the company faced in
1997. But sales at mature Good Guys stores were also flat in the
first half of fiscal 1999, which ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings have been a disappointment, too. While its competitors
were pumping out hefty profits, Good Guys was hit last year with a
$9 million loss, its third consecutive year of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   And while the national chains open dozens of stores annually,
Good Guys opened only one new store last year. It also renovated
four in its current markets of California, Nevada, Washington and
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Gunst believes Good Guys' problems are largely cyclical and that
trends are shifting in the company's direction as high-tech gadgets
like digital camcorders, HDTV and digital video disks finally
become popular among middle class consumers.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly optimistic about HDTV because HDTV owners
usually want a high-end sound experience with their set. Instead of
just buying a VCR, like in the olden days, HDTV shoppers often pick
up a DVD player, a Dolby Digital receiver and high-end speakers to
boot. TVs are Good Guys' largest category, accounting for 35
percent of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of digital merchandise are growing fast at Good Guys, but
still make up a small percent of sales. ``It's offsetting
(declining prices of staples like VCRs), but it is not offsetting
enough,'' said Gunst.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Good Guys, which specializes in audio and video,
has missed out on strong sales of goods like kitchen appliances and
computer games that its rivals carry but Good Guys does not, Gunst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Market research shows that Good Guys ranks lower than its
competitors on convenience, probably because customers must wait
for larger items to be retrieved from a stock room instead of being
able to serve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But for the new digital products, which require some education,
Good Guys is the place to shop, Gunst said. ``That's a disadvantage
we've had over the last decade that we think will be an advantage
over the next decade,'' when unfamiliar new products will be
driving business.
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys has worked hard to develop a reputation for offering
better quality merchandise and service.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers lead daily training sessions to educate sales
associates about new products and discuss strategies for keeping
shoppers happy. Staff keep copies of the Good Guys' 12 Principles
in their pockets, the first principle of which is to provide
outstanding customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses of everyone from store managers to the CEO are tied to
the results of shopper satisfaction polls.
</P>
<P>
   To further distinguish itself from its gray-walled,
linoleum-floored rivals, Good Guys is converting locations into
what it calls Audio/Video Exposition stores. The large, luxurious
Expos are decorated in light wood and feature comfortable living
room environments where consumers can try out TVs and stereos.
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys remodeled four stores last year into the new format,
which averages 28,000 square feet, compared to 15,000 to 25,000 for
older stores. This year, it plans to convert at least six stores
into Expos and open two new ones. Thirteen of its 79 stores are now
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Expo stores are about 20 percent higher than at older
locations, although sales per square foot are lower since much of
the store is used as exhibition space, Gunst said.
</P>
<P>
   Build-out costs per foot are the same as older stores, since the
fixtures are still made of Formica _ they're wood grain instead of
gray in the Expo stores _ and wooden floors cost less in the long
run than tile and carpet since they never need to be replaced,
Gunst said.
</P>
<P>
   Good Guys also operates four so-called Wow Multimedia
Superstores, which adjoin Tower Records outlets. That way shoppers
can buy CDs with their boom boxes _ and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wow store in San Francisco's Stonestown Galleria, an
appearance by pop singer Jordan Knight attracted 2,000 teenagers
one recent morning. ``As far as I'm concerned, the store does
well,'' said Ron Weller, the mall's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience issue aside, shoppers seem to like Good Guys. A
Consumer Reports survey of 6,300 consumers ranked it third among 10
audio-video purveyors, with high scores on selection and courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Costco and Sam's Club, both warehouse clubs, came in slightly
higher on the strength of their low prices. Circuit City, which is
headquartered in Richmond, Va., and operates 560 stores, was ranked
fifth and Best Buy of Eden Prairie, Minn., with 315 stores, came in
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey, published last October, found another weakness
at Good Guys: aggressive sales pitches for extended
warranties. &UR;  &LR; That impression was seconded by a Bay Area shopper who
otherwise likes Good Guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to browse there and check out the latest gear, but I
feel there is terrific pressure to buy the warranty,'' said the
shopper, who did not want his name used. ``I guess they have to
sell them'' to make up for their fair merchandise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gunst counters that, according to independent market research,
people who buy the warranties and do not use them are just as
satisfied as those who do not buy them. People who use their
warranties are the happiest of all.
</P>
<P>
   Gunst declined to say how much the contracts contribute to
profits. But in public filings, the company blamed a drop in
warranty income for thinner gross margins last year. Warranties
account for between 5 and 6 percent of company revenues, the
documents said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, Good Guys faces a new challenge by Best Buy,
which is opening its first six locations here this year. Two are
already operating, one in Santa Rosa and a Marin City store in a
new format that focuses on digital products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best Buy is a formidable competitor, there's no getting around
it,'' said Lewis Alton, managing partner of the San Francisco
investment bank L.H. Alton &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Gunst said Good Guys is holding its own against Best Buy in
Marin and other markets. ``When they open, they take some of the
commodity business from us, so we lose some sales dollars, but
frankly we don't loose a lot of profit dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Gunst noted that the Good Guys Web site will
begin selling products by the end of September. The site
( &LR; www.thegoodguys.com &LR; ) currently gets about 1 million hits a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest factor in Good Guys' immediate future will
be the anticipated surge in HDTV. Said Gunst: ``The big question is
how quickly is that going to come, and none of us know.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company is looking for a CEO with fresh ideas for
merchandising and presentation. ``People ask me, `What kind of
fresh ideas?''' said Gunst. ``I tell them if I knew I'd be
implementing them.''

 Securities Firms Probed Over IPO Fees
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (c) 1999, The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Two San Francisco securities firms, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and
BancBoston Robertson Stephens, are targets of a federal probe into
possible fixing of fees in initial public stock offerings,
according to people familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department this week sent the two investment banks
formal demands to produce information on how they set the fees for
taking companies public, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiries are part of a larger Justice investigation into
possible illegal price fixing in IPOs that reportedly is targeting
most of the nation's large securities firms, including Goldman
Sachs, Salomon Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The probe came to light yesterday when Goldman Sachs disclosed
in a regulatory filing that it had received a Justice Department
subpoena as part of an ``investigation of an alleged conspiracy
among securities underwriters to fix underwriting fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice ``is looking at the possibility of anticompetitive
practices in underwriting services for IPOs,'' said department
spokeswoman Gina Talamona, who declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and Robertson Stephens
declined to comment on the probe.
</P>
<P>
   The two firms were respectively the nation's 12th and 13th
largest IPO managers in the first quarter of 1999, according to
Securities Data Corp. Hambrecht &AMP; Quist led or co-managed 14
transactions worth $299.4 million, while Robertson Stephens did the
same in 11 IPOs worth $238 million.
</P>
<P>
   Justice's investigation won't necessarily result in federal
legal action and fines against the firms, antitrust experts noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threshold for starting an investigation has gotten fairly
low,'' said Washington, D.C., antitrust lawyer Joe Sims, who
estimated that only 25 to 30 percent of such probes result in
further enforcement measures.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation follows several private lawsuits
brought by law firms that specialize in class-action securities
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   These suits accuse 25 securities firms, including Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist and Robertson Stephens, of conspiring to keep IPO fees
artificially high, raising costs to investors and companies selling
stock to the public. The suits were recently combined into a single
class-action case in a New York federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint in the case says that securities firms charged
clients a fee of exactly 7 percent in 95 percent of midsize IPOs
from 1995 to 1997. Such a set fee could only hold if the firms
colluded to keep the price at that level, the complaint maintains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're alleging that from 1994 to the present, these
underwriters fixed the fees,'' said Alice McInerney, a New York
attorney representing plaintiffs in the case.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  McInerney said conspiracy charges are based on a statistical
analysis of fees, and that she had no evidence of communications
among investment bankers to fix prices.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  McInerney declined to comment on whether she's talked with
Justice antitrust officials about the case. But it's common in such
cases for attorneys to pass on their findings to federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' case is based partly on academic research by two
University of Florida business school professors who published a
study noting that midsize IPO fees cluster around 7 percent, a
level they said was more than twice as high as fees charged in the
past.

PATRIOTS OWNER SPURNS HARTFORD STADIUM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft walked away
from the richest stadium deal ever in professional sports Friday, a
joyous victory for Massachusetts sports fans but a devastating blow
to Hartford's revitalization dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Governor John G. Rowland, Kraft explained that
the team did not believe Connecticut could finish the proposed $374
million by 2002 as promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have not seen sufficient evidence to give us
adequate assurance that the planned Hartford stadium can be ready
for the beginning of 2002 season on the terms we contemplated in
our agreement,'' Kraft said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut had struggled to determine how much money and how
much time it would take to prepare the heavily polluted site for
construction. Under his deal with Connecticut, Kraft was free to
back out without penalty by Sunday if he concluded the stadium
could not be completed on time or within budget.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's consultants told him Thursday that it would likely be
2003 at the earliest before the Patriots could play in the new
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who less than 24 hours earlier stood alongside Kraft
and expressed confidence the Hartford deal would go through,
denounced the Patriots' pullout and threatened to sue the Kraft
family and the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one walks away from a $374 million plan because a schedule
not might hit the exact date he would like to see it happen,'' he
said. ``We'll find out soon enough what the real reason was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let the fear of litigation prevent us from doing our
job,'' said Joseph Brown, an NFL vice president. `'In this case, we
went to Massachusetts to see if a viable alternative existed and to
help make one a reality. It was Mr. Kraft's decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The league said it expected to take up the alternative stadium
offer cobbled together earlier this week by Massachusetts when team
owners meet in Atlanta in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's brief statement, which repeatedly praised Connecticut's
efforts over the past year, did not mention the Bay State's rival
bid. But most in Massachusetts thought the message was clear: the
Patriots would stay in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England Patriots will be playing football in
Massachusetts, where they belong,'' said Governor Paul Cellucci
from California, where he was promoting Massachusetts to the film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like winning a game in overtime,'' declared Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham. ``It's a win for Patriots fans, the
state, and taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who many argued drove the
Patriots into Connecticut's arms by blocking a bid last year to use
state funds to help the team build a new facility in Foxborough,
praised Kraft's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Kraft deserves an awful lot of credit for the
decision he made,'' Finneran said. ``Mr. Kraft is the first to
break a very discouraging _ and what I have said is an
inappropriate _ trend, and that deserves commendation.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Bay State leaders said there would be no problem
passing a bill to keep the team in Massachusetts before NFL owners
meet May 25. Birmingham said he expected the Senate to pass the
measure next week.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the agreement Birmingham, Cellucci, and Finneran
negotiated late Tuesday night, the state would provide $70 million
in funds for roads, sewers and other public improvements around a
new Foxboro Stadium. In return, Kraft would build a privately
financed $250 million stadium, with assistance from the NFL. The
Massachusetts plan would also require him to pay up to $1 million a
year to the state to offset the infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Connecticut offered not only a taxpayer-funded
stadium, but also a host of benefits, including a promise that the
state would pick up the tab for any unsold luxury or club seats
over the next 30 years. Sports financing experts have said the
guarantees alone would have been worth more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply unprecedented,'' said Marc Ganis, head of
Sportscorp, a Chicago consulting firm specializing in stadium
development firm. ``That's bankable money the team could count on
for the next 30 years. The idea of walking away from that without
having a another deal firmly in hand is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Local business and political leaders said they were confident
Kraft wanted to keep the team in Massachusetts, but many were
stunned that he chose to terminate his deal in Connecticut before
lawmakers formally adopted a counterproposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a sign that he is committed to his home state in
a way few of us could imagine,'' said former Democratic National
Committee chairman Paul Kirk to whom the NFL turned to orchestrate
a last-minute campaign to keep the team in Foxborough. ``He's put a
lot of trust in the state's political leaders and the business
community living up to their verbal commitments. And I expect all
the parties will.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL tapped Kirk because it wanted to stop the Patriots from
abandoning the nation's sixth-largest media market for Hartford,
ranked 27th. National broadcast revenues, which are split among all
owners, are the lifeblood of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL said it would not comment on Rowland's threat of a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft launched his search for a new stadium because Foxboro
ranks last in the league in the number of premium seats, an
important revenue for team owners. Foxboro Stadium has 39 luxury
suites and no club seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said a new stadium on land Kraft already owns in
Foxborough is likely to sport 100 to 125 luxury suites and 6,000 to
8,000 club seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community's commitment to long-term sales of
luxury boxes is key,'' the source said. ``The Patriots cannot
afford to pay for their own stadium and keep a competitive team on
the field without luxury box sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said that if Kraft accepts the Massachusetts deal, a new
Foxboro Stadium could be built by 2002, perhaps even 2001, because
the site does not suffer from the pollution woes of the property
offered by Rowland along the Connecticut River. Hartford's proposal
was also hampered by delays in arranging the relocation of a steam
plant and its corporate headquarters from the site.
</P>
<P>
   The aborted stadium was slated to be the centerpiece of
Adriaen's Landing, a billion-dollar redevelopment project that
Rowland and Hartford civic leaders hoped would revitalize the
ailing city. Those project, unveiled in May 1998, included a domed
stadium with at least 35,000 seats for UConn, but were greatly
modified when the Patriots agreed to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the project would continue. ``The original
Adriaen's Landing project was very sufficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft had agreed to invest $75 million in the project, building
a hotel, NFL entertainment complex, and fitness center. But a
carefully crafted contract, negotiated with the aid of his son
Jonathan, gave him the right to pull out by Sunday if he was
uncertain the stadium would be ready by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it slipped to 2003, who could tell if would slip to 2004,''
said one person familiar with contract. ``There was too much
risk.''

DERBY FEATURES BIG, TALENTED FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ If the Kentucky Derby horses are hard to
separate on paper, just wait until they break from the starting
gate this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The evenly matched race probably will be won by the horse and
jockey who survive the stirrup-to-stirrup scramble for running
position as the field of 19 rushes to the first turn _ and find
daylight in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a large field, you need a lot of luck,'' said trainer Bob
Baffert, who has the most at stake, sending three horses in quest
of his third straight Derby victory, which would be a record for
the 125-year-old event.
</P>
<P>
   When Baffert decided to put the filly Excellent Meeting in the
race along with stablemates General Challenge and Prime Timber, he
filled out a field matching the largest in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, perhaps the deepest.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most popular brand of speed ratings, the Beyer
figures printed in the Daily Racing Form, nine Derby horses are
separated by only three lengths based on their latest races.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively injury-free prep season sent a raft of major-race
winners into the Derby. The arrival of two fillies, two Dubai-based
colts, several lightly raced horses and a horse whose only victory
is under investigation left handicappers with a confusion of X
factors.
</P>
<P>
   One Dubai colt, the overmatched Aljabr, was scratched Friday,
two days after the maximum 20 horses were entered.
</P>
<P>
   Pruning the list of contenders by eliminating those with
unproven trainers is of little use. The race features four trainers
with previous Derby victories _ Baffert, D. Wayne Lukas, Nick Zito
and Carl Nafzger _ only the second time that's happened in 75
years.
</P>
<P>
   Those four trainers control eight horses _ Baffert's three, plus
Lukas' Cat Thief and Charismatic, Zito's Stephen Got Even and
Adonis, and Nafzger's Vicar.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert won in 1996 with Silver Charm and jockey Gary Stevens,
who had to rally on the outside in a 13-horse field, and in '97
with Real Quiet and Kent Desormeaux, who was bumped early in the
race but swept to the front on the far turn.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the filly Winning Colors and Stevens in '88 have the
Derby champions led from gate to wire.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll lead today is anybody's guess. Vicar (marooned in post
position 17) and fillies Excellent Meeting (comfortable in post 5)
and Three Ring (stuck inside in post 2) have scored front-running
victories as 3-year-olds _ but none is one-dimensional. Five other
horses raced within two lengths of the lead early in their biggest
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see five or six horses close to the lead,'' said Gary
Stevens, who'll seek his fourth Kentucky Derby victory aboard
General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, the Santa Anita Derby winner, starts from
post 14. Prime Timber goes from post 13, and his jockey David
Flores, aiming for a career-making victory, must angle toward the
rail to take up striking position in mid-pack.
</P>
<P>
   The first run through the homestretch could be as exciting as
the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every jockey in that race, in the first 22 seconds, is going
to have to make about 15 to 20 decisions,'' Nafzger said of the
first quarter-mile. ``And they'd better get it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the crucial place is going to be the clubhouse turn.
That's where you win a lot of races. If any horse gets behind a
wall of horses, he's history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's (19) horses,'' Lukas said, ``and some (jockeys) will
get in situations they're really not prepared for. Some of them
will handle it and some of them won't. It could be a war out
there.''

AS DEADLINE NEARS, PATRIOTS REJECT HARTFORD MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Five months after the New England Patriots
announced a startling plan to move to Connecticut, the football
team said Friday it was walking away from the most lucrative
stadium deal in professional sports now that Massachusetts is
willing to pay to keep the team.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots executives attributed their decision to problems with
the site in downtown Hartford, which is now occupied by a steam
plant and is contaminated with coal tar and other toxins. But the
withdrawal came just three days after Massachusetts legislators,
after years of bitter and unproductive negotiations with the team's
owner, Robert Kraft, promised a subsidy of $70 million to help him
build a new stadium next to his current one at Foxboro, south of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's decision turned what had seemed a stunning coup into an
embarrassing and expensive fiasco for Connecticut officials, most
critically Gov. John Rowland, who had brokered the deal that would
have saddled taxpayers with the entire cost of the $375 million
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots canceled the contract with a curt notice to the
state at 4:30 p.m. Friday, just two days before a deadline that
allowed the team to back out without any penalty. Lawyers for the
Patriots had determined that if the team waited any longer, it
could be liable to the state for damages of as much as $100
million, according to a National Football League executive.
</P>
<P>
   Much about the team's future remains uncertain. An executive
close to the Patriots expressed disgust with the current
Massachusetts offer, which would require the team to finance the
entire cost of the stadium, while the state paid for new parking
lots, roads and other improvements. But clearly the team would like
to work something out. ``It's not an option _ it's our home,'' the
executive said. Patriots officials also said Kraft would consider
selling the team, having grown weary of the frustrating stadium
talks he has held with three states _ including a flirtation with
Rhode Island _ ever since becoming the team's fourth owner in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland at first had promised that the stadium site in the
Connecticut capital would be ready for play in 2001, but that
target had slipped to 2002. Then, consultants to Kraft told him
this week that there was a 50-50 chance the stadium would be
delayed at least another year. Team officials said that report
prompted their decision to cancel the contract.
</P>
<P>
   An official who works closely with Kraft said the team had
misgivings about the Hartford site as long ago as February, which
is the reason the exit clauses like the one exercised Friday were
built into the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Rowland, Kraft said: ``The scope of this project
was a mountainous undertaking and much more complex than anyone
anticipated when our discussions originally began. We know that you
have exhausted every effort to meet the deadlines that have been
within your control, but it has become clear to us that the goal of
playing in a new stadium in Hartford by the year 2002 has a
significant degree of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland angrily challenged the Patriots' explanation, saying he
believed the state had been used as a pawn by Kraft to extract a
deal from Massachusetts. ``No one walks away from a year's planning
and a $374 million package because of concerns of the schedule
being a little bit longer than usual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford officials had envisioned the stadium as the centerpiece
of a revitalization project that was to include a hotel and
convention center, lifting a city that has suffered through years
of economic decline as manufacturers left and insurance companies
consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often said it's not just about football,'' Rowland said at a
somber news conference Friday night. ``It's about having pride,
it's about creating community spirit. We tasted that, and I think
that that taste is still with us. We're going to find and create
other opportunities and chances for Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   The team, which has played in the Boston area since its birth in
1959 as the American Football League's eighth franchise, now will
be eagerly courted by Massachusetts officials. Gov. Paul Cellucci
of Massachusetts said Friday night, ``The New England Patriots will
be playing in Massachusetts, where they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who is
a leading opponent of subsidized stadiums, said: ``You have to be
careful not to invest too much of your political and financial
resources in one of these deals. Rowland took none of the necessary
precautions to protect his state and his city.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland showed his bitterness at his news conference, held in
the same ornate room at the Capitol where legislators had donned
Patriots hard hats for the jubilant announcement Nov. 19 that the
team had agreed to move to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always that feeling that Kraft was always looking
for a way out,'' he said. ``Everything always had a very cautious
tone. He was not doing somersaults and saying he can't wait to come
to Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor promised lawsuits against the team and the NFL,
which served as a midwife to the Massachusetts proposal.
</P>

<P>
   Although it initially had voiced little concern about the
Connecticut deal, the league had grown worried in recent months
that by moving from the 6th-largest television market to the 27th,
the Patriots would jeopardize the league's standing to negotiate
with television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland estimated the state had spent ``a few million dollars''
on evaluating the site. ``You can expect legal action, not only
with regard to the Kraft family but presumably with the NFL as
well,'' he said. ``I don't think we'll have any problem recovering
any of these damages.''
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said he would be
``moving aggressively and quickly to take any available action to
assert the state's legal claims and rights.'' Blumenthal asserted
that the NFL has been ``throwing its weight around in a way that
restrains competition and injures consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut politicians poured scorn on Kraft. The speaker of
the House of Representatives, Moira Lyons, a Democrat from
Stamford, condemned what she called ``the lack of good-faith
principles shown by the Kraft family.'' U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd,
a Democrat, said the state ``gave its word and worked in good
faith, but that effort wasn't returned in kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, though, can expect to be showered with blame in coming
days, since he cut the deal in secret, then said that he would
stake his legacy on its success. Edward Marcus, chairman of the
Connecticut Democratic Party, said stadium preparations had cost
the state millions of dollars but added, ``What may be even more
important is the loss to our reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the darkest day of his political life, Rowland joked that he
is now an official New York Jets fan, and indicated that he never
gives up. When asked whether he plans to try to lure another team,
he said, ``I can assure you that I am not _ at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts legislators have promised to enact their offer
before May 25, when NFL owners are scheduled to discuss the
Patriots' stadium plans. Three-quarters of the owners must approve
any relocation by a franchise. Supporters of the Massachusetts plan
have said that if Kraft did not accept their proposal, they would
make their case directly to the other owners.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kirk Jr., a Boston lawyer and former Democratic National
Chairman who is leading the Massachusetts bid, had spent the week
begging businesses to sign up for luxury suites to help make the
deal more attractive to Kraft. On Friday night, Kirk was so
confident of the state's prospects that he said skyboxes now would
be ``first come, first served.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the Foxboro plan is not as handsome monetarily, the
Krafts never lost the emotional bond with Massachusetts,'' Kirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft hinted at his future plans and galled Connecticut
officials by using his termination letter to thank them for working
``so hard in this effort to help the Patriots remain a competitive
franchise in New England.''

HOFFA THE YOUNGER HOPES TO PUT TEAMSTERS' HOUSE IN ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In one of his first acts as Teamsters president,
James Phillip Hoffa hung a beloved oil painting of his father, a
colossus posing above a convoy of trucks while looking up toward
Mount Rushmore as if he belonged there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a very great man _ I don't compare myself to
him,'' said Hoffa, who assumed the presidency of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters 42 years after his father had.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, little more than a month after taking office, the
younger Hoffa still has a touch of
``I-can't-believe-this-happened'' amazement in his manner as he
sits in the office his father once used.
</P>
<P>
   But one hurdle is that many of the teamsters who worshiped his
father, despite his conviction on charges of fraud and jury
tampering, look to the 57-year-old son as the Second Coming and
expect him to perform some of the same wonders.
</P>
<P>
   In running the union from 1957 to 1971, James Riddle Hoffa _
through a blend of charisma, street smarts and strong-arm tactics _
tripled many truckers' salaries and nearly tripled the Teamsters'
membership, making it the nation's largest, strongest _ and
prosecutors said, most corrupt _ union in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Along with these high hopes, the younger Hoffa has had to
contend with opposite expectations. Many supporters of his nemesis,
the union's former president, Ron Carey, view Hoffa as the devil
incarnate, insisting that he is in bed with crooks and corporate
management and will never give the rank-and-file a fair shake.
</P>
<P>
   In his first few weeks on the job, Hoffa is proving neither
savior nor Satan. Instead, he appears to be simply going about his
job, struggling to unify and rebuild a deeply divided union that
has drifted rudderless for two years, ever since Carey was
sidelined by a campaign finance scandal that led to his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's had time to do much so far,'' said Howie
Redman, president of Carey's old local in Queens, N.Y., which
represents 9,000 United Parcel Service workers. ``But he seems very
sincere in wanting to reach across and make sure the teamsters work
together and move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's most urgent task is to restore unity to a union where
the Hoffa and Carey factions have resembled the Hatfields and
McCoys. Hoffa has been reaching out to the Carey wing _ even some
Carey supporters acknowledge this _ although he cannot resist digs
at Carey, whose 1996 victory over Hoffa was overturned because of
Carey campaign finance violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing what my predecessor did, raining retribution on
anyone who went the other way,'' said Hoffa, who used to be a labor
lawyer in Detroit. ``The union cannot be successful if it's
divided. We're pulling this thing together, saying, `I'm going to
work with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   But bitter divisions remain, including a power struggle at the
top of the 1.4-million-member union. Tom Pazzi, Hoffa's campaign
manager, who was widely expected to become the union's chief of
staff, appears to have lost out to Carlow Scalf, a Michigan
Teamster official.
</P>
<P>
   A federal election monitor asked an oversight board to
investigate Scalf after the monitor found evidence that he had
illegally helped funnel $30,000 in union money that had been given
out as raises to union officials back into the campaign coffers of
a local union official. Teamsters officials say Scalf did nothing
wrong, noting that the oversight board has not brought charges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a pro-Carey union caucus, Teamsters for a
Democratic Union, maintains that Hoffa's lieutenants are
threatening to retaliate against Carey supporters who refuse to
support a Hoffa-backed candidate for union vice president in the
South. Hoffa's camp calls those charges political and intended to
weaken him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa is in many ways different from his father. He grew up in
suburban affluence, while his father left school to work at age 14
and organized his first strike at age 17. The younger Hoffa, a
graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, favors navy
blazers and double-breasted suits and speaks smoothly and quickly,
without the snarl or sarcastic anger of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his office seems frozen in his father's 1950s _
there is dark paneling, blue wall-to-wall carpeting and a bulky
wooden desk with the same blotter his father used.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the loyal son, he steadfastly insists that his father did
not have ties to the mobsters who plundered the union. Saying it
was a time to look forward and not back, he would not discuss what
law enforcement officials had told him about how his father
disappeared in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hoffa works 12-hour days doing the unglamorous blocking
and tackling that union leaders must do if they are intent on
protecting their members' living standards and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He has organized rallies and assigned bargaining experts to
strengthen the hand of 11,000 Northwest Air flight attendants who
have not received a raise since 1993. With a contract expiring May
31 for 12,000 truckers who haul new cars to dealers, he is
overseeing negotiations, speaking at rallies and firing up members,
all to pressure management into agreeing to a good contract.
</P>
<P>
   For Hoffa, the car-haul bargaining is a test of his mettle.
Taking a page from his father, who was famed for knowing when and
where to squeeze employers, he is threatening a strike that can
cripple car shipments and sales at a time when Detroit is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has defiantly asserted that ``we're not going to do
anything like Carey.'' But letting wisdom trump pride, he has
followed one of Carey's most successful strategies: mobilizing
thousands of members to maximize pressure on management in contract
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Paff, national coordinator of the pro-Carey Teamsters for a
Democratic Union, said: ``The idea that he can go in and pound the
table and tell them who his dad was and the CEO is going to cry
uncle, that happens only in the movies. You have to have a bunch of
angry members and a strong organization on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, Hoffa is charting a different course
from Carey. In the 1970s and 1980s the Teamsters favored
Republicans, but Carey moved the union into the Democratic column,
making the Teamsters among the biggest contributors to Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who describes himself as a ``progressive,'' accused Carey
of letting the Democrats take the Teamsters for granted. ``The one
thing we're not going to be is an ATM for the Democratic Party or
the Republican Party,'' he said. ``That's what happened to Ron
Carey _ he became an ATM machine for the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Reps. Peter King and Jack Quinn of New York as
Republicans whom labor can work with, Hoffa said: ``We're going to
talk to Republicans. We're going to talk to Democrats. We're going
to be very bipartisan in our endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa wants the union to remain a big-money player in politics,
saying he hoped to make the Teamsters' political action committee
the nation's largest PAC _ it was the second largest in 1997 and
1998, spending a total of $8 million to the $14 million spent by
Emily's List.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build it into a powerful force that will speak out
for Teamster members and for all working people,'' Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to tip his hand on a presidential candidate,
although he seemed in less of a rush than other union leaders to
endorse Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A big issue the Teamsters will use to gauge candidates is
whether they pledge to restrict Mexican trucks from hauling goods
north of the border. He said opening the border to Mexican
truckers, as the North American Free Trade Agreement calls for,
would cost thousands of Teamster jobs and would fill U.S. roads
with pollution-spewing trucks with poorly trained drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to use the word litmus test, but cross-border
trucking is one of the most important issues facing the
Teamsters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, unlike Carey, plans to press the federal government to
end its supervision of the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, when the Teamsters agreed to government oversight to
settle a racketeering lawsuit, the union has spent more than $80
million to pay for an elaborate network of federal monitors. These
monitors have expelled scores of teamsters after finding they had
ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have indicated they are in no rush to end the
supervision because they are still finding wrongdoing, although on
a much smaller scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a meaningful, far-reaching dialogue with the
government about its future role in Teamster affairs,'' Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that most corrupt elements have already been weeded
out. ``I think it's as free of corruption as any great
institution,'' he said. ``Over 300 people have been thrown out of
this union over the past decade. This union is as clean as any
other international union and can take its rightful place in a
leadership role with anyone in organized labor.''

 &HT;    Bradley builds support in S.C.
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Vice President Al Gore may have certain
advantages as a native Southerner and the well-funded heir to Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But as resurgent South Carolina Democrats warmly welcomed Bill
Bradley to their annual party dinner Friday, they displayed a
conspicuous lack of enthusiasm for Gore's candidacy in dozens of
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has got the baggage that comes with the
Clinton administration. I believe that Senator Bradley is more
electable than Al Gore,'' said Al Holland, the Democratic chairman
in Lee County.
</P>
<P>
   And with Bradley buttons far more in evidence than those for
Gore, Dick Harpootlian, the state party chairman, said, ``No one
ought to take South Carolina for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is not without support in the Palmetto State.
A new poll for the state party showed that Gore still leads Bradley
by a wide margin among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Georgia, where the Democratic apparatus is
unofficially but firmly behind Gore, South Carolina appears more
receptive to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problems are compounded by what many party leaders
believe was a slight toward Gov. Jim Hodges, who upset an incumbent
Republican last year with little help from the vice president and
the national Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Democrats also want to give the state a greater say in
the presidential nominating process. They plan to hold the state's
primary on Feb. 26, 2000, even though the date violates national
party rules that prohibits states other than Iowa and New Hampshire
from selecting convention delegates before March.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley won frequent applause at the state's annual
Jefferson-Jackson fund-raising dinner by talking about the need to
rebuild trust in government and exhorting the crowd to ``dream
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, Bradley said, ``cannot afford to be small thinkers.
We have to think of the big answers.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered few specifics, and told reporters at a news
conference that he would not lay out a detailed agenda until the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   One topic on which the basketball Hall of Famer has been more
expansive is race, which he has pledged to make a focal point of
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Bradley said that flying the
Confederate battle flag over the South Carolina Capitol offends
many people. ``I would not fly it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of major issues at this point means Democrats are
evaluating Bradley's personality as much as his politics. Franklin
Ashley, a College of Charleston professor, said he was struck by
how funny Bradley was at a private meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Curry, a union leader in the Greenville area, said he
thinks Bradley's past basketball glory will attract political
support. Responding to the suggestion that Bradley lacks charisma,
Curry said, ``Yeah, but he was a great basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in fact, entertained his audience Friday with stories
of his days as an Olympian and member of the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Gore at Friday's event acknowledged that the vice
president has been slow to shore up his support in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he needs to get out there and define himself,'' said
Mary M. Greene, a lobbyist for the South Carolina Education
Association who sported a Gore button.
</P>
<P>
   Greene predicted that Gore's support would become more visible
``once he comes here and campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpootlian acknowledged that a poll taken for the state party
shows Gore with a wide lead over Bradley among Democratic voters.
But he said he detected ``a certain enthusiasm'' for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley is unwilling to write off the South, at least not at
this early date. He will visit four more Southern states before the
end of May, said deputy press secretary Tony Wyche.
</P>
<P>
   And he appears to be targeting African-Americans, a crucial
constituency in Democratic primaries in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will meet with Alabama ministers on a tour of Birmingham
and Montgomery next week. ``Most of the clergy are
African-American,'' Wyche said.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee will face a tough time in
South Carolina in the general election. No Democratic presidential
candidate has carried the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976.

USC-UCLA TRACK MEET COULD BE A CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA-USC track meet is back.
</P>
<P>
   The 66th meeting today figures to be a return to the classic
battles of the past rather than the lopsided affairs of the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The USC men lead the series, 38-27, but are seeking to end a
20-year losing streak to UCLA. Last year UCLA defeated USC 84-74 in
the closest match since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important to both sides is the adherence to
traditional dual meet scoring on 5-3-1 for first through third
place in lieu of the new NCAA international scoring that calls for
5-3-2-1, with only two athletes from each school scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reward people for just showing up,'' USC coach Ron Allice
said. ``Performance is not important, only the fact that you have
another body in the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Allice and UCLA coach Bob Larsen, among the Pacific-10
Conference's leading proponents of traditional scoring, agreed to
score today's meet under the old system.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had its 51-meet home-winning streak snapped in a 101-99
defeat to Florida earlier this season under international scoring,
which scores the relays 5-3 instead of 5-0. Florida needed only to
jog the meet's final event, the 1,600 relay, to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In quadrangular meets, international scoring makes sense, but
in dual meets it's better to have to beat somebody,'' Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in recent years the UCLA men, 17th in the
Trackwire national rankings, are not heavy favorites against No. 2
USC. There has been speculation that Larsen might retire at the end
of the year after 15 seasons at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to analyze that after the high hurdles on
Saturday,'' Larsen joked.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' prospects hinge on senior sprinters Jerome Davis
and Charles Lee and key members of the Trojans' Pac-10-leading 400-
and 1,600-meter relays.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the defending NCAA 400 champion, also will run in the
200- and 400- meters. In the 1,600 relay at the Texas Relays
earlier this month, Davis led the Trojans to a 1999 collegiate best
3:02.89.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a former Cleveland High and Valley College standout, also
will run in the 100 and 200 today. Lee finished fourth in the 1998
NCAA championships in the 200 and is the Pac-10 Conference leader
at 20.53 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has responded well when they are the favorites,''
Larsen said. ``Whether they spark even more as the underdog is hard
to say. We're going to have to win a lot of the close events to
stay in the meet. In some events, we won't even make them sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 UCLA women are seeking their 61st consecutive dual
meet victory since last losing to No.4 USC in 1992. The 100 will
highlight the women's competition, pitting UCLA sophomore Shakedia
Jones, the 1998 World Junior and Pac-10 champion, against USC's
Torri Edwards, the 1996 Pac-10 champion; Esi Benyarku, the 1997
conference champion, and freshman Angela Williams, the national
high school record-holder.

 &HT;    Texas abortion foes gain ground, poll says
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans are evenly split on whether abortions
should be legal, but four-fifths of them believe that doctors
should have to contact the parents of a minor seeking one,
according to a recent Texas Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The answers to the broader question represent an increase in the
number of Texans who say they oppose abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five percent of the 1,003 Texans surveyed by telephone
between March 30 and April 17 described themselves as
``anti-abortion,'' 45 percent said they were ``pro-choice'' and the
remaining 10 percent were undecided. Three years ago, 52 percent of
respondents said they were pro-choice and 37 percent said they were
anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results show that many who identify themselves as
pro-choice support a parental notification law: 80 percent of the
survey respondents said they either ``strongly favor'' or ``favor''
such a measure. Only 11 percent said they were opposed. The margin
of error for the poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Senate passed a parental notification measure in
March, and several bills are pending in the House State Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas want parents to be connected with their
little girls in these important decisions,'' said Chuck Anderson,
director of the Texas Christian Coalition. ``We need to connect the
laws with the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey didn't ask what the exceptions to the parental
notification law should be, which is the issue dominating debate in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have ruled that parental notification laws are legal only
if they include a ``judicial bypass.'' Under that exception, a girl
who doesn't want her parents to know about her abortion can seek a
court order certifying that she is mature enough to make the
decision herself, or that she has reason to fear that telling her
parents would put her in danger. The judicial bypass is designed in
large part to protect girls who have been sexually abused at home.
</P>
<P>
   At least 87 House members back a bill filed by Rep. Dianne White
Delisi (R-Temple) that would require parental notification with a
judicial bypass. The Senate's parental notification measure,
authored by Sen. Florence Shapiro (R-Plano) is virtually identical.
</P>
<P>
   But other House bills go beyond the judicial bypass. Legislation
filed by Rep. Patricia Gray (D-Galveston) would allow a girl to
notify another relative instead of a parent. It also would allow a
licensed mental health professional or a state social worker to
determine that a girl can make the decision without notifying her
parents or that telling them would put her in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Delisi bill describe it as a ``parental
rights'' measure, and argue that anything beyond a judicial bypass
impinges on those rights. But Gray and notification opponents fear
girls will resort to illegal abortions if faced with the prospect
of having to tell their parents or a judge.

ON THE WEB, WARNINGS FROM STUDENT WHO BECAME SLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BARRON    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The printout of material from Eric Harris' Web site released
Friday was a hodgepodge of rantings about Denver (``I would love to
kill almost all of its residents'') and things he loved and hated
(school was in the first category, schoolwork in the second).
</P>
<P>
   The printout was made public by the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department, which said it had received it 13 months ago from Randy
Brooks Brown, the father of a classmate of Harris at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., a suburb of Denver. Brown had
complained that Harris had made death threats to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Since Harris and his friend Dylan Klebold killed 13 people and
themselves at Columbine High School last week, Brown has criticized
the sheriff's department for not doing enough about his complaints.
He has also distributed much of the material the department
released Friday. It is laced with expletives.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the words of wisdom from Reb,'' Harris declared at
one point, using a name he used on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of you who happen to know me and know that I respect
you, may peace be with you and don't be in my line of fire,'' he
wrote. Others, he warned, should ``hide in your houses because I'm
comin for EVERYONE soon, and i WILL be armed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I WILL shoot to kill,'' Harris added, saying he would ``KILL
EVERYTHING.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I am not crazy,'' he said. ``Crazy is just a word, to me
it has no meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more intriguing passages, Harris, whom officials
said targeted blacks in his attack at the school, repeatedly asked
readers of the site, ``You know what I hate?'' One of the answers
he gave was, ``RACISM!''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that people who are biased against ``blacks, Asians,
Mexicans or people from any other country or race besides
white-American'' should ``have their arms ripped off'' and be
burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let me catch you making fun of someone just because they
are a different color,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The printout also indicated that Harris had given names to pipe
bombs he had made. He described the detonation of one bomb that he
called Pazzie as ``a complete success.'' He said that it had been
set off in a creek bed and that the explosion had been
``heart-pounding, gut-wrenching, brain-twichin, (sic)
ground-moving, insanely cool.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, in a section headed ``philosophy,'' Harris
wrote: ``My belief is that if I say something, it goes. I am the
law. If you don't like it, you die. If I don't like you or I don't
like what you want me to do, you die.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Dead people can't do many things, like argue.''
</P>
<P>
   In another section of the transcript, Harris repeatedly asked,
``You know what I hate?'' His answers ranged from fans of ``Star
Wars'' to people who pronounce words ``like ofTen, or acrosT, or
eXpreso,'' and added, ``Learn to speak correctly, you morons.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that he hated country music, freedom of the press
and opponents of the death penalty. He said the courts should ``fry
conficts (sic) even if all they did was unarmed robbery!''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript was a mishmash of sometimes conflicting
observations. Harris said that he loved Zippo lighters, for
example, but hated ``young smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they are so goddamn cool with their big bad
ciggarettes and their `sooo cool' attitude,'' he wrote. ``I can't
wait until they are about 25,'' he said, and have to ``talk with a
computer hooked up to their X-vocal cords.''
</P>
<P>
   He also complained about ``liars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh gawwwwwd I hate liars,'' Harris wrote, saying his
neighborhood had ``thousands of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why must people lie so damn much! Especially about stupid
things! Like, `Yeah, I just bought 5 cases of M-80's in Oklahoma
for about $5. And they are legal there and everything. Yeah, my
parents buy most of my guns, every once in a while I'll use my
4,000 dollar paycheck and buy a shotgun or 2.'''
</P>
<P>
   But in speaking about his own explosives, he wrote, ``Now our
only problem is to find the place that will be `ground zero.'''

NATO SAYS NEW BOMBING IS THE STRONGEST EFFORT YET 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO Friday night unleashed what officials
described as the most aggressive bombing in the five-week air war,
hitting Serbian tanks and armored vehicles in Kosovo and bridges in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third day in a row of fierce attacks, taking
advantage of clear weather that forecasters expect to continue
through the weekend, according to the Pentagon. The Pentagon said
650 missions were scheduled for Friday, the most to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the best weather we've had since the operation
started,'' Maj. Gen. Charles Wald of the Air Force told a briefing
at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the State Department announced it would fly
the first of 20,000 Kosovo refugees to the United States next week.
</P>
<P>
   With the flow of refugees rapidly overwhelming resources in
Albania and Macedonia, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
announced that the Clinton administration was changing the rules to
transfer refugees to the United States. The new rules would allow
the first 400 Kosovar Albanians to go directly to Fort Dix, N.J., a
former Army training base, for processing and immediate reunion
with families around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three days, 19,500 refugees have arrived in
Macedonia. The assistant secretary of State for refugee affairs,
Julia Taft, said the administration and private groups had received
offers from 45,000 people to provide housing and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian-American families had already identified 1,800 refugees
who are their relatives and welcome in their homes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the second day of the increased air effort,
NATO hit targets that included the Defense Ministry and Yugoslav
Army headquarters in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we took the battle back to the heart of Belgrade,''
a spokesman for the allied military command, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe
Marani, told a briefing in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   But Marani acknowledged that one bomb had malfunctioned and
missed its target in predawn strikes. Several civilian houses were
destroyed in the Vracar district, a mile from downtown, and
Yugoslav state media said at least four people had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry headquarters was hit for the first time, a
spokesman for the allies said, and an ammunition-storage area and a
television broadcasting antenna south of the city were also hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that allied plans had also pounded the
Pristina airfield on Thursday night with 5,000-pound ``bunker
buster'' bombs, the debut of that weapon in the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said allied planes were more successful striking
surface-to-air missile and radar sites on Thursday night,
reflecting better information and familiarity with the battlefield.
``We're getting better and better intelligence,'' he said, ``and
it's accumulating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republican leaders moved to block a vote on a
bipartisan measure championed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that
would instruct President Clinton to use ``all necessary force and
other means'' against Serbia. The foreign relations committee sent
the measure to the floor without a recommendation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, and the minority
leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, will move to put off the
legislation on Monday, Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and other Senate Republican leaders had considered a
alternative, a bill to require the president to seek congressional
approval before deploying ground troops. But the ill will generated
by a debate on the war in the House this week dampened the Senate's
enthusiasm for open argument, several senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to postpone without prejudice any further debate on
involvement in the Balkans,'' Daschle said. ``We'll save that
debate for another day.''
</P>
<P>
   That day may arrive when the Senate takes up a measure to pay
for the war during the week of May 10, several senators said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., filed a suit Friday with a
bipartisan group of 16 other lawmakers that contended that just
Congress had the power to declare war and that the Clinton
administration was violating the Constitution by participating in
the Kosovo conflict without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, Gen. Hugh H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, arrived Friday and visited 3,800 American troops, telling
them that the NATO air campaign was beginning to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is conducting air operations over Yugoslavia both day and
night, virtually around the clock,'' Shelton said. ``Our military
strikes have taken a heavy toll on Milosevic's forces and his
security infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright appeared with the chief prosecutor of the
International Tribunal for War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia,
Louise Arbour. Judge Arbour said she was promoting a more
aggressive plan for arresting those indicted for war crimes in
Bosnia as a deterrent to Serb troops' committing atrocities in
neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has yet to agree to help make those
arrests, Judge Arbour said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is absolutely critical to see a very robust action on
the outstanding warrants. I think that could have a very immediate
impact, would be the demonstration that we have the capacity to
investigate. And we have partners who have the political will and
the operational skills to execute arrest warrants, even in hostile
environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Arbour declined to comment on a report that she was
planning to leave her post as chief prosecutor. Officials say she
is the prime candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada, a
position that will be vacant in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates and Clinton administration officials have
expressed concern that her departure would weaken the prosecutions
of war crimes at a critical juncture.

 &HT;    Baffert continues to baffle in humble, successful way
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Around Churchill Downs this week, he's had an
almost cult-like following.
</P>
<P>
   Early each morning the crowd would start gathering for him
outside the long, white Barn 33, where two large signs announce
this is where the last two Kentucky Derby winners _ Silver Charm in
1997, Real Quiet in 1998 _ were stabled.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long for the crowd to swell to 70 or 80 people.
Sportswriters and TV crews wait for his usual mix of wisecrack and
wisdom. Fans want his autograph. A pair of exercise riders wait for
his training strategy, a trio of millionaire owners linger to hear
his assurances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he is,'' gasped an elderly woman who was part of a race
track tour group Friday morning. She had spotted the trademark
shock of white hair and those John Lennon tinted glasses as soon as
the black BMW pulled up near the barn and the door opened.
</P>
<P>
   He has become the most recognizable guy in his sport. He's part
Beach Boys, part Seinfeld, and a little Amazing Kreskin to boot. He
shows extraordinary racetrack insight and precision, yet at the
same time he's hip and comfortable and funny. It's a mix that makes
people embrace him all the more.
</P>
<P>
   Today _ with the 125th running of the Kentucky Derby _ Bob
Baffert is aiming at an unprecedented third consecutive victory in
America's premier horse race. Over the years, five trainers have
won back-to-back Derbys, but none of them had the kind of
three-peat chance that Baffert has today.
</P>
<P>
   He has three entries in today's 19-horse field, including the
3-1 Morning Line favorites in the chestnut gelding General
Challenge and the filly Excellent Meeting. His other colt, San
Felipe winner Prime Timber, was 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Add in his Silverbulletday, who won Friday's Kentucky Oaks filly
race by two lengths _ and likely would have been the Derby favorite
were she put in against the boys today _ and you see just what a
force Baffert has become.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's just a nose away from already having three
straight Derby wins. In 1996, Cavonnier, his first Derby horse, was
nipped at the wire by Grindstone. Even more impressive is that last
year he was just as close to becoming the sport's first Triple
Crown winner in 20 years. Real Quiet _ who had added the Preakness
crown to his Derby triumph _ lost by a bob of the head at the
Belmont finish line. The year before Silver Charm lost the Triple
Crown by three-quarters of a Belmont length.
</P>
<P>
   No trainer in history has made such a quick impact at the
Kentucky Derby as has Baffert. Yet the more everyone tried to get
the 46-year-old trainer to talk about what it's like to hold horse
racing firmly by the tail, the more he deflected attention with a
joke or some whimsical, self-deprecating reflection.
</P>
<P>
   And so he talked about showing up at Los Alamitos race track in
1976 with four horses and a goat: ``And the goat was worth more
than all four horses.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was telling you this, he was standing in front of a
Churchill Downs barn that currently houses 33 horses he's training
with his two assistants and 15 stablehands.
</P>
<P>
   Owners now flock to him because they have found the style comes
with true substance. Said Bob Lewis, the top-dollar horseman who
introduced himself to the virtually unknown Baffert at Santa Anita
in 1992:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for compatibility and chemistry and here was a
guy willing to have some fun. But he had this humility, too. One of
the first things he told me was, `I do pretty good with sprints. I
know nothing about going long. I have to take some lessons.'''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert started on racing's bottom rung and had a long and
laborious climb to the top of the sport. He was raised on a cattle
ranch in Nogales, Ariz., and then, because he liked the social life
better than his lessons, he ended up struggling through the equine
program at the University of Arizona in six years. As his dad was
saying the other day: ``Bob's sophomore year was three of the best
years of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while Baffert worked as a substitute teacher and finally
he immersed himself in the blue collar, knock-about world of
quarter horse racing. By 1990, he had become a two-time winner of
one of the sports top races, the Champion of Champions. That caught
the attention of Mike Pegram, the businessman who bankrolled his
initial jump to thoroughbreds and now owns Real Quiet and
Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Baffert said the learning curve was steep, which
explains what happened with Thirty Slews, a sprinter he thought
would be his first Derby horse. He brought it to the Lexington
Stakes and, as veteran trainers snickered, the horse barely made it
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor old Thirty Slews,'' Baffert said. ``I almost ruined that
son of a gun. He got back to the barn that day and he was all hair
and lactic acid. It took about three hours to cool him out. It was
one of those deals where you learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Thirty Slews won the $1 million Breeders Cup
Sprint. That eventually led to Cavonnier and the string he's put
together now. He said he's succeeded, in part, because he listened
to Charlie Whittingham, the 86-year-old Hall of Fame trainer who
just died: ``He made me realize nobody is bigger than the game.
Charlie's best quote was `Horses are like strawberries. They can go
bad on you at any time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the tenuous nature of the game, Baffert's been able tug
on the strongest fibers. The best thing about Baffert, said jockey
Gary Stevens _ who rode Silverbulletday, Friday, and will be aboard
General Challenge today _ is his ability to spot yearlings who will
have the stamina and mental strength to race the 1 1/4 mile Derby
so early in their three-year-old career.
</P>
<P>
   And so Baffert spent just $85,000 for Silver Charm and a bargain
basement $17,000 for Real Quiet. Such foresight is why an owner
like 76-year-old Aaron U. Jones _ nearly out of the game _ came
back with a vengeance when Baffert got him his first Derby
contender in Prime Timber. It's why 77-year old John Mabee _ also
without a Derby win _ put Baffert in charge of General Challenge
and also let the trainer talk him into running his filly Excellent
Meeting in today's race.
</P>
<P>
   Even though only three of the 36 fillies who ever entered this
race have won, Baffert said the rugged Mabee filly has a shot and
everyone seems to agree.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rather than focus on these days when people hang on his
every word, he again changed the conversation to times more
obscure. And that led to a story about the quarterhorse race he won
one Halloween night in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As the jockey brought the horse to the winner's circle and the
owners, groom and hangers-on gathered for the traditional track
photo, no one could find Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a guy came stumbling from the grandstands with a
Jack'O Lantern on his head. He posed with the group, the crowd
cheered and then Baffert pulled the pumpkin from his head.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd stood and howled for him all the more.
</P>
<P>
   And if you were around Churchill Downs this week, you realized
they have not stopped.

   DOW INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE INCREASED 10.2 PERCENT IN APRIL
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 10.2 percent in April,
the biggest monthly gain in more than a decade, and is up 17.51
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday the Dow industrial average and Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell on fears that a bustling economy might produce
a bout of inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 89.34
points, to 10,789.04, while the S&AMP;P 500-stock index fell 7.65

   SHARES OF REPSOL AND YPF SURGE
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Repsol and YPF surged after Spain's largest oil
company expressed confidence that its unsolicited $13.4 billion
takeover offer for the Argentine rival would succeed. Alfonso
Cortina, the chairman of Repsol, announced the bid late Thursday.
If the merger occurs, it would create the world's eighth-largest
oil business. The high price offered by Repsol for YPF and the
support of the Argentine Government for the takeover made the deal
look likely.

   President Clinton is expected to announce Saturday that he has

COMPANY IS MODEL OF MODERN MAJOR MODEL SHOP

   LOS ANGELES _ One of the key cradles of Hollywood's show
business resides not on a studio lot but at a former machine shop
in a distinctly unglamorous industrial section of the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At 7-year-old Rijn &AMP; Reisman, Hollywood's rubber meets the road.
The company in the North Hollywood community of Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, usually staffed by fewer than a dozen employees,
is where artistic whimsy is transformed into actual physical form
for the world's leading theme parks and movies such as ``Mars
Attacks!'' ``An American Werewolf in Paris,'' ``Edward
Scissorhands,'' ``Death Becomes Her'' and ``The Postman.''
</P>
<P>
   The building's exterior is topped by a pair of the ``Batman''
gargoyles, designed by co-founder Leo Rijn, and a 4-foot-high
company logo _ a three-dimensional version of the hands from the
Moment of Creation portion of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main role is taking a two-dimensional design and making it
three-dimensional,'' said co-founder Andy Reisman, whose background
includes stints as manager at theme park designer Landmark
Entertainment and the model shop at Universal Studios Florida.
``Our logo reflects that plus our philosophy _ hands-on work and an
Old World style.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its humble setting, Rijn &AMP; Reisman's profile is likely
to be on the rise. It recently completed its largest project ever
by cranking out dozens of the characters used at Universal Studios'
upcoming Islands of Adventure, due to open next month in what's
seen as a frontal assault on Walt Disney World's stranglehold on
the Florida theme-park business.
</P>
<P>
   Starting three years ago, the company built models and maquettes
(industry lingo for preliminary models) for four of the five
``islands'' of the new park _ ``Seuss Landing,'' ``Toon Lagoon,''
``Lost Continent'' and ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   It staffed up to 25 artists in an effort to work out such
diverse looks as The Cat in the Hat ride, the Green Eggs and Ham
restaurant, Merlin's Magic Shop, Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls
ride, the Mulberry Street Emporium, Jurassic Park and Popeye and
Bluto's Bilge Rats ride.
</P>
<P>
   The shop eventually created more than 40 maquettes for Seuss
Landing, the first time the Seuss characters have been employed at
a theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey Geisel (widow of Seuss creator Theodore Geisel) wanted
to know what we were doing at the early stages, so we made a
maquette of the Cat in the Hat in the bathtub,'' Reisman recalled.
``We're now recognized as having our finger on the Cat's look.''
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part was getting all the artists to generate a unique
look, one that would be distinctive from those for Walt Disney
characters. ``The lines for Dr. Seuss characters have wiggles and
are much wonkier,'' Rijn said. ``The Disney lines tend to be fairly
puffy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the characters were digitized and built as full-size
sculptures. ``We often found ourselves in the position of not only
`translating' imagery and ideas originally conceived on paper but
also in the role of problem solvers while crafting the items into
3-D,'' Reisman said. ``Art directors can be amazingly focused on
details that no one else ever sees.''
</P>
<P>
   With no other major theme parks due to open this year,
Universal's $2billion theme park expansion may lead to
significantly higher visibly for Rijn &AMP; Reisman. Among industry
trackers, Islands of Adventure has become one of the most watched
developments in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, which has already opened a CityWalk entertainment
complex next to its Universal Studios Florida, faces a major task
in convincing customers to stay longer and spend more at their
Florida complex rather than at the Disney resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury's kind of out on Islands of Adventure,'' said
entertainment industry analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones.
``Universal has done a lot of advertising, and that's bound to have
some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Rijn and Reisman are looking beyond Islands of Adventure these
days. The founders believe expansion in theme parks and casinos has
slowed, leading them to search for new business such as movies and
toy design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking to get noticed from Islands of Adventure,''
Reisman admitted. ``Until now, we've mostly stayed in the
background and established a niche as a high-end player.''
</P>
<P>
   In its top years, Rijn &AMP; Reisman has taken in $1.5 million in
revenue annually, but the founders are not looking to augment that
figure significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did much more than that, we wouldn't be hands-on; we'd
be administrators,'' Reisman said. ``What we do here is by far the
most exciting part of the project because after we're done, it
becomes mostly a bunch of problems to be solved. Once we've done
models and maquettes, the fun part is mostly over.''

<P>
   THE WOODLANDS _ The record will show that Joey Sindelar has not
won a golf tournament since 1990, when he emerged victorious at the
Hardee's Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But Sindelar, the midway co-leader of the Shell Houston Open
after his second 68, revealed Friday that, in fact, he scored a
major championship just last year.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, however, the PGA Tour doesn't recognize the
Father-Son tournament at Walt Disney World on the official money
list. But Sindelar and his youngest son, 6-year-old Ryan, swamped
the field in the six-hole event last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was a darn nice trophy, too,'' Sindelar said. ``I keep
putting it in my trophy case, and my son keeps stealing it and
putting it in his.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, after nine years without tasting victory, winning at the
local Putt-Putt would be OK with Sindelar.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that he's halfway toward securing what would be
a significantly more noteworthy triumph after his work during the
first 36 holes at the Tournament Players Course at The Woodlands.
Sindelar played bogey-free golf to join Hal Sutton at 8-under-par
136 for the lead at the halfway mark of the SHO. Jeff Gallagher is
a stroke back at 137. Three players are at 138, and four more,
including David Duval, are at 5-under 139. Duval, the defending
champion, survived a double bogey on No. 15 to stay in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar said he had a little trouble believing the way he
toured around the TPC during the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to say this, because this is golf and it will
come back to get you, but the first 33 holes were very easy and
nice,'' Sindelar said. ``It must be like what David Duval does on a
medium day. It was fairways and greens and some short birdie putts.
Low stress. On the last few holes, I hit a couple of stinkers. But
for the most time, it was smooth sailing and it felt very, very
good. I feel like I'm in darn good position.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton had posted his 8-under total earlier in the day, but
Sindelar, who started on the back nine, drew into a tie when he
chipped in from the right of the fourth green, his 13th hole. His
approach on the par-4 had drifted about 12 yards right of the pin,
and the chip might have gone a good 10 feet past if the hole hadn't
gotten in the way.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Sindelar had an unexpected birdie, then saved his
round with some savvy play at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of chopped it up Nos. 7 and 9,'' he said. ``On 7, I
skulled a 9-iron over the green and hit another one of those chips
that just kept going and rolled 10 feet by, but I made the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then on the ninth, I hit a 1-iron off the tee and was in
between clubs. I hit an easy 7-iron, and it went in the right trap,
which was nowhere to be. I didn't even get the trap shot on the
green, although it wasn't a bad shot. It was about 12 feet, and
that putt went in.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got away with a couple there coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed on the PGA Tour since the last time Sindelar
won. The tournament he won that year has changed names twice in the
subsequent nine years. But when Sindelar entered the interview room
after his round Friday, he noticed other differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been anywhere close to this complex, and it's
nice,'' Sindelar said. ``Press areas have changed a lot since the
last time I used them. Gosh, purses went up and press rooms got
better.''
</P>
<P>
   It has taken awhile, but so has Sindelar's game. He was a
consistent contender through the late '80s, and the win in '90 was
his sixth in seven years on tour. But since that victory, Sindelar
has only one second-place finish to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he believes his game is much better now than it was
when he was winning occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean this arrogantly, but nobody has ever won a golf
tournament playing that bad as when I won Quad Cities that year,''
he said. ``It was duck hooks and block-outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But about '93, I made some decisions about my game and found a
few fixes, mainly about getting extension through the swing. That's
the one thing I try to make sure I'm doing when things start going
not as well as they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sindelar would like nothing better than to complete a comeback
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, meanwhile, is trying to extend his. He won twice last
year to break a two-year drought and is looking for his first win
of '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game has been good, and I always like coming to Houston,''
Sutton said. ``This is familiar territory for me, and I feel like
the potential is there for me to accomplish good things on this
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton started on No. 10 and birdied Nos. 13, 15 and 17 to get
himself to the top of the leader board before conditions got
breezier in the late morning and afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody overpowered the TPC. The low score Friday was 68, shot by
seven players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little faster and a little firmer out there,'' Sutton
said. ``The course is playing a little harder. It's just harder to
get the ball as close as we did the first day.''

HORRY LIGHTENS LOAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The season was weighing on Los Angeles Lakers
reserve forward Robert Horry, so he lifted his burden by removing
his lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Horry changed his weightlifting routine two weeks ago after
determining the increased muscle mass had altered his shooting
form. Once he lightened the load, his 3-point stroke returned as
though it were an obedient pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels really good now, better than it has all season,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After making five 3-pointers in a 24-game stretch through March
and half of April, Horry has drained 11 of 19 since adjusting his
lifting routine seven games ago. That includes a watershed 6-of-8
performance in the Lakers' rollicking victory Thursday over
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoulders are naturally forward, but when I lift a lot of
heavy weight, it strengthens my muscles and pulls my shoulders
back,'' said Horry, who leads the Lakers in 3-point shooting (49
percent). ``That changes how I hold my arms, and it changes my
shoulder position when I shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain, but my whole (shooting motion) is
different. Now, it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry never lifted weights during his bombardier days in
Houston, when he complemented Hakeem Olajuwon's post presence with
uncanny 3-point marksmanship. Then again, he didn't have to. He was
strong enough to defend opposing small forwards without the
weights.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers use Horry as a power forward, and that requires
additional strength, especially for post defense. He hasn't
eliminated weights altogether, but he has cut back significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to maintain right now,'' he said. ``The other thing
is, I wasn't playing but 15 minutes a game (in March and early
April), so that meant I had to lift more to stay in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all: Horry also benefited from coach Kurt Rambis'
tactical adjustment Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of running cutters through the lane when Shaquille
O'Neal had the ball in the low post, the Lakers stationed shooters
around the 3-point line and dared the Blazers to double-team Shaq
from longer distances.
</P>
<P>
   When they did, he whipped the ball to an open teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Often, that was Horry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we stayed spread out was the way (Horry) played in
Houston,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said he urged the spread formation during the team
meetings Tuesday. His point was this: using cutters does nothing
but clog the lane, which makes it easier for defenses to
double-team him. If the Lakers are spread, the lane stays clear.
</P>
<P>
   The formation is easy to execute and gives opponents two
options: play Shaq one-on-one, or leave a shooter open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to keep it simple,'' O'Neal said. ``We've got to use
what we've got. Utah uses (John) Stockton and (Karl) Malone. If you
double Malone, he kicks it to Bryon Russell.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of meetings: The Lakers didn't limit their Tuesday
meetings to strategy. With Derek Harper (no surprise) and Horry
(big surprise) doing much of the talking, they covered the gamut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about everything,'' Horry said. ``We talked about
getting paid and contracts and plays and what we need to do. It was
the most-productive meeting I've ever seen.''

OUTGOING U.N. DEVELOPMENT CHIEF BERATES U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With U.S. debt to the United Nations soaring
and contributions to development aid plunging, the outgoing chief
of the U.N. Development Program, the highest-ranking American in
the U.N. system, has accused the United States of ``tragic
shortsightedness'' in failing to support the world body.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has consistently ``undervalued, underutilized
and underfunded'' the United Nations and its agencies in recent
years, said the development chief, James Gustave Speth, a
soft-spoken environmentalist known to be close to Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Speth, who will step down at the end of June as head of the
United Nation's largest agency after six years, was interviewed
Wednesday in his spacious office with a panoramic view of the U.N.
Secretariat and Manhattan's East Side. He is leaving to be dean of
Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In words laced with frustration, he deplored what he called U.S.
``ignorance'' of the ``extraordinary'' role played by the United
Nations in preventing and containing conflict, sustaining
development and reducing poverty. He criticized not only the
Republican-led Congress, which has been holding $1.6 billion in
past dues hostage to anti-abortion and other domestic concerns, but
also the Democratic administration that had nominated him.
</P>
<P>
   While ``a lot more supportive'' than Congress, the Clinton
administration has also given the United Nations too little
priority, he said, often ``going it alone'' as a superpower and
failing to press for the implementation of its pledge to reward the
reforms it advocated.
</P>
<P>
   A troubling indication that Washington had given up its
leadership here, many United Nations officials said, was the
administration's decision to permit a non-American to replace
Speth, who was the sixth American to hold that post.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats and U.S. officials said that Washington had
given up the post in hopes of further reducing its contribution to
U.N. development aid. Last week, the General Assembly confirmed
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's nomination of Mark Malloch Brown,
the British-born World Bank vice president, as Speth's successor.
</P>
<P>
   The UNDP, the world body's main foreign-aid arm, has about 5,000
employees in 130 offices throughout the world and disburses about
$1.9 billion of its $2.2 billion budget to fight poverty and
underdevelopment. Europeans, resentful of the United States for
failing to pay $1.6 billion in assessments, had campaigned for the
UNDP slot.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agency's budget comes from voluntary contributions,
America's portion of the budget has been dropping. In the new issue
of Foreign Affairs, Speth called Washington's aid budgets
``particularly stingy.'' In the interview he noted that while
Nordic countries contributed about $16 per capita to his agency,
America's per capita contribution stood at 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The drop comes at a time of growing poverty amid abundance.
Almost three-fifths of the world's 4.4 billion people in developing
countries live without basic sanitation; almost one-third are
without safe drinking water; a quarter lack adequate housing, a
fifth are malnourished and 1.3 billion live on less than $1 a day,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans have no sense of how desperate the lot of one
half of humanity is,'' Speth said.
</P>
<P>
   Speth said that although the United Nations had made ``dramatic
progress'' in eliminating duplication and waste, and that his own
agency had undergone ``significant restructuring'' _ spending
nearly a fourth of its budget now on projects that promote better
government, democracy and market forces _ the administration's
budget request of $80 million this year was still 20 percent less
than what it requested and Congress approved.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that a weakening of the United Nations' development
efforts would undermine the organization's peacekeeping activities.
``It is the hands-on work of helping people in 160 countries around
the world that builds up the credibility of the United Nations and
gives it access,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Bolton, senior vice president of the Washington-based
American Enterprise Institute, disagreed with Speth's suggestion
that failing to support the world body's development work was
lessening its impact in world diplomacy. But he agreed with those
who criticized the administration for not fighting to keep an
American in the agency's top job. It showed yet again that the
administration was ``spineless'' and ``without vision,'' Bolton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert DeVecchi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations and president emeritus of the International Rescue
Committee, said that the nationality of the administrator mattered
less than his competence. U.S. relief workers were ``delighted''
with Malloch Brown's appointment, he said.

COMPANY IS MODEL OF MODERN MAJOR MODEL SHOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the key cradles of Hollywood's show
business resides not on a studio lot but at a former machine shop
in a distinctly unglamorous industrial section of the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At 7-year-old Rijn &AMP; Reisman, Hollywood's rubber meets the road.
The company in the North Hollywood community of Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley, usually staffed by fewer than a dozen employees,
is where artistic whimsy is transformed into actual physical form
for the world's leading theme parks and movies such as ``Mars
Attacks!'' ``An American Werewolf in Paris,'' ``Edward
Scissorhands,'' ``Death Becomes Her'' and ``The Postman.''
</P>
<P>
   The building's exterior is topped by a pair of the ``Batman''
gargoyles, designed by co-founder Leo Rijn, and a 4-foot-high
company logo _ a three-dimensional version of the hands from the
Moment of Creation portion of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main role is taking a two-dimensional design and making it
three-dimensional,'' said co-founder Andy Reisman, whose background
includes stints as manager at theme park designer Landmark
Entertainment and the model shop at Universal Studios Florida.
``Our logo reflects that plus our philosophy _ hands-on work and an
Old World style.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its humble setting, Rijn &AMP; Reisman's profile is likely
to be on the rise. It recently completed its largest project ever
by cranking out dozens of the characters used at Universal Studios'
upcoming Islands of Adventure, due to open next month in what's
seen as a frontal assault on Walt Disney World's stranglehold on
the Florida theme-park business.
</P>
<P>
   Starting three years ago, the company built models and maquettes
(industry lingo for preliminary models) for four of the five
``islands'' of the new park _ ``Seuss Landing,'' ``Toon Lagoon,''
``Lost Continent'' and ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   It staffed up to 25 artists in an effort to work out such
diverse looks as The Cat in the Hat ride, the Green Eggs and Ham
restaurant, Merlin's Magic Shop, Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls
ride, the Mulberry Street Emporium, Jurassic Park and Popeye and
Bluto's Bilge Rats ride.
</P>
<P>
   The shop eventually created more than 40 maquettes for Seuss
Landing, the first time the Seuss characters have been employed at
a theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey Geisel (widow of Seuss creator Theodore Geisel) wanted
to know what we were doing at the early stages, so we made a
maquette of the Cat in the Hat in the bathtub,'' Reisman recalled.
``We're now recognized as having our finger on the Cat's look.''
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part was getting all the artists to generate a unique
look, one that would be distinctive from those for Walt Disney
characters. ``The lines for Dr. Seuss characters have wiggles and
are much wonkier,'' Rijn said. ``The Disney lines tend to be fairly
puffy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the characters were digitized and built as full-size
sculptures. ``We often found ourselves in the position of not only
`translating' imagery and ideas originally conceived on paper but
also in the role of problem solvers while crafting the items into
3-D,'' Reisman said. ``Art directors can be amazingly focused on
details that no one else ever sees.''
</P>
<P>
   With no other major theme parks due to open this year,
Universal's $2billion theme park expansion may lead to
significantly higher visibly for Rijn &AMP; Reisman. Among industry
trackers, Islands of Adventure has become one of the most watched
developments in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, which has already opened a CityWalk entertainment
complex next to its Universal Studios Florida, faces a major task
in convincing customers to stay longer and spend more at their
Florida complex rather than at the Disney resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury's kind of out on Islands of Adventure,'' said
entertainment industry analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones.
``Universal has done a lot of advertising, and that's bound to have
some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Rijn and Reisman are looking beyond Islands of Adventure these
days. The founders believe expansion in theme parks and casinos has
slowed, leading them to search for new business such as movies and
toy design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking to get noticed from Islands of Adventure,''
Reisman admitted. ``Until now, we've mostly stayed in the
background and established a niche as a high-end player.''
</P>
<P>
   In its top years, Rijn &AMP; Reisman has taken in $1.5 million in
revenue annually, but the founders are not looking to augment that
figure significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did much more than that, we wouldn't be hands-on; we'd
be administrators,'' Reisman said. ``What we do here is by far the
most exciting part of the project because after we're done, it
becomes mostly a bunch of problems to be solved. Once we've done
models and maquettes, the fun part is mostly over.''

FLURRY OF TRADING HURTS NEWCOM STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in modem maker NewCom Inc., based in
Westlake Village northwest of Los Angeles, fell Friday, one day
after exceptionally heavy trading in the stock nearly doubled its
price.
</P>
<P>
   NewCom shares dropped 9.375 cents, or 14.29 percent, to close at
56.25 cents, on volume of 845,000 shares, or five times the issue's
30-day average daily volume. That compared to an 83 percent gain
Thursday on volume of 1.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   With no official news either Thursday or Friday, speculation was
rife among investors as to what caused the initial spike.
</P>
<P>
   A message board dedicated to NewCom on Yahoo.com was crowded
with claims that someone _ though no one seemed to know who _ was
``pumping and dumping'' the stock, a practice in which investors
buy shares in a company, sell it to themselves under a different
name and buy it back at a higher price. The expectation is that by
repeating the process several times, it will draw other buyers on
whom the perpetrator can ultimately dump the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The computer modem maker has struggled in recent years as profit
margins in the industry thinned and competition from larger
companies cut into sales. In January, NewCom appointed an interim
president and laid off one-third of its employees after announcing
disappointing earnings. But the company has had no news since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason at all'' for the increase in trading, said
Dianne Will of Willstar Consultants, which handles investor
relations for NewCom. ``My phone's been ringing off the hook, but I
have nothing to say.''

 &HT;    Guns high on Y2K checklists
 &HT;    By Marc Freeman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Business is booming at area gun and pawn
shops thanks to the specter of a societal meltdown on Jan. 1 _
should the worst computer malfunctioning Y2K scenarios come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't keep a cold AR-15 on the shelf,'' said J.B. Stevens,
who owns Gator Guns &AMP; Pawn in suburban West Palm Beach, referring
to a brand of automatic rifle. ``People don't very well believe the
government, that everything's going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem is a computer programming flaw that businesses
and governments are spending billions of dollars to fix before Jan.
1, 2000. Most older computers can't recognize dates after Dec. 31,
1999, meaning that they will count 2000 as 1900 _ unless they are
reprogrammed in time.
</P>
<P>
   Public officials and major corporations say they're fixing the
flaw and there will be no major problems come New Year's Day. But
doomsday theorists and many average citizens _ some polls say one
out of every four Americans _ expect worldwide financial markets,
international defense systems and communications circuits to crash.
If not permanently, then at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``People honestly believe you'll have looting and everything
else, like after a bad hurricane,'' said Mary Cummings, owner of
Sportsman's Locker in Royal Palm Beach, who said her business is
``absolutely'' on the rise. There's also a run on rifle bullets,
she said. ``They are definitely stocking up on ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local gun sellers say business is up as much as 10 percent.
National weapons distributors say they are having trouble filling
orders because the public demand has been too much for
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, local gun dealers contacted Friday said
customers seeking to stock home arsenals were repeating a familiar
litany: If the Y2K bug hits, we want to be ready for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Why buy now?
</P>
<P>
   Here's their thinking: When the computers crash and the banks
shut down, we won't be able to get money to buy guns. If the
government's computers are down, they won't be able to run criminal
background checks and we won't get our guns. And our families and
homes will be left unguarded as society descends into utter chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned about their safety and I don't blame
them,'' said Patrick Hayes, manager of Trail Guns in Lake Worth.
``They want to be protected in case computers and everything does
go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Milelli, Palm Beach County's director of public safety,
says residents have nothing to fear and should save their gun and
ammo money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not going to be any major, major catastrophes related
to the Y2K issue,'' he assured. ``Banks, water and sewer systems,
electric utilities, telephone systems, traffic control devices _
all of the computer software that controls those things are Y2K
compliant. Governmental institutions will not collapse.''

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Law enforcement officials here acknowledged
Friday that they did little to follow up a complaint a neighbor
made last year that one of the teen-agers responsible for the
killings at Columbine High School last week ``talks often of making
pipe bombs and using them to kill numerous people.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials, from the Jefferson County sheriff's office, also
said they told the sheriff's deputy assigned to the school and two
administrators at Columbine about the complaint. The deputy engaged
in ``light conversation'' with the teen-ager, Eric Harris, and his
friends, but did not pick up signs that Harris was engaged in a
year-long plot that ended in a massacre at the school.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing a copy of the complaint Friday, the Jefferson
County sheriff's office said it did not confront Harris or his
parents because the neighbor who made the complaint did not want
the Harrises to know he had done so.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the strongest evidence to emerge that law
enforcement officials had warnings before Harris and a friend,
Dylan Klebold, attacked Columbine with 30 pipe bombs and guns,
killing 13 people and themselves. The March 18, 1998, report also
said that Harris and Klebold made and detonated pipe bombs.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the complaint was filed, Harris began a diary that
laid out the plan to blow up the school and a grand scheme to
attack neighboring homes, hijack a jet and crash in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, sheriff's officials, noting the
volume of complaints involving bombs they received last year,
defended themselves against mounting criticism that they had
ignored signs that the two teen-agers were unstable and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the two-page report were copies of Harris' Web site
delivered to sheriff's investigators by the neighbor, Randy Brooks
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report noted that Harris wrote three times on his
Web site about ``wanting to kill'' Brown's son, Brooks, Lt. John
Kiekbusch said Friday that the investigation did ``not get to the
point where a crime was identified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all learned a lesson on April 20th,'' Kiekbusch said when
asked if his office had mishandled the complaint. ``We need to take
these in a more serious fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the sheriff's office knew that six weeks
before the complaint, Harris and Klebold were arrested for breaking
into a van.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, who have complained bitterly of inaction by the
sheriff's office, did not answer a telephone calls Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that they were unable to call up the Web site
on their own computers, apparently because the site was down. They
said they did not contact the parents of the two young men because,
as Deputy Mark Miller noted in his report, Brown ``was very anxious
in remaining anonymous in making this report and did not want
Harris or Klebold to have knowledge about his reporting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the report said, had reported Harris to the sheriff's
office in 1997, and now feared that he would take revenge on his
son, a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   ``God I can't wait till I can kill you people,'' a section of
the Web site entitled ``Philosophy'' said. ``I'll just go to some
downtown area in some big ass city and blow up and shoot everything
I can. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I live or die in the shootout, all I want to
do is kill and injure as many of you'' as possible, he said in one
of many diatribes laced with obscenities, misspellings and phrases
in broken German.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who was under some type of psychiatric care at the time,
wrote, ``No I am not crazy, crazy is just a word.''
</P>
<P>
   After three and a half pages listing, ``You know what I hate,''
he described the detonation of a homemade pipe bomb: ``Flipping
thing was heart-pounding, gut-wrenching, brain-twitching,
ground-moving insanely cool!''
</P>
<P>
   In a followup complaint, dated April 11, 1998, a sheriff's
deputy reported that Judy Brown had complained that Brooks, her
son, had just received an anonymous threatening e-mail. The
reporting deputy wrote, ``They are very concerned and requested an
extra patrol for the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Browns' plea for total anonymity, the death threats
were reported in the crime column of the March 25, 1998, edition of
The Columbine Courier, a weekly newspaper that serves the school
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father downloaded and printed 10 pages in which the boy
threatened his son three times,'' read the three-paragraph item.
Without naming names, the article related how the father had filed
a complaint with sheriff's office. ``The boy also explained how to
make pipe bombs and use them against people.''
</P>
<P>
   While the complaint languished as an ``Open Lead'' for a
``Suspicious Incident,'' the sheriff's office did talk to deans at
Columbine and to Neil Gardner, the deputy assigned to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner told the school's two deans that ``Eric Harris was
possibly messing around with pipe bombs and explosives,'' said Rick
Kaufman, a spokesman for the county school district.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deans were not informed about the Web site. No
action was taken by the school because, Kaufman said, Gardner told
the administrators that the sheriff's office was investigating the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deputy Gardner, with this knowledge, occasionally engaged
Harris and Klebold, along with several of their friends and
associates in light conversation,'' Steve Davis, the sheriff's
spokesman, said Friday. ``Deputy Gardner made no observations of
inappropriate behavior and has stated that both Harris and Klebold
treated him with appropriate respect.''

 LITTLETON, Colo.: appropriate respect.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   That respect was thrown to the winds on the morning of April 20,
when Gardner responded to a call of gunfire at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The first police officer to encounter the attackers, Gardner has
described how a man he believed was Harris fired a fusillade of
about 10 rounds of semiautomatic rifle fire at his patrol car. The
sheriff's deputy has said that he fired back four or five shots,
then jumped behind a nearby Blazer and fired another three or five
times.
</P>
<P>
   Before retreating into the school, Harris apparently raked the
Blazer with another volley, shattering the windshield and rear view
mirrors and sending bullets ricocheting underneath the car. The
deputy, one of two policemen to fire at the assailants, was not
injured.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, officials said they had identified the person who
furnished the young men with the semiautomatic handgun, a Tec-DC9.
Dave Thomas, the county district attorney, said that investigators
had interviewed the last owner of the gun, as well as the pizza
store employee who apparently served as a go between.
</P>
<P>
   This high-powered 9mm pistol, the district attorney confirmed,
went from the manufacturer in Miami to a wholesaler in Illinois, to
a gun shop in a suburb north of Denver, to a gun show outside of
Denver last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of a handgun to a minor is a federal offense. Klebold
died at age 17. Harris turned 18 on April 9. The district attorney
hinted that arrests could be made in the gun case in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Crime laboratory technicians are conducting ballistics tests to
determine which guns fired the fatal shots. If bullets fired by the
Tec-DC9 did not kill anyone, the gun seller may face charges only
of illegal gun peddling, rather than being implicated in the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities said Friday that they still had not
talked to the parents of the two suspects. The parents hired
lawyers the day after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   For the living, Columbine students picked up their class
schedules Friday at Chatfield High School, long an athletic
archrival. On Friday, a new banner greeted the Columbine students:
``Rivals No More. Friends Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Some high school students have pledged to channel their grief
into a demonstration Saturday morning against the National Rifle
Association, which is holding its annual meeting in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short term, we want to show the NRA that we are not going to
be receptive,'' said Ben Gelt, an 18-year-old Denver high school
senior who has leafleted about 20 area high schools for the
protest. Referring to victims of gun violence, he said, ``If there
are a lot of kids there, it will show them that today's young
people, who are tomorrow's leaders, are not going to stand for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Friday, Wellington Webb, who faces
reelection as Denver's mayor next week, called on the gun group
``to cancel or postpone out of respect for the grieving families of
Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the angry atmosphere following the shootings, there have been
a series of threats _ bomb threats to the hotel where the NRA
members arrived Friday for their convention, and death threats to
the Klebold family. Doug Dean, a Colorado Springs state
representative who sponsored a bill this spring to loosen rules on
the granting of concealed weapons permits, has said that he has
received so many telephone threats that he may leave politics.
Dean, a Republican, is the House majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as a cold rain fell on a county park adjacent to the
school, a massive, spontaneous memorial was temporarily wrapped in
long swatches of white plastic sheeting. Famous worldwide, the
memorial has started attracting pilgrims from outside Denver.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Martin Luther King III, a son of the civil rights
leader, quietly walked among the rows of flowers, handmade
placards, artwork, poetry inscriptions, votive candles and teddy
bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation is judged by how it treats its most precious
resource, and our most precious resource are our children,'' said
King, who came here from Atlanta to attend the funeral of Isaiah
Shoels. ``This kind of behavior shows we are not treating our
children justly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Vice President Al Gore brought a bouquet to the
park. On Tuesday, it was the turn of Sarah Ferguson, the dutchess
of York. She said that the massive outpouring of popular mourning
reminded her of the public response to the death of her
sister-in-law, Diana, the Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has the feel of Kensington Palace,'' she said as
she surveyed the damp field of bouquets. ``Everyone was there to
pay their respects. It certainly feels like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Historical Society has established an agreement
with county park officials to start removing the memorial on May
10. Each item that can be saved is to be cataloged and warehoused.
Some pieces may go into a traveling exhibit. Others may be
integrated into a permanent memorial at the site.

MILOSEVIC, IN INTERVIEW, SAYS NATO HAS `MISCALCULATED'

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, insisted
in an interview released here Friday that Yugoslavs were ``willing
to die'' to defend their rights but at the same time outlined what
he described as a six point plan for settlement of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparently carefully timed insight into his thinking,
Milosevic rejected outright a military presence in Kosovo composed
of an army but said that the ``United Nations can have a huge
presence if it wishes.'' Questioned more closely by Arnaud de
Borchgrave from United Press International, Milosevic said these
U.N. peacekeepers could bear sidearms for self-defense, and include
troops from non-NATO nations.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic rarely speaks in public, or grants interviews to
foreign media. His interview, which UPI said was given on Thursday
but was not released until Friday, appeared designed to coincide
with proposals aired more privately to the Russian envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who has been called by British officials a ``serial
ethnic cleanser,'' made no reference to the more than 600,000
ethnic Albanians who have been expelled by his forces in the last
five weeks and denied that ethnic Albanian villages had been
torched by Serb forces. He acknowledged that his forces were ``not
angels'' but said they were not the ``devils'' they were made out
to be.
</P>
<P>
   On his interpretation of American strategy, Milosevic was
sarcastic. ``Your leaders are not strategic thinkers,'' he said.
``Short-term quick fixes, yes. They said let's bomb Yugoslavia and
then figure out what to do next. Some said Milosevic would give up
Kosovo after a few days of aggression from the air.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO ``miscalculated,'' he said. ``You are not willing to
sacrifice lives to achieve our surrender,'' he said. ``But we are
willing to die to defend our rights as an independent sovereign
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement proposal by Milosevic, which included a draw down
of his forces in Kosovo as NATO withdrew its forces in neighboring
Albania and Macedonia, was far from meeting the five demands laid
out at the NATO summit last weekend. NATO has said that it wants an
international security force in Kosovo and that it stands ready to
create such a force.
</P>
<P>
   Giving an idea of the kind of non-military presence he would
accept, Milosevic said: ``There is no job for forces. What would
forces do? Just ruin our roads with tracked vehicles.'' He said
that members of any U.N. presence could carry ``self-defense
weapons'' but ``no offensive weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave, 72, asked Milosevic few adversarial questions and
allowed Milosevic to ruminate at length unchallenged. UPI said the
two-hour interview took place at a modest house outside Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was conducted in English, according to UPI.
Milosevic was a banker in New York for the Communist government of
Yugoslavia during the 1980s and learned idiomatic English during
that period.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration dismissed Milosevic's ideas on a
settlement as ``falling far short of what's needed to end the
bombing,'' according to David Leavy, a spokesman for the National
Security Council. Leavy described Milosevic's statements as
``propaganda spewing from the highest source.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader said that in order for a ``compromise'' to
be worked out with NATO, he would demand that the alliance withdraw
its troops ``now concentrated on our borders in Albania and
Macedonia,'' and at the same time he would draw down Serb forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic gave a far higher number of Serb forces in Kosovo _
100,000 _ than NATO has announced. NATO has said that Milosevic has
about 40,000 troops in the province. NATO's supreme commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, said earlier this week that despite NATO bombing,
Milosevic had managed to reinforce his troops in Kosovo and had a
higher number there now than at the start of the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically by de Borchgrave if he had increased his
troops from 40,000 to 100,000, Milosevic said he had done so after
hearing ``NATO voices urging political leaders to order ground
forces into action.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other points in Milosevic's proposal were ``the return
of all refugees, regardless of their ethnic or religious
affiliation.'' He made no reference to the fact that all of the
refugees now in neighboring countries are ethnic Albanians and that
those Serbs who have left Kosovo during the NATO bombardment
largely went to Serbia proper.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission that he proposed would, he said, come to Kosovo
as ``our guests'' and would be there to ``observe that all is
peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times in the interview, Milosevic said he could not accept
any foreign forces in Kosovo because they represented an
``occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Listing countries that he he would find acceptable in the U.N.
mission, Milosevic named Ireland as a European country that was not
a member of NATO. He also favored contingents from Russia, Ukraine
and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic described the negotiations at Rambouillet in France,
where Washington, four European countries and Russia failed to
persuade the Serbs to agree to 28,000 strong peacekeeping force, as
a ``diktat.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the peacekeeping force of 28,000, including 4,000
Americans, was planned with tanks, armored personnel carriers and
heavy weaponry and, hence, was unacceptable. ``Aid not arms is what
Kosovo needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of Milosevic's proposal was what he called the
``political process'' that he said he was conducting with the
ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and its NATO partners have questioned
whether Rugova, the head of the moderate political forces in
Kosovo, was acting voluntarily in his talks with Milosevic. A
German newspaper reporter who said she was with Rugova at his home
in Pristina after the NATO bombing began said Rugova was a hostage
of Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said that he would ``continue direct negotiations with
Mr. Rugova in the presence of the international community.'' But he
said the international community could not act as mediators.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing language from the proposed Rambouillet accords,
Milosevic said, ``We want to achieve the widest possible autonomy
for Kosovo within Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, Milosevic fell short of one of NATO's key demands, which
states that Kosovo would be set up as ``an international
provisional administration'' with ``substantial autonomy'' within
Yugoslavia. Serbia is the dominant of the two republics in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Milosevic's most revealing comments came when he
described his version of what had gone on in Kosovo. In some
respects, his descriptions appeared to be the obverse of those
heard in the West.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrillas of the
ethnic Albanians who make up the majority of the Kosovo population,
as wanting to achieve a ``racially pure state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is precisely the opposite of what is happening in the
world. Ethnically mixed states is the trend in the new global
village,'' Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has frequently charged Milosevic with the
``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo by expelling nearly half the ethnic
Albanian population in the last five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our regular forces are highly disciplined,'' Milosevic said.
``The paramilitary irregular forces are a different story.''
Painting a picture of the rule of law that Western governments
insist has not existed under Milosevic's authoritarian rule, he
said: ``We have arrested those irregular self-appointed leaders.
Some have already been tried and sentenced to 20 years in prison.''

FAMILY OF POW BUOYED BY JACKSON'S VISIT

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Prisoner of war Andrew Ramirez has a very
infectious smile, and when his mother saw it on television Friday,
she had to smile too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's condition looks very good. He looks very healthy,''
Vivian Ramirez said after watching a video of him at the East Los
Angeles school where she works as a librarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smiling,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time she has seen him since a day after his
capture March 31 by Serbians, when they broadcast images of the
24-year-old staff sergeant and two other prisoners of war who met
Friday with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks better,'' she said, with motherly concern in her
voice. ``A little thin, but a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said it's been an unbearable month, wondering if her son
is OK.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the fuzzy broadcast of Andrew praying with Jackson just
confirmed what she already knew because of a letter she received
from him earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing him grin Friday made the wait that much easier, she said,
even with the knowledge that she might not see him in person
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   While good news has only trickled back to Ramirez since her son
was captured, goodwill has flooded over Eastmont Elementary School,
where she works.
</P>
<P>
   The campus has become a three-dimensional tribute to Andrew
Ramirez _ with yellow ribbons, large and small, woven into the
chain-link fence that surrounds the school and every tree in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Thomas Donfrio said the school's 1,200 students _ from
preschool through fourth grade _ have flooded the popular staff
member with attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know much about politics,'' Donfrio said. ``They
sure know enough to make Vivian feel good on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she hasn't missed a day of work since her son was
captured.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a CNN satellite truck parked in front of the school
and there on the screen was the image of Jackson praying with
Andrew Ramirez. Jackson also handed him letters from his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The other men captured, Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone and Spc.
Steven Gonzales, were able to broadcast a message to their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was cut off by an apparent bombing raid by NATO planes.
But Ramirez had already seen all she needed to know her son is in
good spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very emotional,'' she said. ``God, if I could have gone
in there (myself), I would have just gone in there and hugged
him.''
</P>
<P>
   While attention was focused on Vivian Ramirez, other relatives
echoed similar sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's cousin John Hernandez said that one good has come out
of the stressful ordeal: His capture has brought the family
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family has come together more than we ever have been.
We're talking to family we never talked to before. ... It's good to
see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another cousin, Minerva Amaro, said she hasn't been able to stop
smiling herself since she saw the POW smiling on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so excited,'' she said. ``To see these pictures makes
me very happy _ just knowing that he's well and he's safe for
now.''

 3 CAPTURED U.S. SERVICEMEN MEET WITH JACKSON DELEGATION IN
BELGRADE  
(js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The three U.S. servicemen held by
Yugoslavia described on Friday their days as lonely and monotonous,
interrupted only by perfunctory daily visits from a Serb army
officer and solitary exercise in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   They said they have no contact with each other or with other
prisoners in the same facility. One said he took a walk Friday
outside his cell, only the second time he had been allowed to do so
in his month-long imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Another said he was finally given reading material Friday, but
the books were on Serb history and the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   With the chairman of the military court monitoring the questions
through a Yugoslav army interpreter and a military cameraman
recording their answers, the three young soldiers were allowed to
speak to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Congressman Rod Blagojevich of
Illinois, and a reporter from The New York Times. They were filmed
by CNN.
</P>
<P>
   When they were given the opportunity to send messages to their
families, each of the soldiers turned to face the camera directly
and seemed, suddenly, very young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope it's all over soon,'' said Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of
Huntsville, Texas. ``Mom, Dad, sorry I put you through so much pain
and agony.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., was
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my wife Tricia and my son Ryan, I love you,'' he said, his
face reddening and his eyes filling with tears. He stopped and
seemed unable to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Blagojevich, a Serbian-American Democrat whose father was raised
in Yugoslavia, seized the uneasy moment, bringing a smile to the
young soldier's face by saying that as a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, he was going to make sure the captives receive
a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, could spend only
a few minutes with the visitors because an air raid siren sounded
just before he was brought into the room, and the Yugoslav military
officers tried to hustle the visitors out.
</P>
<P>
   After pleas from Jackson, he was sent in with his two fellow
soldiers for a final photo shoot and time in front of the
television camera. He had time to do little more than send
greetings to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks everybody for all your thoughts and prayers,'' Ramirez
said. ``They've been needed and they're a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the delegation that met the soldiers, as well as
the length of the meeting, was decided by the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   The visit lasted about 40 minutes. The three soldiers, who had
been seen publicly only once shortly after they were captured along
the Kosovo-Macedonia border, were brought one at a time into a room
at the Belgrade Military Court building, just over the Sava River
from downtown Belgrade, at about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities refused to say where the soldiers are being held
and permitted them to answer only those questions that concerned
their living conditions and their health. The Yugoslav government
also specified that only two journalists and two members of
Jackson's interfaith delegation to Belgrade, which includes several
members of the clergy who had been in contact with the prisoners'
families, could meet the servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, dressed in their laundered U.S. Army camouflage
uniforms, appeared nervous and anxious and sat straight in their
armchairs. They wore their battered Army-issue boots without the
laces, which they said had been taken away by their captors.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were well-fed and had no medical problems and
appeared fit, if tense.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was the first to be brought into the small office of the
general supervising the visit. He appeared tired, with dark circles
under his eyes, and still had a bruise on his forehead, which he
said ``is a mark from our capture.'' He added that he had received
medical attention for the injury immediately after being taken into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   They are provided with three meals a day and a cell furnished
with a bed and a small table. who received th reading material
Friday, said he has only ``caught sight'' of his fellow GIs briefly
during his captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who appeared more rested than the others, ventured the
most elaborate description of his condition. Responding to a
question from Jackson, he said he was ``okay, considering the
circumstances.'' He added that he is also feeling ``a little
mentally drained.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told him, ``You are a hero. People know you all over the
world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security
Council, reacted to the interview by praising Jackson, but then
adding: ``We opposed his mission because we felt we couldn't
protect his safety, and feared it would be misconstrued in
Belgrade. It is positive that he was able to see the three
soldiers, deliver messages from familes and verify their health.
But there is no basis for their being taken and we continue to hold
Mr. Milosevic responsible for their personal safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The clergy who came from the United States with Jackson, but
were barred from meeting with the soldiers, had brought bibles and
small Orthodox icons for each of the men, as well as five packages
of Chuckles candies for Ramirez, a tape player and cassette tapes
recorded by each of the men's families.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson showed each of the soldiers the pile of gifts, but the
Yugoslav general, who would not identify himself, did not allow the
soldiers to take the gifts with them, saying they had to pass
military censors first.
</P>
<P>
   To each of the servicemen, though, Jackson offered words of
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many view the jail experience as a time of reflection, a
time to write, a time to think, a time to pray, a time to think
about how they want to build their lives,'' he told Stone, adding
that his imprisonment could be an opportunity to strengthen his
character and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of our scars,'' he said, ``come our stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The men, members of the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry of the 1st
Infantry Division operating in Macedonia, were on patrol when they
were captured at about 4 p.m. on March 31. The government here has
maintained they were seized in Kosovo, although U.S. officials have
accused the Serbs of abducting them and have demanded their
release.
</P>
<P>
   The dazed soldiers, with bruises and dirt on their faces, were
shown on Serb television soon after their capture. The Yugoslav
authorities at first talked of putting the three on trial, although
some government officials have since retracted the threat. However,
the general who supervised the interview with the soldiers
suggested that a trial remains under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The procedure for the indictment has not been in any way
initiated and possible evidence is still being collected,'' he
said, in laying down the limits on what could and could not be
asked of the soldiers. ``And it has to be yet decided whether an
indictment will be raised at all. But until then all matters
pertinent to possible investigation should not be dealt with at
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the general also said the three soldiers are prisoners
of war and are being treated in accordance with the Geneva
Convention. The men received their first visit from the
International Red Cross only this week. The general said a
representative of the European and Balkans branch of the Red Cross
also met them, but he did not say when that meeting took place.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who arrived in Belgrade on Thursday with a group of
American Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders, said he still hopes
to persuade the Yugoslav government to release the soldiers as a
humanitarian gesture. He said after the interviews with the men
that he still had no indication that they would be freed. Jackson
and his delegation have met twice with the Yugoslav foreign
minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, and are scheduled to meet President
Slobodan Milosevic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The general's comments indicated that the Yugoslav authorities
may consider it gesture enough to have approved a visit with the
soldiers. He called the arrangement ``out of the ordinary,
especially considering the air raid possibility and air strikes at
any moment.'' Indeed, the interviews with the soldiers were cut
short when an air raid siren wailed outside the window after about
40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are to take this as a gesture of good will by the Foreign
Ministry of our country,'' he told Jackson. ``Because as you are
probably well aware after the aggression by NATO on our country,
three U.S. citizens have been apprehended, having been found on
Yugoslav territory in U.S. uniforms and with arms in hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' final moment with their visitors was spent in
prayer. With his arm around Ramirez and Gonzales, and with Stone
standing close to his side, Jackson thanked God for watching over
the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help is on the way and hope is in the air and soon, very soon
you will know peace and family,'' he said, before the men filed out
of the room, holding their hands behind their backs.

WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION DEADLOCKED ON CHOICE OF LEADER

<P>
   GENEVA _ The World Trade Organization will be leaderless on
Saturday, after efforts to appoint a New Zealander as the new
director general were blocked by supporters of his Thai rival.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of delegates of the 134-nation group, which determines
global trading rules, bogged down in lengthy and heated wrangling
over who would replace Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade
minister, whose four-year term expired at 11:59 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared late Friday that Mike Moore, a former prime minister
of New Zealand, had the edge over Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's
deputy prime minister and commerce minister. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Supachai's supporters rebuffed the recommendation of Ali
Mchumo, Tanzania's trade ambassador and head of the selection
process, that Moore should be chosen because he had the strongest
numerical support, with 62 countries backing him and 59 supporting
Supachai. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mchumo also said that Moore, who was backed by the United
States, France and Germany, had the most widespread geographical
support, and that member countries expressed ``more positive
sentiments'' for him. These criteria were laid out to help the
members of the trade body achieve a consensus on Ruggiero's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting stretched into the early morning hours,
Supachai's supporters called for a formal vote to record each
country's position on the candidates, noting that 13 countries had
not declared a preference.
</P>
<P>
   However, 40 countries, including the United States and the
15-nation European Union, opposed such a vote, arguing that it
violated the organization's traditional way of doing business.
Sixteen countries favored a tally.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was created four years ago to replace the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the World Trade Organization has
avoided putting countries on the spot by calling for votes, opting
instead to work to achieve general agreement among the developing
nations and the larger trading powers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the delegates met privately, they left the
consultations to express their views to journalists. Pakistan's
trade envoy, Munir Akram, asked whether Moore had the green light
for the job, said, ``No green light, not even amber.''
</P>
<P>
   Akram, who has been a leader among developing countries that
want one of their own leading the organization, said the vote total
did not represent a consensus. ``It shows it's split down the
middle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing his determination to complete the selection, Mchumo
declared, ``We will be here until the sun comes up, and we have a
new director general.'' But the delegates agreed to adjourn and
reconvene at 4 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization's struggle to select a new leader comes
just as it is preparing for a new round of trade liberalization
negotiations this November. It is also mediating a number of
fractious trade disputes between the United States and Europe and
grappling with China's application for admission.

MERCANTILE BANCORPORATION, LONG A BUYER, WILL BE BOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Wis.)  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mercantile Bancorporation, a St. Louis bank that has been
cutting jobs and expenses after a three-year acquisition binge, has
agreed to be acquired itself by Firstar Corp., a Milwaukee bank,
which announced the deal late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two banking companies signed a definitive agreement for a
stock swap worth $10.6 billion, based on a price of $66 for each
Mercantile share. That is a premium of 29 percent over Mercantile's
closing price of $51.25 a share on Thursday, the day the terms were
agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Mercantile's shares rose more than 11 percent to $57 in
extremely heavy trading Friday, a result of a swirl of merger
rumors and a report in The American Banker, a trade publication,
that identified Firstar as the most likely buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory
approval, Mercantile shareholders will receive a tax-free exchange
of 2.091 shares of Firstar stock for each Mercantile share they
own.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will create a bank with more than $75 billion in
assets, far smaller than the seven largest banks created by the
merger boom of the last few years. Many of the bank deals that
occur over the next couple of years will involve the large cadre of
small and mid-sized banks that still dot the country.
</P>
<P>
   A number of banks, including U.S. Bancorp, Fifth Third Bancorp
and National City Corp., had looked at Mercantile but decided
against acquiring it because they felt the price was too rich,
relative to the bank's profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Mercantile, under its chief executive, Thomas H. Jacobsen, has
made two dozen acquisitions in the last four years, pumping its
asset base up to $35.8 billion from about $15.9 billion. But
analysts said the bank's acquisition spree was overly hasty,
eroding the value of the franchise. The buying binge was not
accompanied by strong revenue growth, and profitability suffered.
That left the bank, which has about 11,000 employees, vulnerable to
a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Firstar's shares plunged 4.75 percent, to $30.0625, in heavy
trading Friday, with investors apparently expecting a deal that
would hurt Firstar's profitability. But Firstar, with $38 billion
in assets, has won investors' respect in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Firstar has a well-regarded chief executive, Jerry A.
Grundhofer, and a very profitable consumer branch network in
several states, including Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee and Arizona. It also has trust,
investment and other financial services units that analysts
consider well run.
</P>
<P>
   Grundhofer will continue as president and chief executive, while
Jacobsen, who will be based in St. Louis, will become chairman of
the Firstar board. Roger L. Fitzsimonds, Firstar's chairman, plans
to retire when the acquisition is completed, which is expected in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank will still be far smaller than the Midwest's
dominant bank, Bank One Corp. of Chicago, which has $261 billion in
assets. But it will be closer in size to other regional rivals like
National City, which has $88 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Firstar may need to tread cautiously if it wants to avoid the
problems that plagued Mercantile. Firstar bought Star Banc Corp.
only about five months ago, and analysts have yet to deem that
merger a success.

IBM MAY TESTIFY FOR U.S. AGAINST MICROSOFT IN TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., the government
has portrayed personal computer makers as little more than
indentured servants of the software powerhouse. Again and again,
government lawyers asserted, Microsoft used the monopoly power of
its Windows operating system to bend PC companies to its will,
reducing competition and consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
   But a weak point in the government's case has been that none of
the PC companies it portrays as victims have taken the stand to
support the Justice Department's charges. For the rebuttal phase of
the trial, however, a manager of International Business Machines
Corp.'s PC division has agreed to testify, according to people
close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   IBM declined Friday night to comment on whether it would provide
a witness. The names of the rebuttal witnesses _ up to three each
for the government and Microsoft _ are to be submitted to a federal
court in Washington late Monday afternoon. And the trial, which
recessed in February, is expected to resume late this month or in
early June.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft are
confident they have already presented a strong case in the trial,
which began last October. Still, the government has been prodding
PC makers, including IBM, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard, to come
forward as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   One PC company executive, from Compaq Computer Corp., did appear
as a defense witness.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants a manufacturer as a prosecution witness
partly to strengthen its case further, but also with an eye toward
what happens next, should it win the case.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions the Justice Department and states plan to seek,
according to people close to the case, would be intended to
overhaul the relationship between Microsoft and the PC makers in
ways that restore competition to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps being considered, these people say, are forcing
Microsoft to publish the prices it charges PC makers for Windows
and other software, then prohibiting it from selling Windows at a
lower price to those companies that favor other Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants any sanctions to give PC makers greater
freedom to choose non-Microsoft products like Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the government has had trouble persuading any PC makers
to take the stand for the prosecution, even though PC company
executives have complained about Microsoft's bullying tactics in
depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, in particular, has been urging Theodore
W. Waitt, the chairman of Gateway Inc., and executives of
Hewlett-Packard to come forward. But both companies have been
reluctant, according to people close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The government says PC makers have resisted testifying against
Microsoft in the trial because they fear retaliation. IBM _ the
world's largest computer company and one that is diversified well
beyond PCs _ has less to fear from Microsoft.

NEW YORK CITY RAISING STANDARDS FOR PROVIDER OF JAIL CARE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration plans to tighten its standards for
measuring the performance of the hospital that provides medical
care in the city's jails, a top city official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota, said the city had
drafted a ``new protocol'' that included additional benchmarks to
be used to judge the quality of jail care provided by the hospital,
St. Barnabas in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota declined to discuss details of the new standards, which
are spelled out in a $342 million managed-care contract that St.
Barnabas took over last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, he described them as ``deeper, broader'' than the 35
specific standards St. Barnabas must now meet, which include
ensuring that clinics are adequately staffed and guaranteeing that
any inmate who needs an HIV test gets one.
</P>
<P>
   For eight months, the Manhattan district attorney's office has
been investigating whether St. Barnabas committed criminal
negligence in its care of five inmates who died and dozens of
others who suffered serious medical setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   That inquiry also includes recent allegations by a city official
that his superior pressured him to water down a quarterly
performance report to make it more favorable to St. Barnabas, said
an official involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota defended St. Barnabas' performance in the jails, saying,
``There is no doubt that St. Barnabas is acting in a much better
fashion'' than Montefiore Medical Center of the Bronx, which held
the contract until last year.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the administration had been developing the new
protocol over the last month in conjunction with a number of city
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for St. Barnabas declined to comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The city's jail care contract is being reviewed by City
Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who examines all city contracts and
originally had until next week to approve or reject the deal.
Because of the proposed changes, however, city officials said they
had resubmitted the contract, and the comptroller now has an
additional month to issue a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   David Neustadt, a spokesman for the comptroller, said the
additional time would allow the comptroller's office to ``make sure
that this contract has in it appropriate protocols for monitoring
and the implementation of performance.''

BURBANK TO PRESSURE CALTRANS FOR REASSESSMENT OF EXPENSES FOR 134-5
CONNECTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK _ Connecting the 134 and 5 freeways in all four
directions would cost too much to justify because of Caltrans'
design standards, according to a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But with strong political support for building the ramps to
connect two of the nation's busiest freeways, Burbank city
officials are asking for a second examination and plan to press the
California Department of Transportation to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared to accept it and walk away from the
project,'' said Bob Tague, director of community development for
Burbank. ``We know there is strong political interest in building
the ramps.''
</P>
<P>
   A Daily News story outlined the problems caused by the lack of
connectors between the Golden State Freeway south and the Ventura
Freeway west and the 134 Freeway east and 5 Freeway north.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of those ramps is estimated at $80 million, but the
report says it would cost significantly more if the ramps were
built to Caltrans' specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, and Los Angeles County
Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich have said they support building
the ramps. Wildman has pledged to push for building the ramps as
part of a package of freeway improvements for the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Jess Reynolds, a former Caltrans design supervisor who worked on
the original interchange, said he has read the consultant's report
and thinks Caltrans is coming up with excuses rather than
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caltrans went out of its way to find ways not to do something
rather than finding a way to make it work,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if conventional ramps don't work, Reynolds said there may
be other ways to connect the freeways without forcing traffic on to
city streets. He suggested building new roadways between the sites,
which would take the traffic off residential streets and provide an
shorter and easier connection between the two freeways.
</P>
<P>
   The report by consultants Parsons Brinkerhoff Quade &AMP; Douglas is
scheduled to go before the Burbank City Council on Tuesday. The
cities of Burbank, Glendale and Los Angeles jointly commissioned
the study to determine whether it is possible to build the ramps.
</P>
<P>
   The links were left out of the 134-5 interchange when it was
built in 1967 because planners felt the population would not
generate enough traffic to warrant them.
</P>
<P>
   Now residents and officials say the lack of connections causes
too many problems. Motorists must exit the freeway and travel for a
mile along surface streets in a residential neighborhood to make
the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans officials have said the ramps would require 11 design
exceptions to be built. City officials have estimated that longer,
wider ramps built to Caltrans specifications could cost more than
$120 million and would require demolishing several residences and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said design exceptions are allowed
but not if they sacrifice safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time do we shut out looking at ideas? The answer
is absolutely not,'' Drago said.
</P>
<P>
   Although a study of traffic volumes has not yet been done,
consultants said that preliminary estimates show not enough
motorists would use the connections to justify such an expensive
and potentially disruptive project.
</P>
<P>
   Tague said the city wants to convene a ``peer review'' of the
work by the consultants. That panel would include engineers from
Caltrans, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and area
cities.

FIVE HORSES MAKE UP THE FIELD OF DREAMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: RAC-DERBY)

 By JOE DRAPE

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Three of them bring horses and intriguing
tales to their first Kentucky Derby. Two others have been here
before. One wears a black cowboy hat and needed a judge's ruling to
get his horse into the starting gate. Another survived the
destruction of her Tokyo home during World War II, taught Asian
studies at the University of Kentucky and didn't begin training
horses until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a graduate of D. Wayne Lukas' finishing school, a
Hall of Famer and a budding training star who came within a length
and a half of winning here last year.
</P>
<P>
   At least for two minutes Saturday, Dallas Keen, Akiko Gothard,
Dallas Stewart, Scotty Schulhofer and Elliott Walden will be linked
in the 125th running of the Kentucky Derby. Their horses _ Valhol,
K One King, Kimberlite Pipe, Lemon Drop Kid and Ecton Park _ have
been lumped together in the race's mutuel field.
</P>
<P>
   For horse racing aficionados, that means the Churchill Downs
oddsmaker, Mike Battaglia, determined these five horses were the
least likely to win in a crowded 19-horse field. The horses are
grouped this way out of necessity _ the Churchill tote board can
handle only 14 betting interests. (A 20th horse, Aljabr, was
scratched Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   For casual fans, however, necessity means sort of a price club
bargain opportunity. Think of it as buying in bulk _ a $2 bet on
No. 14 in the program brings five horses for the price of one in
one of the most open fields in Kentucky Derby history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all here because we think we have pretty good horses in
our barns,'' said Stewart, the Lukas protege. ``We all think we got
a good shot to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses don't know the odds,'' Stewart added, shrugging off
the 12-1 odds on his Kimberlite Pipe and the rest of the field
horses. The field had been bet down to 7-1 by Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   History has not been kind to horses that toil in the field _
they have won only three times in 124 years. The most recent
victory came in 1971 when Canonero II _ part of a six-horse field _
circled wide from 15th place into the winner's circle and paid
$19.40 on a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the trainers choose to ignore the low rate of success. And
none more than Keen, the cowboy-hatted Colorado native who has been
a force on the modest Louisiana and Texas circuits. His Valhol
became the most infamous Kentucky Derby entry in recent times when
Arkansas racing officials withheld the $300,000 first-prize money
the gelding earned by winning the Arkansas Derby. The dispute,
which has yet to be resolved, centered on whether Valhol's rider,
Billy Patin, applied an illegal electrical device, or buzzer, to
Valhol in order to goose him to a victory spurt.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, Keen, 41, has been in virtual quarantine at Barn
42 as first uncertainty, then legal maneuvers, swirled about his
horse. On the eve of the deadline for Derby entries, Valhol's
owner, Jim Jackson, won an injunction that forced the Arkansas
racing officials to release the money. The winnings got Valhol in
the race but did not quiet the bitter words on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I saw what they saw, and I owned that horse, I'd be
embarrassed to show up at the Derby,'' said the trainer Randy
Morse, whose colt, Torrid Sand, failed to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   Now Keen, who has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing, has only
one thing to comfort him: his horse. ``This is a nice colt,'' he
said. ``The first time he came to this track, it was like he'd been
here every day. He's got some cool, and I got to believe in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stabled around the corner from Valhol is Gothard's colt, K One
King. Gothard, 68, is the only female trainer with a horse in the
race. She came to the United States in 1957, earned a psychology
degree and joined the faculty at the University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1970, Gothard was seduced by the Bluegrass country's
major industry and began buying and selling horses. She picked up a
nice colt named John Henry for $1,500, had him gelded and sold him
for $25,000. It was shrewd trading even though John Henry went on
to win more than $5 million, barreled into racing legend and was
twice named Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In K One King, Gothard may or may not have her first John Henry
as a trainer. The runner-up in the GalleryFurniture.com Stakes is
an improving colt who has been impressive in workouts here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing the horse to the Derby is as difficult as writing a
dissertation,'' said Gothard, whose ever-present smile has made her
one of the most welcome sights on the backside. ``It's made me more
philosophical. What you put in life _ good and bad _ is what you
take from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the other first-time Derby trainer, learned his trade
from Lukas, the latest Hall of Fame inductee. Stewart was an
exercise rider for the Lukas-trained filly Winning Colors, who won
the Derby in 1988. He was an assistant trainer when the stable won
the Derby in 1995 and '96 with Thunder Gulch and Grindstone.
</P>
<P>
   Like his mentor, Stewart, 39, is among the first at the barn and
the last to leave, and the hard work has transformed Kimberlite
Pipe from a $11,000 yearling to the Louisiana Derby winner and a
Triple Crown hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a lot of rope,'' Stewart said of Lukas. ``He wasn't
always breathing down on me. He gave me an example and taught me a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the field entries are two trainers who have had
their hearts broken here. Last year, Walden's Victory Gallop ran
second to Real Quiet in the Derby and again in the Preakness before
catching him at the wire in the Belmont to thwart his rival's
Triple Crown bid.
</P>
<P>
   Walden also trains the current third choice, Menifee, but his
Ecton Park is part of the field. Ecton Park, a Forty Niner colt,
was favored in the Arkansas Derby but failed to get a grip on the
track and finished fourth. But after Ecton Park donned blinkers
early this week and blitzed a workout in 1 minute 2 seconds over
five furlongs, Walden perked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stubbed his toe a little bit in Arkansas,'' Walden
conceded. ``I like them to have a little confidence going into the
biggest race of their life. He was super today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left for Schulhofer, the lone Hall of Famer among the
trainers of the mutuel field horses, to inject reality into the
current situation.
</P>
<P>
   He came here in 1987 with the Florida Derby winner,
Cryptoclearance, and ran fourth. In Lemon Drop Kid, he has a
spectacularly bred horse that won more than $222,000 last year and
is suited for the one-and-a-quarter-mile distance here. But the
Kingmambo colt has been a disappointment as a 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good horse who is as ready as he's ever going to be,''
Schulhofer said in his lilting South Carolina drawl. ``The question
is: Is he good enough and is he lucky enough?''
</P>
<P>
   The odds may be long that any of the field horses prove either
good or lucky. But if one of them somehow earns the blanket of
roses, the odds are 100 percent you'll hear a good story. &QL;

SALT LAKE CITY'S OLYMPIC SPIRIT FOUND IN ATLANTA

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first batch of documents made public Friday
regarding the 1996 Summer Olympics revealed that Atlanta bid
officials behaved in the same fawning manner that Salt Lake City
officials did in trying to lure the votes of members of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There was also evidence that Juan Antonio Samaranch, the
embattled president of the IOC, may have violated the rules
governing visits to bid cities by bringing an excessive number of
guests to Atlanta in the spring of 1990, five months before Atlanta
secured the Summer Games.

released, however, revealed none of the serious improprieties that
scandalized Salt Lake City's bid, such as scholarship programs,
cash payments and exorbitant medical treatment that exceeded $1
million. Ten IOC delegates have resigned or been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials have acknowledged violating the $150 limit on
gifts to IOC members, and it has previously been reported that
Billy Payne, the chief Atlanta organizer, wrote a memo in 1990
considering scholarships, medical treatment and free plane tickets
as incentives.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta officials have continued to deny offering the lavish
personal and financial favors that disgraced Salt Lake City's
efforts to win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The documents _ the first of 4,000 boxes _ were released Friday
under pressure by the Georgia attorney general to make them public.
</P>
<P>
   The documents portrayed the metamorphosis of Atlanta bidders
from naive beginners, turned down by Samaranch when they invited
him to dinner, to pragmatists who understood the sense of
entitlement to which visiting IOC members were accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta officials went to the 1988 Summer Olympics in
Seoul, South Korea, to begin their schmoozing with IOC delegates,
they first were given etiquette lessons on how to refrain from
offending their Korean hosts. Don't talk about Japan, communism or
the wife of your host, the bidders were told. Never leave the
concave side of the soup spoon facing down.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in April 1990, Atlanta bidders knew exactly how
to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   They held a gathering called Springtime in Atlanta for 15 or 20
visiting IOC delegates and their guests. This was the last big push
to sway the members, who voted on Sept. 18, 1990. The visiting
delegates were flown by private jets on a side trip to Savannah,
Ga., the proposed site of Olympic sailing, for a ride on Steve
Forbes' yacht, the Highlander.
</P>
<P>
   Each jet was greeted upon arrival in Savannah by three
trumpeters on the red-carpeted tarmac, and the delegates were
ferried in a police-escorted motorcade to their hotel. Drivers of
the delegates were instructed not to speak unless they were asked a
specific question.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brennan, a spokesman for the bid committee, suggested in a
memo to Payne that reporters' access be restricted on the boat trip
because there would be drinking and the presence of the news media
might inhibit the IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Teresa Samaranch, wife of the IOC president, brought along
two friends from Spain on the trip to Georgia, according to the
documents. It was not clear whether Atlanta officials paid for
their air fare or hotel accommodations, but if they did, it would
have violated IOC rules, which permit each delegate to bring one
guest per trip.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has previously said he was not restricted by the
gift-giving rules because he did not vote on which cities are host
to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials appeared eager to grant the wishes of the IOC.
They arranged a tour of the White House for Wu Ching-Kuo of Taiwan,
paid for Francis Nyangweso of Uganda to connect through London so
he could visit an ailing cousin and arranged a trip to the Masters
golf tournament in Augusta, Ga., for Matts Carlgren of Sweden, who
charged the bid committee $11,120.10 for first-class air fare from
Scandinavia for himself and his wife.

MILITARY SATELLITE STRANDED IN A LOPSIDED ORBIT
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ A giant rocket failed to carry a communications
satellite into its intended orbit after launching from Florida
Friday, dealing the Air Force a third straight setback in a space
mission that cost well over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a very disappointing day,'' Brig. Gen.
Randy Starbuck told an early-evening news conference at Cape
Canaveral, confirming that a Titan 4B rocket costing $433 million
had failed to lift a satellite worth $800 million into proper
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of disappointment was heightened by the apparently
successful beginning of the mission. The 20-story rocket had lifted
off from the cape at 12:30 p.m. with the 10,000-pound Milstar
communications satellite in its nose cone. Mission planners dared
to be optimistic as the solid-fuel main booster rocket burned like
a giant Roman candle, carrying the satellite toward an orbit some
22,000 miles above the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But an hour later, Air Force officials at the cape canceled a
scheduled news briefing about the mission. Friday evening, Starbuck
confirmed rumors that the upper-stage liquid-fuel booster had
failed to lift the satellite into its orbit over the equator once
the solid-fuel first stage had done its job by placing the
satellite in an initial orbit 3,000 miles up.
</P>
<P>
   The lost satellite was to have been used for military
communications around the globe, ``phones, computers, just about
anything,'' in the words of a Defense Department official who said
he was familiar with the mission. Both the satellite and the Titan
rocket were manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's failure was the third consecutive disappointment for
the Air Force. Last Aug. 12, a Titan 4 carrying a spy satellite
blew up shortly after launching from Cape Canaveral at a cost of
well over $1 billion. And on April 9, a $250 million
missile-warning satellite was accidentally stranded in the wrong
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Starbuck said the failure of the upper-stage Centaur liquid-fuel
burner had left the satellite launched Friday stranded in a
lopsided orbit thousands of miles below its intended 22,300-mile
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   He said that mission controllers would try to use thrusters and
whatever liquid fuel remains to get the satellite into its proper
orbit, but that they were uncertain of their chances.
</P>
<P>
   The first Milstar satellite was placed in a 22,300-mile orbit in
1994 and a second in 1995. The Pentagon had planned to place six in
orbit altogether to provide secure and jam-proof communications
between commanders and troops.
</P>
<P>
   Starbuck, who is in charge of the Air Force's Cape Canaveral
launch site as commander of the 45th Space Wing, said it was too
early to speculate on causes for Friday's mishap. ``When we have
three failures in a row of any system,'' he told the press
conference, ``something is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said Friday's failure, if it cannot be
corrected, would not hamper the military's communications or the
nation's security.

EDITORIAL: RIGHT PLANT, WRONG PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 1: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US Generating Co. has asked New York state for permission to
build a gas-fired power plant near the western shore of the Hudson
River in Green County, an area of breathtaking natural beauty 120
miles north of New York City. From an engineering standpoint, it is
a good place to put a power plant. From any other perspective _
esthetic, environmental, historical _ it is the wrong place. Gov.
George Pataki should deny the application. Failure to do so would
set a poor precedent and tarnish his reputation for environmental
stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be an easy decision, as even conservationists
concede. In this new age of utility deregulation, aimed at
encouraging competition in an industry long dominated by local
monopolies, out-of-state power companies are romancing New Yorkers
with promises of more efficient plants and lower electricity bills.
Like any smart governor, Pataki wants these benefits.
</P>
<P>
   US Generating has a commendable environmental record, and the
gas-fired plant it proposes would emit far fewer of the pollutants
that cause smog or contribute to global warming than New York's
older oil and coal-fired plants. In terms of costs, the site itself
makes perfect sense. It lies at the confluence of the Iroquois
natural gas pipeline, power lines that can carry electricity to New
York City and New England, and the river, which can provide water
for the plant's cooling systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the site is also directly across from Olana, the
ornate 19th century Moorish mansion built by Frederic E. Church, a
central figure in the Hudson River School of painting. One expert
has called Olana ``the most aesthetically and historically
significant artists' residence in the United States'' _ significant
not just for the house itself but for the landscape that inspired
some of the artist's noblest works. The plant and its plumes of
steam would disfigure that view, not only from Olana but from
nearby parks and other historic homes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also worry that the plant will harm fragile fish
populations. The company insists that the plant will actually save
fish by displacing older power plants along the river that suck in
much more water. But the main fear is that the plant will corrupt
an irreplaceable piece of visual history, an outcome the governor
cannot want. As he himself noted in his January State of the State
Message, ``preserving the historic places that reunite us with our
rich and glorious past is an obligation we must fulfill to the
children of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The final decision is largely controlled by Pataki, who
appointed the six members of the siting board that will rule on the
application, probably in October. The board is operating on a fast
track mandated by a flawed 1992 law designed to encourage
``one-stop shopping'' by utility companies. This law does not
require companies to offer alternative sites, thus requiring an
up-or-down vote on the company's preferred site.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the plant have taken hope from a ruling by the
federal Environmental Protection Agency that the siting board has
no power to issue the permits for discharges into the air and water
that the company will need to begin operation. But that problem
could be fixed by new legislation in Albany. The only certain way
to stop the plant is for the board to vote it down. This is an
important test. US Generating's facility would be New York's first
new power plant in 20 years. There will be more to come. It is
essential to establish the principle that the environment has a
claim in these decisions.

EDITORIAL: FLORIDA'S SCHOOL VOUCHER SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 1: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week the Florida Legislature approved the first statewide
school voucher plan in the nation, allowing some students to attend
private and parochial schools at public expense. Gov. Jeb Bush made
vouchers a centerpiece of his political agenda. But the Florida
plan, though likely to become a template for other
Republican-controlled legislatures, has the same profound
weaknesses of voucher schemes operating in places like Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers have political appeal because they are tickets out of
bad schools for some children, and they give politicians an easy
way out of having to deal with costly, comprehensive school reform.
Vouchers do nothing to improve education for those remaining in the
public system. In theory, they are supposed to cause bad schools to
reform themselves by threatening them with market competition. In
fact, they make reform harder, if not impossible, by siphoning away
meager resources and skimming off good students, leaving the most
troubled children and the most apathetic families behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida proposal would have that effect on a statewide
level. It will assign a grade from A to F to every public school
based largely on rigorous new standardized tests. Schools that show
improvement will get rewards for achievement. Students at schools
that fail for two years out of four will be offered vouchers worth
about $4,000 to attend any public or private school that will take
the voucher. The program will start out small, since only four
schools are currently designated ``failing,'' but the number could
go as high as 170 schools in two years as the state raises
achievement standards.
</P>
<P>
   State officials guess that anywhere from 10 percent to 30
percent of students in failing schools _ nearly all in areas of
high poverty _ would take up the voucher offer. An exodus of
thousands of students could drain tens of millions of dollars from
local school districts, leaving distressed institutions even worse
off. Yet the Florida plan does little to direct new resources to
cure the failures.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that vouchers are a convenient diversion from the
arduous and expensive task of true reform. Educational leaders know
a good deal about what works. Attracting qualified, experienced
teachers to failing schools is a crucial step. Likewise, longer
school days, extended school years, smaller class sizes and access
to quality preschool programs can improve achievement among
disadvantaged children. Vouchers do none of these things. Instead,
they can undermine what little hope is left in embattled schools,
leaving those least able to demand change in the public system.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida plan is sure to come under constitutional challenge
for sending public money into parochial schools. That issue will
have to be addressed by the courts. Meanwhile, in two years Florida
will have scores of schools that have been officially labeled
failures by the state. Some children will be able to opt out. But
the great majority will be left in classrooms that offer them even
less of a chance at a decent education.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 1: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Long, the Internal Revenue Service agent who nearly
lost her job two weeks ago after publicly blowing the whistle on
abuses at the agency, was rescued at the last minute by the
intervention of an influential U.S. senator. But the fact that her
employers had no inhibitions about harassing her is clear evidence
that the laws protecting whistle-blowers need to be strengthened.
As they stand, these laws merely invite the kind of retaliation
that Mrs. Long endured.
</P>
<P>
   A career tax auditor, Mrs. Long was the star witness at Senate
Finance Committee hearings convened in 1997 by William Roth of
Delaware to investigate complaints against the IRS. She was the
only IRS witness who did not sit behind a curtain and use a
voice-distortion device to hide her identity. She accused the
agency of preying on weaker taxpayers and ignoring cheating by
those with the resources to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   She has since said that she was subjected to petty harassments
from the moment she arrived back at her district office in Houston.
Then, on April 15 of this year, she was given what amounted to a
termination notice, at which point Roth intervened with the IRS
commissioner and saved her job _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Had he not intervened, Mrs. Long's only hope of vindication
would have been the remedies provided by the Civil Service Reform
Act of 1978 and the Whistle-Blower Protection Act of 1989. These
two statutes prescribe a tortuous and uncertain appeals process
that in theory guarantees a whistle-blower free speech without fear
of retaliation, but in practice is an exercise in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent improvements, only a handful of federal
employees, out of some 1,500 who appealed in the last four years,
have prevailed in rulings issued by the government's administrative
tribunal, the Merit System Protection Board. Overwhelmingly, the
rest of the cases were screened out on technical grounds or were
settled informally with token relief.
</P>
<P>
   A few prominent whistle-blowers have won redemption outside the
system. Frederic Whitehurst, the chemist who was dismissed after
disclosing sloppiness and possible dishonesty in the Federal Bureau
of Investigation's crime laboratory, won a sizable cash settlement
because he had a first-class attorney who mounted an artful public
relations campaign. Ernest Fitzgerald, the Pentagon employee who
disclosed massive cost overruns, survived because he was almost
inhumanly persistent and because his cause, like Mrs. Long's,
attracted allies in high places. But the prominence of an issue
does not guarantee survival for the employee who discloses it.
Notra Trulock, the senior intelligence official at the Energy
Department who tried to alert his superiors to Chinese espionage at
a government weapons laboratory, has since been demoted.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, has been seeking ways to
strengthen the 1989 law with the help of the government
Accountability Project, a Washington advocacy group that assists
whistle-blowers. One obvious improvement would be to give
whistle-blowers the option to press their claims in the federal
courts, where their cases could be decided by a jury. To guard
against clogging the system with frivolous litigation, the cases
would first be reviewed by a nongovernment administrative panel.
But the point is to give whistle-blowers an avenue of appeal
outside the closed loop in which they are now trapped.
</P>
<P>
   A reform bill along these lines passed the House in 1994 but
died in the Senate. With Mrs. Long's case fresh in mind, the time
has come for both Houses to re-examine the issue.

`NEW WORLD SYMPHONIES': WHAT EUROPE OWES TO AMERICAN MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 BY EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American art music _ commonly called ``classical'' _ is in the
midst of an identity crisis. This is nothing new; such crises
almost define American music. Except that recently the autumnal
atmosphere has led to an unusual amount of self-scrutiny, including
a close examination of American music's origins, in varied studies
of 19th-century American musical life.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jack Sullivan, a professor of English and the chairman of
American Studies at Rider College, takes the subject in another
direction in his new book, ``New World Symphonies: How American
Culture Changed European Music.'' One of the recurrent
recriminations of American concert music is that it is idolatrously
beholden to Europe, which gave America its instruments, its
masterpieces and its concert halls. This is why, the argument goes,
concert music has become so marginal: the true musical life of the
United States is found outside the concert hall, in jazz, rock and
other popular musics.
</P>
<P>
   This argument is deeply flawed _ if applied to museums, novels,
political ideas and other European imports, it would lead to
absurdities _ but Sullivan gives it a piquant twist, showing not
how much American art music owes to Europe, but how much European
art music owes to America. Much of the detail is familiar: the
appeal of jazz to Stravinsky, the influence of black spirituals and
Indian chants on Anton Dvorak, the lure of Walt Whitman to Ralph
Vaughan Williams. But when the details are put together, the
portrait is startling. The spirit of America is inscribed in
20th-century European modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the attraction was the sense that in America almost
anything was possible. The Czech composer Dvorak, who wrote his
``New World'' Symphony in New York while reading Longfellow's
poetry, celebrated the almost naive ``eagerness'' of Americans. In
contrast, Europe seemed stultified, tradition-bound. The most
popular opera of Weimar, Germany, ``Jonny Spielt Auf,'' by Ernst
Krenek (1900-1991), tells of a black American jazz violinist who
single-handedly undermines the ponderous pieties of European
culture.
</P>
<P>
   America almost took on an avant-garde character. The Australian
composer Percy Grainger (1882-1961) thought European music was
``hopelessly sunk in conventionality, sham intellectuality and
parochialism'' and longed for an ``American Messiah.'' The French
composer, Edgard Varese (1883-1965), who celebrated ``new worlds''
in his raucously experimental ``Am/erique'' (which later inspired
Frank Zappa), called for an American music that would reject any
``mummified European formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Even America's darker sides attracted the attention of European
composers. Puccini's American characters in ``Girl of the Golden
West'' and ``Madame Butterfly'' reveal something tragic in the
promise of American liberation. Sullivan's most fascinating example
is how deeply French impressionist composers like Debussy and Ravel
were affected by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe's characters may be steeped
in mummified traditions, but they are severed from that old world,
like envious Americans cut off from their origins, trapped in
isolation and horror. Composers who also felt cut off from their
European past set Poe's texts to music, adopted his esthetic and
emulated his refined despair.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, America's violations of innocence often got as much
attention as its innocence, particularly in its treatment of race.
The English composer Frederick Delius (1862-1934) was haunted by
his experiences living in Florida in 1884. His opera ``Koanga'' _
almost never seen or played _ is the tale of an African voodoo
prince whose curse brings a plague down on the Southern plantation
where he is enslaved. An anthology of black American poetry,
``Afrika Singt'' (``Africa Sings,'' published in the 1920s in
Germany, influencing such composers as Alexander Zemlinsky
(1871-1942) and Wilhelm Grosz (1894-1939); if the slaves found a
resonant mythology in the Biblical stories, these Jewish composers
found similar resonance in the poetry of enslavement.
</P>
<P>
   This is rich and heady stuff, full of oddities pointed out by
Sullivan: ``Koanga'' was a ``Louisiana voodoo opera written by a
native of Yorkshire living in Paris as a way of reinvoking
Florida'' ); Zemlinsky was ``a Viennese Jew setting black American
poems translated into German''; Samuel Taylor-Coleridge's
``Hiawatha'' was ``a setting by an Anglo Negro of a white
American's poem about Indians.'' There is something
phantasmagorical about these relationships with their shifting
identities, rebellions and yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Sullivan's story is not always felicitously told.
And there are many strands he does not touch on that would have
shown just how wide-ranging the America-obsession was and how
connected it was with Europe's disgust with its own past, and its
own panting desires for new beginnings. Some attention to the
American experimental avant-garde, which was often more celebrated
for its iconoclasm in Europe than in the United States, might have
helped reveal the issues at stake.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan's descriptions are sure and telling. And his
accumulating anecdotes and portraits end up suggesting something
about our current predicament: the utopian prescriptions of
Europeans who idealized American possibility and derided their own
heritage have now evolved into the prescriptions of Americans who
idealize American popular culture and deride European influence. On
both sides of the Atlantic, the celebration of American promise has
hidden a cornucopia of discontents.
