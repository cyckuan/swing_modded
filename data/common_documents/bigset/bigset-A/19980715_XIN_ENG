<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending Goes Up Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer spending
showed signs of slowing in June with retail sales edging up just
0.1 percent, the Commerce Department reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase, the smallest since a similar 0.1 percent
advance in March, left retail sales at 225.7 billion U.S. dollars
last month. The June gain followed a much more robust 1.2 percent
surge in sales in May, the biggest increase in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown, which was in line with expectations, reflected
outright declines in sales at department stores, hardware stores
and service stations and only a small 0.1 percent increase in
sales by auto dealers.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is closely monitored by economists since it
accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity. The overall
economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, soared ahead
at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first three months of the
year, but most analysts believe growth is now in the process of
slowing dramatically, to perhaps an annual rate of about 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The slower growth is mainly blamed for the impact of the Asian
financial crisis, which is cutting sharply into the ability of
this country's manufacturers and farmers to sell to Asian
countries, who buy one-third of all American exports.
</P>
<P>
The weaker growth could mean a rise in the unemployment rate,
which dropped to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in April and May. In
June, unemployment rose slightly to 4.5 percent. Many economists
are predicting that the slowing economy will nudge the jobless
rate up to close to 5 percent by year's end.
</P>
<P>
Today's report on retail sales showed that demand at auto
showrooms inched up 0.1 percent last month, far below the 2.4
percent jump in sales recorded in May.
</P>
<P>
Sales at department stores fell by 0.3 percent in June
following a 0.6 percent increase in May. Sales were also down at
hardware and building supply centers, dipping 0.2 percent while
sales at furniture stores dropped by 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Grocery stores recorded a small 0.1 percent rise in June sales
and demand at restaurants was up an even stronger 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales at gasoline stations were down 0.1 percent and specialty
clothing stores saw a 0.4 percent dip in demand.
</P>
<P>
Excluding auto sales, retail sales rose by 0.1 percent last
month following a gain of 0.9 percent in May.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Flee Fresh Angola Conflict: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people have fled fresh
fighting in Angola between government and rebel forces, said the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 people had fled to the neighboring Democratic
Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire, in the past week and had
taken shelter in the southeastern Kisenge area where there were
now 22,000 refugees, said UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski.
</P>
<P>
"There is a continuing outflow of people as a result of
fighting between UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola) and government forces," Janowski said at a press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and the opposition UNITA fought a
20-year civil war in the southern African country before a 1994
peace agreement which has since failed. The conflict has left an
estimated 150,000 Angolans internally-displaced.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday strongly
urged Nicaragua and the other countries to stop immediately their
illegal activities of interfering in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a letter on July 8, 1998 to the Secretary-General of the
United Nations, Qin Huasun, Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, said, Nicaragua and a very small number of
other countries once again put the so-called "Taiwan's
representation at the United Nations" before the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said the brazen attempt was to challenge the
General Assembly Resolution 2758, create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" at the United Nations and split a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed such illegal activities have severely contravened
the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
seriously encroached upon China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and grossly interfered in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador strongly urged Nicaragua and the other countries
to stop immediately their illegal activities of interfering in
China's internal affairs and obstructing China's peaceful
reunification.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Examines Designs Works For National Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal People's
Government has received 44 designs for the National Grand Theater
and will plan to solicit opinions from the general public.
</P>
<P>
Wang Siquan, director of the trans-century project, said the
designs were submitted by 36 architectural institutes, including
20 foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
Their designs will be exhibited in the Museum of Chinese
Revolution between July 19-27. An 11-member appraisal committee
headed by Wu Liangyong will examine the designs and select the
final three candidates.
</P>
<P>
Wu is a professor at Qinghua University and academician with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Wan said the designs must meet the following three requirements
-- modern architectural style and interior decoration, appease the
tastes of the general public in China, and blend with nearby
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
The theater complex, located on the west side of the Great Hall
of the People at downtown Beijing's Tiananmen Square, will include
four major facilities -- the opera theater, concert hall, drama
theater and performance center. The project will be completed at
estimated cost of 3.54 billion yuan (about 420 million US dollars).

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan has been an
inalienable part of China since ancient times, Qin Huasun, Chinese
Ambassador to the United Nations, stressed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, Qin said the 1943
Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation once again
reaffirmed China's sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said to date, 162 countries have established
diplomatic relations with China, and they all recognize that there
is but one China in the world, that the Government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legal Government representing China
in its entirety and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Qin said over the past 50 years or so since the founding of the
People's Republic of China, great changes have taken place both in
the world situation and in China, including Taiwan, in the social,
economic, political and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
Qin noted that however, no such change can alter the fact that
Taiwan is a province of China and that China exercises sovereignty
over Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Israel Defies U.N. Statement On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel Tuesday showed defiance
to a United Nations Security Council presidential statement which
urged it to abandon its controversial plan to expand Jerusalem,
while the Palestinians welcomed it.
</P>
<P>
"We regrets the Presidential Statement adopted yesterday by
the United Nations Security Council," the Israeli Foreign Ministry
said. "Israel has already clarified that the Cabinet decision of
June 21, 1998 does not contradict the agreements between Israel
and the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian National Authority Cabinet Secretary
Ahmad Abdel Rahman told the Voice of Palestine radio that the
Security Council presidential statement is a moral and political
condemnation to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council issued the presidential statement later
Monday, deeming the Israeli plan a "serious and damaging
development" which will jeopardize the Israeli-Palestinian talks
on the final status of the city. It called on Israel not to
proceed with it.
</P>
<P>
Israel has come under fire from the international community by
approving the controversial plan last month to expand Jerusalem to
include Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Palestinians, who
want Jerusalem as capital of their future state, said this will
lead to annexation of occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
One of the latest waves of criticism came from a three-way
summit in Cairo early this month held by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and
Jordan's King Hussein. The three leaders warned Israel against
"play fire" on the Jerusalem issue and asserted their "absolute
rejection" of the expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council presidential statement, however, was a
result of compromise in the 15-member council, which began debate
on the plan early this month. The United States and Britain have
led a diplomatic drive to prevent the Security Council from voting
on a resolution condemning Israel's plan as pressed for by Arab
states, saying such a resolution would make it more difficult to
get the stalled peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement requires the agreement of every
member of the council, but it does not carry the same weight as a
vote, since it is non-binding.
</P>
<P>
Rahman expressed the hope that the Security Council's position
will oblige Israel to halt settlements and expansion policy which
violates the signed agreements and endangers the entire peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the U.N. statement and its condemnation lacks
the mechanism of forcing Israel to drop its Jerusalem expansion
scheme.
</P>
<P>
In its reaction, the Israeli Foreign Ministry reiterated that
the plan "is municipal in nature," saying that it "is intended to
extend Jerusalem's municipal jurisdiction only to areas west of
the city."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council presidential statement "ignores these
facts," it argued.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will continue to work for the development and
prosperity of Jerusalem, for the benefit of all its inhabitants,"
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accords, the fate of Jerusalem can only be
determined in the permanent peace talks and before that, no side
should take unilateral actions to change its status, demographic
composition or character.

<P>
YICHANG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The suspension of navigation in
the Yangtze Three Gorges area continues due to surging flood
waters.
</P>
<P>
However, various forms of transportation has been used to
disperse the over 46,000 passengers stranded over the past three
days.
</P>
<P>
Both the temporary lock and water diversion channel at the

Yichang transportation departments provided over 1,800 buses
to transport stranded passengers to new railway, air, ship and bus
connections during the period.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Its Positions on So-Called Taiwan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, Ambassador Qin said
that in 1971, the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth session
adopted by an overwhelming majority the historically significant
resolution 2758.
</P>
<P>
Qin said in the resolution, the Assembly clearly and
unequivocally recognized "that the representatives of the
Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful
representatives of China to the United Nations and that the
People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent
representatives of the Security Council" and decided to restore
all rights of the People's Republic of China at the United
Nations and to expel the representatives of Taiwan "from the
place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in
all the organizations related to it."
</P>
<P>
Qin noted that in the resolution, the Assembly reaffirmed the
"one China" principle in an exact and holistic manner, and it
decided resolutely to restore the lawful seat of the People's
Republic of China at the United Nations and in the same resolute
manner to expel the Taiwan authorities from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Qin said these are two indivisible aspects of one question.
Without expelling the Taiwan authorities from the United
Nations, it would nave been impossible to resolve properly
China's representation at the United Nations. Only in this way
could the resolution give, as it did perfectly, concrete
expression to the "one China"principle.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said it has settled once and for all and in a
just manner the question of China's representation at the United
Nations, and it has conformed to the historical trend and
reflected the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Qin said it is of great historical and practical significance
and has won the support of an overwhelming majority of Member
States of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador noted that however, Nicaragua and a small
number of other countries are now moving to dissect resolution
2758 in an attempt to strip the resolution of its essence,
negate the "one China" principle and create "two Chinas" and
"one China, one Taiwan," which is unacceptable to China and the
overwhelming majority of U.N. Member States.

LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Three young brothers killed in an
arson attack on their home in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, were
laid to rest in a single, simple grave on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
BBC reports said the funeral was held at the Roman Catholic
Church of Our Lady in Ballymoney, but mourners came from both
Protestant and Catholic communities who packed the church to bid
farewell to the three young boys from 11 to nine -- Richard, Mark
and Jason Quinn.
</P>
<P>
The children's grief-stricken mother, Christine, sat
expressionless in front of the small white coffins with her
surviving son Lee, 12.
</P>
<P>
Although Christine is a Catholic, she sent her sons to a
Protestant school and has a Protestant partner.
</P>
<P>
In his sermon Father Peter Forde told the congregation that the
deaths of the three boys had provoked a "great outpouring of
sorrow and sympathy" from all sides of the political and religious
divide across Northern Ireland and the world.
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested on Monday by police investigating the
arson attack and were questioned over the brutal murder case.
</P>
<P>
The boys' deaths in their home followed a week of sporadic
clashes in the town of Portadown between security forces and
Protestant Orangemen.
</P>

The Orangemen are continuing to protest at Drumcree against a
ban on their march along a route which includes a Catholic

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Security Council on the Side of the Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Tuesday described a presidential statement issued by the United
Nations Security Council criticizing Israel's Jerusalem expansion
as a rare support for "the side of the right."
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the Security Council supports the side of
the right. The U.S. delegate to the Council did the same until a
strong-worded statement was passed," said Mubarak after the
graduation ceremony of the 49th Naval cadet batch held in the
Mediterranean city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council approved Monday night a presidential
statement that calls Israel's June 21 decision "a serious and
damaging development." It also calls on Israel not to proceed with
the expansion of Jerusalem's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the statement, Mubarak said that it was issued at a
time "Israel is defying the world community while nobody even
utters one word."
</P>
<P>
He expressed deep regret over the impasse in the Mideast peace
march over the past 16 months, and held Israel responsible for
sabotaging the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Israel should be aware of the reflections of the current grave
situation on the whole region and on its people," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council statement also calls on the parties
directly concerned with the Mideast peace to negotiate and not to
change the features of the occupied Palestinian territories,
including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak noted that there are still "some people who take more
than their rights, while others lose their own rights with nobody
helping them retrieve their rights," referring to Israel and the
Palestinians respectively.
</P>
<P>
He expressed apprehensions that this state of affairs will
easily damage the credibility of the world major powers and the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"This could also lead to an imbalance worldwide, coupled with a
state of confusion prevailing, a matter which is extremely
dangerous for mankind in general," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council statement is a compromise of its 15
members. The Arab countries had demanded a resolution condemning
Israel, but the U.S. and Britain launched a diplomatic drive to
prevent from happening.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-sponsored draft resolution was softened to a
presidential statement after repeated U.S. objections and intense
negotiations between Washington and Arab capitals.
</P>
<P>
Such a statement does not carry the weight of international law
that a resolution does and is non-binding.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the capital of China,
recorded a 12.8 percent increase in foreign trade during the first
six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by Beijing Customs show that the city's
Jan-June import and export volume hit 2.91 billion US dollars, up
12.8 percent, with its export volume reaching 1.37 billion US

percent in the first half of the year as compared with the same
period of last year, and its export to Japan and the Republic of
Korea, which has decreased.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing's exports to the Untied States grew by 19

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Police Shoot Dead Two Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Two militants wanted in a slew of
fatal terrorist attacks since 1993 were killed Tuesday during an
hour-long gun battle with the police in southern Egypt, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the Interior Ministry, the
shoot-out in Abu Qirqas, Minya, about 220 kilometers south of
Cairo, left the two assailants killed and a police conscript
wounded. A third attacker managed to escape and is being pursued
by the police.
</P>
<P>
The three had planned to attack a police patrol in the southern
province, a hotbed of extremist violence. Acting upon a tip-off,
security forces laid siege at their hideout.
</P>
<P>
Police found with the two terrorists two automatic rifles and
two bags containing clothes, food and some documents.
</P>
<P>
The ministry identified them as Yehia Ali Sediq, and Hamza
Abdel Hamid Abdul Moeez, belonging to the military wing of the
outlawed Gamaa Islamia, or the Islamic Group, which is blamed for
most of the violence since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sediq had been involved since 1993 in 21 terror acts which left
15 people killed and eight others and 11 policemen wounded, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Abdul Moeez was a leading fugitive terrorist
who had been involved in 20 acts of terror since 1993 which killed
24 civilians and seven policemen, and injured nine civilians and
five policemen.
</P>
<P>
The clash was the first in Egypt since March when security
forces killed a suspected Muslim militant in the south.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 people have been killed in the past six years
since a violent insurgence was launched by Islamic militants
seeking to overthrow Egypt's secular government.

<HEADLINE> AL Welcomes Security Council Statement on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Tuesday
welcomed the United Nations Security Council statement calling on
Israel not to proceed with its decision to expand Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The statement marks a strong start to urge Israel to stop all
arbitrary and expansionist measures in Jerusalem, and implement
the Oslo accord and all Security Council resolutions of relevance
to the peace process," said Saeed Kamal, the AL assistant
secretary-general for Palestine affairs.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement passed by the 15-member Security
Council Monday night deemed the Israeli plan on broaden Jerusalem,
the most sensitive issue in the peace process, a "serious and
damaging development."
</P>
<P>
It also calls on the parties directly concerned with the
Mideast to negotiate and not to change the features of the
occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the Middle East News Agency, Kamal slammed the
Israeli rejection of the Security Council's statement, describing
the reaction as "a dangerous precedent."
</P>
<P>
He said this should prompt the Security Council into holding an
emergency meeting to take a substitute resolution for the
statement issued Monday night to "lend it a legal status."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain had tried to prevent the Security Council
from voting on an Arab-sponsored resolution condemning Israel, and
the 15 council members finally compromised on a watered-down
presidential statement which is non-binding and does not carry the
same weight as a resolution.
</P>
<P>
Kamal also demanded an international committee to be set up to
be permanently posted to Jerusalem to monitor Israel's illegal
measures and compile a report to be referred to the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is closely watching the developments in the
occupied territories as well as the whole peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel has come under under fire from the international
community by approving the controversial plan last month to
extend Jerusalem's boundaries to include Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
It was regard as another Israeli attempt to breach the Oslo
accord, under which the fate of the city can only be determined in
the permanent peace talks and no side should take unilateral
actions to change its status, demographic composition or character
in advance.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Calls for Unity among Zimbabweans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Tuesday called on the Zimbabwean people to unite to surmount
economic difficulty the country is facing.
</P>
<P>
Opening the fourth session of the fourth parliament of
Zimbabwe, Mugabe said "The government has noted with dismay that
our urban and rural folk are suffering."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's new economic reform program which has begun
recently sought the urgent restoration of macro-economic
stability in order to stimulate growth, greater investment
activity, employment creation and the equitable distribution of
incomes across various sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The tasks ahead of us require all of us commitment, energy
and dedication. Equally importantly, they require an unshakeable
unity of purpose and action," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the constitution issue, Mugabe hoped that this parliament
would be able to begin in earnest during this session to debate
this matter thoroughly so that the final agreed constitution will
truly reflect the wishes of the people.
</P>
<P>
Referring to land reform, the president said his government,
in consultation with the European Union and other donors, would
convene a land donor conference in Harare in September to
mobilize resources in support of the land policy program already
underway.
</P>
<P>
"While we welcome the financial and material support from the
donor community, we should always primarily rely on the strength
and resourcefulness of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, said Mugabe, is making efforts to promote African
sub-regional and continental integration in pursuit of goals of
the Organization of African Unity and groupings such as the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to which it
belonged.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, in pursuit of our vital interest we remain active
on such fora as the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement and
the Commonwealth," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Delivery of Russian Missiles in August Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said Tuesday the Russian-made S-300 air defense system would not
be delivered to Cyprus by August, confirming a reported
postponement.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a press conference at the end of his
four-day visit to Moscow, where he held talks with his Russian
counterpart Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
the Cyprus News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clerides told reporters that "the S-300s would not reach
Cyprus in August. A part of the system was scheduled to be
obtained in August, but Cyprus decided that the system should be
delivered as a whole, and the decision was conveyed to Russia."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is any chance to cancel the deployment of the
system, he said his country's basic objective for a Cyprus
settlement would be a demilitarization agreement.
</P>
<P>
The east Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 into
Greek Cypriot dominated south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north, and efforts to find a peaceful settlement has so for made
little progress.
</P>
<P>
"We proposed to the Turkish side the immediate start of talks
on demilitarization, and if an agreement was reached, a gradual
reduction of armed forces and armaments from both sides would
begin, followed by a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign
troops," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said "if this point was reached before the date of the
S-300's arrival, we would not obtain the missiles, but we would
pay the manufacturers."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government clinched a 425-million-U.S.-dollar deal
with Russians early last year to buy the surface-to-air missiles
with a range of 150 kilometers. This angered Turkish Cypriots and
their ally Turkey, who regarded the system as a threat to their
security.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that during the talks in the Kremlin, he
reiterated "our positions and insistence on a peaceful Cyprus
solution, using the U.N. Secretary-General's good offices
mission."
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need for the withdrawal of all foreign troops
from the island and the deployment of an international force
under the U.N. that would monitor the pullout, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the desire to buy "certain types of arms from
Russia," in addition to "various types of armored vehicles."
</P>
<P>
Russia supported Clerides' proposal for demilitarization of the
island as a precondition for cancellation of the missile deal.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in 1974 in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
It has kept a 40,000-strong force in northern Cyprus controlled
by the Turkish Cypriots, who declared in 1983 a breakaway state,
which was recognized by no other country than Turkey.

<HEADLINE> German Highest Court Gives Green Light to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's highest court Tuesday gave
the green light to the introduction of a German language reform
from August 1 this year after years of controversies.
</P>
<P>
In a much-awaited ruling on Tuesday, the German Federal
Constitutional Court also turned down a complaint by a German
couple who claimed that their basic parental rights to guide their
children's education were violated by the introduction of the new
language rules.
</P>
<P>
The German language reform was agreed to in July 1996 by
government ministers of the three German-speaking countries:
Austria, Germany and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The changes include shortening lengthy compound nouns,
introducing more consistent spellings to avoid numerous exceptions
and cutting the number of the correct-writing rules from 212 to
112.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that the reform, the first comprehensive one
since 1901, is meant to make the written German language more
logical and easier to learn.
</P>
<P>
However, many academics, authors and parents, who like the old
way of writing, oppose the reform, and launched a number of legal
challenges to try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Citizen groups in the northern German state of
Scheswig-Holstein have succeeded in forcing a referendum on
whether or not to implement the reform in the state.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting arguments that the reform would create confusions,
the German constitutional court said that the new rules would only
affect about 0.5 percent of German vocabulary and therefore would
not make German less comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
With the court ruling, it would be obligatory for schools
across Germany to adopt the new language rules from August 1 this
year. However, during a transitional period until 2005, the old
way of writing would still be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
The German Interior Ministry meanwhile said that it had still
to examine the court ruling before setting a deadline for
government offices and institutions to follow the new language
rules.

<HEADLINE> Moi Agrees to Cut Wage Ahead of Teachers' Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
is to cut half of his wage as the nation's economy is facing a
tough time, the Kenyan government announced Tuesday, one day
before the planned country-wide teachers' pay strike.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the ongoing economic difficulties facing the
country, His Excellency the President has agreed to forfeit 50
percent of his salary," said Fares Kuindwa, the head of the
public service, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that cabinet ministers have also accepted a 30 percent
salary reduction but the move will not affect assistant ministers
and allowances will be excluded from the cut.
</P>
<P>
However, details of their wages are not available.
</P>
<P>
In another statement also issued on Tuesday, Moi said he will
name a commission to solve the dispute over civil servants'
salaries and allowances.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy is in a recession with real gross domestic
product shrinking in each of the first three months of 1998, and
high interest rates strangling private investment.
</P>
<P>
The 260,000-strong Kenya National Union of Teachers warned
Monday that it will launch a strike Wednesday unless the
government withdraws a bill on curbing the increments of teachers
salaries.
</P>
<P>
The union demanded the government implement their agreement
reached last year before Moi won his fifth term in the country's
second multi-party poll, to give teachers a 150-200 percent pay
rise over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
When announcing the 1998/99 budget on June 11, Finance
Minister Simeon Nyachae said the government just cannot afford to
implement the deal, asking the pay hike to be renegotiated and
new teachers recruitment to be frozen.
</P>
<P>
The increment on teachers salaries, if implemented in 1998,
will reportedly take up 30 percent of the total government
revenue.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias here Tuesday blamed Washington for adopting a soft stand
over the Israeli government, which in effect contributes to the
stalemate in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government did not put enough pressure on the
Israeli government to force it to change its intransigence
towards implementing the Oslo accords," said Arias in a statement
for Jordan's official news agency Petra.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government should have exerted more pressure on the
Israeli government to force it to implement the agreements already
signed with the Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should also have tried to make both sides resolve
their differences through peaceful dialog, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Dialog is the only means to solve outstanding issues and all
the concerned parties could reach comprehensive, just and
permanent peace that puts an end to the conflicts in the region,
through (such) dialog," Arais added in his statement.
</P>
<P>
Arias is in Jordan to attend a program organized by the United
Nations International Leadership Academy in Amman. He delivered a
lecture during the Tuesday session of the program.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been stalemated
for some 16 months.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Backs South African Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United States
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Tuesday commended South African
government's macro-economic strategy of growth, employment and
redistribution as being on the right track.
</P>
<P>
In an address at Vista University in Soweto, Johannesburg,
Rubin said South Africa had followed sound fiscal and monetary
policies since the present government took power in 1994,
according to the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, in South Africa on the second leg of a five-nation
African visit, declined to comment on whether the Rand was
undervalued at its current levels after the speculative assault
on the currency over past weeks.
</P>
<P>
He urged South Africa to continue with its program of
integration into the global economy, despite the recent pressure
on the Rand.
</P>
<P>
"Emerging markets from around the globe have benefited
enormously from global integration, even taking into account the
recent crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
It had to be remembered that many Asian nations, while having
underlying problems which eventually led to the crisis, had
experienced between 20 and 30 years of high growth and reaped
enormous benefits.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Asian nations will get back on the path of solid
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said economic progress would also entail finding ways to
make labor markets more flexible while protecting workers'
interests.
</P>
<P>
"Productivity growth is the only path over time to
competitiveness in the global economy, lower unemployment and
higher standards of living," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he believed privatization was the most obvious and
immediate way South Africa could attract foreign investment, but
he believed an array of investment would flow in over time.
</P>
<P>
He repeated assurances that the U.S. would open its market to
African countries undertaking economic reform.
</P>
<P>
"With South Africa we can even envision the day when it will
be mutually advantageous to conclude a free trade agreement
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is now engaged in talks for a free trade
agreement with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Asked for comment on the resignation of Ryutaro Hashimoto as
Japan's prime minister, Rubin said Hashimoto's successor must
deal with the country's troubled economy immediately for the sake
of world economy.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that whoever may be in the government, it is
absolutely imperative for Japan and the rest of the world that
Japan move expeditiously on dealing with its bank problems and
more generally on issues of its economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the state of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Rubin said its historically low level of funding created a
risk of renewed financial instability. For this reason the U.S.
was pushing for IMF funding to be increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official is scheduled to meet South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Reserve
Bank Governor Chris Stals later Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, who has visited Cote d'Ivoire, will proceed to Namibia,
Mozambique and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Rubin's African tour is to continue publicizing
Washington's new trade-for-aid African policy after U.S.
President Bill Clinton's historic Africa visit in March.

<HEADLINE> Secret Autopsy Rules Out Poisoning of Abacha: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former head of state
General Sani Abacha died of natural causes, according to the
tissue and blood samples taken from him shortly before he was
buried on June 8, This Day newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was announced died of heart attacked by the government
and was buried according to Muslim tradition with no postmortem
reported.
</P>
<P>
But This Day quoted sources conversant with the last moments
of late Abacha as saying that presidential doctors took some
blood, urine and tissue samples minutes after his death and flew
immediately to Germany for secret postmortem.
</P>
<P>
The result ruled out poisoning and foul play, the report said,
adding that there was no finding of Viagra (a new male potency
drug) used by the late leader as speculated by the United
States-based Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely spread that Abacha was in the company of
two ladies shortly before he died in the early hours of June 8.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Abacha has brought about a number of
changes in the most populous African country, which may finally
lead to a genuine transition from military to civil rule.

BUCHAREST, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu left here on Tuesday afternoon for a 7-day official
visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian President is accompanied by Defense Minister
Victor Babiuc, Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu, Finance Minister
Daniel Daianu, Privatization Minister Sorin Dimitriu, Transport
Minister Traian Basescu, Minister of Research and Technology Horia
Ene, presidential aides Zoe Petre and Dorin Marian.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in
the Oval Office and will address the joint Houses of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Romania and the U.S. have improved after
1989. The U.S. administration in 1990 included Romania in the work
programs of the Group 24. In 1993 the U.S. offered Romania the
most favored nation's status, and in 1996 the Chamber of
Representatives of the U.S. Congress endorsed a bill granting
Romania the most favored nation's status on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
The United States ranks among the first top foreign investors
in Romania, with 2000 American companies conducting businesses in
the east-European country.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Names New Chief of Naval Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Minister of Health Jubirla
Ayinla has been named Nigeria's new Chief of Naval Staff to
replace Okhai Mike Akhigbe, who was sworn last week as Chief of
General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Ayinla's appointment, which took immediate effect, was
announced in a statement Monday by David Attah, Chief Press
Secretary to Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Ayinla was the Federal Minister of Health in the Federal
Executive Council (cabinet) which was dissolved last week. He
was Minister of Commerce and Tourism from July 1996 to November
1997.
</P>
<P>
Ayinla's predecessor Akhigbe was sworn as Chief of General
Staff last week by Abubakar to fill the vacuum created by the
fall of Oladipo Diya, who was arrested last December for
involvement in an alleged coup plot.
</P>
<P>
Also sworn in at the same time was Alami Dagash as the new
Chief of Defense Staff, a position held by Abubakar until he
succeeded late military leader General Sani Abacha on June 9.
</P>
<P>
In what looks like a major reshuffle of the armed forces, the
Army Command Monday announced the redeployment of some senior
commanders.
</P>
<P>
Victor Malu, former commander of the West African sub-regional
peacekeeping force in Liberia known as ECOMOG, was appointed the
commander of the Lagos Garrison, perhaps to strengthen the
security in the stronghold of Nigeria's opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Before his new appointment, Malu was the general officer
commanding the Second Mechanized Division in the southwestern
City of Ibadan, a position once held by late General Abacha and
now taken over by Major-General Felix Mujakperuo.
</P>
<P>
Bashir Magashi was named the new commander of the Nigerian
Defense Academy, filling the vacuum left by Alami Dagash.
</P>
<P>
Leo Ajiborisha was appointed principal staff officer to the
new leader Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Release of Prisoners in Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Tuesday launched a
nationwide sit-in protest on the Prisoner Day to call for a
release of all Lebanese detainees held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The country's non-governmental Follow-up Committee for
Supporting Lebanese Prisoners in Israeli Jails organized a sit-in
protest in front of the headquarters of the United Nations in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Lebanese parliament members, university professors,
lawyers and prisoners recently freed from Israeli jails took part
in the protest.
</P>
<P>
They called on the U.N. and other international organizations
to pressure Israel to release all Lebanese detainees.
</P>
<P>
"Destroy Khiam Prison and release all Prisoners in Israeli
jails," they shouted.
</P>
<P>
The Khiam prison, established by Israeli forces in south
Lebanon, is used to hold those who fought against Israeli
occupation and those who refused to collaborate with the
pro-Israeli militia South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
Some 125 Lebanese are currently held in this prison and other
42 are in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Similar protests were also held in Lebanon's other important
cities like the biggest southern city Sidon, another big southern
city of Tyre and the central town of Nabatieh which faces the
Israeli occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz met
with a delegation of released prisoners and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government will make every effort to help
seek the release of all Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel released 60 Lebanese prisoners and returned
bodies of 40 Lebanese guerrillas in exchange for the remains of an
Israeli soldier killed in south Lebanon last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon with a claimed aim to protect its north from
Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Its Positions on So-Called "Taiwan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, Ambassador Qin said
Article 4 of the Charter of the United Nations stipulates
expressly that only sovereign states are entitled to membership
at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Qin said Taiwan, as a province of China, can by no means be
in a position to be a Member State of the United Nations.
Meanwhile, according to the principles of international law, the
sovereignty of a State is indivisible.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said the Government of the People's Republic of
China naturally represents, at the United Nations and its
agencies, the Chinese people as a whole, including the Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Qin said there does not exist the so-called question of
"Taiwan's representation at the United Nations". The question of
Taiwan, by nature, bears no analogy to the cases of Germany and
Korea resulting from the international agreements following the
end of World War II. Therefore, the so-called principle of
parallel representation naturally can not apply to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qin said General Assembly resolution 2758 conforms to the
Charter of the United Nations and the principles of
international law and above all, reflects the actual situation
in China.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said the illegal activities of Nicaragua and
the other countries have of course met with strong opposition of
the vast number of justice-upholding Member States of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the General Committee of the successive sessions of
the General Assembly since 1993 have all decided not to include
the question of the so-called Taiwan 's "representation " in the
agenda of the General Assembly, which has fully reflected the
firm resolve of the overwhelming majority of Member States of
the United Nations to safeguard the Charter of the United
Nations, the General Assembly Resolution 2758 and the principles
of international law.
</P>
<P>
Qin noted that doubtlessly, the proposal of Nicaragua and a
small number of other countries this year will come to the same
end.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Support ECOWAS Efforts in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has urged the U.N. Security Council to give its full
support to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
in its efforts to ensure the return of constitutional legality in
Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release issued here Tuesday, the
call was contained in a communique issued at the end of the 49th
ordinary session of the central organ at ambassadorial level here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
After considering the report on the mission of the special
envoy of the OAU secretary-general to Guinea Bissau, said the
communique, the central organ endorsed the decisions and
recommendations of the joint meeting of ECOWAS foreign and
defense ministers held in Abidjan on July 3.
</P>
<P>
The central organ reaffirmed OAU's strong and unequivocal
condemnation of the mutiny in Guinea Bissau perpetrated against
the democratically elected government of President Joao Bemardo
Viera and called upon all member states and the international
community to refrain from giving any form of support to the
authors of the mutiny.
</P>
<P>
The central organ expressed its support for Guinea and Senegal
as well as for the ECOWAS member states for their involvement on
the side of the constitutional authorities of Guinea Bissau upon
request by the latter.
</P>
<P>
It called for the search of a lasting solution based on dialog
and other relevant measures adopted by ECOWAS with a view to
restoring peace and the authority of the legal government
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The central organ also appealed to the international community
to provide all the necessary humanitarian assistance in
collaboration with the authorities of Guinea Bissau and the
countries hosting the refugees.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Its Positions On So-Called "Taiwan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The question of Taiwan is
an internal matter of China and a matter for the Chinese people
themselves that brooks no interference by any country or
individual in any way or under any circumstances, Qin Huasun,
Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations, stressed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, Qin said the
settlement of the question of Taiwan and the reunification of
the motherland are the solemn and lofty missions of all the
Chinese people, including those in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qin said as early as over a decade ago, on behalf of the
Chinese Government, Mr. Deng Xiaoping proposed the fundamental
policy of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems"
for the settlement of the Taiwan Question. On 1 july last year,
the concept of "one country, two systems" first materialized in
Hong Kong and tremendous success has been achieved ever since.
</P>
<P>
Qin said on December 20, 1998, China will resume its exercise
of sovereignty over Macao. The Taiwan question will ultimately
be resolved. In recent years, with the joint efforts of the
people on both sides of the Taiwan strait, marked progress has
been made in the people-to-people exchanges between the two isdes.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the indirect trade has been growing
rapidly every year and the investment in the mainland by Taiwan
business people has increased steadily.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the exchange of personnel visits between the two
sides has surpassed 12 million persons/times in total. The
contacts and exchanges in the cultural, academic, sports,
scientific and technological, and journalistic fields have been
expanding vigorously. Progress has also been made in the direct
postal and transport services between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Qin noted that the economic cooperation and trade as well as
cultural exchanges between the people on the two sides of the
Strait are closer than ever, which have greatly deepened their
mutual understanding and fraternal feeling.
</P>
<P>
Qin said under such circumstances, Nicaragua and a very
small number of other countries are raising the question of the
so-called "Taiwan's membership at the United Nations" which will
only severely sabotage the process of the peaceful reunification
of China.

UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China attached importance
to relations with all Member States of the United Nations and is
ready to establish and develop friendly relations of cooperation
with all countries in the world on the basis of the Charter of the
United Nations and the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence,
the Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, Qin Huasun said
China has never done anything to hurt the interests of Nicaragua
and the other countries. However, what they have done has
seriously hurt the fundamental interests of China and the feelings
of the 1.2 billion Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said China hopes that those countries, proceeding
from their own long-term interests, will stop being used by the
Taiwan authorities in the latter's attempt to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Qin said it is also China's hope that those countries will
not stand on the opposite side of the overwhelming majority of
the Member States of the United Nations and move against the
historical trend anymore.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed that China believes the Chinese Government and
people will continue to enjoy the understanding and support of
the Governments and people of the general Membership in the just
cause of maintaining state sovereign and territorial integrity.

BRUSSELS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Ford Belgium announced on Tuesday
its plan to retrieve 11,000 cars for possible problems with
passenger airbags.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian affiliate of the United States carmaking giant said
that the airbags sometimes deploy without any reason and the
problems were feared to be caused by static electricity in the
car.
</P>

The cars to be retrieved in Belgium are of three models, Ford
Escort, Ford Mondeo and Ford Scorpio, manufactured between March
1997 and March this year.
</P>
<P>
Ford Belgium stressed that the move was of a preventive nature.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, Ford Werke, a German affiliate of Ford,
announced its plan to retrieve up to 124,000 cars in Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday called on Duma's leaders to adopt the bills facilitating
implementation of the stabilization program.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, during the meeting with
Duma's leaders in the Kremlin Yeltsin said "We need the
stabilization program not only for the sake of implementation. We
will not be able to implement it unless you approve (the bills)."
</P>
<P>
Both the president and the State Duma are opposed to the
creation of unconstitutional bodies of power in Russia, Duma
speaker Gennady Seleanyov told a press conference after the
meeting with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He said the president was told that the State Duma would
categorically oppose "any unconstitutional bodies of power, like a
State Council proposed by the "oligarchs" after their meeting with
the government.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Yeltsin proposed that the status of roundtable
meetings of representatives of all branches of power under the
president be upgraded, president's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Duma's leadership suggested that such
meetings become regular and that roundtable sessions be resumed in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
Duma deputies, on the whole, favor "concerted efforts" for
stabilizing the situation in the country. They proposed that a
trilateral commission for preparation of draft laws be created
with the participation of members of the Duma, the Federation
Council and the Cabinet, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-U.N. Chief Slams Foreign Meddling in Egypt's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The former Secretary General of the
United Nations Boutros Boutros-Ghali Tuesday warned against
"dangerous foreign bids" to drive a wedge between Egypt's Muslim
majority and Coptic Christians on pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian people must unite to face these attempts, and any
problem, if any, should be handled at home," Ghali, who is chief
of La Francophonie, said in an interview with Egypt's Middle East
News Agency from Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who is an Egyptian Christian, said that Muslims and
Copts are treated on an equal footing in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on some countries' exploitation of human
rights principles to interfere in others' internal affairs, Ghali
expressed sorrow that some principles are serving as
justifications for such attempts.
</P>
<P>
"Encountering this requires mobilizing public opinion and
enhancing the role of the United Nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some Coptic expatriates in the United States have been accusing
the Egyptian government of persecuting the minority Copts, Egypt's
aboriginals who traditionally live in the south. Cairo squarely
denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
But Copts, along with the police and foreign tourists, have
been a prime target of terrorist attacks staged by Muslim
militants since 1992. Muslims account for nearly 90 percent of the
population and Copts around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
On a possible role by La Francophonie in the Middle East peace
process, Ghali said the organization, which groups 52
French-speaking countries whose majority are from Africa, was
still in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we have to avoid having many brokers," he said,
citing the role of the U.S. as the key sponsor of the Middle East
peace drive.
</P>
<P>
But still, La Francophonie can help in educating world public
opinion about the importance of grappling with the crisis
experienced by the Mideast peace process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ghali was selected last November to steer the helm of La
Francophonie. Egypt, whose official language is Arabic, is a
member of the forum.

<P>
ABU DHABI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Six bodies of the Ukrainian
cargo plane that plunged into the sea last night soon after
take-off from the United Arab Emirates have been recovered by the
coastal and border guards.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two of the eight crew members on board the plane
when it crashed were still missing and feared dead. The search was
continuing for them and the instruments that recorded flight
condition and data.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheikh Salem Al-Kasemi, chief of Ras Al-Khaimah
International Airport, the coastal guards recovered four bodies of
the crew by 10:00 local time (0600 GMT). Another two bodies were
found in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The tragic incident took place Monday soon after the Ilyushin
76, leased by a Kiev-based private air company, took off for
Mykolayiv, Ukraine. The plane crashed about 500 meters offshore.
</P>
<P>
Carrying 44 tons of ordinary cargo loaded Monday evening, it
took off at 23:12 local time (1912 GMT) from runway No. 34 of Ras
Al-Khaimah Airport, some 300 kilometers northeast of the

<HEADLINE> 26 Kurdish Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 26 members of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in recent
military operations by Turkish government troops in southeastern
Turkey, the Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place in the southeastern provinces of Van,
Bingol, Tunceli, Hakkari, Diyarbakir as well as Sirnak. One
soldier was also killed and seven others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, a group of PKK militants raided a
villiage in the eastern province of Erzurum Monday night, killing
five civilians, including one village guard.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting the Turkish government since 1984 in

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian, Burundi FMs Meet as Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 14 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian Foreign Minister
Jakaya Kikwete has praised the commitment by the Burundi
government to join the oppositions in the second round of peace
talks due on July 20 in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting here Monday with his Burundi counterpart,
Severin Ntahomvukiye, Kikwete asserted that nothing but dialogs
can bring peace to the war-torn Burundi, said an official from
the foreign ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete was quoted as saying that the Bujumbura's involvement
in the peace talks, which opened its first round in Arusha last
month under the facilitator Julius Nyerere, founding president of
Tanzania, was a "very encouraging signal."
</P>
<P>
Ntahomvukiye was accompanied by the Burundi Minister for Peace
and Reconciliation, Ambroise Niyonsaba, and the Executive
Secretary of opposition FRODEBU party, Dometien Ndahiyeze.
</P>
<P>
Concluding their meeting in Kikwete's office, the ministers
left together for Arusha in the afternoon to join Tanzanian
President Benjemin Mkapa, who is on a tour in the region.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multiparty system in 1993.

CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The slowdown in Israel's real estate sector
continued in the first half this year, with all activities,
including building starts, apartment sales and mortgages, dropping
compared with the same period in 1997, according to a Housing
Ministry report available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new and second-hand apartments were down 8 percent
compared with the same period last year and the number of building
starts declined 26 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the slowdown, the number of mortgages taken by
those eligible for Housing Ministry assistance were down 19
percent in the January-May period.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Industry and Trade Ministry is to
launch its price-labeling information campaign next week under the
slogan of "consumer power," the Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Customers will be encouraged to ask stores to affix prices on
products as a condition for purchasing them and phone numbers will
be provided for them to register complaints with the ministry, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Investment Bank said it collected net
profits of 121.3 million riyals (32.3 million U.S. dollars) in the
first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
This was compared with 80.2 million riyals (about 21.4 million
dollars) in the same period last year, an increase of 51 percent,
the London-based Al Hayat newspaper reported Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> High-capacity Memory Chip Due in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Early next year, Japan's
Hitachi Semiconductor plans to begin offering chip technology that
would allow a personal computer's main memory to store as much as
one gigabyte of data, according to CNET News today.
</P>
<P>
1GB memory module would be about 30 times the size of today's
PC standard. With such capacity, future PCs will be capable of
handling such task as the most realistic 3D graphics and
full-motion video applications. High-capacity memory chips will
also be necessary for next-generation operating systems.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi said that it has assembled its 1GB memory module from
36 256-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. By
comparison, most PCs come with 32MB of memory, using 16-megabit
chips.
</P>
<P>
DRAM technology is used for main memory in all PCs today. As
recently as last year, new notebook PCs came with hard drives
about the same size as the Hitachi memory chip.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the new memory module will be targeted for use in
high-performance workstations and servers, Hitachi said. The chips
are slated for volume production in the first quarter of 1999.
Everyday PCs will not see the technology for a while, as Hitachi
will set the initial prices at over 6,000 U.S. dollars early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Japanese and Korean memory makers are eager to advance memory
capacity, hoping to charge premium prices on advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
But in the United States, there has been talk of overinvestment
and overcapacity in memory manufacturing. The semiconductor
business has been experiencing lower demand, sinking prices and
poor earnings. Some Silicon Valley semiconductor companies and
related business have been scaling back their spending and hiring.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, India to Upgrade Ties in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and India are looking
forward to their upgraded, more comprehensive relations in the
new millennium, veteran businessmen learned from a seminar held
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar, with the theme of "India-Kenya Relations:
Vision 2000," comes at a time when the two countries are marking
the 50th anniversary of bilateral ties in the areas of business,
culture and education.
</P>
<P>
It aimed to "provide a valuable pointer to the future of
India-Kenya relations in the 21 century," said the organizer.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana urged the meeting to
charter out new areas of cooperation between the two countries
and curb the large trade deficit Kenya runs with India.
</P>
<P>
Kenya exports to India grew by 49 percent to 22 million U.S.
Dollars in the 1996/97 year while exports from India dropped from
a peak of 250 million Dollars in 1995/1996 to about 180 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"India is one of Kenya's leading trading and investment
partners" while Kenya remains the gateway for India to the rising
markets in east African and the Great Lakes region, said Godana.
</P>
<P>
He also called on about 100,000 people of Indian origin in
Kenya to "consolidate their investments in an effort to boost
exports to India."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indian Ambassador R.K. Bhatia said that the Indian
government is planning to take some new initiatives to enhance
bilateral relations especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
As a part, a display of India's technological prowess is in
the offing as India Tech'98 will hit Nairobi in August with up to
100 companies mainly in engineering and information technology
sectors expected to participate in.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Criticizes West for Isolation Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko Tuesday criticized the West for isolating his country
and providing minimal aid to dealing with the consequences of the
Chernobyl disaster, the Interfax reported from Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko stated that the Belarussian authorities are not
afraid of international isolation, and it has always relied on
their own resources in handling problems.
</P>
<P>
Aid from the West in this area was minimal, Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Belarussia and some Western countries
have been deteriorated since the Belarussian authorities asked
foreign missions to vacate their residences from Drozdy compound
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko now is also adamant on the issue of moving foreign
ambassadors, saying "they do not necessarily have to live 10
meters from the resident's residence."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Belarus is prepared "to seek jointly mutually
acceptable solutions of the problem."
</P>
<P>
However, the Belarussian authorities will not impose sanctions
on European Union member nations that have decided not to issue
visas to Belarussian senior officials, Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
The president stated that Belarus may renounce Western
assistance in physical rehabilitation of children affected by the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster, if Western countries continue to
discriminate against Belarussian citizens who want to visit
European countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defiance to U.N. Statement Warned Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestine's permanent delegate to
the Cairo-based Arab League Mohamed Sobeih Tuesday voiced worries
that Israel would ignore a United Nations Security Council
statement calling it to rescind its plan to expand Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped this statement would have taken the shape of a
resolution because we know that the Israeli leadership would
deride this statement as it has done to the U.S., Arab and
international position," Sobeih told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Israel has come under under fire from the international
community by approving the controversial plan last month to extend
Jerusalem's boundaries to include Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council issued the presidential statement late
Monday, deeming the Israeli plan a "serious and damaging
development" in the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on Israel not to act on its June 21
decision and "not to take any other steps which would prejudice
the outcome of the permanent status negotiations" with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, a holy city claimed both by Israel and the
Palestinians, is the most sensitive issue in the peace process.
Under the Oslo accord, its fate can only be determined in
final-status talks and no side should take any unilateral action
before that.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain had tried to prevent the Security Council
from voting on an Arab-sponsored resolution condemning Israel, and
the 15 council members finally compromised on a watered-down
presidential statement which is non-binding and does not carry the
same weight as a resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official, while admitting that the statement
included "many positive elements," maintained that Israel would
construe the absence of a resolution as "a green light to wage
more infringement and expansion."
</P>
<P>
Israel has shown defiance to the U.N. statement, expressing
"regret" to its adoption and vowing to "continue to work for the
development and prosperity of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official also sounded pessimistic over the
outcome of direct negotiations with the Israelis expected to
start next week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has agreed to send its chief
negotiator Abu Mazen to meet with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai in response to a call by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked for 16
months over Jewish settlement construction and a long-overdue
Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.

MAPUTO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Companies from the United States,
South Africa and India are to join the Mozambican government in
exploring the oil and gas fields in the central part of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
An agreement with a value of about 23 million U.S. Dollars was
signed in central Mozambique's Beira city Tuesday between the
Mozambican government and America's ARCO company, South Africa's
SASOL and India's ZARARA, according to Mozambican News Agency.

John Kachamila, Mozambique's Minister of Minerals and Energy,
who attended the signing ceremony of the accord, said the
exploration and development of oil around central Mozambique's
Sofala Province would give a great push to the economic
development there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ARCO company will drill the first well this month,
and if it succeeds, two more wells will be sunk there.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the oil and gas produced along Sofala coast

LUANDA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Angola, Namibia and
Democratic Congo held a summit here Tuesday, urging Angola's
rebel UNITA forces to stick to the peace deal agreed upon
"unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
A joint communique to this effect was issued after Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Namibian President Sam Nujoma
and President of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Laurent
Kabila met and held a tripartite summit on Angola's peace here.
</P>
<P>
The statement analyzed the situation in Angola and urged Jonas
Savimbi, Chairman of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) to put an end to all its military actions,
cooperate with the other side in the peace process, and disarm
its military men.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders also urged Savimbi to help rebuild local
administrations in the UNITA-controlled areas, and work closely
with the government to settle all the problems left unresolved in
the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed to join efforts in persuading Savimbi to
refrain from endangering peace, security and stability in the
three neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Dialog is the only way to peace, and war can only lead to the
killings of innocent civilians and the destruction of Angols's
infrastructure, the three leaders said in the statement.

Nujoma and Kabila arrived here earlier Tuesday at the
invitation of Santos to discuss peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> 20 Nigerians Dead in Last Week's Riots: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Police here Tuesday broke
silence on the death toll in the riots erupted in Lagos last week
after the death of late opposition leader Moshood Abiola, saying
that at least 20 people had died.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that the number is more than that but I am
giving you in the official report," said Alhaji Abubakar Tsav,
Lagos state commissioner of police.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the presumed winner of Nigeria's annulled June 12,
1993 presidential election, died last Tuesday, reportedly one day
before his release from four years of detention.
</P>
<P>
His supporters in southwest Nigeria took to the streets to
protest against his death, causing disturbances during which more
than 30 people were said to be dead.
</P>
<P>
The police chief, who did not explain why the official death
toll was lower than widely believed, also said that 34 others
were injured in the riots in the nation's economic center.
</P>
<P>
He said 55 persons had been arrested so far and efforts were
continuing to apprehend those involved in the protest.
</P>
<P>
However media reports said earlier that nearly 200 persons had
been arrested or detained by the state special security military
squad known as Operation Sweep.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsav, a total of 104 properties were damaged
during the protest, including 63 vehicles. Altogether 32 vehicles
and nine buildings were burnt.

JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Two electric appliances
factories invested by Shanghai Industrial Investment Corporation

about 530 km southeast of Johannesburg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Huang Ju, member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the
inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the two factories, with about nine million
U.S. Dollars at the initial stage, symbolized good cooperation
between China and South Africa, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Yacob Zuma, deputy president of ruling African National
Congress, spoke highly of China's investment in South Africa,
saying he hoped to see more possibility of doing business with
China.
</P>
<P>
Ladysmith Mayor S.D.S. Vilakazi, who was also at the ceremony,
said that the two China-invested enterprises had created
much-needed employment opportunities for South Africa. He
expressed the hope to further cooperation with the Chinese
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
SIIC is the window company of the Shanghai Municipal
government in Hong Kong, and also Shanghai's largest and

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Taxi Drivers Vow to Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Taxi drivers and operators here
have vowed to continue to defy government order urging them to
resume normal operations after a two-day strike forcing thousands
of people to go to work on foot or by hired motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
They said they will only go back to transport people if
Minister for Transport, Works and Housing John Nasasira meets
them, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The report said the taxi drivers and operators have been on
strike because they think the fines to be paid by taxis which
would have caused fatal accidents as stipulated in the new
Traffic and Road Safety Act 1998 are too harsh and too
exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
They warned that it is unwise for government to order
government registered vehicles to ferry people saying that these
could be targets for attack because the move is aimed at breaking
their strike before a solution is found.
</P>
<P>
Many taxi operators who wanted to continue with their normal
operations were threatened off the road by a few misguided
elements who would wish to take law in their hands.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Tuesday, however, the minister said
the traffic bill was extensively discussed with all Taxi
Operators' Organizations and debated by Parliament before it was
passed.
</P>
<P>
He urged Taxi Operators to resume their operations and warned
individuals bent on disrupting taxi operations to stop forthwith.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will ensure the rule of law and all
those willing to carry out normal business will be protected.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which shut down some of the economy here, was
designed to have been launched at the same time as the first
national congress of the ruling National Resistance Movement was
held in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The strike has spotlighted the shortcomings in the nation's
transport policy. Uganda is peculiar because it is one of the few
countries in the world without a publicly owned mass transport
system and relies exclusively on private buses and taxis.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Union Rejects Plan to Lay off Civil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Civil Servants Union of Zambia
(CSUZ) Tuesday dismissed a government plan to lay off about
59,000 Civil servants within two years as "over-ambitious",
saying it would become a source of problems.
</P>
<P>
CSUZ General Secretary Japhet Moonde said the Public Service
Reform program (PSAR) has failed to take off because of the
government's over-ambitious stance of laying off nearly 60,000
workers within two years, Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has no money ready to pay the workers
to be laid off and has resorted to the so-called voluntary
separation package which is meager.
</P>
<P>
The package is also dogged with numerous problems especially
with the insistence by the government that even civil servants
who have worked for over 10 years should register for the
exercise, Moonde said.
</P>
<P>
He said the package should be improved by increasing such
things as repatriation packages from the current 1.5 million
Kwacha (about 750 U.S. Dollars) across the board to about five
million Kwacha (about 2,500 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government and the unions will soon set up a public
service reform program monitoring committee to iron out the
problems in the exercise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moonde described the dialog with the government as good and
said the union will not want to be seen to be castigating the
government, but trying to ensure that retrenched people lead
meaningful lives.

latest 11 billion U.S. dollar commitment to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director, said
that senior officials from the United States and other major
industrial nations have indicated they would approve a request to
use an IMF emergency fund, called the General Agreement to Borrow
(GAB), to provide some of the money for Russia, according to an AP
report here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The emergency fund was established in 1962 by the major
industrial countries to provide a source of emergency financing
for the IMF, particularly if the major industrial nations needed
it or the IMF's ability to provide credit elsewhere was impaired.
</P>
<P>
It has been tapped only nine times since it was created, the
last time in 1978 by the United States to prop up a staggering
dollar, according to IMF officials.
</P>
<P>
The IMF move came as the White House and the State Department
urged Congress to end months of delay and approve the Clinton
administration's request for a new 18 billion dollar U.S.
contribution to the IMF. The Senate approved the request in March
and a House Appropriations Committee panel is expected to consider
it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government officials have repeatedly argued that the
182-nation IMF's rescue packages promote global economic stability
and enable countries that are markets for U.S exports to recover
from financial crises.
</P>
<P>
The House panel may slice off 3.5 billion dollars of the
administration request for quick approval. The other 14.5 billion
dollars might be delayed until the fall, when the IMF holds its
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
The IMF announced Monday it will provide about 11.2 billion
dollars in additional credit to Russia on top of an existing 9.2
billion dollar loan. Of the new credit, 5.6 billion dollars will
be made available this year.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the IMF wanted to use 8.4 billion dollars of the
23 billion dollars available in the emergency GAB fund for part of
the payment to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Since the Asian financial crisis erupted last summer, the IMF
has committed 32 billion dollars to help rescue Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea. And just last week, Indonesia said it
needed 4 billion to 6 billion dollars in additional help.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and other senior fund
officials have warned they had only 10 billion to 15 billion
dollars left before having to take extraordinary measures such as
tapping the emergency GAB.
</P>
<P>
There are the 23 billion dollar emergency fund and the
multinational agency's 26 billion dollars equivalent in gold that
could be used as collateral to borrow in global financial markets.
In the past Germany, Japan and Italy have resisted any use of IMF
gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
In the Clinton administration's request to Congress for new IMF
funding, 3.5 billion dollars would go to a new emergency fund
called the New Agreement to Borrow or NAB. U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin proposed establishing the NAB after the 1994-1995
Mexican peso crisis.

<HEADLINE> S. African Electoral Bill Tabled in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive electoral
bill to regulate the running of future South African elections at
all governmental tiers was tabled in parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides, among other things, for the electoral
commission to manage all elections, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum to the draft legislation, tabled by Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, points out that a major difference
between the 1994 national and provincial elections and those to
be held next year was that the constitution now requires the
establishment and use of a national voters' roll.
</P>
<P>
The bill further provides that the state president, or premier
of a province, must, when proclaiming an election, give at least
60 days' notice of the voting day.
</P>
<P>
The electoral commission must prescribe the polling hours and
may lay down different ones for different voting stations.
</P>
<P>
It may, on the voting day, extend the hours at a particular
station until midnight and may temporarily close a booth for part
of a day.
</P>
<P>
The electoral commission is to be charged with dividing the
country into voting districts and the bill lays down the factors
that must be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Each voting district should have between 1,000 (in rural
areas) and 3,000 voters (in urban areas).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Restricts Travel by Belarus Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
Tuesday it would impose visa restrictions on President Alexander
Lukashenko and other Belarussian leaders because of its dispute
with Belarus over the U.S. ambassador's residence in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
"Each travel request, except those to international
organizations in the United States, will be examined with the
presumption of denial," said State Department spokesman James
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the last straw in the dispute came last week when
the Belarussians tore down the fence around the U.S. ambassador's
residence, which is inviolate under the Vienna Convention on the
treatment of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"This new violation was tantamount to forceable seizure of a
diplomatic compound," he said. "Such behavior cannot be
tolerated."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that at this stage the visa ban covered only the
Belarus officials, not members of their families.
</P>
<P>
"They'd like to be able to travel to Europe and the United
States. And so this stings well beyond their ability to impinge on
our effective operation in Belarus," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he hoped the dispute would not lead to a
break in relations but this was up to Belarus.
</P>
<P>
"The actions of the Belarussian government have effectively
brought our relationship to a standstill and they know what they
need to do to return to a more normal relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we will be looking at additional options. But I'm
not going to speculate at what they might be," he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union took similar measures Monday against a list
of 131 Belarussian ministers and officials, including Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors from the EU countries and the U.S. left Minsk last
month after Belarus said it needed to repair the sewer and water
facilities around the areas and decided to cut off their water and
telephones.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has launched a national
debate on what should be the moral and ethical broadcasting
standards.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, which held here Tuesday afternoon, was presided
over by Minister of State in the President's office in charge of
information Basoga Nsadhu, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The debate is seeking a national consensus on issues such as
what constitutes morality, pornography, what information would
lead to public insecurity or violence and whether censorship of
the media is justifiable.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state commended the Broadcasting Council for
opening the debate to the public, saying that the government
intends to put in place an integrated program of measures which
have been formulated, with the participation of all stake-holders
in an open discussion.
</P>
<P>
An important step in rebuilding public confidence in the
government is to let people have a say on matters that affect
their lives, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chairperson of the Council Prof. Tarsis Kabwegyere
appealed to the general public, institutions and personalities to
send their opinions to their council.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda called Tuesday for resumption of the inter-party dialog
breaking down last December after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said here that there is an urgent need for the
country's stake-holders to discuss a lot of national issues,
</P>
<P>
Kaunda urged the political parties of the country to
participate the inter-party dialog unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Early last December 31 parties worked out an agenda at a
preliminary meeting for the inter-party dialog.
</P>
<P>
However, as the party leaders were going to participate in the
dialog Kaunda was arrested for alleged involvement in the October
28 failed coup.
</P>
<P>
In protest against Kaunda's arrest, many parties announced
their withdrawal from the planned dialog.
</P>
<P>
Kuanda was set free from under house arrest early last month
and announced four days after his release that he will quit party
politics so that he can serve the nation and the continent on a
wider scope.

Kaunda has presented his resignation to his United National
Independence Party (UNIP).

<HEADLINE> Privatization Program Half Fulfilled in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The privatization developed at
snail's pace in the first half of the year, reported Tuesday the
daily Adevarul (The Truth), quoting data of the State Ownership
Fund, which is in charge of the privatization process.
</P>
<P>
As many as 2,800 commercial companies are included in the 1998
privatization program, of which 1,200 are to effectively be sold
by the end of 1998, but in the first half of the year, only 304
sale-purchase contracts were signed. So, the privatization program
on the first six months of 1998 was only 50 percent fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The reason that kept the foreign investors away from Romania
was, according to Privatization Minister Sorin Dimitriu, "first of
all the wreaking effects of the political crisis at end-1997 and
the beginning of 1998." Inadequate legislations and bureaucracy
are among the other hindrances in attracting the foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Data of the State Ownership Fund showed that the general stage
of privatization till July 10, 1998 is as follows: 4,647 companies
turned private, out of which 3,465 are small, 1,015 medium-sized
and 167 large. As many as 517 contracts were drawn back.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday reiterated its call for a political dialogue between the
warring factions in Afghanistan and for a cessation of foreign
interference.
</P>
<P>
After consulting on the latest report by Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on the situation in the country between March and June, the
council adopted a presidential statement deploring the breakdown
of the intra-Afghan talks in Islamabad in May.
</P>
<P>
It urged the parties concerned to stop fighting and to return
without delay to the negotiating table for national reconciliation
and a lasting political settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan's report, the suspension of the dialogue and
the apparent start of the annual spring offensives are "alarming
developments."
</P>
<P>
"The Afghan factions are either not ready for serious peace
talks or, worse, are determined to pursue the mirage of a military
solution," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council deplores the fact that military support,
including arms supplies from outside Afghanistan to the warring
factions, continues unabated.
</P>
<P>
The council said the United Nations, as a universally
recognized intermediary, must continue to play its central and
impartial role in international efforts towards a peaceful
resolution of the Afghan conflict.

<HEADLINE> Romania Faces "Peak Years" of Debt Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Romania has to pay back 2.1
billion U.S. dollars owed to foreign creditors this year and 2.7
billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
The amounts due, released lately by the National Bank of
Romania, are turning 1998 and 1999 into "peak years" for the
country's debt payment efforts.
</P>
<P>
Of Romania's total 8.2 billion dollars debt, 64 percent are
long-term credits with maturities of over five years, and 34
percent are mature in one to five years.
</P>
<P>
Romanian financial analysts said the effects of the debt are
"marginal," as a big part of the loans have been directed to
consumption and the balance of foreign payments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they said, credit needs for the expansion of the
country's manufacturing operations are mostly neglected.
</P>
<P>
However, what makes the International Monetary Fund (IMF), one
of Romania's largest creditors, worry is its overburdening with
foreign loans, shown by the growing deficit in its balance of
payments.
</P>
<P>
The deficit last year stood at 2.6 billion dollars, 7 percent
of the country's gross domestic product (GDP); and it is expected
to hike this year to 3.5 billion dollars, 7.8 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Most of foreign credits came from international institutions,
such as the IMF, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
and the European Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
Romania also received financing from the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Organ Donation Lags Far Behind Demand in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada has one of the worst
organ-donation rates in the western world, Canada's leading daily
newspaper "The Globe and Mail" reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of Canadian patients waiting for transplants has
soared by 68 percent in the past decade, but the number of
transplants has increased only 40 percent during the same period,
despite dramatic technological advances.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's organ-donation rates rank among the lowest of all
developed countries," Dr. Paul Greig, chairman of the Canadian
Organ Replacement Register said, "for example, in 1996, Canada's
rate was only 14.1 donors per million population compared to
Spain's rate of 26.8 donors per million."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were only 689 organ donors in Canada, down three
percent from the previous year. Of those donating, 423 were from
brain-dead patients, 266 live donators had given kidneys to their
friends or family members.
</P>
<P>
The yawning gap between demand and supply is not a reflection
of the generosity of Canadians, but rather a testament to the lack
of co-ordination in the organ-retrieval field, said Dr. Philip
Belitsky, a transplant surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth II Health
Sciences Center in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
"There have been sincere efforts to enhance donation in a
number of ways, but what is really needed is a sustained, national
initiative," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were 3,072 patients waiting for organ transplant in
Canada at the end of last year. The vast majority, 82 percent of
the patients were waiting for kidneys, other eight percent were
waiting for livers, and four percent for hearts.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Syria to Build New Pipeline for Carrying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Oil Amir
Mohammed Rashid said Wednesday that Iraq and Syria have agreed on
building a new pipeline for transporting Iraqi crude oil to the
world market via Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency immediately after his
return to Baghdad from a three-day visit to Syria, the oil
minister said the capacity of the new pipeline would be larger
than the current one and would contribute to increasing Iraq's
exporting potentials in the future.
</P>
<P>
The current Iraqi-Syrian pipeline from the Iraqi northern city
of Kirkuk to Syria's Banias export terminal on the Mediterranean
has been closed since 1982. This happened during the Iran-Iraq war
(1980-88), in which Syria sided with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said the two countries have agreed on putting the
current Iraqi pipeline across Syria back into full operation,
stressing that pumping of crude oil through the pipeline would
start in a short time.
</P>
<P>
Any reopening of the pipeline system would need the approval of
the U.N. Sanctions Committee on Iraq, though the U.N. has allowed
Iraq's limited oil sales to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods for its people since 1996.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iraq and Syria signed a memorandum of
understanding under which Kirkuk-Banias pipeline will be reopened.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi Oil Ministry source said on Tuesday that 80 million
U.S. dollars would be needed to repair the old pipeline inside the
Iraqi territory in order to bring it back to its original capacity
of 1.2 million barrels per day.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Merapi volcano, which
erupted last Saturday, is still spewing hot clouds and ashes,
remaining a threat to residents of its surrounding areas, the
Antara News Agency reported Wednesday quoted observers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hot clouds and gases were still flowing down westward
threatening the village of Krinjing in Dukun sub-district, the
report said.

local residents of Krinjing village and officers at the Babadan
observation outpost have been warned to be more vigilant," said
Agus I, Krinjing village head.

Merapi erupted at 4:38 local time last Saturday and volcanic
ash hit areas as far as 60 kilometers west and southwest of the
volcano, but no casualty has been reported.
</P>
<P>
"Generally the volcanic activity has decreased but the mountain
is still producing hot gases and clouds," Mas Atje Purbawinata,

</P>
<P>
Merapi lies in Central Java, one of the world's most densely
populated areas. but residents in the ancient royal capital of
Yogyakarta, a city of 2 million people, said they were not

</P>
<P>
Residents of villages near the volcano have been warned to get
ready for evacuation and dams have been built to channel the lava

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Suffers from Scorching Heat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing heat wave in Shanghai
has forced tens of thousands of local residents to seek the
comfort of the city's some 1,000 air conditioned buses.
</P>
<P>
"We've carried some 500,000 passengers daily over the past few
days," according to an official with the bus line.
</P>
<P>
Drivers and conductors operating the air conditioned buses have
worked 16 hours a day during the period, with the volume of
passengers forcing many to have meals on their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Other passengers have exhibited a preference to stand on buses
with no air conditioning rather than sit in the searing
heat on benches awaiting better equipped units.
</P>
<P>
While weather forecasts continually warn residents of danger
surrounding temperatures of over 38 degrees Celsius, the vast
majority of the 4,000 traffic policemen remain at their posts.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely important line of communication, with a
daily traffic flow of more than 70,000 motor vehicles," said Qiu
Weibin, a traffic policeman on Hengshan Road. "I can't imagine
what it would be like without a policeman, even for only a minute."
</P>
<P>
Traffic has flowed smoothing and no major accidents have been
reported during the period, according to the city public security
bureau.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists visiting the Bund has continued to grow
during the evening hours, with many lingering into the early
morning hours to enjoy the comparatively cool air blowing in from
the sea, according to Wei Ruifang, a street cleaner in the
district.
</P>
<P>
"We often collect more than 70 bags of garbage at night," said
Wei, adding that the bags are normally filled with cans and
various types of packaging materials.
</P>
<P>
On the brighter side, the scorching heat has been a blessing
for some local businessmen. For example, the New World Department
Store on prosperous Nanjing Road has sold some 800 air
conditioners over the past three days alone, with the store's
daily turnover soaring to around 500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city's major ice cream suppliers and watermelon vendors
have also been busy satisfying the heavy demand from local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in the densely populated southern part of the
city pass their time outside in the early evening hours by
talking, playing chess or drinking beer.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a really hard summer since we have to move before
long," according to septuagenarian Gu Xiuying as he passed out ice
sucker to his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing and Wuhan, located in the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze River, have also suffered from the same scorching heat
over the past week, with highest temperatures reaching 39 degrees
Celsius.

<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain enjoyed an all-time record
number of inward investment projects during the last year,
according to the Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB), Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
IBB reported 618 foreign direct investment projects from
throughout the world -- the first time the number has ever
exceeded 500.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45,937 new jobs were created during the 1997/98 year
as a direct result of overseas-sourced investment, with another
78,685 jobs safeguarded, IBB said.
</P>
<P>
Launching the organization's Annual Review of Operations 1998,
President of the Board of Trade Margaret Beckett said it was due
to the Government's "deep continuing commitment to economic
stability, improved international competitiveness and
determination to establish a new sense of partnership throughout
industry and the investment network."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the effects of Asian economic difficulties during
the year, Andrew Fraser, IBB's Chief Executive said: "We are
watching the situation carefully ... However, we are confident the
region's companies will be back on the European investment scene
in due course."

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Fungi May Kill Sea Coral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists say they have
discovered fungi that have been killing a type of sea coral from
the Florida Keys to El Salvador over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the July 9 issue of Nature, John W. Taylor from the
University of California at Berkeley and colleagues said they have
found the fungus Aspergillius sydowii has been sickening sea-fan
coral.
</P>
<P>
The fungus, identified through genetic studies of infected
coral, has been present in the Caribbean for years but appears to
have begun killing coral on a large scale only recently.
</P>
<P>
One possibility, they say, is the pollution-caused stress has
made the coral more vulnerable.

<P>
President Suleyman Demirel said in a statement that "I'm
strongly condemning this treacherous attack" launched by the PKK
rebels on Tuesday night.

<P>
The incident took place when a group of PKK militants ambushed

an attempt to establish an "independent Kurdish state" in eastern
and southeastern Turkey. Over 35,000 people, including government
troops, civilians and PKK rebels, have been killed.

<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al Assad will
visit Egypt on Saturday for talks with his Egyptian counterpart
Hosni Mubarak on the Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Assad will arrive in Cairo after his three-day visit to France
which will start on Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will discuss the current situation regarding
the stalled Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Assad's travel to France, his first outside the region since he
met U.S. President Bill Clinton in Geneva in January 1994, is
reportedly aimed at seeking an alternative to the U.S. mediation
in Syria's negotiations with Israel that have gone nowhere for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Assad has refused to resume talks with Israel unless it returns
the occupied Golan Heights to Syria, a term allegedly promised by
Israel's former Labor government led by assassinated Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
With the U.S.-sponsored peace process hitting snags in all
tracks, Arab countries increasingly favor a more active European
diplomacy in reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the
region.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Urges Intensified Battle Against Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow's edition of People's
Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial calling
for intensified efforts to combat smuggling.
</P>
<P>
China is confronted with rampant smuggling activities which
include the participation of some Party, government and army
organizations, as well as judicial and law enforcement
departments, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that law enforcement personnel have in
some cases accepted bribes or paid fines to protecting smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that smuggling has caused great harm to
the domestic market and the national industries, caused
substantial losses of tax revenues, violated government
import-export management policies, corrupted officials and
poisoned social morals.
</P>
<P>
"The general public must fully realize that the anti-smuggling
drive is not only a major economic struggle, but also a harsh
political struggle which will have great bearing on the reform,
opening-up and modernization drive," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Oil products, automobiles and cigarettes represent major items
involving smuggling activities in coastal areas and inland border
areas, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It calls for stress on major smuggling cases and calls for
relentless punishment for Party, government and army units
involved in related activities, as well as for judicial and law
enforcement departments protecting smugglers.
</P>
<P>
It notes the state will standardize anti-smuggling practices
and for a national anti-smuggling police force.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls for Party organizations and governments at
all levels to join in a concerted effort to "unify thoughts and
actions in line with the strategy and policies of the Central
Party Committee and the State Council, and to ensure that related
strategies and policies are carried out to the letter."

CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey might put quotas on some goods from European
Union (EU) countries to retaliate for an EU decision to cancel
privileges to Turkish goods, the Turkish Daily News reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We also have to reciprocate by putting quotas on goods coming
from the European Union," Fuat Miras, chairman of the Turkish
Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchange, was quoted by the
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The EU has decided to suspend privileges bestowed upon Turkey's
ketchup, watermelon and hazelnut due to its plan to halt imports
of meat from EU members for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Cairo Chamber of Commerce has announced that the
number of stores that intend to take part in the upcoming
one-month Tourism and Shopping Festival has increased to 539, the
Egyptian Gazette reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The stores are required to pay 90,000 Egyptian pounds (26,470
U.S. dollars) for the participation in the festival starting on
July 20 as part of Egypt's efforts to rejuvenate its depressed
tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to the chamber's secretary general, the majority of
the stores, which will offer key discounts of up to 50 percent,
are selling leather goods and ready-to-wear garments.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Central Bank has said that Egypt's
foreign exchange reserves reached 20.88 billion dollars last
April, the Egyptian Gazette reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This shows an increase of 442 million dollars from those in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly journal, the bank said the total volume of the
domestic liquid funds in April amounted to 203.7 billion pounds
(59.9 billion dollars), against 202.84 billion pounds (59.66

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Urges Companies to Open Outside-Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 15 (Xinhua)--Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong Wednesday evening urged companies in the city-state to open
markets outside the region to cope with the worsening regional
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the Singapore Quality Award (SQA) presentation,
the prime minister said "since falling regional demand has dragged
down our economic growth we will turn our energies towards markets
outside our region."
</P>
<P>
The regional economic situation will get worse before economic
recovery comes about, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the external economic environment has
deteriorated sharply over the last 12 months and the regional
crisis has taken a significant toll on the Singapore economy.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the facts that the mammoth economy of Japan has
entered into recession and South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Hong Kong have all slipped into negative growth in
the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
On the economy of his country, Goh Chok Tong said that the
economic growth has slowed down from 7.8 percent last year to a
newly-revised forecast of 0.5 to 1.5 per cent of this year.
</P>
<P>
Quoting statistics by the country's Productivity and Standard
Board, the prime minister said 70 percent of local small- and
medium-size businesses have projected a drop in sales over the
next six months.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government's promise to do what is necessary
and practical to stimulate domestic economic activities and
lighten the costs of doing business in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Companies should reassess their old strategies to position
themselves for the future and have to restructure their business
activities and refocus on their core strengths and consolidate
with an eye on the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SQA is presented to recognize organizations that have
attained a commendable level of performance based on the Singapore
Quality Award criteria and are committed to attaining world-class
standards of business excellence. It is developed with inputs and
advice from international experts associated with the U.S. Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Award, Japan's Deming Prize and the
European Quality Award.
</P>
<P>
Philips Singapore Pte. Ltd., a tuner factory, is the 1998 SQA
winner.

<HEADLINE> Canada Not to Participate in Hockey Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The scheduling of the first world
under-18 hockey championships next March means Canada won't be
sending a team, a report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is fixed to be held in Germany in March, when
Canadian major-junior playoffs are in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Canada protested that the timing would make it impossible to
field a competitive team. It wanted the tournament to be held
early September.
</P>
<P>
However, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) ignored
Canada's objections at meetings in June, and the matches will go
on as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Bob Nicholson, senior vice president of Canadian Hockey, said
he would rather drop out than spend the money to send a
substandard team.
</P>
<P>
Pulling the players off the Canadian Hockey League's
major-junior teams during the playoffs is out of the question, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Kimmo Leinonen, director of public relations for the IIHF,
said he hopes Canada will change its mind.
</P>
<P>
"Any time Canada is not participating, then it is not a real
championship...Canada makes the tournament," he was quoted as
saying by the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The IIHF and Canada are still discussing the issue and that it
will no doubt come up at the federation's semi-annual congress
this September in Toronto, he added.

marching towards multi-polarization and stressed that the EU will

China is pleased to see the development of its relations with
the EU, said Li. He also expressed hope that the relationship will
witness even more substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
Pattison expressed his admiration of China's rapid development,
and noted that both the Irish Parliament and government attach
great importance to developing their relations with China, and
hope to increase exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will continue to work
closely with industry and academia to explore ways to facilitate
the commercialization of the results of research on leading edge
information technology.
</P>
<P>
K. C. Kwong, secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting, made these remarks in a written reply to a question
raised by a Legislative Council member here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that currently, institutions funded by the University
Grants Committee maintain close contact with the information
technology industry over research activities.
</P>
<P>
Some institutions have also established independent private
bodies to facilitate technology transfer and commercialization of
the results of research on technological developments, including
information technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said to enhance collaboration between the academic sector
and the information technology industry, the government funding
support is made available through the Industrial Support Fund and
the Research Grants Council under the aegis of the University
Grants Committee.
</P>
<P>
The government has financed a number of projects involving
collaborative efforts between the academic sector and the
information technology industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
One example is the Cyberspace Center established by the Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology to promote and
facilitate the use of the Internet among software developers.
</P>
<P>
The center has produced publications on Internet security and
initiated an Internet Business Consortium for the promotion of
business application of Internet.

<P>
Another example is the Electronic News Media and publishing
Consortium set up by the Chinese University of Hong Kong for the
local news media industry to promote greater use of electronic
publishing.
</P>
<P>
Through the Research Grants Council, funds are provided for
research projects with the potential of social or economic
application, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Kwong said that the Research Grants Council has
allocated about 160 million HK dollars (20.5 million U.S. dollars)
to support 344 research projects and five large-scale initiatives
in computer science and information technology.
</P>
<P>
The Research Grants Council also supports the establishment of
Co-operative Research Centers to promote technology transfer
between tertiary institutions and the industry, he said.

<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
would submit to Congress a legislative agenda focusing on the
revival of the economy, food security and the uplift of the poor's
living standards, a presidential press release said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said the agenda took shape during the second cabinet meeting
called by Estrada in the Presidential Palace Tuesday, 12 days
before the opening of the 11th Congress.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Estrada said he would submit to the new
Congress a legislative agenda that represents the economic,
political and social aspirations of every Filipino, especially the
poor, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the priority measures, proposed by different
cabinet clusters, focused on proposed bills that would address the
projected 70-billion-peso (1.75 billion U.S. dollars) fiscal
deficit through several tax and non-tax measures.
</P>
<P>
The proposals also include measures that would provide the
delivery of quality basic services to the poor, ensure food
security and agricultural productivity, promote investments,
pump-prime the economy and improve peace and order in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the 11th Congress, 12 out of the 24 senators and all the 260
members of the House of Representatives were newly elected in the
May 11 elections in which Estrada was elected the president.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the ongoing Asian financial crisis, the
Philippine economy was severely battered and is expected to grow
by only 2 percent in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A humanitarian organization was set
up here Wednesday with an aim of flying Libyan patients to Jordan
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The organization, named as The Humanitarian Commission to Help
the Libyan Patients, issued a statement after its inauguration
saying that it was a non-profitable, non-partisan, non-religious
and non-political organization.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the launching of an air route between Amman
and Tripoli, capital of Libya, can spare Libyan patients from
traveling by land to Tunisia or Egypt to get a flight.
</P>
<P>
The air route will also be used to transport humanitarian
goods to Libya, it added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed direct flight between the two countries has yet to
be approved by the United Nations, which has imposed an air
embargo against Libya since 1992 for its refusal to extradite two
of its citizens suspected of bombing an American airliner in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In the bombing over over Lockerbie, Scotland, 270 people aboard
the Pan Am flight 103 were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian commission was formed in line with Jordan's
efforts in the international arena to help alleviate the
sufferings of the Libyan people caused by the sanctions, the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Resolve PAL Labor Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada said here
Wednesday that the government hopes to resolve the labor dispute
in the Philippine Airlines (PAL) in one to two weeks to save the
airline from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he had instructed Labor Secretary Bienvenido
Laguesma to work for the speedy settlement of the labor problems
that has hobbled Philippine Airlines operations and caused severe
inconvenience to the public.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some 620 pilots went on a strike to protest the
PAL's decision that all pilots must retire after serving the
company for a total of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The strike exacerbated the financial crisis facing the company.
To pay off its two-billion-U.S.-dollar debt, the PAL decided to
reduce its size from 54 airplanes to 14 and sack 5,000 employees,
one third of its employees.
</P>
<P>
However, the pilots continued their strike, putting the airline
on the verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said the timing of the strike was
"particularly unfortunate" in view of the centennial celebration
of the Philippines' independence from Spain.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the labor problem in the PAL has inflicted
damage to the riding public, citing that a pilot was reported to
have even abandoned his passengers in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The PAL, Asia's first airline, was trapped in serious economic
woes as a result of the ongoing Asian financial crisis.

Senior Inspector Pete Campano, chief of the Western Police
District Homicide Division, was quoted as saying that the police
believed that the deaths were caused by nightmare or distress, but
did not know how to stop the rising threat.
</P>
<P>
"We have our medico-legal officers to do this -- determination
of death -- but we have no means or know-how to advise people on
how to curb it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Campano urged officials of the Department of Health to take
concern over the situation and help them advise people on what to
do to avoid the deaths.
</P>
<P>
The latest victim was a 29-year-old security guard who was
found lifeless with no sign of violence or foul play inside the
room he rented, Campano said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Proposes to Increase WTO Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States has proposed to
increase transparency at the World Trade Organization (WTO),
arguing that the organization's credibility and viability depends
on the public understanding of its role.
</P>
<P>
"The United States wants to open up the WTO, the documents and
the meetings," said Rita Hayes, U.S. permanent representative to
the WTO, when announcing her country's initiative here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal is to be discussed when the General Council
of the 132-member WTO meets on July 15.
</P>
<P>
Hayes said the minutes of General Council meetings generally
come out a month after the events, and even then they are marked
"restricted" and may remain unavailable to the press and general
public for as long as six months.
</P>
<P>
The same problem exists with panel reports, leading to
different interpretations by interested parties who would claim
victory by quoting parts of the reports, she said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has nothing to fear and everything to gain from
increased transparency, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We could televise meetings of the WTO committees and councils
starting tomorrow, and it would make no difference in the ability
of the organization to do its job," she said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, increased transparency in WTO operations
and a meaningful dialogue with civil society would go a long way
to building support for the system."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade envoy hoped that the General Council will move
to adopt the U.S. proposal immediately but conceded that some
delegations may not yet be "on board."

</P>
<P>
The value of shares changed hands also hiked from Tuesday's

<HEADLINE> World's Largest National Park Set for Himalayas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. nature protection
organization plans to join China in building one of the world's
largest national parks on eastern slopes of the Himalayan
mountains.
</P>
<P>
The nongovernmental association will pump two million
U.S. dollars into the construction of the park which will be
seven times the size of famous Yellowstone National Park
in Wyoming, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Three major rivers -- the Yangtze, Lancang and Nujiang rivers -
meander through the proposed park in southwest China's Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The area also features famous attractions such as the
snow-covered Yulong Mountains, the Nujiang Great Canyon which
features a 4,000 meter drop in elevation and Hutiao Canyon in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern part of the province bordering on the
Qinghai-Tibet and Yunnan-Guizhou plateaus features diverse
wildlife. Experts point out that the area is also a sanctuary for
flora, as well as the natural habitat for rare animals species
such as snub-nosed monkeys, black-necked cranes, pandas and
leopards.
</P>
<P>
The ecosystem in the 60,000 sq.km. park will greatly affect the
well-being of residents in the lower reaches of the three river
valleys.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the diverse cultural heritage in the region will
appeal to tourists. For example, Dayan, which has a history of
over 800 years and is home to the Naxi ethnic minority, was listed
as a World Heritage late last year. In addition, idyllic and
picturesque Zhongdian County in the Diqing Tibet Autonomous
Prefecture attracts people from throughout the world seeking the
so-called "Shangri-La".
</P>
<P>
The cultural traditions of the Tibetan, Naxi, Bai and Lisu
nationalities have been well preserved in that area, according to
an official of the association.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based association, which originally hesitated in
joining the massive park project, decided to join in the effort
following on-site visits by members of the organization's board of
directors. The board also decided to establish its Asia
representative office in Kunming.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum agreement signed by the two sides calls for the
association to provide the province with advanced management,
skilled personnel and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The park will cover an area with a total population of over
three million people, and the project will provide job
opportunities for some 1.5 million local residents.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have introduced regulations prohibiting
timbering in the area and have adopted various initiatives to
encourage tourism.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai utilized 2.86 billion
U.S. dollars in overseas investment in the first half of this
year, up 26 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase is mainly attributed to official approval of a
stainless steel project funded by Germany's Krupp and Thyssen,
which involves 1.26 billion U.S. dollars in investment.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai approved 110 overseas-funded projects in the
January-June period, half of which are industrial projects, and 43
percent of which are in the Pudong Area.
</P>
<P>
Paid-in investment amounted to 1.25 billion U.S. dollars in
that period, down 15.3 percent from the corresponding period of
last year. Shanghai expects paid-in overseas investment to amount
to 4 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The city's Mayor Xu Kuangdi says that they need to improve the
investment environment to make it an ideal place for overseas
capital.

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Changes in U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) ruled out Wednesday its acceptance of any changes
in the U.S. proposal on Israel's next troop redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Chief PNA negotiator Saeb Erekat, in an interview with the Voice
of Palestine, said the PNA could accept the U.S. proposal to have
direct talks with Israel, but will never agree to any changes in
the U.S. initiative calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that arrangement was being made for holding a
meeting between PNA deputy head Abu Mazen and Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the PNA would never make any more compromise
on the U.S. proposal, which it has already adopted. Israel has so
far rejected the U.S. plan citing that any redeployment exceeding
9 percent would endanger its security interests.
</P>
<P>
Erekat disclosed that the U.S. had renewed a promise to announce
its proposal in the near future, probably in one week's time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reconvened
the "Kitchen Cabinet" Wednesday morning to discuss the
redeployment issue and the situation facing the peace process. No
decision was made.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, which also includes Mordechai, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky, had already held several sessions before
in an attempt to take a decision on the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the Wednesday meeting, the cabinet
expressed welcome to the U.S. idea on resuming the direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks. The U.S. has demanded PNA President
Yasser Arafat to have direct talks with Mordechai, if not
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The PNA earlier rejected this request, saying the U.S. had not
specified what issues to be discussed during the talks and it
would not attend such talks without any concrete promise by the
Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for 16
months since March 1997 because of Israeli policies of expanding
settlements and refusing to carry out the long overdue troop
redeployment.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Anti-Smuggling System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that China will establish a national special police
force to combat smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of the national anti-smuggling
work conference, Zhu said China will introduce measures to
intensify the crack down on smuggling in China.
</P>
<P>
The special force, which will operate under the joint guidance
of customs administrations and public security departments, will
conduct smuggling investigations, arrest culprits involved and
conduct preliminary hearing involving related cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Public security will join customs and industrial and commercial
administrations in activities to eradicate smuggling, according
to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said all fines and proceeds earned from smuggled goods will
be handed over to the central government.
</P>
<P>
The central government will receive 30 percent of the total
proceeds in the form of taxes, with some 50 percent of the
remainder used to equip anti-smuggling departments and reward
individuals and departments contributing to the effort. Remaining
funds will go to help provincial government battle smuggling,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said that all Party and government offices, law enforcement
agencies and judiciary departments will sever relations with
affiliate companies, and conduct thorough investigations related
to smuggling activities conducted by related organizations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the State Council will examine all
anti-smuggling efforts.
</P>
<P>
He touched upon the current economic situation in China and
noted that further development of the national economy will
represent a major achievement in light of the ongoing financial
crisis in Asia.

</P>
<P>
Paid-in overseas investment in Weihai amounted to 77 million

capital instead of the Republic of Korea and other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Between January and May, investment from Japan, the ROK, and
other Asian sources dropped 23 percentage points on a yearly
basis, while investment from Europe, America, and Oceania rose
46.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Russia Discuss Security Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Russian security
officials Wednesday discussed Israel's concern over the alleged
transfer of missile technology to Iran by Russian companies,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Foreign Ministry sources as saying that
Director of the Russian Federal Security Service (RFSS) Nikolai
Kovalev was visiting Israel to discuss Israel's demand that Russia
do more to stop transferring missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss cooperation in fighting
organized crimes and international terrorism, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The RFSS, one of several successors of the former Soviet
Union's secret intelligence service the KGB, is Russia's major
counterintelligence and anti-terrorism agency.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Wednesday that Kovalev
arrived in Israel on Monday for a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky and his Israeli counterparts, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Kovalev is the first senior Russian security official to visit
Israel.
</P>
<P>
A western source was quoted by the paper as saying that his
visit marks "a new Russian desire to play a bigger role in the
Middle East than it has since the end of the Cold War."
</P>
<P>
Kovalev's visit came amid Israel's doubts about whether Russia
has done enough to halt the flow of ballistic missile technology
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials complained that although the Russian
government "has done much more than it has in the past," it fails
to completely halt the transfer of missile technology to Iran by
Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
Israel has expressed concern that its archrival Iran will
acquire sufficient technology next year to produce its own
prototype for surface-to-surface missiles that can hit the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Australian Parliamentary Report Denounces Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's approach to the Middle
East peace process was denounced here Wednesday as short-sighted
and a tragedy in an Australian parliamentary report just four
weeks before a visit to Australia by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The report was released by the Australian parliamentary
delegation led by Ian Sinclair, speaker of Australian House of
Representatives following their recent visit to Syria, Lebanon,
Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation concluded that the current position adopted by
the Israeli government on the peace process is very
short-sighted," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation is of the view that the peace process has
entered a critical period which demands timely action.
</P>
<P>
"The response of the Netanyahu government, however, suggests it
has concluded that delay is to Israel's advantage."
</P>
<P>
The report warned Israel was placing its future at risk by
stalling the peace process and puts pressure on Australian Prime
Minister John Howard ahead of his meeting with Netanyahu next
month in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation welcomes the prospect of a visit to Australia
by Prime Minister Netanyahu because it would give another
opportunity to express the strong view of the parliament,
government and people of Australia that an early settlement is
essential and that the present stance of the Israeli government is
not contributing to the achievement of that goal," the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Export 1,600 Tons of Paprika in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA,July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will export a total of 1,600
tons of paprika next year to earn the country over 1.5 million
U.S. Dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here Tuesday by Brian Hakamangwe, member of
Zambia Association for High Value Crops responsible for
production and logistics, Times of Zambia reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The association has secured export contracts with South Africa
and India, but could not export the required quota this season
due to limited production capacity, said Hakamangwe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the association which has 1,000 members at
present is recruiting more members to ensure that more
small-scale farmers join the organization to receive paprika
inputs for them to undertake production of the crop this season.
</P>
<P>
The South African market requires 50 tons of paprika from
Zambia monthly while India expects the association to export 800
tons of the crop annually, according to Hakamangwe.
</P>
<P>
This year, the association is expected to export 500 tons of
paprika to the two countries instead of the targeted 2,000 tons.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Land Auction For Commercial Uses In Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
will abolish government approval procedures for transfers of land
for commercial purpose as of August 1, 1998 and open commercial
land-use rights to public bidding.
</P>
<P>
This will mean a great change in Guangdong's approval
procedures, Yuan Zhengjie, director of the Guangdong Provincial
Land Administration Department, told a press conference today, and
will allow the market, not some particular individual, to decide
the final price of land.
</P>
<P>
Land developers in Guangdong used to obtain land-use rights
from the government directly and it was easy for corrupt officials
to influence the price of land.
</P>
<P>
The province began reforming the approval procedure in 1987,
but only 5 percent of the land for commercial development has been
auctioned publicly since then.
</P>
<P>
According to recent government regulations, all land to be used
for housing, shops, hotels and entertainment facilities will be sold
at public auctions from the beginning of next month.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Export 1,600 Tons of Paprika in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will export a total of 1,600
tons of paprika next year to earn the country over 1.5 million
U.S. Dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here Tuesday by Brian Hakamangwe, member of
Zambia Association for High Value Crops responsible for
production and logistics, Times of Zambia reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The association has secured export contracts with South Africa
and India, but could not export the required quota this season
due to limited production capacity, said Hakamangwe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the association which has 1,000 members at
present is recruiting more members to ensure that more
small-scale farmers join the organization to receive paprika
inputs for them to undertake production of the crop this season.
</P>
<P>
The South African market requires 50 tons of paprika from
Zambia monthly while India expects the association to export 800
tons of the crop annually, according to Hakamangwe.
</P>
<P>
This year, the association is expected to export 500 tons of
paprika to the two countries instead of the targeted 2,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Zambia produces the best quality paprika because of its good
climatic conditions.

<HEADLINE> China Tops Developing Countries in Attracting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China tops developing countries
in attracting direct foreign investment with its share reaching
about 45 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, the Arab Institution for
Investment Insurance (AIII) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The AIII's report showed that Brazil came as the second by
attracting some 10 billion dollars of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
It said that last year has witnessed an increase in the flow of
direct foreign investment in the world, which amounted to 364
billion dollars, a 4 percent hike over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Available statistics showed that approximately 84 percent of
the investment originated from the bloc of industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the geographic distribution of this flow, the
industrialized countries took the lion's share, or some 60
percent, while the developing countries received only about 38
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The share of developing countries of the total direct foreign
investment has increased to 135 billion dollars in 1997 from 129
billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Divided to regions, the share of the developing countries in
southeastern Asia was 85.1 billion dollars, or 63.3 percent of the
total. The Latin American and Caribbean states attracted about
13.5 billion dollars, while the share of African states was below
4 billion dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the share of Arab states of direct foreign
investment stood at about 6 billion dollars, or 4.4 percent of the
total.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Seeks Normalization with World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has expressed the determination of the nation
to normalize relations with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
It was Nigeria's desire to be more involved in world affairs
so as to contribute its quota to the cause of international peace
and the collective security of mankind, he said.
</P>
<P>
The head of state made the remarks at a meeting Tuesday with
Mamoudou Lamine Jobe, foreign minister of Gambia, who was in the
Nigerian capital Abuja as special envoy of President Yahaya
Jammeh to deliver a special message to Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
According to Abubakar, who became head of state of the most
populous African country on June 9, the international community
must work relentlessly for the cause of peace and collective
security of mankind.
</P>
<P>
He particularly appealed to the warring factions in Guinea
Bissau to go to the negotiation table for an amicable resolution
of their differences.
</P>
<P>
Receiving Cavaye Djibril, president of the national assembly
(parliament) of Cameroun, in Abuja last week, Abubakar urged
African leaders to work relentlessly toward achieving peace and
harmony within the continent.
</P>
<P>
The leaders should seek more mature, humane and diplomatic
means of settling disputes as "Africa is tired of wars", he said,
adding Nigeria would continue to live at peace with its
neighboring states in the true spirit of African solidarity and
brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's remarks are seen by observers here as a kind of
indication of the new government's foreign relations position.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been in the eye of the storm with the
international community since the regime of former Head of State
General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the June 12, 1993 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Its relations with the rest of the world worsened in November
1995 with the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his Ogoni
kinsmen.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth in its reaction suspended Nigeria's
membership, while the United States and the European Union
imposed a string of sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
Following the sudden death on June 8 of the former Head of
State General Sani Abacha and the assumption of power by General
Abubakar, the heads of the United Nations and the Commonwealth,
Kofi Annan and Emeka Anyaoku, U.S. Under-Secretary of State for
Political Affairs Thomas Pickering and British Deputy Foreign
Minister Tony Lloyd visited Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
These VIPs came to parley with Nigerian officials on the
future of democracy, human rights and the release of political
detainees, which are all issues critical to the military
government's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that the strings of visits have helped
build good fame for Abubakar both within and outside the country
and re-open the country to Western countries.

STOCKHOLM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Consumer Price Index (CPI) was
up 0.6 percent in June over the same month last year, but grew at
a slower pace compared to the 0.9 percent rise in May.
</P>
<P>
"The figure was somewhat lower than expected... This opens the
door for rate cuts," said economist Sharder Persaud, commenting on

</P>
<P>
Discounts on shoes and clothing, as shown by official
statistics, helped curb the index increase in June.
</P>
<P>
As a result, economists now are expecting to see another
interest rate cut by the Swedish Central Bank.
</P>

The bank, which follows a price stability target, last time
lowered its key "repurchase rate," or repo rate, to 4.1 percent

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs 50 Bln U.S. Dollars to Revive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B. J. Habibie
Wednesday said that the government needs 10 billion to 11 billion
U.S. dollars while the private sector needs 40 billion dollars to
revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
"It would be impossible for us to restore the economy without
help from others," Habibie told a nationwide meeting of Islamic
boarding school directors here.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) would decide to release the second 3 billion dollar tranche
of its aid to Indonesia when its 24 directors meet in Washington
on July 15 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has signed a revised bailout
agreement with the IMF on June 24 in a bid to arrest the country's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The revised agreement paved the way for the resumption of the
43 billion dollar IMF-led rescue package.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia received the first tranche of 3 billion dollars from
the IMF in November last year, but the second disbursement of 3
billion dollars was delayed due to riots in Jakarta in May and the
following political crisis in the country which forced former
president Soeharto to step down.
</P>
<P>
In a two-hour speech, Habibie said international financial
institutions and countries which have pledged funds to rescue
Indonesia from its economic crisis "have the right to judge
whether Indonesia has the credibility that would convince them to
provide what the country needs."
</P>
<P>
He also underscored the importance of unity in implementing
political, economic and judicial reforms to restore the country's
credibility to the world.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Opposition Insists on Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's major opposition group
the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) insists on the
establishment of a national unity government, despite the death
of opposition leader Chief Moshood Abiola.
</P>
<P>
This was made known during a meeting between NADECO and
Nigeria's new military leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar Tuesday
in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the second between Abubakar and NADECO since
Abubakar started his nationwide consultations on the way forward
a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting took place on June 27, at which NADECO
proposed a national unity government to be headed by Abiola, the
presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
NADECO's chairman Chief Abraham Adesanya told reporters after
Tuesday's meeting that the group's position on the unity
government has not changed, though it was yet to consider anybody
as head of the unity government.
</P>
<P>
Adesanya said there was no agreement reached at the meeting,
but Abubakar has agreed to consider NADECO's stand.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the opposition group also called for the
holding of a sovereign national conference to prepare for a new
constitution by which Nigeria will be ruled.
</P>
<P>
After taking the power in 1993, late military leader General
Sani Abacha has called a national constitutional conference, but
he kept the constitution in his drawer until his sudden death a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
Legally speaking, the country's 1979 constitution is still
valid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa's Vice-President Thambo Mbeki said in
Pretoria Tuesday that Abubakar has agreed to set up a
transitional government during his visit to Nigeria last week.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said, Abubakar is to announce the composition of the
transition government Thursday.

Warabole Village is besieged by water at a height of 1.5
meters to 1.8 meters.
</P>
<P>
"The water is lying two kilometers on every side of this
village," Fidow said, adding that the floods are now heading
toward the three directions of south, southwest and southeast at
a very high speed.
</P>
<P>
"At this rate, the highway between Mogadishu and Ballidogle
Airport, 90 kilometers south of the capital, will be cut off in
less than a week unless something tangible is done against that,"
said Fidow.
</P>
<P>
There are five bridges under which the rain water or floods
passed through, he said, "but now they are blocked by mud and
stones, so that the water can't run beneath them."
</P>
<P>
The road between Mogadishu and Ballidogle has only been
rehabilitated recently after it was destroyed by the heavy floods
last years which killed around 2,000 people and more than 35,000
heads of livestock and devastated at least 60,000 hectares of
farmlands.
</P>
<P>
The floods seriously affected more than half a million people
in the regions of Middle Shabelle, Lower Shabelle, Middle Jubba
and Lower Jubba, Bay and Bakol.
</P>
<P>
There is a growing concern that floods may again devastate
thousands hectares of farmlands and residential areas in several
regions of southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
River Shabelle burst its banks earlir this week near Balad
Town of Middle Shabelle region, 30 kilometers north of the
capital, making the water cross to the Lower Shabelle Region.
</P>
<P>
The travelers from Baidoa and Ballidogle Airport are also
speaking about a large lake-like water being created about 45
kilometers south of the airport submerging most of the trees.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people including women and children who have
already been displaced by the floods are now scattered in
Lamadonka Village, 42 kilometers south of Mogadishu, and beside
the main road between the capital and Ballidogle airport.
</P>
<P>
The displaced people are seriously suffering because of lack
of food and shelter in this rainy season.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Allowed to Withdraw EFP Money Upon Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners including
Singapore nationals employed in Malaysia can withdraw their
Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributions even before reaching
the age of 55 upon leaving the country, the EFP said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This special permission, especially for Singaporeans, has been
given since October 1996 under an amendment to the Employees
Provident Fund Act 1991, EPF public relations officer Nik Affendi
Jaafar said, according to Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
As withdrawal is not automatic, foreign workers can submit
applications to take out the contributions before leaving
Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that it was not mandatory for foreign
workers to contribute to the EPF.
</P>
<P>
The EPF contributions, as of last December 31, accumulated to
130.85 billion ringgit (31.53 billion U.S. dollars), according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, several parties in Malaysia asked Singapore
to review its ruling disallowing peninsular Malaysians no longer
employed in the republic from withdrawing their Central Provident
Fund (CPF) contributions before reaching 55.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians from Sabah and Sarawak, East Malaysia, like other
foreigners, are, however, exempted from this ruling.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) President Zainal Rampak
has urged Singapore to amend its CPF laws to enable peninsular
Malaysians no longer working there to automatically withdraw their
CPF contributions.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
invited a Malaysian telecommunications giant to negotiate for the
sale of 51 percent of the newly restructured Uganda
Telecommunications Limited (UTL).
</P>
<P>
This decision has been made following the other three of the
four bidders failed to submit their bids by the deadline on July
10, 1998, the New Vision newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Divestiture Reform and Implementation Committee (DRIC),
the cabinet sub-committee on privatization, Tuesday canceled the
bidding process and invited Telekom Malaysia International (TMI)
to enter into direct negotiations with government toward the
purchase of the UTL shares for sale.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Tuesday by the Enterprise Development
Project, a body responsible for privatization in Uganda, said
that at its meeting on July 14, the DRIC reviewed the status of
the UTL privatization.
</P>

On April 28, 1998, four groups were approved for UTL's 51
percent shares for sale.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Central Bank to Toughen Regulation on Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
said it was tightening regulations on the banking industry in
order to prepare it for the competitive pressures of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Most significant of the central bnak's measures were new rules
governing directors' access to lending, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CBK said in future loans to directors and senior management
must be sanctioned by the full board of directors, be on similar
terms to those to other customers and be disclosed in published
accounts.
</P>
<P>
"In order to achieve a complete arm's length relationship, a
new proposal will be made in the foreseeable future where
directors will not be permitted to take any loan facility from
the bank on whose board they serve," CBK said in its monthly
economic review for July.
</P>
<P>
If a loan becomes non-performing, a director will be
automatically disqualified from the board. Banks could also be
open to penalties if the banking act is violated, CBK said.
</P>
<P>
In March, the government fired three directors, the general
manager and the executive chairman of Kenya Commercial Bank,
the largest retail bank in East Africa, after local media reported
they had been allowed irregular and unsecured loans.
</P>
<P>
Concerns have been mounting about the extent of non-performing
loans which Kenyan banks are carrying.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans are estimated at 43.8 billion Shillings
(736 million Dollars) at the end of December last year out of an
overall 209 billion Shillings in loans and advances.
</P>
<P>
There are 14 non-bank financial institutions and 53 commercial
banks, of which 26 face the risk of closure next year when a new
banking rule takes effect forcing them to increase their capital
base.

PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- One of the soccer fans hit by a car
on the Champs Elysee during World Cup celebrations early on Monday
has died, a hospital spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Around 80 revellers were injured when the car, driven by a
44-year old woman, ploughed into the crowds which had gathered in
the avenue after France's victory over Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The dead man, who was not named, was in his 40s. One radio
station reported that he was a Romanian.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three people are still in hospital, ten of them still in
a serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who was a teacher, has been sent to a psychiatric
hospital. Police said she had been suffering psychiatric problems
for some time and was apparently panicked by the crowds.
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that nearly 1.5 million people poured into the
elegant, central avenue for a night of singing and dancing that
was probably the biggest outdoor celebration in the French capital
since Liberation Day in 1944.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM Urges Japan to Tackle Economic Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan needs to urgently tackle
its economic problems as the country's recovery is central to the
future of entire Asia, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a group of Australian exporters in Melbourne,
Downer said the Asian crisis is the most significant external
economic shock to Australia in nearly 20 years, with Japan the
crucial factor in determining when Asia would recover.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of goods and services which Australia exports
go to Asia each year.
</P>
<P>
"The weekend's upper house election result and Prime Minister
(Ryutaro) Hashimoto's subsequent resignation demonstrate the
seriousness of the economic situation in Japan and the urgency
with which Japan's economic problems need to be addressed," Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese recovery is central to the fortunes of East Asia. It
is crucial that Japan takes measures to ensure its economy does
not slide into deep recession, seeing further devaluation in the
yen," Downer was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Downer, who visited Indonesia last week, warned that Indonesia
would also require international help for at least a year if it is
to overcome its economic and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand and South Korea have both been making good
progress in their reforms.
</P>
<P>
Asia would recover and it is important not to be pessimistic
about the region's economic crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The economic strengths which made East Asia highly attractive
to global investors over the past two decades have not
disappeared."
</P>
<P>
"High savings rates continue and an increasingly skilled and
educated workforce will be able to capitalize on the upswing which
will inevitably come in due course," he added.

YANTAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Two mirages that appeared on the

Local people reported a foggy belt of lights with mountains and

Buildings, chimneys, towers, streets, and street lights could
all be seen, then the sky became clear again.

Several thousand tourists saw the mirages, and many more have
come to the city in recent days in hopes of seeing the phenomenon
again.
</P>
<P>
Penglai faces the Bohai and Huanghai seas and is known as a
dwelling place of the gods. There are records of many mirages in

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Announce Transition Government: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new leader General Abdulsalam
Abubakar has agreed to set up a transition government and is expected
to announce the composition of it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights of what South African Vice-President
Thambo Mbeki told reporters in Pretoria Tuesday on his visit to
Nigeria last week, the official newspaper New Nigerian reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The transition government, according to Mbeki, will handle
constitutional review and coordinate moves toward credible democratic
election activities which the current military regime said would best
be handled by civilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, during his visit last week, met with the head of state and
some opposition groups in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said the transition government would be set up because the
opposition groups and the authorities wanted to avoid a drift into
ethnic tension.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, South Africa is keenly interested in the
political stability of Nigeria, considering its leading role in Africa
and its size of population.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also quoted South African government sources as
saying that Nigerians regarded South Africa as an honest broker,
despite the sour relations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
There is suspicion about direct involvement of the United States,
Britain and France in the transition program because, unlike South
Africa, they have major commercial interests in Nigeria, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Names New Interior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate President Mohammad
Khatami Wednesday named Vice President for Legal and Parliamentary
Affairs Seyed Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari as the new Interior
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the nomination in a letter to Majlis (Parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, which was read at the parliament's
open session Wednesday morning, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri said that the Majlis would hold a vote of
confidence for Lari next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Though viewed also as one of Khatami's strong supporters, Lari
is expected to receive a vote of confidence from the
conservative-dominated Majlis, because he is more cautious than
the former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was impeached by the Majlis on June 21 in a no-confidence
vote for his radical views on carrying out liberal reforms in the
country. But Khatami soon appointed him vice president for
development and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
To be appointed, Lari will need a majority of votes in the
270-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lari, 44, was twice elected Majlis members and appointed vice
president for legal and parliamentary affairs last August
following Khatami's election.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Judge Stresses Judicial Openness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) - Judge Xiao Yang, the president of
China's Supreme People's Court, in commenting on China Central
Televsion's recent live broadcast of a civil suit, said that open
trials increase judicial openness, prevent "darkroom operations",
and see to it that justice is served.
</P>
<P>
On July 11, CCTV covered a copyright violation case involving
10 Chinese film studios in Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said in an interview today that judicial reforms are an
important part of the political reforms discussed at the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China held last autumn
and an important move by the Supreme People's Court this year to
re-educate judges across the country.
</P>
<P>
Open trials are not, he added, a new invention of the SPC, and,
according to the Chinese Constitution and laws, all trials, except
those involving state secrets, personal privacy, and juveniles,
are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
He explained that some local courts have opened their
proceedings to the media before and the live broadcasts got a good
reception by the public, and he encouraged the courts and media
organizations to continue with this practice.
</P>
<P>
He said that they are also an effective way to protect judicial
independence, and that Chinese courts hear 5.2 million criminal,
civil, economic, and administrative cases annually, and are mostly
independent in their judgements.
</P>
<P>
"However, a few officials in some places do not
properly use their power or they even abuse it," he said, pointing
out that courts, whose personnel and finances are controlled
locally, sometimes have to deal with individual interference and
find it difficult making a fair and independent judgement.
</P>
<P>
"Open trials can curb or eliminate the interference or such
factors as personal favors, power, and money," Xiao concluded, and
said they also help increase public awareness of the law, improve
efficiency and proficiency in the judiciary, and prevent
corruption in law-enforcement.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Inch Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Share prices inched up on the
Singapore Stock Market Wednesday as a strong overnight rally on
Wall Street, New York, and stable regional currencies lifted the
market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) gained
13.57 points to close at 1056.01 points.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said the gains were unlikely to be sustained
as the underlying sentiment for the Singapore market remained weak
and uncertain ahead of further political developments in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 108.98 million shares
valued at 180.25 million Singapore dollars (about 106.66 million
U.S. dollars). Gainers outstripped losers by 229 to 75 while 287
stocks remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
MBF Cap was the most active stock as it registered a turnover
of 7.09 million units. It was followed by TAC 200 which had 6.35
million shares done. SingTel was next with 4.42 million shares
changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Bukit Sem was the top gainer of the day as it gained 65 cents
to end at 8.10 Singapore dollars. Rothmans M edged up 50 cents to
finish at 11.90 Singapore dollars. Jurship inched up by 40 cents
to close at 8.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Tasek was the biggest loser as it lost 63
cents to finish at 1.35 Singapore dollars. Creative 50 fell by 50

<HEADLINE> Intel Earnings Off 29 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation reported
Tuesday a 29 percent drop in earnings and a sequentially flat
revenue in the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The chip-making giant's second quarter revenue was 5.9 billion
dollars, compared to 6 billion dollars a year ago. Its net income
of the same period stood at 1.2 billion dollars, down 29 percent
from a year ago and 8 percent from the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
But the company said in a statement that cost-cutting measures
and new products should boost its revenue in the next quarter.
</P>
<P>
Intel plans to move to the 0.18 micron chipmaking process by
the second quarter of 1999, one quarter earlier than expected.
This will help increase chip yields and allow for the introduction
of newer, faster 32-bit processors.
</P>
<P>
Intel's earning cuts in the first two quarters this year may
verify a cyclical phenomenon of the sector. Computer chip making
has always been a cyclical business, in which improvements in
production may periodically cause oversupply, which in turn drives
down prices and profits.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say the oversupply of computers and
microprocessors now seems to be easing, which may clear the way
for sales, at possibly higher prices in the second half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Intel cautioned today that there will be continual inventory
adjustment as the industry attempts to become more efficient.
</P>
<P>
The company predicted a mild revenue growth in the third quarter
this year and a greater revenue in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 1988 has not been a banner year for the processor
giant. First-quarter sales slumped because of a slowdown in
computer demand, leading the company to announce a reduction of
3,000 employees. Subsequently, Intel had to put off the release of
its 64-bit Merced chip until 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The recent strong correlation
between the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen was stretched
Wednesday in the aftermath of strong gains in both currencies.
</P>
<P>
The domestic currency maintained most of the ground it made in
offshore overnight dealings to finish the local session at 62.20
U.S. cents, up from the previous close of 61.67 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the unit has closed above 62 U.S. cents
in a week.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Japanese yen lost some strength during Asian time zone
trading, to close against the U.S. dollar at 140.78 yen from
141.36 yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed in Sydney at 87.56 yen from 87.19
yen previously, and at 1.1218 German marks from 1.1094 marks.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Uncompromising Over Wage Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite the opposition of a
coalition partner, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has voted
to reject a wage hike exceeding 20 percent for the public sector,
a newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I would not give half a percentage point more than 20 percent"
to the wage rise for the public sector employees, the Daily News
quoted Yilmaz as telling a meeting of parliament members of his
Motherland Party (ANAP) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Turkey Party, a ruling coalition partner, Monday
demanded that public sector's wages be raised by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
It warned that if the demand was not accepted by ANAP and
another coalition partner Democratic Left Party, its ministers
would not sign the decision on a 20 percent wage hike and would
continue their struggle in the government.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz argued that even a 20 percent wage hike would cost 280
trillion Turkish Liras (about 1.037 billion U.S. dollars), and it
was impossible to finance a 40 percent wage hike from the existing
budget.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Police Arrest Bomb-Hurling Orangemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Northern Irish police, firing
rubber bullets, arrested 13 bomb-hurling "hooligans" during a
clash with the Protestant Orangemen on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Police also seized a van in clash with the angry protesters who
were barred from marching down a Catholic area in Portadown, 50 km
south-west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said on Wednesday that around 10 blast bombs
and petrol bombs were thrown at security forces who responded with
plastic bullets during the night. So far there were no reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
He said the violence was the work of a "small group of
hooligans" who had tried to break down barriers erected by
security forces to prevent the Orange Order from carrying out its
planned march along Portadown's mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
The clashes have continued since July 5, when the Orange Order
began their annual parade in defiance of the ban issued by a
parade commission and stopped by police. The Orange Order has
vowed to walk through the traditional route no matter how long
they have to wait.
</P>
<P>
The violence has threatened to wreck last April's historic
peace agreement intended to draw a line under three decades of
sectarian and political violence in Northern Ireland that has cost
more than 3,600 lives.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hails Kiriyenko's Visit to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia called the first visit by
its Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to Japan a success, saying it
will ensure the development of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted by the
Itar-Tass news agency Wednesday as saying that the one-day visit
Monday was marked by "significant practical results."
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Kiriyenko and Japanese leaders discussed
economic cooperation issues, especially cooperation in the
framework of the Yeltsin-Hashimoto plan made in Krasnoyarsk in
late 1997, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a memorandum on concluding an
intergovernmental agreement on protecting and encouraging
investment. They reached an agreement on extending 800-million
U.S. dollars of loans to Russia by Japan's Export and Import Bank
as part of the 1.5-billion-dollar untied credit.
</P>
<P>
The two parties also exchanged letters on extending the 1993
agreement on peaceful space research.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said it is important in principle that the Japanese
leadership has fully supported the Russian government's economic
stabilization course and that he is confident in Moscow's ability
to overcome the current difficulties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's visit was not affected by the political
changes in Japan, demonstrating a high degree of stability of the
Russian-Japanese relations, the Russian spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned on Monday to
take responsibility for his party's setback in the upper house
election of the Japanese parliament.

CHONGQING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese historians
have been researching the bombing of Chongqing City during World
War II, an event which brought serious destruction to the city by
Japanese invaders in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that between 1938 and 1943, Japan bombed the
southwestern China city some 2,000 times, killing or injuring more
than 20,000 people and leaving over 60,000 buildings in ruins.
</P>
<P>
Many university students have volunteered to take part in the
research. They have visited survivors and collected a large amount
of written material along with more than 100 pictures.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, the provisional capital after the fall of Nanjing
during the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945), is now
China's newly established municipality directly under the central
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank had
extended 172.9 billion yuan in real estate loans by the end of
June, with individual housing accounting for 26 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources say that in the first half of the year, the bank
added 35.1 billion yuan in housing development loans, or more than
one and a half times the amount for the same period last year, and
individual housing loans of 10.8 billion yuan, or almost 3 times
the amount for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank has made an effort to work with the state's
"relatively comfortable housing project" and by the end of last
year, project loans had amounted to 14.3 billion yuan, or 93.4
percent of its total credit plan for the project. In 1997, it
provided 7.1 billion yuan for building 44.38 million sq.m. of
housing for the project.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman says that it has improved its operations and
simplified housing loan procedures, and provides new credit
services for individual housing.
</P>

This year the bank plans to increase its real estate loans by
50 billion yuan and individual housing loans by 3.5 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua)-- Splendid China Miniature Scenic
Spots and China Folk Culture Villages have become the first two
tourist attractions in China to receive IS09002 certificates from
the International Standardization Organization.
</P>
<P>
These tourism "trump cards" of the Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone were granted the certificates for their nationally renowned
good service and management. Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, is
also a major tourist city of south China.
</P>
<P>
To further excel, the two scenic spots applied for the ISO9002
standard in August 1997, according to the "China Youth Daily."
In an effort to improve service, concrete measures concerning
worker responsibility and the service process are now in place.
</P>
<P>
For example, workers are required to patiently listen to
complaints from tourists and report them in a timely manner to
relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
The toilet facilities in these scenic spots are another fine
example of standard service, providing users not only with soap
and toilet paper, but also with background music and decorative
potted plants.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Strengthen Audit Functions of Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
strengthen the auditing functions of the Philippine Central Bank
and the Deposits Insurance Corp. to make the two agencies more
effective in their role of averting bank failures and closures in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said in a news release
Wednesday that endowing more audit powers will enable the two
agencies to determine with certainty the cause of any bank failure
and the assistance and other remedial measures that must be
extended.
</P>
<P>
With more audit powers, the two agencies can immediately
recommend government takeover of banks having financial problems,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said while some small thrift and rural banks are faced
with problems, the country's banking system as a whole is stable.
</P>
<P>
On further liberalization of the banking sector by allowing
more foreign banks to enter into the country, Espiritu said the
proposals are for foreign investors to own up to 60 percent of a
bank.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 100 percent ownership of a bank by foreign
capitalists pertains to takeovers or full acquisition by foreign
banks of distressed local banks, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Budget Deficit Controlled Below Ceiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has successfully kept the
budget deficit below the projected yearly ceiling of 42 percent in
the first half of 1998, the Daily Star newspaper said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report by the Lebanese Finance Ministry as
saying that the deficit stood at 35 percent at the end of June,
the lowest level in five years.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the achievement mainly to the increase of
the revenues, which amounted to 1.52 billion U.S. dollars in the
first six months of 1998, rising by 27 percent from those in the
same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Spendings also decreased by 10 million dollars to 2.34 billion
dollars compared with those in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report highlighted the real estate fees collected by the
Finance Ministry, which increased by 15 percent to 81.12 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of State for Financial Affairs Fuad Sinyoura
has anticipated a further fall of the budget deficit by the end of
this year due to a drop of the interest rates of the treasury
bills.

JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will build four
new prisons throughout the country to reduce the pressure on
overcrowded prisons, the daily Star newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the new prisons is due to be accomplished
within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The new jails, to be jointly built by the government and
private companies, would be better run at cheaper operating costs
than existing prisons in the country, Public Works Minister Jeff
Radebe was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The four jails with the cost between 200 million Rand (33
million U.S. Dollars) and 300 million Rand (50 million U.S. Dollars)
would increase the existing national capacity of jails, currently
96,000 beds, by 5300 beds.
</P>
<P>
"This (is) a completely new way of procurement and gives
effect to the government's approach of inviting private
enterprise in partnerships to deliver much-needed public
services," Radebe said.
</P>
<P>
Bert Slabber, Spokesperson for Correctional Services Minister,
said: "The private sector are more business-minded and can run
prisons more cheaply than we can."

<P>
-- The members of the French football team were the vedettes at
the National Day garden party in the Elysee presidential compound
on Tuesday, during which President Chirac raised the World Cup and
called on the right wing oppositions to union. Chirac, who
predicted a 2-1 win by France against Brazil, also deliberately
let the footballers and their wives and girl friends to appear with
him after his television address.
</P>
<P>
-- Two brilliant Italian academics in the philosophy of

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Seeking Mechanism to Implement UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian envoy to the
U.N. Nasser Kedwa said Wednesday the Palestinian National
Authority is seeking a mechanism to implement the U.N. statement
urging Israel not to expand Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side together with the U.N. will work to find
such a mechanism," said Kedwa in a telephone interview with the
Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement late
Monday urging Israel to rescind its Jerusalem expansion plan and
"not to take any other steps which would prejudice the outcome of
the permanent status negotiations" with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accord, the status of Jerusalem should be
determined in the final status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. and Britain tried to prevent the Security Council
from voting on an Arab-sponsored resolution condemning Israel, and
the 15 council members finally adopted a watered-down presidential
statement, which is non-binding and does not carry the same weight
as a resolution.
</P>
<P>
Israel, under a storm of criticism from the international
community by approving on June 21 the controversial plan to extend
Jerusalem's boundaries to include some Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, has rejected the statement and vowed to go ahead with
the expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
If Israel fails to abide by the presidential statement, Kedwa
warned that, the council will reconsider all Israeli measures.
</P>
<P>
There is an "organic relation" between the recent U.N. decision
to upgrade the Palestinian status in the world body and the
Palestinian determination to declare an independent state in May
1999, Kedwa said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly on July 7 voted overwhelmingly to
upgrade the status of the Palestine Liberation Organization from
an observer to that of near statehood.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians has repeatedly said that an independent
Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as capital will be set up in
May 1999, regardless of the outcome of negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked for 16
months over Israeli settlement construction and a long-overdue
Israeli pullout from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review (1) China Takes Stern Measures to Rectify Banking Sector by Xu Xingtang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
China's central bank, is taking stern measures to put the banking
sector in good order as been evidenced by the recent closure of
the Hannan Development Bank and China Venturetech Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
The first half of this year also saw a number of financial
institutions and dozens of individuals severely punished for
illegal banking practices.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time PBOC has shut down a commercial bank,
and it is also unprecedented that so many financial institutions
and individuals were punished in such a short time.
</P>
<P>
China's financial operations in the first half of this year
were marked by intensified rectification and the establishment of
a solid financial order, one of the key aspects of the central
bank's reforming efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan Development Bank and the non-banking financial
institutions that have been shut down became insolvent due to
serious illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned economic system, the central bank would have
done something to "rescue" them. Instead, the PBOC revoked their
licenses and allowed them to close, indicating the central bank's
determination to rectify the financial order.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review (2) China Takes Stern Measures to Rectify Banking Sector by Xu Xingtang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the State Council convened a national financial working
conference last November, the prevention of financial risk was at
the top of the country's financial reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
China has set a clear target for financial reforms: the
establishment of a modern financial system that is suited to the
socialist market economy. The essence of the reform is to push
banks into the market and have them operate in accordance with the
law governing market operations.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year all the scheduled reforms
were gradually carried out, of which rectification of the
financial order was especially emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In May the PBOC punished eight financial institutions in
Yunnan, Anhui, Henan, Hubei and other provinces for their
malpractices. Thereafter, more financial institutions and
individuals involved in illegal operations received severe
punishment.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC has also initiated pilot projects in some
provinces to restructure rural credit cooperatives in a bid to
ward off financial risk in these cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China is improving its legal environment for
the rectification of the financial order. Following the
regulations on the punishment of people involved in financial
malpractices issued by the PBOC in June, new procedures on closing
illegal financial institutions and illegal financial operations
were adopted by the State Council on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Related sources say that in order to tighten supervision over
financial institutions, financial authorities are formulating a
series of programs for rectifying the financial order and
preventing financial risk.

<HEADLINE> No Compromise Talks Yet with Marcoses: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Wednesday emphasized that the government has not yet entered into
any negotiations with the Marcoses concerning the settlement of
the ill-gotten wealth cases against them.
</P>
<P>
Estrada assured the public in a statement that his
administration will remain transparent on the issue, and will
immediately inform the public of any development on a possible
compromise settlement.
</P>
<P>
"If an out-of-court settlement is forged then the Filipino
people will know about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration has already suffered a barrage of
criticism from several sectors on the issue although the
Presidential Commission on Good Government has not yet even talked
directly to the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
Estrada noted that his predecessors, former presidents Fidel
Ramos and Corazon Aquino, initiated out-of-court settlements with
relatives and close associates of the late president Marcos
without any strong opposition from the public.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Estrada announced he will seek the advice of
Congress on any proposed compromise settlement between the
government and the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
Estrada had said his administration is ready to enter into a
compromise agreement with the Marcoses over the ill-gotten wealth
suits so the money could be used to uplift the living standard of
the poor.
</P>
<P>
He said the cash-strapped government could use the money from
the compromise deal to bankroll mass housing projects, livelihood
and job-generation programs and agricultural reforms to ensure
food security.

<HEADLINE> China Using Foreign Expertise To Expand Software Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Carl Hsu, the president of Lucent
Technologies' Communications Software Business Group, says that
China badly needs management technology and expertise to
develop large scale software systems.
</P>
<P>
He says that although the country has the best software writers
in the world, most Chinese software companies have failed to
develop large software systems.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 5,000 software companies, most of them
small. Total software sales in China amounted to 11 billion yuan
(1.3 billion US dollars) in 1997, with foreign products accounting
for 70 percent of that.
</P>
<P>
International software developers like Microsoft, IBM, and
Lucent are major suppliers of system software to the country's
transport, telecommunications, banking, and education sectors.
</P>
<P>
Hsu says that over the next three years Lucent, which is one of
the largest communications software suppliers in the world, will
put 200 million yuan into Beijing's Asia Pacific Communications
Software Regional Technology Center. Bell Labs set the center up
as part of a move to use foreign expertise to improve technology
in the software industry. The center will hire 200 local people to
develop large software systems.
</P>
<P>
China has designated the software industry as a pillar of the
economy and will direct resources into a Chinese operating system,
support systems, different software applications and the
government is sponsoring the first copyright software engineering
system to provide state-of-the-art tools for Chinese software
developers.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan and South Korea, co-hosts of
the 2002 World Cup, are pushing ahead with their plans to build
new stadiums in spite of the economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to the plans, each country has already identified 10
host venues.
</P>
<P>
Japan has completed two stadiums, Yokohama and Osaka and will
build other venues include Kobe, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Niigata, Oita,
Saitama, Sapporo and Shizuoka.
</P>
<P>
While venues in three South Korean cities, Pusan, Taegu and
Inchon, are under now construction.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government will provide 30 percent of the
costs of building each of the 10 stadiums.
</P>
<P>
The construction of nine of the stadiums in Japan will be
completed by the spring of 2001 with the last one in the city of
Kobe set to be finished by the autumn.
</P>
<P>
With 64 matches taking place in the 2002 World Cup finals, each
of the 20 stadiums selected by the two countries could be expected
to hold only three matches.
</P>
<P>
The opening game will be held in Seoul along with the third
place play-off if FIFA does not scrap that match.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup final will be staged in Japan at either the newly
constructed 70,000-seat Yokohama International Stadium or the
63,000-seat Saitama Prefectural Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Shandong to Enlarge Jinan Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province plans
to invest 800 million yuan for the enlargement of Jinan Airport to
hasten its economic development.
</P>
<P>
The current airport, located in the provincial capital of
Jinan, was built in 1992 and now serves 19 domestic and
overseas airlines.
</P>
<P>
The airport is expected to handle 500,000 passengers this year.
</P>
<P>
But with poor facilities, the airport fails to meet the
increasing demand for air transportation, and it is incapable of
handling large long-distance civil planes with full loads, said an
airport official.
</P>
<P>
The expansion projects include extending the current runway
from 2,600 m. to 3,600 m., and building a new parallel slide and
a 50,000-sq.-m. lounge.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the airport will be capable of handling three
million passengers and long-distance large and medium-sized planes
such as Boeing-747s and MD-11s.
</P>
<P>
The enlargement is now under way, according to the
official, who added that the new runway will be opened in October
1999.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warned Against Targeting UN Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations peacekeeping
force in south Lebanon has issued a strong warning to Israeli army
against targeting the peacekeepers, the Daily Star reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded statement, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) said it was unacceptable to target UNIFIL troops and
Israeli troops should avoid the repetition of such mistakes, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, an Irish soldier of the UNIFIL and a Lebanese
civilian were wounded when Israeli mortar shells hit a UNIFIL jeep
in the Hataida village in the central sector of Israeli-occupied
zone.
</P>
<P>
The village is believed to be a hideout for the Iranian-backed
anti-Israeli guerrilla group Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Monday raid came shortly after its post in Sojud in
the eastern sector of the zone was attacked by the guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
The Irish soldier is the first U.N. peacekeeper wounded in
south Lebanon so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Since the UNIFIL was established in 1978 after Israel's first
invasion of Lebanon, 222 peacekeepers have died in separate
incidents, 38 of them were Irish soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-member UNIFIL was deployed to restore peace and
security across the border between Israel and Lebanon, and observe
the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has long complained that the U.N. troops have been
ineffective in protecting its northern areas from Lebanese
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon in 1985, Lebanese resistance groups spearheaded by
the Hezbollah have been fighting to oust the Israeli occupation
troops.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise for 3rd Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices surged in Tokyo for the
third consecutive trading day Wednesday, boosted by active stock
purchases by foreign brokerages.
</P>
<P>
But renewed fears over Japan's feeble banking system prevented
the key Nikkei index from posting strong gains.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 125.23 points, or 0.76
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 16,614.14.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 8.66 points or 0.68 percent to
1,275.31.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 450
million shares from Tuesday's 402.08 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel, attractive to some because of its relatively low
share price and outstanding liquidity, was the day's most heavily
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Healthy stock purchases by foreign brokerages and the record
high seen in the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight in New
York buoyed market sentiment, traders said.
</P>
<P>
But stocks struggled to advance further as institutional
investors quickly sold off shares to seek out better buys.
</P>
<P>
Also dragging on share prices was the fall of many bank stocks
in reaction to market rumors that Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
(LTCB) and Sumitomo Trust and Banking had given up on a possible
merger, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 635 to 497, with 142 issues finishing
unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Parliament decided late
Tuesday night to put a censure motion against Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz on its agenda, the Milliyet daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The motion, submitted by the opposition Virtue Party (FP), was
approved by 225-213.
</P>
<P>
The motion charged that Yilmaz had illegally assigned a plot of
land belonging to the state-owned paper and pulp company SEKA in
Izmit, near Istanbul, to the industrialist giant Koc Group.
</P>
<P>
The FP, True Path Party (DYP), National Movement Party and
some other political parties supported the motion.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary hearing will be held within seven days
according to the law, the paper said.

allegations that Yilmaz had omitted some shares in Turkey's
Finance Bank between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the inquiry into Yilmaz's private wealth
was a retaliation launched by the DYP for a probe into its leader
Tansu Ciller's private property.

JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new Labor

<HEADLINE> Iranian Guards Commander Vows to Protect World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Iranian Islamic
Revolution's Guards Corps (IRGC) Yehya Rahim Safavi has said that
the IRGC would not only protect Iran, but also the Muslims
worldwide, the Iran Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The IRGC intends to safeguard the Islamic Revolution (of
Iran)," Safavi said Tuesday during a visit to an IRGC battalion.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that IRGC's duty "is not limited to Iran only,
it pertains to the entire Muslim population worldwide."
</P>
<P>
The IRGC belongs to the oppressed, and "wherever the voice of a
Muslim is raised, it will be responded to" by the force through
the orders of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
Safavi's remarks have indicated that the IRGC holds on to the
policy of exporting Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
After Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric,
came to power last August, the government has repeatedly stated
that Iran follows a policy of non-interference in other countries'
internal affairs and seeks ties with the rest of the world based
on mutual respect and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC commander said the IRGC needed to be armed with "the
most advanced technology available."
</P>
<P>
"We should become more familiarized with modern know-how and
adhere to faith, in order to be able to fight against the
enemies."

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
which is badly in need of water, plans to import water-efficient
irrigation equipment from overseas over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The province has only 357 cubic meters per capita of water
resources, less than a sixth of the nation's average and far less
than the international standards of 1,000 cubic meters per capita.
</P>
<P>
The drying-up of the Yellow River and the increasing use of
water for economic development have worsened the situation, so, the
province will spend nearly 3 billion yuan annually over the next
three years developing some 333,000 hectares of irrigated farmland
using the new equipment.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has made a great effort to use
water-efficient irrigation methods and has more than 3.33 million
hectares of farmland irrigated this way.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, it has imported irrigation equipment from
France, Austria, and Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has disovered a
living fish in the central part of the Taklamakan desert in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yiyu, vice-president of Chinese Academy of Sciences,
China's top scientific research institute, discovered the fish
swimming happyly in a water pit near No.4 Tazhong Oilfield in the
desert.
</P>
<P>
He was there on a field investigation for planting more trees
in the oilfields there.
</P>
<P>
Taklamakan suffers from serious drought and is generally
believed to be a place where aquatic life cannot survive.
</P>
<P>
The black fish is about a thumb's length and pencil thin.
</P>
<P>
Chen has ruled out the possibility that the fish was brought to
the desert for breeding by people working there.
</P>
<P>
Chen, authority on aquatic animals, said the fish is a kind of
freshwater fish and has already adapted itself to the slightly
salty water.
</P>
<P>
Chen said workers in the desert use bulldozers in highway
construction and many pits are carved out by the digging, and
some of the pits then fill with ground water.
</P>
<P>
Though the temperature is often as high as 40 degrees centigrade
in summer, the water in the pit often remains because of the
constant addition of ground water.
</P>
<P>
The oil workers have built a 522-kilometer long highway across
the desert.
</P>
<P>
With the help of scientists from the CAS, 13 hectares of desert
plants have been planted along the highway along with housing for
the workers.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have since brought the fish to Beijing for further
research.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Ten people, including a pregnant
woman, were burnt to death in southwestern Kenya Monday night
when an overturned petrol tanker burst into flames as villagers
scrambled for the liquid.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 others suffered serious burns in Siaya District,
Nyanza Province, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tanker overturned after a tire burst at about 7:00 p.m..
The Daily Nation newspaper quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the
fire was started after one of the onlookers struck a match,
apparently trying to light a cigarette as the villagers scrambled
for leaking fuel.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the tanker was still burning, with five
bodies lying next to it.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Nairobi said that the tanker belonged to the Total
Uganda Company. The tanker's loader and driver were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
The tanker had reportedly drawn the petrol at the Kisumu depot
of the Kenya Oil Pipeline and was heading for Ugandan capital
Kampala when the accident occurred.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Capital Turning Into Modern Commercial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, famous as one of the world's
four major ancient capitals along with Athens, Cairo and Rome, is
fast becoming a modern commercial center in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
By financial restructuring and opening up to the outside world,
this capital city of northwest China's Shaanxi Province has set up
a new commercial system of varied forms of ownership and established
direct economic and trade ties with more than 100 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, some comparatively large state-owned
commercial firms have been merged into eight groups, four of which
have been listed on the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Over 93 percent of the local small shops also have introduced
various types of ownership. As a result, 90 percent of money-losing
businesses have reduced losses or became profitable.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an has also spent about 4.6 billion yuan on construction of
commercial facilities in the last five years. At present, the city
has 20 large and medium-sized department stores and 500-odd small
markets.
</P>
<P>
Improved facilities and investment environment have attracted
over 20 commercial firms from the United States, Japan, Italy and
Germany for establishing joint ventures or trade links with Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an was the starting point of the ancient Silk Road, the
route over which China's silk, tea and compasses, as well as the
expertise needed to make paper, gunpowder and herbal medicines
were exported to West Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
In 221 B.C., the Qin Dynasty, China's first feudal dynasty,
made the city its capital. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907),
Xi'an was the largest international metropolis in the world and
home to a population of one million people.

<HEADLINE> NZ, Australia Both Claim Seabed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand and Australia are
each laying claim to the same piece of continental shelf seabed.
</P>
<P>
According to today's local newspaper the Evening Post, the
claimed area includes seabed between the North Island of New
Zealand and Lord Howe Island, an Australian-owned island off the
coast of New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman James Funnell
was quoted as saying that a "long, drawn out process" was involved
before anything was decided. Four joint surveys have been carried
out to determine continental shelf boundaries between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Because the continental shelf is part of the land mass, it
becomes claimable territory, Funnell said.
</P>
<P>
"We are or have been doing joint seabed surveys with the
Australians," he said. "And we are both going off and doing our
own interpretation of data and then we are going to get together.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are a couple of areas of seabed outside both
countries' 200-mile economic zones that we both have an interest
in. What we are trying to do by doing this survey work is to reach
some points of agreement on what we lay claim to," Funnell said,
adding "No one is on the verge of doing anything. We're just very
carefully working through the data from the surveys and then we're
talking. It's quite a long, drawn out process."
</P>
<P>
Funnell said that the main reason for extending seabed
jurisdiction was for exploration purposes. A successful claim will
give New Zealand exploration rights, such as rights to drill for
oil and gas.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Investors Demand Lowering Israeli Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian investors at a major
Jordanian-Israeli industrial zone has shunned the duty-free
treatment provided by the U.S. due to their demand for lowering
the percentage of the Israeli input.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal signed between Israel and Jordan last November,
products manufactured in the Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) in
Irbid, some 80 kilometers north to Amman, could be exported to the
U.S. duty-free on condition that they include at least 11.7
percent of Israeli input.
</P>
<P>
Saying the percentage of Israeli input was too high, Jordanian
investors have rejected the beneficial U.S. treatment provided as
a reaward for the kingdom's contribution to the Middle East peace
process, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. trade department has been surprised that since the
QIZ was officially designated in March, nobody has applied for a
duty-free entry into the U.S.," the paper quoted Omar Salah,
Chairman of the Century Investment Group, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian investors will not apply for a duty-free status
for their products destined for the U.S. markets before Israel
agrees to lower the percentage to give more profits away to the
Jordanians, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
"The 11.7 percent input from Israel is too high. We are
working now on lowering it to 3 percent," said Salah, who opens
eight factories at the zone.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Israelis are showing some flexibility and
the problem could be resolved by October when a U.S. official from
the Department of Commerce visits the region.
</P>
<P>
If Israel agrees on a 3 percent input, Jordan will have to
either increase its present 11.7 percent contribution or
introduce a 10 percent U.S. input as stipulated in the deal, Salah
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., as the leading sponsor of the peace process, strongly
supports the QIZ deal which was designed to bring economic
dividends to Jordan which sealed peace with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
For Jordan, the QIZ deal means new markets and it has created
over 2,000 job opportunities for its growing unemployed
population.

HANGZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 small companies
that are serious polluters in the Taihu Lake valley in east
China's Zhejiang Province have been closed down as part of the
province's efforts to halt the degradation by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Taihu is in the Yangtze River Delta and is one of China's major

The polluters have spent about 200 million yuan (25 million
U.S. dollars) on pollution controls and 90 percent have pollution
treatment facilities, according to the provincial environmental
protection bureau.
</P>

can let their waste waster flow into the lake after January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has recently worked out preferential
policies for key enterprises for waste treatment and loans of no

<HEADLINE> Senior Judge Gets Prison Sentence For Accepting Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese judge who was
found guilty of accepting bribes has been sentenced to 15 years in
prison, the Supreme People's Court announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Pan Yile, 58, vice-president of the Higher People's Court of
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was found guilty of
accepting 250,000 yuan (30,000 U.S. dollars) worth of bribes, the
SPC says.
</P>
<P>
The case involved a man named Gao who owned an auction house in
Guangxi and got to know Pan when he filed two lawsuits with Pan's
higher court in 1995. In 1996, the senior judge accepted 10
percent of Gao's new gold mining company shares, worth 250,000
yuan, and was made vice-chairman of board of directors of the
company.
</P>
<P>
Pan later forged documents to cover up the bribe.
</P>
<P>
The case against Pan was handed over to Beijing No.1
Intermediate People's Court because of his position as a higher
court vice-president.
</P>
<P>
According to the SPC, the case was first reported by
individuals, and the Supreme People's Court gave it a great deal
of attention and sent people to investigate.
</P>
<P>
After the first judgement was handed down, Pan appealed to the
Beijing Higher People's Court, which found the verdict in line
with the facts of the case and upheld it.
</P>
<P>
An SPC official has said that making such a high-profile case
open during this period of judicial reforms shows the judiciary's
determination to crack down on corruption and to see that justice
is served.

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai municipal government
has decided to offer 600 million yuan (72 million U.S. dollars) to
support the establishment of more high-tech ventures in China's
leading industrial city.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Science and Technology said this
large amount of money will be used to guarantee inter-bank loans,
stock investments and loan discounts.
</P>
<P>
A special agency is expected to be established soon in Shanghai
to appraise market prospects and investment risks for the
soon-to-be-established high-tech ventures.
</P>
<P>
The appraisal programs will enjoy a series of preferential
policies in obtaining discounted loans and the reduction of various
taxes.
</P>
<P>
According to a new regulation adopted recently by the Shanghai
municipal government, the city will establish a center for
encouraging the industrialization of scientific achievements.
</P>
<P>
The 18-item regulation also stipulates that the patent-holders
of these scientific achievements will be allowed to use their
inventions as intangible-assets investments in the high-tech
ventures.
</P>
<P>
An inventor can thus hold as high as 35 percent of the shares
of a venture.
</P>
<P>
Confirmed high-tech ventures will also enjoy several reduced
charges and a reduction of taxes over a specified period of time.
</P>
<P>
A special award is also expected to be conferred regularly on
outstanding scientists who bring their achievements to Shanghai for
industrialization.

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 Goodwill Games, an
international multi-sport invitational uniting the world's best
athletes, will be staged in New York, the United States, from July
19 to August 2.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 athletes from more than 60 countries will compete
in 15 sports including athletics, basketball, boxing, track
cycling, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics,
soccer, swimming, synchronized swimming, triathlon, beach
volleyball, water polo, wrestling.
</P>
<P>
A total of five million U.S. dollars in prize money and record
incentives will be awarded, creating the largest purse in
multi-sport event history.
</P>
<P>
The world's elite international athletes and teams are invited
to participate based on their international standings and
performances at major international competitions.
</P>
<P>
The Games have their signature, "finals-only" format for
individual events, which means there are no preliminaries or
qualification heats. Champions in the team events and boxing are
determined through elimination rounds, culminating in a gold-medal
match.
</P>
<P>
All venues will be located in Manhattan, Nassau County and
Staten Island. The New York state and Nassau county government are

Goodwill Games Aquatics Center and the 22 million U.S. dollars
renovation of the Nassau County Mitchel Athletics Complex,
respectively. Both are located on Long Island.

<P>
It will be the fourth edition of the Goodwill Games, which was
first held in Moscow in 1986. It was the brainchild of Ted Turner,
President of the Turner Broadcasting System, who created it in
response to the U.S. absence from the 1980 Moscow Olympics and
Soviet boycott the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The Games aimed at
bringing the world's best athletes an additional opportunity to
compete in a major international forum.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1998, goodwill has been redefined for the Goodwill
Games. The Games have adopted a new cause "benefiting
children". The Goodwill Games official charities are the Boys &AMP;
Girls Clubs of America and UNICEF International. The Games have
teamed up with TBS Superstation for the million dollar
SuperChallenge.
</P>
<P>
The SuperChallenge is a fund-matching program which aims to
generate one million hours of volunteer time and one million
U.S. dollars for the national organization of the Boys &AMP; Girls
Clubs of America. Time Warner is making a donation to UNICEF
International on behalf of the Games.
</P>
<P>
The previous three Games were held in Moscow in 1986, Seattle,
Washington, in 1990, and St. Petersbury, Russia in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Police Tracing 57,353 Stolen Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian police are tracing a total
of 57,353 cars stolen by international theft gangs, a report said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Lyubomir Yossifov of the Police National
Service Directorate as saying that of those on the list, 11,847
are being sought at INTERPOL's request.
</P>
<P>
Among the 57,353 missing vehicles, 16,134 are Ladas followed by
6,455 Volkswagens, 6,379 Mercedeses, 4,106 Fiats, 3,876 Fords,
3,335 BMWs, Yossifov said.
</P>
<P>
The number of the stolen Opels, Audis, Moskoviches, Peugeots
and Renaults is less than 3,000, he added.
</P>
<P>
Missing car reports arrive almost daily from the INTERPOL
National Bureau, he said. Between January 1 and July 10 this year,
5,394 vehicles were put on the list.
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, criminal groups steal mainly expensive automobiles
or parts, which are often trafficked to Macedonia, Albania,
Moldova, Ukraine and Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Larger gangs smuggled stolen cars from Western Europe and
redistributed them to the former Soviet republics and to the Arab
world via Bulgaria and Turkey, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the stolen cars which had passed through or
been sold in Bulgaria came from Western Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some Bulgarian customs officers are on record for involvement
in such smuggling, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Jute Production to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Jute production is expected to
decline in Bangladesh this year as farmers have lost their
interest to cultivate the cash crop due to low prices of raw jute
and jute goods both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The area for jute growing in the 1988-99 fiscal year beginning
July 1 has decreased to 1.2 million acres with an output target of
4.5 million bales (0.81 million tons), after a bumper crop of 6.5
million bales (1.17 million tons) on 1.6 million acres of land
during the past fiscal, according to a survey of the Agricultural
Extension Directorate available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jute experts, however, estimated that the production would not
exceed 3 million bales (0.54 million tons) and not more than
900,000 acres of land would be brought under jute cultivation
during the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The average price of jute at the growers level has decreased
dramatically during the past two years, from 506 taka (10.77 U.S.
dollars) per maund (37.36 kilograms) in July 1996 to 373 taka
(7.94 dollars) in December the same year, and from 229 taka (4.87
dollars) per maund in July 1997 to 197 taka (4.19 dollars) in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh earned 434.2 million U.S. dollars during the 1996-97
fiscal year from its jute industry, one of the country's major
foreign exchange earners.

<HEADLINE> Audit Shows Poor Accounting of U.S Drug-Fighting Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An audit has shown that the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has kept sloppy records and
could not account for money and drugs seized in drugs operations.
</P>
<P>
The audit concluded that the main U.S. drug fighter has not
been able to "accurately and completely account" for the property
it owned, the money that drug traffickers give undercover agents
during sting operations or the seized drugs it has on hand.
</P>
<P>
The DEA's accounting was so poor in 1997 that the private
accounting firm which conducted the audit under new government
accountability laws said it could not form an opinion as to
whether the agency's books were accurate.
</P>
<P>
"We were unable to satisfy ourselves as to the fair
presentation of these balances and transactions," Peat Marwick
reported after looking at DEA's 1997 books.
</P>
<P>
The audit cited DEA for several "material weaknesses", the most
severe criticism in professional accounting. Some of the concerns
had been brought to the agency's attention in previous years.
</P>
<P>
The agency agreed with the findings. The Justice Department,
which oversees the DEA, said Tuesday that while it hasn't seen the
final audit it is aware of the concerns and believes they have
been adequately addressed with a new accounting system DEA is
implementing this year.
</P>
<P>
"The department is committed to addressing the problems that
have been raised," said Chris Watney, a Justice Department
spokeswoman. "The department acknowledges there were concerns
about DEA's antiquated financial system, and a new more modern
system is being implemented now that addresses those concerns. The
attorney general had made it a high priority to see those changes
through."
</P>
<P>
A DEA official said Tuesday that all of the recommendations in
the audit are being implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to quiz Attorney
General Janet Reno about the problem at a hearing Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With British Duke Of Gloucester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin expressed
the hope today that China and Britain would continue their efforts
to elevate bilateral exchange and cooperation in various areas to
a new level.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the common aspiration of the people of both China
and Britain, both influential nations in the world, and in line
with their interests, to intensify bilateral cooperation in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting British Duke and Duchess of
Gloucester and their party here this morning, President Jiang
highly appraised the contributions made by the British royal
family to the development of Sino-British ties.
</P>
<P>
The successful China visit by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 had
pushed forward bilateral relations of the two countries and the
smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong last year had opened up a
new chapter in the annals of Sino-British ties, Jiang said, adding
that the current China tour by Duke and Duchess of Gloucester
would also produce a positive impact on the further growth of
these ties.
</P>
<P>
Duke of Gloucester said he was happy to come to visit China. He
spoke highly of China's economic growth and the development of
Britain-China relations. The Duke also conveyed to President Jiang
the greetings from Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, too, asked the Duke to forward his greetings
to the British Queen.
</P>
<P>
The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester are here on a visit to China
at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign
Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Annan Criticizes U.S. for Lack Support for ICC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan has criticized the United States and nine other countries
for their lack of support in the creation of the International
Criminal Court (ICC).
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.S. secretary of state, Madeleine Albright,
and nine of her colleagues on Saturday, and released yesterday
evening in New York, Annan claimed that some delegations to the
ICC conference, including Albright's, "do not seem ready to find
an agreement with the others".
</P>
<P>
The UN conference on the establishment of an ICC, is being held
in Rome. The outcome is now in doubt, partly because of
U.S. pressure against UN plans to set up the ICC to try war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The conference is scheduled to end on Friday with a final draft
of the court's statute to be signed during a special ceremony on
Saturday in Rome.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian media, the U.S., France, Syria and
India are the main sources of opposition to the many countries who
favor giving court prosecutors the right to pursue cases of
genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity " without asking
for the permission of the relative countries or the UN Security
Council".
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the conference's plenary assembly, Philippe
Krish of Canada said: "I hope the U.S. will be part of the statute
marking the court's creation. What we want is a strong statute
signed by the largest number of countries possible."
</P>
<P>
The ICC is designed to be an international criminal tribunal
where defendants will be individuals, whereas the existing
International Court of Justice at the Hague settles judicial
controversies between sovereign states.

Russian fascist groups have been behind conflicts between

militarized extremist organizations advocate racial superiority

The statement attributed the trend to growing serious social

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Slovak
Republic issued 2.11 billion Koruny (68 million U.S.dollars) of
bonds on July 14 to ease its financial stress.
</P>
<P>
The total value of the issued bonds this year is greater than
usual. The bonds have an annual interest rate of 19.8 percent with
a one-year maturity term, a government official said..
</P>
<P>
The government had to issue bonds in recent years to raise
funds as the country has been plagued with increasing financial
deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak Republic had registered a deficit of 37 billion
Koruny (1.2 billion dollars) last year. The deficit has reached
3.9 billion Koruny (122 million dollars) in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Since its independence in 1993, the government has issued bonds
for several times. In 1996 and 1997, it issued bonds worth 53.7
billion Koruny (1.7 billion dollars) and 61.5 billion Koruny (1.9
billion dollars), respectively. The amount has hit 66.9 billion
Koruny (2.1 billion dollars) in the first three months of this

<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia is willing to mediate
between Belarus and the western countries about their dispute over
embassies in the Drozdy compound, a Russian foreign ministry
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Extreme actions and the isolation of Belarus would not do any
good, Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry was
quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia advocates a solution which is mutually satisfactory and
in line with the Vienna Convention, Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmanin said he hoped the Belarussian side could take
concrete steps in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In late April, Belarus asked foreign missions living in the
Drozdy compound to vacate, saying it was a necessity to begin the
overhaul of the old building. All diplomats of the European Union
refused and were later recalled home.
</P>
<P>
Despite compromising signals from the Belarussian side, the EU
imposed a visa ban on all Belarussian officials on July 10.
</P>
<P>
On July 13 Belarussian President Alexandr Lukashenko wrote to
the Foreign Minister of Austria, the Rotating Presidency of the
EU, reiterating Belarus' call for negotiations to end the crisis.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan 17-month infant
appears to be a child of five years, according to the Sinhalese
newspaper The Island here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He eats a kilogram packet of powdered milk, large quantities of
biscuits and a plateful of rice adequate for a day. But these
still fail to satisfy his appetite.
</P>
<P>
Born to a poor family in the North Central Province, Umantha
Iroshan is the third child of father S.G. Subasinghe, a village
protection officer and mother W.D. Malini.
</P>
<P>
His weight was 3.4 kilograms when he was born. However, he
weighed 22 kilograms on July 8.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes after being breast fed, Iroshan cries for more. He
is given a cup of powdered milk because his mother has no more
breast milk to feed him but he continues to cry for more.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the local hospital where his parents take him
regularly in the hope that they could do something about his
insatiable appetite said there is nothing wrong with him and there
are no medicines to curb his appetite.
</P>
<P>
They advised the parents to give him less food. But the parents
queried, "When he cries for more could we ignore him?"
</P>
<P>
The local government authorities have called for public
donations to tend the abnormal child.

<HEADLINE> China's Coal-Rich Shanxi Hopes to Become Large Power Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province will
build or expand ten large power plants at a cost of 70 billion
yuan over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The province hopes to increase power generating capacity by
830,000 kw annually through the next two years' construction,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The plan is viewed as a way to spur the slow pace of economic
development in Shanxi where the demand for general manufactured
goods has remained sluggish, and the coal market has been weak
since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi now has a power generating capacity of 10 million kw and
is capable of producing 54.5 billion kw/hours of electricity
annually. Each year, it sells 10 billion kw/hours of electricity
to supply customers outside of Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
By year 2000, the province's total power generating capacity
will be 13.42 million kw, of which four million kw will be for
customers outside Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, dubbed the "sea of coal", has a verified coal reserve
of 287.3 billion tons, accounting for one-third of China's total
and ranking first in the country. It produces 300 million tons of
coal annually, one-quarter of China's total coal production.
</P>
<P>
Construction of several pit thermal power plants alongside the
existing coal mines, and trans-regional long-distance power
transmission lines are now under construction.
</P>
<P>
When all the large thermal power stations are completed, 50
million tons of coal will be transformed into electricity annually
near their production sites. This will also contribute to
alleviating the pressure on railway transport for shipping coal
out of Shanxi, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, electricity was available in 97.8
percent of Shanxi Province's villages and will be extended to all
villages by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Praises China's Role in Promoting Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian military leader Vegh
Ferene said Tuesday that China will play an important role in
promoting world peace and stability in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Ferene, Commander and Chief of General Staff of the Hungary
National Defensce Forces, was speaking at a meeting with a visiting
group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army led by Xu Caihou,
Political Commissar of the PLA Jinan Region.
</P>
<P>
Ferene praised China's economic achievements in recent years.
Emphasizing China's political, economic and military influence, he
said China would play a very important role in maitaining world
peace and stability in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of China's decision to keep RMB from
depreciating, which was critical for Asia's financial stability in
the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ferene said he was happy with the development of
Sino-U.S. relations, which was promoted by the successful meeting
between leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ferene noted that the new Hungarian government would not change
its foreign policies, including its policy towards China. Hungary
attached great importance to the development of friendly relations
with China, including military relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Ferene, the PLA delegation, which began its
visit on July 12, and is due to leave on July 17, visited
Hungary's Army and Air Force and some military academies.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Asks U.S. to Buy Back F/A-18 Spare Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Air Force is to ask the
United States to buy back spare parts of the F/A-18 fighter
planes, the purchase contract of which was terminated halfway
through due to insufficient funds, the Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The parts, worth about 30 million U.S. dollars, are no longer
of use since the Thai Air Force cannot afford the U.S.-made
planes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had taken back the jets without imposing fines on the
Thai government for abandoning the purchase. But it did not return
the 74.5-million-U.S.-dollar deposit the Thai Air Force placed for
ordering the jets.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Armed Forces delegation headed by Supreme Commander
General Mongkol Ampornpisit will visit the United States to
negotiate the spare parts deal.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol was quoted as saying that his visit would touch on
security matters and is aimed at strengthening the military ties
with Washington. The discussion of the spare parts sale was also
high on the agenda.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Agree to Boost Information Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Information ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to
launch an ASEAN satellite channel by 2000 as a step to enhance
exchange of information.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the just-concluded fifth biennial
meeting of ASEAN information ministers, conference sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to launch a new website for culture
and information, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Supatra Masdit, minister of Thailand's Prime Minister's Office,
said at the two-day meeting that Thailand would take the first
step to help boost the information exchange among ASEAN member
states.
</P>
<P>
He said Channel 5 of Thailand, which is already beaming all
over the world, would be able to show the way for other ASEAN
member states in receiving from and transmitting to the ASEAN
channel.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN television channel is set to reach all member
countries before extending to the rest of the world. ASEAN groups
Myanmar, Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia, a prospective member,
attended the meeting as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Minister of Information George Yeo indicated the
group's support for Malaysia's cost-saving proposal for national
channels to beam to an existing satellite rather than launching a
new one.
</P>
<P>
National channels would only have to pay the cost of renting
separate transpondents, Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is to host a meeting in October to settle funding
arrangements and appoint a network coordinator.
</P>
<P>
But Yeo stressed that the new website and planned satellite
channel were efforts by ASEAN to "make our gentle voices from the
region to be heard", not to counter Western mass media.
</P>
<P>
U Kyaw Min, editor of Myanmar's official newspaper New Light of
Myanmar, said Rangoon might be selective about presenting
information from the ASEAN channel to Myanmar viewers.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Urges Closer Trade Ties Among CIS Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine on Tuesday urged all members
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to strengthen
trade cooperation and make joint efforts to set up a free-trade
zone.
</P>
<P>
Anton Buteiko, the first deputy foreign minister of Ukraine,
told a press briefing the CIS should make its basic task the
establishment of a free-trade zone according to the principles and
norms set by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being a closed organization, the CIS should promote
cooperation and exchanges with other international organizations,
Buteiko said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine would coordinate its strategic objective of European
integration with other CIS members, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Having admitted the prevailing low efficiency of the CIS and
differences in the member states' views on mutual cooperation,
the deputy foreign minister called for simplifying the leading
administrative groups of the CIS.

ROME, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini met with his Eritrean counterpart Haile Woldetensae here on

</P>
<P>
The Italian Foreign Ministry said the meeting with the Eritrean

<P>
Dini told Woldetensae that Italy continued to follow the
situation between the two countries attentively and with much
concern.
</P>
<P>
He called for an end to all hostilities and pressed for a
peaceful solution to the controversy, emphasizing the negative
effect that the conflict was having on the entire Horn of Africa.
</P>

operations to define the border between the two countries, and
backed the peace plan made by the Organization for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Dini urged both sides to stop the arrest and expulsion of
citizens who happened to live on the wrong side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Responsible behavior would help ease tensions in the region and

management of public burial grounds have prompted the central
government to launch a nationwide rectification campaign.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the State Council recently released a
Ministry of Civil Affairs circular stipulating the closure of all
cemeteries built without local government approval.
</P>
<P>
The circular prohibits public burial grounds from allowing

</P>
<P>
The circular also prohibits illegal sales of graves and
masoleum niches. It instructs all cemetery administrations to

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Listed Companies Suffer Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 166 of Indonesia's 289
listed companies toppled into the red last year due to massive
foreign exchange losses.
</P>
<P>
They suffered total foreign exchange losses of 18.6 trillion
rupiah (4 billion U.S. dollars) in December last year, the
Indonesian Business Data Center (PDBI) said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange losses would be even larger if overseas debts
were calculated at the June exchange rate level of about 15,000
rupiah to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which was around 2,450 to the dollar in July last
year, has since lost about 80 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
"This is a time bomb and bad news for stock investors," said
PDBI's chief research officer Beni Sindhunata.
</P>
<P>
PDBI concluded that the sharp depreciation of the rupiah had
rendered the country's listed companies cheap because the total
equity of 91 trillion was only valued at 6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity for foreign investors to acquire
Indonesian companies at bargain levels," Beni said, adding that
local companies could form partnerships with foreign strategic
partners to survive the crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN July 15 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen Airport is fully prepared
to assist neighboring Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok in
its cargo transportation, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Airport was authorized by the Civil Air Administration
of China (CAAC) early yesterday morning to handle some cargo
transportation for Chek Lap Kok airport upon airline companies'
request, said officials at Shenzhen Airport.
</P>
<P>
Problems with cargo transportation have been reported at the
new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
The CAAC notice came after the Hong Kong airport authorities
asked the central government for rights to land some of its cargo
planes at Shenzhen Airport at Huangtian.
</P>
<P>
Various departments of Shenzhen's entry ports have established
a command post and are working together around-the-clock to
guarantee operations, logistics and safety at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Shenzhen Airport said that it can offer service to
more than 20 cargo planes or 1,000 to 2,000 tons of cargo every
day.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Airport has an annual cargo handling capacity of about
250,000 tons, ranking sixth among China's airports, while it
processes about 100,000 tons of cargo every year at present,
leaving much room for additional business.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Polluted water in the
northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia has already caused the death
of 7 people and intoxication of 80 others in the last 20 days,
local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which happened mainly in the southern part of the
state and in the city of Santa Luzia, some 560 kilometers from the
state capital of Salvador de Bahia, was due to the spread of
cholera virus.
</P>
<P>
Close to 80 people were hospitalized after they drank water
contaminated with cholera and other toxic microorganisms, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Experts have decided that eight different water sources were
unsuitable for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
Santa Luzia officials said the situation is under control.
Local citizens were advised to boil water before drinking and to
take measures to prevent the virus from spreading further.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Succeed in Growing Wheat in Frigid Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 15 (Xinhua) --Chinese scientists have been
successful in growing 13,333 hectares of winter wheat in frigid
northeastern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
This has added 50 million kg of winter wheat to the region,
said Hou Libai, an associate professor at Shenyang Agricultural
University in Liaoning Province. The winter wheat can resist the
cold to as low as minus 28 degrees Celsius. It has been used in
more than 70 counties and cities in northeast China since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hou is a member of a research team that has transferred winter
wheat from its traditional home, south of the Great Wall to
northern parts of China. Average output per mu (0.067 hectares) in
the Northeast is 350 kg, 30 percent more than spring wheat in the
same region.
</P>
<P>
Hou says that about 2.67 million hectares of farmland are
suited to winter wheat in the Northeast, and researchers claim
that 12 billion kg of wheat can be produced if winter wheat
strains are used.
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat was not used in the Northeast for a long time
because of the frigid weather and spring wheat, whose quality and
output is not as high, was more common.
</P>
<P>
Before the introduction of winter wheat, Liaoning, Jilin, and
Heilongjiang provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
had to import about 5 billion kg of wheat annually.
</P>
<P>
Hou began cooperating with researchers from the Chinese Academy
of Agricultural Sciences' Crops Institute in 1991 to study the use
of winter wheat in the frigid Northeast. They tried two
cold-resistant strains in four counties of Liaoning Province, with
per mu output reaching 326 kg, twice the output of spring wheat
there.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Targets 2.5 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to maintain the 2.5 percent gross national product (GNP)
growth target for this year despite the lingering financial and
currency crisis and the government's deteriorating fiscal
position.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the target, which is
already a downward revision from the original growth forecast of
between 3 and 4 percent, can still be realized, the Business Daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have established that the 2.5 percent GNP growth is still
attainable. But to do this, we have to work toward reducing the
budget deficit," Espiritu disclosed in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that a balanced budget was no longer attainable but
that the administration was pursuing measures to check the ever
increasing budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
He said the deficit was expected to hit 70 billion pesos (1.7
billion U.S. dollars) should moves to check the development fail.
</P>
<P>
The country's cash budget deficit increased dramatically from
15.4 billion pesos (375.6 million dollars) last May to 26.7
billion pesos (651.2 million dollars) for the month of June.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu reiterated that by reducing the spending gap, a cap
could be put on the country's inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Should all measures fail, he said, the country's lone recourse
would be to turn to foreign borrowings available from the World
Bank, Asian Development Bank and other multilateral institutions.

<P>
NANNING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China is building a
479-kilometer-long protective bamboo belt along the Hongshui River
in south China as part of its efforts to control soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
This barrier, believed to be the longest in the country, is
being built to a width of 40 meters along the banks of the
river. The project is expected to be completed in two years.
</P>
<P>
With an abundant flow of water, the 1,050-kilometer-long
Hongshui River is one of the ten major hydro-electric power bases
in China. However, soil erosion is a serious problem along the
river. The protective belt is being launched in a section of the
river in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a total of 10,000 hectares of bamboo will
be planted in the belt, and they are expected to grow ripe in four
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Plans to shut down the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant may be delayed if the funding for building two
new plants is not made available, the Ukrainian cabinet said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government's promise of closing Chernobyl by the
end of 2000 was made under the premise that the Group of Seven and
NATO provide aid for building two new plants, a cabinet statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Aid was also needed to improve the safety of the sarcophagus,
the shield encasing the nuclear reactor and settle social security
concerns once Chernobyl is closed, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the aid was long overdue, the Ukrainian government had to
hinge the closure of the Chernobyl upon the completion of the two
new nuclear plants, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two 1.2 billion-U.S. dollar plants, Khmel'nitskiv and
Rovno, are near completion, but building has stopped because of
shortage of western aid.
</P>
<P>
In April 1986 the No.4 reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant exploded. Thousands of people are believed to have died as a
result of the worst nuclear accident in history.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A Federal judge Tuesday
ordered former Argentine President Jorge Rafael Videla to remain
in custody on charges of abduction, concealment and detention of
five children.
</P>
<P>
Judge Roberto Marquevich said that Videla falsified public
documents to cover the identities of the kidnapped children.
</P>
<P>
Videla, who was the president in 1976-1981, took the children
from their legitimate guardians who were suspected of being
subversives or political dissidents, delivering them to members of
the armed forces or to third persons with the goal of detaining
and concealing them.
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered five million U.S. dollars of Videla's assets
to be frozen.
</P>
<P>
An appeals court could order the former president placed under
house arrest, court sources said. His defenders appealed last
Wednesday to the judge's decision not to authorize his house
arrest, but to keep him in prison where he has been confined since
June 9.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Shoe Exports Predicted to Drop 50 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A continuing decline in orders may
drive down Indonesia's shoe exports by nearly 50 percent this
year, an executive of the shoe industry has warned.
</P>
<P>
The drop in shoe exports would cut the country's foreign
exchange earnings from the industry to about one billion U.S.
dollars this year from 1.9 billion dollars in 1997, the Jakarta
Post daily Wednesday quoted Chairman of the Indonesian Footwear
Association Anton J. Supit as saying.
</P>
<P>
Anton said the orders had dropped significantly in the past
several months as usual buyers of Indonesian-made shoes feared
political uncertainty in the country would affect local shoe
production and delivery.
</P>
<P>
The country's producers of four major shoe companies, Nike,
Reebok, Villa and Adidas, recorded an average 50 percent fall in
their subcontract orders, Anton said.
</P>
<P>
Supplies for the four major shoe lines make up 72 percent of
the total shoes exports.
</P>
<P>
Anton said only 50 percent of the production capacity in shoe
factories was currently being used.
</P>
<P>
"There are only three million pairs of shoes produced in the
country monthly now, compared with seven million pairs normally,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
he also disclosed that about half of the workers in the shoe
industry had lost their jobs as their companies drastically cut
production.

</P>
<P>
Johnson, who won the gold medals in both the 200 and 400 meters
at the 1996 Olympics, has decided to run only 400 meters at the
Nassau County's Mitchel athletic complex. The American has been
troubled by a nagging injury this season, and looked not as sharp
as he used to be in the one-lap race.
</P>
<P>
But Jones is expected to shine on the track when she runs 100m
and 200m on July 19 and 20. She has been dominating the sprinting
events along the way winning three gold medals at the
U.S. championships and the title of IAAF Athlete of the Year for
1997.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly the greatest heptathlete of all time, Olympic and
world champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee is going to compete in her
last multi-event in her fourth Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
Olympic and world champion Dan O'brien is returning to the
Games to defend his decathlon title, and looking to break his own
world record. He will face intense competition from Tomas Dvorak,
also an American, the world champion last year.
</P>
<P>
The Games' field events will showcase an array of U.S. talent
including the legendary John Godina, who won the golds in both the
men's shot and discus at the U.S. championships last month.
</P>
<P>
Following are some other U.S. men stars:
</P>
<P>
Maurice Greene, world 100 meters champion last year, Dennis
Mitchell, defending and U.S. champion in the 100m, Allen Johnson,
1996 Olympic champion in 110m hurdles, Derrick Adkins, Olympic and
defending champion in the 400m hurdles, Bryan Bronson,
U.S. champion in the 400m hurdles this year, Charles Austin,
Olympic champion in the high jump, Kenny Harrison, Olympic and
defending champion in the triple jumps.
</P>
<P>
The stars in the women's pool include Gail Devers, Olympic 100m
winner, Kim Batten, Olympic silver medalist in the 400m hurdles
and Suzy Hamilton, two-time Olympian.
</P>
<P>
World big names to compete in the Games include Canada's
Donovan Bailey, world men's 100 meters record holder and Olympic
champion, Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tabago, world men's 200
meters champion, Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, men's world high jump
record holder and world champion, Sergey Bubka of Ukarine, world
men's pole vault record holder.
</P>
<P>
The women's super stars include Ana Quirot of Cuba, world 800m
champion, Sabine Braun of Germany, world heptathlon winner, Emma
George of Australia, world pole vault record setter, Deon Hemmings
of Jamaica, world 400m hurdles champion.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Has Fast Population Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangdong Province had
an increase of 7.05 million people over the past seven years, to
a total of 70.5 million at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The population grew at a rate of 11.5 per 1,000 people, 2.77
percentage point higher than the national average. At such a pace,
experts say, Guangdong will be very much likely to outnumber
Jiangsu as the fourth largest province by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the growth rate to uncontrolled births in
some of its rural areas.
</P>
<P>
This has become harder now for Guangdong to keep its
population growth target below 73.7 million by the end
of the century, experts say, and warn that the province needs to
encourage family planning more.
</P>
<P>
According to designed target, Guangdong should keep its birth
rate within 15 per 1,000 people and natural population growth rate
under 10 per 1,000 people a year.

<HEADLINE> Drainage Helps Save Harvest in Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A record 96,000 sets of drainage
facilities have been in full operation in China's flood-hit areas
to mitigate further losses caused by flooding, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Floods in south China and areas along the Yangtze River have
inundated more than 4.1 million hectares of farmland in 10
provinces since the rainy season set in this year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that grain yields from about half the farmland
will be reduced by at least 30 percent, and over 15 percent of the
fooded land will produce no harvest, the State Flood-control
Headquarters was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the drainage facilities, water has been pumped from
more than 3.4 million hectares of farmland, over 80 percent of the
total flooded.
</P>
<P>
This will enable farmers to plant late rice on two million
hectares, which can prevent the 14.6 billion yuan (1.7 billion US
dollars) drop expected in the value of the autumn harvest because
of crop failure.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 provinces suffering serious flooding, east China's
Jiangsu Province has pumped 3.9 billion cubic meters of water from
495,000 hectares by using 42,000 sets of drainage facilities.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hubei, one of the most affected provinces
along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, 4.3 billion
cubic metres of water have been drained from some 940,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in east China's Anhui Province, late rice is
expected to be planted on 800,000 hectares after effective
drainage operations which should allow farmers to get back to
normal as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Capital Slump at Increasing Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's capital surface is
slumping at an increasing rate, especially in the north, where
some areas have fallen by 20 centimeters over the last 12 months,
local press Wednesday quoted latest research as saying.
</P>
<P>
The research using the so-called Global Positioning System and
studies conducted by the National Land Affairs Agency indicate
that Mutiara and Kapuk beaches in North Jakarta have sunk by
between 40 and 58 centimeters since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Moving inland, depression in Rawamangun, East Jakarta, is
between 5 and 20 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
In Maruya, West Jakarta, land has fallen between 15 and 30
centimeters, while in the South Jakarta area of Kebayoran it's
gone down between 5 and 11 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Hasanuddin Abidin of the Bandung Technology Institute told
reporters Tuesday that the extraction of water from below the
city's surface is causing the land to slowly crumble.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon also causes river currents to shift and allows
sea water to leach further inland, where it can damage building
foundations.
</P>
<P>
If the depression continues, skyscrapers will start to lean and
crack, Abidin said.
</P>
<P>
"But today there is no comprehensive information about the
characteristics or types of land depression in and around
Jakarta," he added.

<HEADLINE> Unearthed Ancient Vases Proved to Have Greater Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- About 200 porcelain vases
unearthed over the past 20 years, from ancient tombs in Guilin, a
tourist city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have been
proved to be of great value for archeological research.
</P>
<P>
The blue and white porcelain vases were believed to be produced
in Jingdezhen, a famous porcelain city in Jiangxi Province, east
of Guilin, during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The vases, most of
which are large and free-standing, were used for interior
decoration, according to archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
Famous archeologist Tan Fasheng pointed to the rarity in
discovering so many valuable Ming Dynasty porcelain vases
at a single site.
</P>
<P>
The vases, featuring traditional Chinese painting, not only depict
flowers, mountains and rivers, but also record the lives of local
people, legends and fairy tales, according to Tan.
</P>
<P>
"The vases are listed as the top State cultural relics and now
in safe keeping of the Guilin Museum," said Tan.

<HEADLINE> Non-State Sector Urged to Help Unemployed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China's fledging non-state
economic sector should accelerate its expansion to help millions
of laid-off workers find jobs, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The non-state-owned sector should participate actively in the
reform of state-owned enterprises, the paper quoted Wang Zhaoguo,
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
Non-state-owned firms are encouraged to merge, lease and buy
small and medium-sized state enterprises and assume responsibility
for the employees.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the system has been under way since 1996. It was seen
as a "low-cost expansion" by private entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
On average, 16,500 people enter China's private business sector
daily, 80 percent of them being laid offs from state firms.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 3.5 million laid-off workers either became
self-employed or found jobs with private firms, notes Jing
Shuping, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, at a
three-day conference of the All China Federation of Industry and
Commerce, which opened in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The annual number of layoffs in the next three years is
estimated at between 3 and 4 million.
</P>
<P>
China had had 28 million self-employed individuals and 960,000
private enterprises, which employ more than 85 million people, by
the end of 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance
(Property) Company of China Ltd (PICC Property) is bracing itself
for major payouts after devastating floods hit east South and
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The PICC property has made full preparation in funds, materials
and human resources for settling compensation claims while
donating three million yuan (361,000 US dollars) to the flooded
areas, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the company, the country's largest property
insurer, has sent 15 working groups to the flooded areas to
supervise claims work.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-June, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan,
Zhejiang and Sichuan provinces have been hit by serious floods,
which killed more than 800 people and caused over one billion yuan
(120.4 million US dollars) worth of damages to PICC property
insured enterprises.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Jiangmen branch in south China's Guangdong province
has paid more than five million yuan (602,000 US dollars) in
advance compensation. The Nanping Branch in east China's Fujian
province has settled 297 compensation cases, paying out 16.73
million yuan (2 million US dollars) by July 1.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets Aside 300M Dollars as Food Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
earmarked 4.5 trillion rupiah (300 million U.S. dollars) as
subsidies to cope with the food shortage after the economic
meltdown, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"The subsidies are intended for people who are suffering from
food shortage due to the decline in their purchasing power,"
official Antara News Agency Wednesday quoted Minister for Food and
Horticulture A.M. Saefuddin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Tuesday that the subsidies include funds for
a special market operation program launched to provide assistance
to 7.3 million poor families all over the country in the form of
rice sales at 1,000 rupiah per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
In the markets, the price of rice has increased to more than
3,000 rupiah per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The production of rice in the country was predicted to drop by
6.3 percent compared with that of last year, so the government has
decided to import 3.1 million tons of rice this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Saefuddin said, the government would also provide
4 trillion rupiah in fuel oil subsidy, bringing the total
subsidies to 8.5 trillion rupiah (560 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Solution to Educational Imbalance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A report issued here today urges
that the uneven development of education in different parts of
China be avoided as part of the effort to achieve the country's
goal of modernization.
</P>
<P>
The report, written by educational experts from Beijing Normal
University and the State Council, points to the great gap in
educational levels existing between economically developed coastal
provinces and large cities like Beijing and Shanghai, and
poverty-stricken provinces in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Though developed regions have greater populations than the
backward areas, their per capita investment in education is much
larger, in some coastal provinces as much as twice that of the
western provinces, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
There are no marked differences in the primary school
enrollment rate, however, the enrollment rate of senior high
school students in the most developed provinces and cities is
sometimes 40 percent higher than in underdeveloped regions.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this imbalance is a result of the uneven
development of the economy. Most remote mountainous provinces
receive little money or benefits from educational taxation,
despite the fact that their governments have invested large sums
in the educational sector.
</P>
<P>
Coastal provinces are traditionally China's commercial,
industrial and agricultural centers, and the first regions to open
to the rest of the world, while the western regions are confined
by deserts, mountains and other restrictive environmental
conditions so that foreign capital seldom arrives.
</P>
<P>
The experts suggest that the economy be enhanced in the
underdeveloped regions to serve as a fundamental engine for
pushing local education, and that the developed regions should
give a helping hand and the central government should work out
more poverty-relief policies.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report points out that even in some
prosperous coastal provinces priority has not been fully given to
educational development because people there are simply focusing
on creating economic miracles.
</P>
<P>
China has perhaps the longest educational tradition in the
world, largely the legacy of Confucius, but intellectuals were
humiliated during the "Cultural Revolution" in the mid 1960s when
universities stop enrolling students.
</P>
<P>
It was late leader Deng Xiaoping who in the late 1970s
reemphasized the importance of education to the modernization of
China.

<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has assured the
Philippine government of its continued financing support to help
the government get out of the currency mess and bring the economy
back on the right track, a leading newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was relayed to Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu by World
Bank resident representative to Manila Vinay Vhargava and other
bank officials in a closed door meeting Tuesday, according to
Manila Bulletin.
</P>

as well as the conditions linked to the financing package.
</P>
<P>
Under negotiation with the World Bank are various loan packages
worth some 1.1 billion U.S. dollars, including the 600 million
dollars budgetary support fund, the 300 million dollars banking
sector adjustment loan and the 200 million public sector
adjustment loan.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin quoted informed sources as saying that the bank
officials vowed to fast-track the release of these loans, which
would beef up the dollar reserves of the country.

<P>
Espiritu told reporters that the World Bank is also offering
technical and financial assistance for housing projects and this
is on top of the 1.1 billion dollars in loans currently under
negotiation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Replace Minivans by Larger Cars in Taxi Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, capital of China, is to
replace 22,000 yellow minivans called by local people as "Miandi"
with larger, less-polluting cars by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The vans was condemned as an 8-percent contributor to the
city's worsening air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Among the city's 22,000 vans, 18,000 have served more than five
years. An official with Beijing Public Transportation
Administration said that the vehicles should not be worked longer
than three years.
</P>
<P>
The first 200 yellow vans appeared in Beijing in 1988, and the
number soared to 30,000 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading of taxi fleets became a hot issue in Beijing when
the municipal authorities stopped renewing or issuing new
registrations for minivans in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the city's 1,000 taxi companies to choose
successors of the minivans between bullet cars (Zhonghua Zidantou)
and Charades (Xiali).
</P>
<P>
There are presently 1,300 Bullet cars which started cruising
Beijing streets in 1996. The air-conditioned cars are priced at
1.2 yuan (0.14 U.S. dollar) per kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Charade is now most popular in Beijing. Rates are 1.6 yuan per
kilometer.
</P>
<P>
The total number of taxis in Beijing will remain 65,000 which
is the most in the country. There are now 600,000 taxis in China,
an increase from 82,000 in 1988.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Increasing Number of Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China's urbanization is now
characterized by sharp growth in the number of small and
medium-sized cities in the central and western parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official at the Chinese Ministry of
Construction, the number of Chinese cities has tripled since 1980,
and now stands at 666. The country's urbanization strategy seeks
to "control the number and scale of large cities and to give
greater emphasis to small and medium-sized cities as well as small
rural towns," he noted, adding that this strategy has begun to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
Of the present 666 cities, 75 are large cities, 399 are small
cities and 192 are medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The official said that because of nationwide economic
development, the rapid pace of urbanization has improved the
uneven distribution of cities in eastern, central, and western
parts of the country to some degree. The three areas now account
for 44 percent, 37 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, of the
total number of cities.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the autonomous regions of Inner
Mongolia, Xinjiang and Ningxia and the provinces of Hubei,
Qinghai, Shanxi, Anhui, Henan and Jiangxi are undergoing faster
urbanization than other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The official expected faster growth in the number of Chinese
cities in the coming years, saying the figure will reach
800 by the turn of the century, with more than 700 small and
medium-sized ones.

<HEADLINE> U.S Steps Up Military Presence In Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
stepped up its military presence in Latin America after the Cold
War, a Brasilian newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According the daily "Jornal de Brasil", a coalition of 60
non-government organizations interested in Washington's policy
towards Latin America found that the involvement of U.S. armed
forces with their Central and South American counterparts was
"substantial" and even less transparent than in the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
The "work group of Latin America" said that during the 1980s,
the United States was directly involved in Central American wars
and gave military assistance to some regimes in a program approved
by the Congress and controlled by the civilian sector of the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the report said, the U.S. government drastically
reduced its financing support, but there were other U.S. Defense
Department programs, which are not revealed in any public
documents.
</P>
<P>
Today, the budget for anti-drug operations by the Pentagon is
three times greater and, in 1997 alone, close to 56,000 U.S. troops
passed through Latin America, most of them in training activities.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that in 1997 some 2,377 military personnel
from Latin American countries were enrolled in military
institutions in the United States to receive training and a
specialized education of international quality.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Focuses on Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Road construction is expected to
dominate infrastructure projects in east China's Zhejiang Province
during the next four years, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been worked out to improve prospects for economic
development in this better-off province and lift poverty in its
isolated rural areas where there are no roads or railroad services.
</P>
<P>
From 1998 through 2002, a total of 61 billion yuan (7.35
billion U.S. dollars) will be channeled for road construction, of
which 35.35 billion yuan (4.26 billion U.S. dollars) will be
invested in expressways, as mapped out on a blueprint by Zhejiang
Provincial Department of Communications.
</P>
<P>
As for this year, an investment of 10.48 billion yuan (1.26
billion U.S. dollars) is expected to be raised, of which, 4.69
billion yuan (565 million US dollars) will go to expressways.
</P>
<P>
The investment plan is in line with the central government's
call to speed up road construction, said the department
officials, adding that in four years of time, a "four-hour highway
communications" within the province is envisioned.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2002, total length of highways in the province
will reach 39,600 km, of which 1,192 km will be expressways.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Maori and Non-Maori in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Maori Affairs
Ministry issued a report Tuesday, blaming the economic
restructuring, which began in the 1980s in the country, for
creating a "heavy toll on Maoris", though it admitted that the
economic restructuring has brought about improvements to the whole
social and economic conditions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Progress Toward Closing Social and Economic
Gaps Between Maori and Non-Maori," said that the restructuring
devastated Maori employment in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Though the disparities had narrowed by the mid 1990s, Maori
unemployment began to rise again in 1997-1998, it said, adding
that in March this year, it stood at 18.3 percent, about three
times that of non-Maoris.
</P>
<P>
According to 1995 statistics, indigenous Maoris make up 13
percent of New Zealand's total population of 3.64 million.
</P>
<P>
Maori life expectancy has continued to improve and infant
mortality rates fall, the report said. However, for almost every
other health indicator reviewed, including sudden infant death
syndrome, teenage pregnancy, youth suicide, diabetes, strokes,
pneumonia and mental health, gaps have widened between Maori and
non-Maori figures.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Maori sudden infant death syndrome rate at 6.9 per
thousand was five times higher than the non-Maori rate (1.4 per
thousand). Although the life expectancies for Maori females and
males have increased by 17 years and 14 years over a 40-year
period to 73 years and 68 years respectively, they are 79.2 years
for non-Maori females and 73.4 years for non-Maori males, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In education, the report said that the proportion of Maoris in
early childhood education in 1997 was 40.5 percent compared with
63.5 percent of non-Maoris. Compared with non-Maoris, Maoris are
less likely to attend early childhood education, to stay on to
senior secondary levels or to gain formal qualifications. They are
also less likely to undertake tertiary training.
</P>
<P>
Maori self-employment and household income have increased over
the last decade, it said, but housing has become less affordable
and Maoris are still more reliant on social welfare than
non-Maoris.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, between 1981 and 1996, Maori
self-employment increased from 5.4 percent to 9.9 percent but the
increase in non-Maoris self-employment was greater, so the
disparity widened.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 36.3 percent of Maori households were reliant on
benefits as their main source of income, compared with 14.3
percent of non-Maoris.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Maori health, education, employment and
economic status lag well behind those of non-Maoris, with no sign
of improvement.
</P>
<P>
The release of the report has caused great concern among
high-ranking government officials of New Zealand. Tuesday, a
number of government ministers were at pains to point out that
government initiatives were helping to close the gaps. They issued
statements outlining measures such as Maori employment programs, a
proposed Maori education strategy and the establishment of Maori
development commissions for health, education, employment and
training.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said that it was to the
government's credit that it had ordered the report and it was not
seeking to hide the problems.
</P>
<P>
"Things are being done but it is no use as a government hiding
from reality," he said.

<HEADLINE> Waste Water Treatment Plant Begins Operations in Shenyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG July 15 (Xinhua) -- A waste water treatment plant with
a daily capacity of 400,000 tons began operations recently in
Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The plant's capacity is the second greatest in China, and is
the city's first large waste water treatment plant, said Liu
Tiecheng, director of the city's environmental protection bureau,
adding that the plant can handle one-third of the city's waste
water, and 200,000 tons of waste water can be retrieved for
industrial use after treatment.
</P>
<P>
The plant's construction cost nearly 600 million yuan (about 75
million U.S.dollars), part of which came from a 70 million franc
French loan.
</P>
<P>
As the largest industrial city in northeast China, Shenyang
suffers serious environmental pollution. To alleviate this
problem, the city will build three more waste water treatment
plants with a total daily capacity of one million tons, and by the
end of the century the city will have all its waste water treated,
Liu said.

UNITED NATIONS -- China on Tuesday strongly urged Nicaragua and
the other countries to stop immediately their illegal activities
of interfering in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a letter on July 8, 1998 to the Secretary-General of the
United Nations, Qin Huasun, Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, said, Nicaragua and a very small number of
other countries once again put the so-called "Taiwan's
representation at the United Nations" before the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said the brazen attempt was to challenge the
General Assembly Resolution 2758, create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" at the United Nations and split a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed such illegal activities have severely contravened
the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
seriously encroached upon China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and grossly interfered in its internal affairs.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton Tuesday called for
urgent action on solution to the 2000 computer problem Y2K and
urged federal agencies and all American businesses to have their
Y2K remedies ready by next March.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the National Academy of Sciences, the president
said, "because the difficulty is as far-flung as the billions of

is not a challenge that is susceptible to a single government
program or an easy fix."
</P>
<P>
He said he has ordered all agencies to have their Y2K remedies
ready by next March. He also noted that many big corporations are
moving swiftly to prepare themselves, but in spite of all this
progress in the business sector just as in the government sector,
there are still gaping holes. (US-Clinton-Y2K Problem)

CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Coalition leadership tried Tuesday to quell rebellion
and division within government ranks over the sale of Telstra (a
government communication company), and deferred party preparations
for the release of the tax package.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian business started the new financial year with the
gloomiest outlook in seven years, prompting one of the country's
leading economists to predict that the Asian crisis could send the
economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Doctors are being ordered to exclude seriously ill patients
from public hospital waiting lists and reclassify patients'

waiting list figures.

<P>
The Australian Financial Review:

<HEADLINE> Lott Alleges Tech Transfer to China, White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott repeated the allegation here Tuesday that satellite
technology was transferred to China, prompting the Senate
Democrats and administration officials to rebuke him for political
motivation.
</P>
<P>
Republican Lott told a press conference that the preliminary
results of a Senate inquiry concluded that China received military
benefits and sensitive technology from satellite exports to that
country.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the Clinton administration for "wholly
inadequate export controls for satellites" and failure to protect
sensitive U.S. technology. "National security concerns are
regularly downplayed and even ignored," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lott's allegation immediately came under question by Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, who called it "a pretty partisan
report."
</P>
<P>
"I do believe the issue warrants our attention, but it also
warrants objectivity and very thoughtful careful consideration of
the fact," Democratic Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
He complained about "unidentified sources and very questionable
sources. We are going to have to be very careful about the
distinction between allegation and fact."
</P>
<P>
Both the Senate and the House are investigating President
Clinton's decision early this year to grant a waiver to allow
Loral Space and Communications to launch a commercial satellite
aboard a Chinese rocket. The administration and the company have
denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Senator Bob Kerrey, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, accused Lott of undermining the investigation by
"threatening to compromise our work, by converting the committee
into a partisan effort."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry dismissed Lott's charges as
"not a serious statement by a serious person." "It's partisanship
at its worst," he told a routine daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Lott's allegation "struck me a little bit like Alice in
Wonderland time, you know, a verdict first -- sentence first,
verdict afterwards; facts sooner or later forgotten," McCurry
scoffed the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
After 18 hearings on the Hill and full cooperation from the
administration, "Senator Lott today tried to connect a lot of dots
that, frankly, don't connect. And I -- our judgment here is that
that was not a serious statement by a serious person; it was a
political argument made by a politician for political benefit."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin defended the
government satellite export policy, saying, "It's in the national
interest of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Allowing launching of American satellites atop Chinese rockets
would promote U.S. competitiveness, promote openness in China,
advance U.S. China policy of engagement and help reach the goal of
nonproliferation, Rubin told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said, "By definition, because it was Chinese technology
that created the satellite dispenser, it reflects Chinese
capabilities, and the United States, to my knowledge, has not
added to those capabilities."
</P>
<P>
In the past weeks, officials from the departments of commerce,
defense and state and intelligence organizations were present at
the congressional hearings on this matter. They tried hard to
disprove the lawmaker's worries, but failed to keep politics
outside the case.

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday approved
an interest-free credit of 45 million U.S. dollars equivalent to
Honduras for the fourth social investment fund project.
</P>
<P>
This project will continue support for the successful Honduran
Social Investment Fund (FHIS) program, which aims to increase
access among the poor to small-scale social and economic
infrastructure, to develop social assistance programs for
disadvantaged groups and to contribute to the sustainability of
such investments.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1990, the FHIS has channeled over 180
million dollars for priority investments in education, health,
water and sanitation, economic infrastructure, social assistance,
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is some 136.5 million dollars.
Co-financing includes: 10 million dollars from the German Credit
Institute for Reconstruction, 50 million dollars from the
Inter-American Development Bank, and some others. The World Bank's

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved here
Tuesday an interest-free credit of 50 million U.S. dollars
equivalent in support of the second national agricultural services
support project for Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
This project is the first phase of an 11 year program supported

Bank's concessional lending affiliate, through the World Bank's
new long-term lending instrument, the Adaptable Program Loan.
</P>
<P>
The core objective of the project is to firmly establish
responsive and cost-effective agricultural services, provided by
autonomous agencies which are majority owned and managed by
farmers, through their representative organizations and other
private sector actors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the World Bank's credit, co-financiers of the
project are the government of Cote d'Ivoire with 88.6 million
dollars, farmers organizations 56.1 million dollars and some
others.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Urges Y2K Remedies to Be Ready by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Tuesday
called for urgent action on solution to the 2000 computer problem
Y2K and urged federal agencies and all American businesses to have
their Y2K remedies ready by next March.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the National Academy of Sciences, the president
said, "because the difficulty is as far-flung as the billions of
microchips that run everything from farm equipment to VCRs, this
is not a challenge that is susceptible to a single government
program or an easy fix."
</P>
<P>
He said he has ordered all agencies to have their Y2K remedies
ready by next March. He also noted that many big corporations are
moving swiftly to prepare themselves, but in spite of all this
progress in the business sector just as in the government sector,
there are still gaping holes.
</P>
<P>
"With millions of hours needed to rewrite billions of lines of
code in hundreds of thousands of interdependent organizations,
this is clearly one of the most complex management challenges in
history," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also announced that the United States will
contribute 12 million dollars to support World Bank efforts to
increase awareness of the "millennium bug" in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Since most computer software programs recognize only the last
two digits of a year, the arrival of the year 2000 will cause many
to malfunction unless fixes are in place. Without a fix, these
computers will take Jan. 1, 2000 as the same day a full century
earlier, causing widespread power outages, transportation foul-ups
and telecommunications failures.
</P>
<P>
According to John Koskinen, chairman of the Year 2000
Conversion Council that is overseeing the government's work on the
problem, some of the biggest federal agencies are behind schedule
in fixing the bug, including the departments of defense, health
and human services, energy, education and transportation as well
as the U.S. Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
However, Koskinen said most of the "mission critical" federal
computer systems should be ready by Clinton's target date of next
March.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 Ethiopians Allegedly Detained in Eritrea's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Ethiopian
government spokesperson Tuesday accused the Eritrean Government
of detaining about 30,000 Ethiopians in the Red Sea port city of
Assab.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA), the
spokesperson, quoting eye witnesses, said the detainees are
neither allowed to leave Assab nor work there and that some have
to report every day to Eritrea's governing party, the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front (EPLF).
</P>
<P>
The ENA did not mention the name of the spokesperson who
claimed that two Ethiopian women there have committed suicide
because they were unable to feed their families.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson charged that the Eritrean authorities have
refused to allow families of Ethiopian prisoners to visit them
and they are denied access to the International Committee of Red
Cross (ICRC) and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said the Ethiopian government appeals to the
international community to put pressure on the Eritrean
government to allow the ICRC access to these "prisoners" and
their families.
</P>
<P>
An earlier announcement made by the Ethiopian government
spokesperson said that a second group of a thousand Eritreans
left Addis Ababa Sunday under escort for their homeland.
</P>
<P>
These deportees, who Ethiopia says are a threat to national
security, were members of the Eritrean ruling party EPLF,
involving in gathering information, disseminating war propaganda
and raising funds for Eritrea's war effort against Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,045 Eritreans were deported last month.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Eritrea has deported 4,400 Ethiopians since
the outbreak of border conflict in May.

<HEADLINE> Romania Overburdened With Foreign Loans: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is worrying about the Romanian economy because the deficit
of the balance of payments indicates that Romania has registered
huge loans from foreign lenders that it will fail to sustain
economically.
</P>
<P>
IMF official in Romania John Hill made the statement in an
interview with the daily Romania Libera (Free Romania) issued
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments in 1997 was 2.6 billion U.S. dollars, 7
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and experts predict a
7.8 percent of the GDP for this year, approximately 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This sum is large, with foreign investors continuing to leave
the Romanian capital market and the two credit rating operators
Moodie's and ABCE pointing negative fingers at Romania, said John
Hill.
</P>
<P>
He expected the 3.6 budget deficit, adopted by parliament in
1998, to go up, leaving Minister of Finance Daniel Daianu before
the difficult, heroic hurdle to cut budget spending.
</P>
<P>
"Three years of economic backdrop make future negotiations for
a stand-by agreement with the IMF look bleak," John Hill said.

<HEADLINE> Colin Powell Urges Empowering of Black Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- It makes no sense to preserve
affirmative action programs if black youth aren't ready
academically or socially to take advantage of them, said Retired
General Colin Powell Tuesday at a meeting of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action is a formal effort to provide increased
employment and education opportunities for women and ethnic
minorities, to overcome past pattern of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Instead, improving schools and strengthening home life should
be the top priorities of the NAACP, Powell told 3,500 delegates to
the civil rights group's annual convention being held in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"The choice before us is either getting back to the task of
building all children or just keep building more jails," The
Associated Press quoted Powell as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But there is no point in creating (affirmative action)
opportunities if we bring up children who can't use the English
language. If this generation of youth don't take advantage of
those opportunities, what's the point?" Powell said.
</P>
<P>
After touching on a broad range of topics, he concluded with
his vision for a new America.
</P>
<P>
Powell, who declared himself a Republican in 1995, urged the
audience to vote, regardless of their political leanings.
</P>
<P>
"Vote Democrat, vote Republican, split your ticket but just
vote so your voice will be heard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Powell, who in 1991 earned the NAACP's Spingarn Award, its
highest honor, acknowledged that his path to success vastly
differs from many of his audience members who earned their civil
rights stripes marching, sitting-in or organizing for change.
</P>
<P>
"They marched so I and others would have the opportunity to
rise to the top of my profession," said Powell.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai to Sell Auto Parts Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Hyundai America said it plans
to use the Web to broaden the distribution of its replacement
parts and generate business for its U.S. auto-franchise dealers.
</P>
<P>
While auto makers use their informational Web sites to steer
new-car shoppers to local dealers, Hyundai is the first with plans
to sell parts over the Web to independent repair shops and car
owners.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai, which sells 150 million U.S. dollars worth of
replacement parts annually in North America, said that the
extranet will generate additional revenue for its dealers, who
will handle all parts orders from auto shops and car owners.
</P>
<P>
The system is set to go live around November and will
supplement the CD-ROM catalogs and electronic data interchange
(EDI)-based ordering systems commonly used in the auto-parts
sector. It will link Hyundai's ordering system with a
password-protected Web site where buyers can search and order
parts from a Hyundai catalog.
</P>
<P>
By selling parts on the Web, manufacturers are making an
important turn in their e-commerce strategies, which have been
focused on integrating relationships with suppliers and providing
information for consumers. Their e-commerce initiatives have been
oriented more backward to the supply chain than forward through
the selling chain.
