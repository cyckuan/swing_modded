<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Peace Talks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday called for peace talks to seek a political
settlement in the restless Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In his report, issued here on Monday, to the U.N. Security
Council, he said, "Full and unconditional acceptance of peaceful
negotiations is the only way to resolve the crisis in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the appeals as preparations for the U.S.-led NATO
air strike on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore once again urge the parties to engage in
negotiations on a peaceful settlement in Kosovo without further
delay and without preconditions, as demanded by the international
community and in particular," by relevant Security Council
resolutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group on January 29 decided to summon
representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the
Republic of Serbia and of the Kosovo Albanians to Rambouillet,
southwest of Paris, by February 6, to begin negotiations.
</P>
<P>
So far, none of the parties has said "no" to the peace offer,
contained in a joint statement issued at the end of a meeting of
foreign ministers of the Contact Group members in London. However,
none of the parties has indicated their full acceptance of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan said that the criminals who committed the
reported January 15 massacre in the village of Racak, southern
Kosovo, should be brought to justice in order to restore peace in
the restless Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that the perpetrators be brought to justice
in order to deter further violence and to give peace in Kosovo a
chance," Annan said in a report, issued here on Monday, to the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Any appearance of impunity for the perpetrators could become a
real obstacle to the process of finding a peaceful solution to the
conflict through negotiation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who earlier said he was "shocked and dismayed"
by the massacre reports, also urged that "unconditional respect be
given to the authority of the International Tribune for the Former
Yugoslavia throughout all of the territory of the former
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The European monitor mission reported on January 16 that 45
ethnic Albanians were found killed in the village of Racak,
touching off strong response from the international community.
</P>
<P>
"Fear of fighting between the security forces and Kosovo
Albanian paramilitary units and continued violence against
civilians are the overriding obstacle to return and to the
sustainability of those returns that have taken place," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian operation has demonstrated its capacity to
deliver large-scale assistance, but without an end to violence and
the establishment of a climate of security this will not suffice,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am increasingly concerned that the spread of violence and
the nature of the attacks could lead to a situation of all-out
civil war in Kosovo, which might have unpredictable repercussions
for the entire region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Violence, from whatever quarter, can only lead to further
suffering for the civilians population in Kosovo, which has been
the main target and victim of the conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February last year after
ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million, fought with Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. White House Accuses Starr of Illegal Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. White House lawyers
headed for court Monday to accuse Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr of violating grand jury secrecy laws.
</P>
<P>
Starr's office has engaged in illegal, partisan leaking of
secret information, President Bill Clinton's lawyer, David
Kendall, told reporters. He apparently referred to a weekend story
in The New York Times saying Starr has concluded that Clinton can
be indicted while in office.
</P>
<P>
"We are filing today in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia a motion to show cause why... Starr and members of is
staff should not be held in contempt for improper violations of
grand jury secrecy," Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
The story, coming at the time the Senate is trying to find a
way to end Clinton's impeachment trial, drew criticism from
senators from both parties.
</P>
<P>
"I thought that the timing was extremely unfortunate and that
it was inappropriate to come out while the Senate is concluding
the president's trial," said Republican Senator Susan Collins.
</P>
<P>
However, Starr's spokesman Charles Bakaly Monday denied Starr's
office was the source of the story. "We have no interest in
interposing ourselves in the Senate's business," he said on ABC's
"Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Kendall issued his statement at the White House before driving
a few blocks north to the Mayflower hotel, where former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky was to respond to questions from
House prosecutors and White House lawyers at the Senate
impeachment trial against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors are questioning Lewinsky as they entered the
final phase of their attempt to turn the tide and prove that
Clinton should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
With that attempt likely to fail, the senators sitting in
judgment of the president were scrambling for a way they
themselves will be judged kindly by history after they acquit
Clinton of articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors and White House lawyers each has four hours
Monday to question Lewinsky about her affair with Clinton and
charges that he committed perjury and obstructed justice in trying
to conceal their relationship.
</P>
<P>
Her deposition is taking place in private, presided over by one
Democratic and one Republican senator and videotaped for viewing
by other senators.
</P>
<P>
The process will be repeated Tuesday when Clinton's close
friend Vernon Jordan, who helped Lewinsky find a job, will be
deposed, and on Wednesday, when White House aide Sidney Blumenthal
will be questioned.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Prices Edges Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC's
basket of seven crudes edged up to 10.75 U.S. dollars per barrel
last week, from 10.54 dollars the week before.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna-based Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) Secretariat announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The price climbed above 11 dollars per barrel during the first
two weeks of January because of a decline in the inventory of some
major oil consumption countries.
</P>
<P>
The average price for the whole of 1998 dived by a third to 12.
28 dollars from 1997. In December, the price slumped to below 10.
00 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that oil prices on the world market might recover
in the near future because of the bitter cold weather which has
swept through a number of regions recently and has increased the
need for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
However, they forecast that the recovery will not be big
because the oversupply of oil has not seen any fundamental changes.

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide Egypt with Fund for Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
provide Egypt with a large sum of fund this month to help
modernize the country's industry in the coming years, Egyptian
Minister of Industry Suleiman Reda said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting a new iron and steel complex in Aswan, 700
kilometers south of Cairo, Reda said the EU will grant Egypt 470
million U.S. dollars to help upgrade its industry, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 15-nation European organization will provide
Egypt with a loan of 400 million dollars for the industry
renovation process, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The plan involving 5,000 industrial firms in the coming five
years has been endorsed by the Egyptian cabinet and will soon be
submitted to the People's Assembly (parliament) for approval, Reda
said.
</P>
<P>
The project is also aimed at establishing 20 specialized
technological centers to supply industrial firms with skilled
laborers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the EU have been negotiating for a partnership
agreement, under which the EU will help Egypt carry out a 15-year
Industry Modernization Program to enable it to be better prepared
for international competition in industry.

<HEADLINE> France's Societe Generale and Paribas to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- France's two major banks, the
Societe Generale (SG) and Paribas, said on Monday that they will
merge in an overall restructuring of European banking system.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale has launched an offer for shares in Paribas to
create a new banking entity named SG Paribas.
</P>
<P>
The merger, whose cost is estimated at 15.1 billion euros (17
billion U.S. dollars), would create the fourth-biggest bank in the
world in terms of shareholders' funds of 21 billion euros (24
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new banking group will replace Credit Agricole as France's
biggest banking group and will be on the same scale as the
Deutsche Bank AG and Swiss UBS.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn
welcomed the move by the two banks as ``a strong and dynamic
French financial sector at the heart of the euro.''
</P>
<P>
The head of Paribas, Andre Levy-Lang, will chair the new group
and the president of SG, Daniel Bouton, will become vice president
and succeed Levy-Lang in 2002.
</P>
<P>
``The objective is to achieve recurrent profitability on
shareholders' funds of 15 percent of net profits per share of more
than 15 percent per year on average,'' said the two banks in a
joint communique.
</P>
<P>
On the condition that Paribas will offer more than 50.01
percent of its shares in tendering, Societe Generale has offered
to buy all Paribas shares with every five SG shares for eight
Paribas shares, which would involve 96 million out of the total of
196 shares of Society Generale.
</P>
<P>
SG said that it would offer a 17 percent premium above the
Paribas share price over the past 20 trading days during the
operation, which will be from February 9 till March 16.
</P>
<P>
The new group will have six main areas of business: retail
banking, special financial services, banking services and asset
management, shareholdings, and property.
</P>
<P>
SG Paribas will also be the leader in international investment
banking activities, ranking among the world's top five in
eurobonds, derivatives, and international trade finance.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli joint venture has
won the bid to build Cyprus' second desalination plant, Cyprus'
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Minister Costas
Themistocleous announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The tender was won by the joint venture of two Israeli
companies, Ide and OCEANA. The Cyprus government will buy water
from the joint venture at the price of 42.2 Cyprus cents per cubic
metre (about 85 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister, in less than two years, all
households in Cyprus will have constant supply of water.
</P>
<P>
Themistocleous said resevoirs in Cyprus now have 30 million
cubic metres of water, only about 11 percent of their total
capacity, far behind the amount of water needed for the year.

<HEADLINE> Americans at U.N. Seek Parity With Foreign Co-workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of American
citizens working for the United Nations in professional-level jobs
are preparing to step up a fight to receive the same education
grants for their children that foreign officials get in New York.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement more than 50 years old, foreign
professionals working at the United Nations headquarters here as
specialists in a range of fields including economics, political
affairs and technical or financial services receive more than
15,500 U.S. dollars a year for each child in school in New York,
the New York Times, a major U.S. newspaper, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Americans do not get the grants, which were intended to allow
foreign families to pay for a private education in language or
culture of their home countries, so that the children could return
comfortably to those nations.
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be so bad if it were sued for the purpose
intended," an American working here said. The reality, this
official and others from various countries said, is that the grant
buys entry to the best private schools and colleges for children
who may have been born in this country, have an American parent or
be part of a family settled here.
</P>
<P>
"What makes it so unjust is that many of these children are
Americans like our children," an American parent said. The
Americans -- about 108 officials with a total of more than 170
children -- want help from United Nations representatives on the
United Nations committee that determines these grants, said
Stephen Baldwin, who recently retired as an official in the
Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Baldwin was among a group of Americans who petitioned
the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, the organization's
highest judicial panel, for equal treatment. They were turned
down.
</P>
<P>
Baldwin suggested in an interview with the newspaper that the
General Assembly, the group of 185 nations that formally sets the
grant levels, could freeze increases until the Americans could be
brought into the program. This would not add costs to the
organization's already hamstrung budget.
</P>
<P>
The United States, unlike many other nations, is perennially
reluctant to become involved in the cases of Americans working for
the United Nations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very helpful to us if our own representatives were
to take up this case and say this isn't a level playing field,"
Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
Another parent, who did not want to be identified, said the
American Governement's attitude "represents the low esteem with
which the United Nations is held in Washington."
</P>
<P>
Some American officials have recommended abolishing the grant
entirely, but Baldwin said that this would be politically
unrealistic and "draconian," because many families are involved
who do sent their children to foreign-language schools and need
financial help living in New York. Average salaries for these
professional-level jobs hover around 75,000 U.S. dollars and
80,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The education grant has become an untaxed windfall for
foreigners, augmenting their salaries substantially, American
professionals say.
</P>
<P>
The grants apply only to United Nations officials, whose
salaries and benefits are set or reviewed by the General Assembly
and the International Civil Service Commission. The supplements do
not apply to diplomats based in foreign missions in New York,
though they may qualify for other programs through their
respective governments.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes 1.77 Trillion Dollars Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton sent
Congress a 1.77 trillion U.S. dollars spending plan Monday for the
fiscal year of 2000, beginning a new century with record budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, proclaiming his budget marks a" new era of
opportunity," proposed increasing spending for the fiscal year
that begins next Oct. 1 by 2.3 percent. Even with the 39 billion
dollars increase over the current year, the new budget projects a
record 117 billion dollars surplus.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan forecasts 2.41 trillion dollars in surpluses
over the next decade, laying out a vision of plenty the country
has not known in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
President's budget was the opening shot in what is expected to
be a bitter struggle with the Republican-controlled Congress over
government priorities.
</P>
<P>
Republicans seek an across-the-board 10 percent cut in income
tax rates, returning 600 billion dollars or more to taxpayers over
the next decade. That, they say, is critical to keep the Democrats
from creating new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposals require approval by Congress, and it's
unclear how eager the two sides will be to reach compromise given
the impeachment battle and a looming presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the call for hundreds of billions in
across-the-board tax cuts, Clinton's budget offers targeted tax
relief of 36.2 billion dollars over five years.
</P>
<P>
This includes a 1,000 dollars tax credit to help people handle
long-term health care costs, and a 250 dollars credit for
stay-at-home parents caring for infants below the age of 1.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's budget also includes several proposals that
Republicans have rejected in past years _ including a
55-cent-a-pack increase in cigarette taxes. The president would
raise 53.4 billion dollars over five years from that.
</P>
<P>
As first outlined in his State of the Union speech, Clinton
proposed using 62 percent of the 4.85 trillion dollars in
projected surpluses over the next 15 years to shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
Republicans agree that much of the surplus should be set aside
for the retirement of 76 million baby boomers, although they
disagree with the president on the best way to do this.
</P>
<P>
But the big fight will be over what to do with the rest of the
projected surpluses. Clinton wants to devote the rest to support
Medicare, provide additional spending for the military and
domestic programs and set up new retirement accounts to funnel 36
billion dollars annually into individuals' savings.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed a 280.8 billion dollars defense budget for
2000, including 53 billion dollars for hi-teck weapons.
</P>
<P>
the 280.8 billion dollars, which includes 13.6 billion for the
Energy Department and others with military responsibility, was a
slight increase over the 276.2 billion dollars requested for 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Clinton's 2000 budget projects, the government will collect
1.88 trillion dollars in revenues, up 4.3 percent from the current
year. The 117 billion dollars surplus for 2000 follows a projected
79 billion dollars surplus this year and an actual 69 billion
dollars surplus realized in 1998, the first year the government
had finished in the black in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
The 2.41 trillion dollars in total surpluses the administration
envisions is about 160 billion below the amount forecast by the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The administration's
forecast foresees growth of 2 percent or above over the next five
years with no recession in sight, even though the current
expansion is already the longest in peacetime history.
</P>
<P>
Economists caution the budget surpluses could vanish if the
economy starts to turn sour.
</P>
<P>
Among highlights of Clinton's budget:
</P>
<P>
--Billions dollars more for the Pentagon over the next five
years although spending would actually go down in 2000. For the
entire period, Clinton proposes billions in new weapons purchases
and the largest pay raise for the military in two decades.
</P>
<P>
--5 billion dollars to build and renovate schools and hire
teachers. Clinton would tie part of that for the first time to
requirements that states upgrade the academic quality of their
weakest schools.
</P>
<P>
--5.3 billion dollars for health care initiatives over the next
five years, including expanding access to Medicare to people below
the current 65-year eligibility age.

<HEADLINE> Two Israelis Put Into Prison in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Two Israelis were sentenced to
three and a half years in prison in Cyprus Monday for approaching
a prohibited military area and possessing banned listening
equipment without due permission.
</P>
<P>
Igal Damary, 49, and Udi Hargov, 37, were arrested in early
November last year at the small fishing village of Zigi on the
Cypriot southern coast and found carrying radio scanners, a
lap-top computer, cell phones and eight maps of the island.
</P>
<P>
The village is near military installations, including an army
commando training camp.
</P>
<P>
After Damary and Hargov were arrested, the Israeli government,
U.S. Senators and European officials pressed Cyprus to drop the
espionage charges against them, claiming that the two Israelis
were in Cyprus for an anti-terrorist operation that was not aimed
at the Island.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Sets Budget for 2000, 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Environmental Program
(UNEP) Executive Director Klaus Toepfer presented here Monday a
budget of nearly 120 million U.S. Dollars for the years 2000 and
2001 in his policy statement at the opening of the 20th session of
UNEP's Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed biennial budget, or "financial envelope" of 119.4
million U.S. Dollars before the council for approval has been made
in the context of the immense challenges and expectations of
UNEP," Toepfer told assembled delegates.
</P>
<P>
The Governing Council elected by delegates from different
countries will review the budget proposed and decide whether to
pass it or not.
</P>
<P>
"This sum, in my view, is the minimum that would enable UNEP to
regain the effectiveness, critical mass and operating capital that
are essential to the execution of the program of work," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after his policy statement, Toepfer said
the projected budget represents only a modest increase on the
current biennium, and based on what governments agreed to in 1997,
is merely linked to inflation.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that 60 million a year for the global
environmental voice is too much to ask for," he said. "Especially
when you consider the increased demands on the organization with
our expanded mandate."
</P>
<P>
He told the press that UNEP has balanced its budget for the
first time since 1992, due to donations from different countries,
inter-governmental organizations and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
In his policy statement, Toepfer said the complexity of the new
global environment heightens the need for UNEP to be adequately
equipped, flexible and responsive to the emerging challenges.
With limited capacity within the organization itself, UNEP must
engage all relevant actors such as young environmentalists and
NGOs, to make environmental policies, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Prevention is better than cure," Toepfer stressed. "Reliable,
 accessible and relevant monitoring and assessment is the basis of
our approach to policy development."
</P>
<P>
The week-long Governing Council meeting, a forum for the
international community to address major and emerging
environmental policy issues, is being attended by environment
ministers and government representatives from around the world.
It culminates in a high-level meeting between February 4 and
February 5.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Rejects Seperation of Lebanese-Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said on Monday that the Israeli attempt to separate Lebanese
and Syrian tracks in the peace process is doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that pursuing the entwinement of the
Lebanese-Israeli and the Syrian-Israeli peace making tracks is a
final resolution of the two countries as well as a guarantee for
Lebanon against Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' remarks came in a response to Israeli Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon's comments on Sunday that it is wrong to link the
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon with the resumption of its
negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also said that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon should
not be contingent upon a deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Israel and Syria over returning the strategic
Golan Heights to Syria, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle
East war, have been suspended since 1996 after the hard-line Likud
government of Benjamin Netanyahu came to power.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused Syria, which has 40,000 troops deployed in
Lebanon, of holding the security zone as a bargaining chip to seek
an Israeli full withdrawal.

TEHRAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Monday its police
confiscated over 147 tonnes of various drugs in the first 10
months of the current Iranian calendar year ending March 20.
</P>
<P>
Reza Saremi, an official at the anti-drug headquarters, said
the seized drugs included 118 tonnes of opium, 18 tonnes of
morphine and 11 tonnes of hashish, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Majlis (parliament) passed a strict anti-drug law
in January 1989, under which any one caught with 30 grams of
heroin or five kilograms of opium will be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no official figures on how many drug smugglers
have been executed since the law took effect, but some reports
put the figure at more than 3,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian opposition group
People's Mujaheddin Organization (MKO) has claimed responsibility
for a bomb attack Sunday afternoon against an Iranian secret
service building in Teheran. Media here reported Monday from MKO
office in the German city of Cologne.
</P>
<P>
No independent confirmation was immediately available and the
extent of the damage was unknown.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian news agency IRNA, an explosion in
northern Teheran blew out the windows of an apartment block. The
blast was caused by a home-made bomb or handgranade.
</P>
<P>
But the MKO office in Cologne said that it's insurgents used
several explosive charges in an attack that severely damaged the
headquarters of the country's secret police.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was in retribution for the assassination of Iranian
opposition activists at home and abroad, the MKO said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Marks Revolution Anniversary Amid Intensified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran started on Monday
celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Islamic revolution
amid intensified power struggles and concerns over the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
School bells rang and helicopters showered flowers on the
shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, founder of the
Islamic Republic, to mark his return from a 15-year exile the same
day 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd gathered inside the shrine to pay tribute to
Khomeini, who masterminded the Islamic revolution which toppled
the former pro-U.S. Pahlavi regime in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the crowd, former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani called for unity among the people despite their
differences.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that national solidarity must be protected as
extremist actions should be avoided and speeches aiming at
dividing national unity should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives and the moderates of the country have been
engaged in a heated political quarrel since the revelation of the
involvement of some agents of the conservative-controlled
Intelligence Ministry in the murders of several dissident
intellectuals late last year.
</P>
<P>
The moderates called for a fundamental change in the ministry,
but the conservatives counter attacked by accusing supporters of
moderate President Mohammad Khatami of being behind the murders.
</P>
<P>
The quarrel was intensified with the approaching of the
elections of local councils of cities and villages slated on
February 26.
</P>
<P>
The pro-moderate Interior Ministry, which is responsible for
holding elections, and the conservative-dominated election
supervisory committee blast each other of siding certain factions.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, the supervisory committee disqualified some 50
moderate candidates for the elections, reportedly including former
Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri, who was impeached by the
conservative Majlis (parliament) last June.
</P>
<P>
The move irritated the Interior Ministry and disappointed the
public, the young generation in particular, who pinned their hope
on Khatami's moderate supporters for a better future.
</P>
<P>
Badly hit by oil price fall, economic situation of the country
has become more and more worrying.
</P>
<P>
Rial, the Iranian currency, lost about 15 percent of its value
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
On Tehran's illegal but highly active black market, the
U.S. dollar was traded at 8,300 rials on Monday, from 7,100 rials
at the beginning of last month.
</P>
<P>
Many economists said the country would face a serious economic
recession this year as the future of oil prices is still dim.
</P>
<P>
"If people observe unity and step onto a single road, they can
overcome every kind of difficulties," Rafsanjani told the people
at Khomeini's shrine.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Back NATO in Event of Strike in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria would back NATO in the
event of a military strike against Yugoslavia to end the fighting
in Kosovo, Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov said in Monday's
edition of the daily Berliner Morgenpost.
</P>
<P>
"I'm certain that the international community will use every
means to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo.
That's what all the neighboring states want," Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
However, if there were military strikes, Bulgaria would "pursue
a policy of Euro-Atlantic solidarity", Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov reiterated his call for Bulgaria to be granted
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as
soon as it has met the necessary criteria.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the former Yugoslavia could be stabilized
better if Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia were NATO members,
Stoyanov said. The instability of Yugoslavia was harming the image
of the entire region, he added.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, Britain made it clear that it would support
Bulgaria's efforts to join the Atlantic alliance saying it was not
a question of whether Bulgaria should join, but of when.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation has been satisfied with the
economic adjustment in Sao Tome &AMP; Principe in 1998, saying that if
the good momentum continues this year, they will suggest that the
country be given the treatment of debt relief enjoyed by "highly
indebted poor country".
</P>
<P>
Idriss Team, head of the delegation, made the remarks Sunday
night before departure from the country after spending 15 days
there, according to reports reaching here from Sao Tome.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, inflation in the island country was down to 20 percent
from 81 percent in 1997. Meanwhile, the exchange rates turned
stable, public expenditure under control while national revenues
also improved, which is " positive and encouraging," he added.
</P>
<P>
To further improve the current economic situation in the
country, the World Bank and the IMF has asked the Sao Tome
government to reduce inflation to three percent, to boost annual
economic growth to four percent, by the year 2001.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes U.N. Statement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Monday welcomed a U.N. resolution on Kosovo and expressed its full
support.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the document, made Friday by the chairman of
the U.N. Security Council following the foreign ministers' meeting
of the six-nation Contact Group, "is oriented to political methods
of tackling Kosovo's problems and to the acceleration of talks
with active participation of the Contact Group and of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. statement confirms the "adherence (of the United
Nations) to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia, and the need to seek solutions on the basis of
equality of rights and respect for the legitimate interests of all
Kosovo ethnic communities," the Interfax news agency quoted a
ministry spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia believes "the U.N. Security Council has stated in clear
terms that it will keep the process of settlement in Kosovo under
its strict political control."
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear signal to all those who are advocating the use
of force and, concurrently, seek a redistribution of roles
undermining U. N. authority," the spokesman said, apparently
referring to NATO's threat of military actions.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a senior Russian defense official on
Monday express concern over a recent document authorizing NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana to order air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued Saturday by the NATO Council, means the
military alliance still regards armed force as the most effective
means of resolving the Kosovo conflict, Gen. Col. Leonid Ivashov,
head of the ministry's international cooperation department, said.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, the role of the OSCE and the U.N. Security Council
is being eroded."
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov noted some "progress" in NATO's line in parts
of the statement, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The document, he said, is putting equal pressure on both the
Yugoslav government and the ethnic Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
The NATO statement said Solana will take account of the Kosovo
Albanians' behavior in considering air attacks, and that the
alliance is looking for ways to prevent smuggling weapons into the
breakaway Yugoslav province.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Islamic
militant group Hamas shot to death a Palestinian policeman on
Monday in south Gaza Strip, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the policeman of the security forces of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was trying to arrest the two
Hamas members when they opened fire at him.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the two Hamas members were not officially
confirmed. But the report said they were Hamas fugitives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Bar-Illan, policy advisor of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Monday that 60 Palestinians
were freed from Palestinian jails last month on the occasion of
the Muslim holiday of Eid el-Fitr, 21 of whom had been imprisoned
for involvement in acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio in the day, Netanyahu also
reiterated that the released Hamas members included those
responsible for the deaths of United States citizens.
</P>
<P>
But the radio also said the top representative of the
U.S. Central Investigation Agency (CIA) in Israel has met with
Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub and has been persuaded
that the Israeli claim was not true.
</P>
<P>
The PNA also accused Israel of trying to torpedo the meeting
between PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, which is scheduled to be held in Washington in a few
days, by accusing the Palestinians of violating peace agreements.

<HEADLINE> Report on Early Warning of Africa's Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A report named " Early Warning
of Selected Emerging Environmental Issues in Africa ", published
by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), was made to the
public here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report identifies some emerging environmental issues facing
Africa by examining the inter-connected nature of population
dynamics, land cover distribution, protected areas and
trans-boundary water resources.
</P>
<P>
In the forward of the report, UNEP Executive Director Klaus
Toepfer said this report conveys a sense of urgency about the need
to develop suitable long-term strategies, attract investments and
stimulate international cooperation to conserve biodiversity and
fresh-water resources.
</P>
<P>
The report carries major findings of the study and suggested
policy responses.
</P>
<P>
About 63 percent of the total land in Africa lies within
trans-boundary river basins and five of the river baisn (The
Congo, Nile, Niger, Chad and Zambezi) occupy some 42 percent of
geographical area and sustain 44 percent of the African
population.
</P>
<P>
It says that in the interests of sustainable development, the
ripairan states should cooperate and develop collaborative
infrastructures for the scientific management of their shared
eco-systems.
</P>
<P>
The presence of crop land in protected areas show that legal
designation alone is not sufficient for the protection of
biodiversity in the face of human competition for the same land,
the report says, adding that the local shareholders should be
given economic incentives and a role in the conservation of
biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that a shift in national and
international policy and planning, based on targeting
biodiversity-rich areas, is needed for enhanced and effective
protection and conservation.
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes that it is imperative that the contradictions in
 approach and conflicts of interest of parties concerned should be
 harmonized in the interest of developing an effective
collaborative management for the protected areas with multi-party
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The report, part of UNEP's efforts to strength its early
warning and assessment functions, is being discussed at the
ongoing five-day UNEP Governing Council session, which opened here
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Solana Arrived in Germany to Talk on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The German government warned
Serbia and the Kosovar Albanians on Monday that they must
negotiate and reach agreement on autonomy for the southern Serb
province of Kosovo and on ending the violence there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after a meeting with the
Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO), Javier Solana, Schroeder said Germany stood firmly behind
the ultimatum issued to the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians by the
six-power Balkans contact group.
</P>
<P>
He said, the international community was "deadly earnest" in
its demands that the parties to the conflict should reach
agreement within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said, Germany was "ready for all eventualities" in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the contact group countries meeting
in London on January 29 called on Yugoslav leaders and Albanian
Kosovars to meet on February 6 in France and to reach an interim
peace agreement two weeks after that.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic had to
understand that the ultimatum had to be observed "to the minute".
</P>
<P>
Solana made today a one-day visit to Germany to discuss Kosovo
with the German government. He also talked with German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer and Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping.
</P>
<P>
Fischer told the press conference that if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic did not make concessions, "the consequences
will be too serious to speculate about".
</P>
<P>
He presumed Belgrade would send a high-ranking delegation to
the scene of the talks at Rambouillet, near Paris, which was
authorized to complete an agreement.
</P>
<P>
He added that the German armed forces had begun training
additional troops for possible deployment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Scharping had told Solana that Germany would make available a
"strengthened" battalion of 800 men. This unit would, if
necessary, back up the 350 Germans in the 1,800-strong
international force in Macedonia which was ready to ensure the
security of the 2,000 unarmed OSCE observers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Solana said NATO was both politically and militarily prepared
if the conflicting parties did not appear at the negotiating table
at Rambouillet on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
No new formal decision would be needed if a military attack
were needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Solana and Schroeder emphasised the constructive role of
Russia both in the contact group and the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The Balkans contact group comprises the United States, Russia,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

<HEADLINE> OAU Team Begins Probe Into 1994 Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An International Panel of
Eminent Personalities (IPEP) has begun investigation into the 1994
genocide in Rwanda which claimed the lives of more than 500,000
Tutsis and Hutu moderates.
</P>
<P>
The panel arrived in Kigali, capital of Rwanda, Sunday, on a
five-day fact-finding mission aimed at finding out the truth about
the Rwandan genocide and surrounding events which rocked the Great
Lakes region, according to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Their research will go as far back as August 1993, when the
Arusha peace agreement was signed, and will cover the period
extending to the first Congolese rebellion which culminated into
the fall of the dictatorial regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko
in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
''The object of our visit to Rwanda is to come and meet the
people of Rwanda and try to find out events which led to the
genocide,'' IPEP chairman, former president of Botswana Ketumile
Masire told the Rwanda News Agency upon arrival in Kigali Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from meeting government officials, the panel will also
talk to genocide survivors and visit some important genocide sites
where thousands of Tutsis were butchered. They will then visit
other countries in the Great Lakes Region, in Europe, the United
States, and Canada before drafting the conclusions to hand to the
heads of state of Organization of African Unity (OAU) member

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants to Develop Ties with Germany and EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia seeks a "dynamic and
constructive cooperation" with Germany, Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said in Bonn on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after meeting German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, Ivanov said he expected Schroeder's forthcoming visit
to Moscow to provide a fresh impulse for the growth of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder welcomed Moscow's desire to develop, together with
the European Union, the economic structures in Russia necessary
for a greater economic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister's discussions with Schroeder dealt chiefly
with preparations for the chancellor's visit to Moscow on February
18 and 19.
</P>
<P>
Germany is currently chairing the EU.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder intends to discuss with the Russian leadership the
expansion of bilateral ties as well as Russia's relations with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
In Cologne in June, the EU is scheduled to approve a joint
strategy towards Russia.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the contents of the strategy have already been
settled: the EU wants not only improved economic cooperation with
Russia, but also comprehensive political cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Kosovo, Ivanov said Russia regarded a
solution to the conflict from the viewpoint of establishing a new
security program for Europe.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Russia had, in that respect, common strategic aims,
not only as far as the Kosovo problem was concerned, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is ready to enter into the closest possible partnership
cooperation in order to counter all the risks and challenges
appropriately," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder noted the determination of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) and Russia to contribute in "different ways"
towards a political settlement of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Both NATO and Russia took the view that Serbs and Kosovo
Albanians would come to the negotiating table, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Russia had played, in the six-nation international Contact
Group on the Balkans, a role which Schroeder said he "very highly
esteemed". That role had been "constructive and certainly
contributed towards increasing the chances of a sensible
settlement in Kosovo".
</P>
<P>
Ivanov is in Bonn for two days of talks, including a meeting
with his German counterpart, Joschka Fischer.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Report Stresses Environmental Impact of Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Many small wild fires have
quickly escalated into large-scale and uncontrolled disasters in
recent two years, affecting adversly the environment and people,
according to a report released by the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report titled "Wildland Fires and the Environment: a Globe
Synthesis" provides an overview of the causes, impacts, and some
potential means for the international community to respond to
widespread forest and other wild fires.
</P>
<P>
It reveals that the gaseous and particulate emissions from the
1997 fires in Indonesia significantly exceeded those from the
Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991, another major environmental
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Most of the fires were set by locals for land clearing. Many
others were caused by extreme drought conditions related to the
1997 El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia alone, tens of millions of people were
exposed to high levels of fire-produced gases and particulates for
weeks at a time. The poor atmospheric visibility resulting from
the fires was responsible for the crash of a commercial airplane
and the collision of two ships. It will take years to measure
long-term negative impacts on the region's biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Gases produced by fire include carbon dioxide and methane which
are greenhouse gases that lead to global warming. Other gases are
chemically active and lead to the photo-chemical production of
ozone near ground. Ground level ozone is a pollutant with a
adverse impact on all living systems.
</P>
<P>
Fire also produces large amounts of particulate matter. These
small solid particles absorb and scatter incoming solar radiation
and impact planetary climate systems. In addition, smoke
particulates smaller than about 2.5 micrometers can easily enter
the human respiratory system with resultant health problems, said
the report.

that political consensus is necessary for stability in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Uganda
Nancy Powell Monday, Radio Uganda reported Monday.
</P>

the situation in the whole Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The factions also condemned the incidents of terrorism in
Tanzania, Kenya and South Africa, said the radio report.
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that terrorism is a big threat to all
countries and a united effort and cooperation against it is
needed.
</P>
<P>

situation in the region. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
Africa Susan Rice held talks recently with President Yoweri

KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament Speaker
Francis Ayume told a regional seminar here Monday that
accountability and transparency are central to good governance.
</P>
<P>
Opening the five-day seminar on parliament and good governance,
the speaker said when the two things are lacking, corruption and
misappropriation of public funds become rampant.
</P>
<P>
The best way of guaranteeing accountability and transparency is
through making government businesses open to public scrutiny and
control, he said.
</P>
<P>
The speaker told foreign parliamentarians that the parliament
in Uganda is at the forefront of the war against corruption in an
effort to provide good governance for all the people of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ayume commended the media in Uganda for the crusade against
corruption and hoped that the consensus that will emerge from the
meeting will be beneficial to Africa and further the ideals of
parliamentary democracy.
</P>

The seminar, whose theme is "Towards a new agenda for
controlling corruption in Africa", has drawn parliamentarians from
10 African countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France to Hold Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac will hold talks on the
latest developments of the Middle East peace process, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the discussions will be based on the initiative
declared by the two leaders last year for holding an international
conference to promote the Mideast peacemaking, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who arrived in Paris earlier in the day from Davos,
Switzerland, where he attended the World Economic Forum, will hold
talks with Chirac Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal "still stands" and is "applicable and viable,"
Moussa said, stressing that it should be put into practice in case
the peace process continues to be stalled.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks suffered another setback
after Israel in early December froze the latest peace deal, the Wye
River agreement.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Mubarak and Chirac will also touch on the
peace negotiations on the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese
tracks.
</P>
<P>
"The talks will also cover the Lebanese and Syrian tracks with
the aim to reach durable and comprehensive peace in the region,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Israel came to a halt in
early 1996 due to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights
which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed Egypt's readiness to cooperate with European
counties to help advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will intensify efforts and contacts with the European
states to break the peace deadlock," said the Egyptian minister.

for all Africa.
</P>
<P>
He is in Uganda as part of his tour of LWF countries in Africa
to determine which should be included on the priority list. The
decision has had to be made due to scarce resources, he noted,
addding that the resources should be shared in a qualitative and
focussed way.

He is expected to announce the new LWF program for Uganda
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Moldova: Prime Minister's Resignation Accepted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Petru
Lucinschi accepted late on Monday the resignation of the Prime
Minister Ion Ciubuc.
</P>
<P>
According to Rompres news agency, the President has already
begun consultations with the parliamentary groups to highlight a
candidate for the office of prime minister. The prerogative to
move a candidature for this post belongs to the head of the state,
as it is stipulated in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ion Ciubuc tendered his resignation early in the day. In
compliance with the constitution, his move signifies the
resignation of all the cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference in the government residence, Ion Ciubuc
designated the impossibility for the government to work under the
circumstances of the proposed power algorithm as the main motive
for his deed. In his opinion, a coalition government must build
its performance on principles of mutual understanding and respect,
but "There was always a lack of them," Ciubuc said with regret.
</P>
<P>
Ciubuc's center-right government was sworn in last May but
proved unable to deal with the economic difficulties provoked by
the impact of the Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ciubuc refused to speak about his successor, but noted that
Depute Prime Ministers Ion Sturza and Nicolae Andronic, as well as
Minister for Agriculture and Processing Industry Valeriu Bulgari
have energetic teams for forming a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, he called Chisinau mayor Serafim Urecheanu as the most
probable candidacy for the position.
</P>
<P>
He did not ruled out a probable participation by the Party of
Communists in the future government. "It depends on the candidacy
for the prime minister and forces, which will participate in the
formation of the cabinet," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The current parliamentary majority -- the Alliance for
Democracy and Reforms, formed after the election in last March,
consists of three of the four parliamentary factions, the
Democratic Convention, the Democratic and Prosperous Moldova Bloc
and the Party of Democratic Forces. The Party of Communists, which
ranked the first in election, became the only opposition in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The candidacy is to be presented late this week to the
parliament for approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Financial Holdings
(Finhold) Monday urged the government to timeously implement its
stated policies, while maintaining dialog with the private sector
in order to restore confidence in the economy this year.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 Zimbabwe Economic Review, Finhold, a local
financial group, said that the past year was very difficult with
all economic indicators deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
It noted that consultations with all stakeholders, as was seen
with the formation of the National Economic Consultative Forum and
the tripartite (the government, business and labour movement)
negotiation forum, need to be strengthened in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Such consultative frameworks should help to reduce policy
conflicts and result in easier implementation of the agreed
policies since all stakeholders will have been involved in the
designing stages," it said.
</P>
<P>
One key remedy for the deteriorating economic indicators,
Finhold said, is for the government to reduce its budget deficit
as this will reduce recourse to the monetary banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer price index
has reached an all time high of 46.6 percent for December, 1998
while interest rates are hovering above 41 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has indicated in its latest
economic bulletin that money supply growth rose from 17.8 percent
in October, last year to 27.1 in November, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in exports will have to be part of a strategy designed
to stabilise the Zimbabwean dollar in the long run," it said.

WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Danish researcher said
that life could have arisen 3.7 billion years ago, pushing back
the beginning of life further than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the latest issue of Science, Minik T. Rosin from

the conclusion after analyzing the carbon content of microscopic
globules of graphite retrieved from rocks in western Greenland
dating back 3.7 billion years.
</P>
<P>
Rosin found the levels of various types of carbon, the basis of
all life on Earth, indicating that some type of marine creature,
perhaps a type of plankton, existed at that time.
</P>
<P>
He said that the oldest known fossils of extremely primitive
forms of bacteria date back 3.5 billion years, but life may have
existed before leaving behind fossils that were later destroyed.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S President Bill Clinton
is to meet his foreign policy advisers on Monday to discuss how to
bring about a peace deal in Kosovo and the possibility of U.S.
troops going there, White House spokesman David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen, Vice President Al Gore, National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger, CIA Director George Tenet and others concerned
will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign policy team will brief the president on the
diplomatic activities over the last week including the Contact
Group announcement and the NATO ultimatum," Leavy said. "They'll
review the situation on the ground, then brief the president on
additional consultations from last week and how we proceed
forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Contact Groups -- the United States,
Russia, Britain, Germany and Iraly -- agreed on Friday to order
Serbs and ethnic Albanians to go to France by February 6 to begin
negotiations, setting a tight deadline for concluding a peace deal
between them.
</P>
<P>
NATO cleared the way on Saturday for the use of force to help
impose a deal on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said major decisions were not expected from Clinton's
meeting with his advisers and any decision on U.S. troops
participating in a peacekeeping force for Kosovo once a peace
deal is reached is some time away.
</P>
<P>
"There have been a lot of important questions raised about a
post-implementation force, what the mission would be, what the
exit strategy would be, and I'm sure those questions will be
raised with the president," Leavy said.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Takes Place at Ford Plant Power Station in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- An explosion and fire rocked
a generating station for a huge Ford Motor Company plant in
Dearborn of Michigan State in the United States Monday, injuring
more than a dozen people, some seriously.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen ambulances lined the streets around the burning
building, as heavy gray smoke billowed from the windows, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Nearby Oakwood Hospital received 12 to 14 people, some with
Priority One injuries, which is the most severe injury
designation, the reports quoted spokeswoman Jennifer George as
saying. She also said the hospital was expecting six to eight more
people.
</P>
<P>
University of Michigan Hospital spokeswoman Carol Craig said
its medical helicopter was heading to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Dearborn police cordoned off the area around the plant and said
they were being cautious because they feared there could be a
second explosion, an officer who wouldn't give his name said.
</P>
<P>
The 445-hectare Rouge facility was once the world's largest
auto plant. Henry Ford built the plant in 1918 because he dreamed
of building a car from start to finish in one location.
</P>
<P>
At its peak in the 1940s, 85,000 people worked at the plant in
Dearborn, about 11 kilometers west of Detroit. About 8,000 people
work at the six Ford factories still in operation at the Rouge,
and Ford builds the Mustang there.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Calls for Emergent Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Government of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) has called for an emergency
session of the U.N. Security Council on Kosovo in order to
"prevent aggressions" against the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a letter on Monday from Zivadin
Jovanovic, foreign minister of the FRY, to the president of the
Security Council for the month of February, Robert Fowler of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I call on you to inform all Council members of this letter and
to convene an emergency session of the Council in order to take
appropriate measures available under the (U.N.) Charter to prevent
aggressions against my country," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The decision by NATO, as a regional agency, to have its
Secretary General authorize air strikes against targets on FRY
territory, as well as the position contained in the letter that
this was a 'final warning', represent an open and clear threat of
aggression against the FRY as a sovereign and independent Member
State of the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, NATO's threat directly undermines the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the FRY and flagrantly violates the
principles enshrined in the U.N. charters," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's appeal was prompted by NATO's Saturday
decision to authorize its Secretary General Javier Solana to
order possible air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
As a regional organization, NATO, without the formal
authorization from the Security Council, has no right to launch
military action against Yugoslavia, an independent and sovereign
country.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Involvement in Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- France denied on Tuesday that the
French navy shelled a rebel position in Guinea Bissau, as claimed
by the Guinea-Bissau government.
</P>
<P>
"We denied the rumor that the 'Siroco' had opened fire after
being attacked," said Francois Rivasseau, an assistant spokesman
for the French Foreign Ministry Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
The vice-prime minister of Guinea-Bissau Francisco Fadul told
national radio of Portugal that the French warship, which was
carrying 300 Western African peacekeeping soldiers, shelled the
rebel position, killing many people.
</P>
<P>
Rivasseau said the "Siroco," however, is only a transport ship
that does not have the equipment to bomb the coast.
</P>
<P>
The "Siroco" has tried but failed to get close to the coast due
to the heavy fighting between the government forces and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
France has condemned the fighting and called on the two sides
to stop and renew dialogues in the framework of the Abuja peace
agreement, which was signed last November, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Brazil Replaces Its Central Bank President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 2 (Xinhua)-- Brazil's President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso Tuesday dismissed the president of
Brazil's Central Bank Francisco Lopes 18 days after he was
nominated to the post.
</P>
<P>
Lopes will be replaced by Arminio Fraga Neto, advisor of the
Soros Fundation run by international financier George Soros.
</P>
<P>
The change of the Central Bank president led a fluctuation from
one dollar against 1.82 to 1.84 reals.
</P>
<P>
The removal of Francisco Lopes, does not ``represent any
alteration in the current floating exchange rate system nor in the
overall economic policy guidelines, which will be maintained,''the
Finance Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Until Fraga is confirmed by the Congress, Demostenes Madureira
de Pinho of the central bank will serve as interim president.
</P>
<P>
Since restrictions were lifted on Brazil's foreign exchange
trading on Jan. 13, the Brazilian currency, the real, has
depreciated 32 percent against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which has Latin America's largest economy, has been in
talks with the IMF over the release of the second installment of a
41.5 billion dollars international rescue package.
</P>
<P>
In December, Brazil received 9 billion U.S. dollars from the
IMF and used it to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at
36 billion U.S. dollars, down from 74 billion dollars last July. A
second parcel might help restore the confidence of skittish
investors.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Finance Minister Pedro Malan said that
the appointment of Fraga, ``one of Brazil's best economists,'' was
in line with the current direction of the country's economic
policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony noted that Caribbean countries are former colonial
countries which fully understand the meaning of national
sovereignty. He said the understanding fully reflects the
aspiration of people to be united.
</P>
<P>
Anthony stressed that Saint Lucia pursues the "one China"
policy and sees no reason why China's mainland should not be
reunited with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral relations have developed smoothly since the
establishment of diplomatic ties, and noted that the goal of the
current visit is to further consolidate friendship.
</P>
<P>
Friendship with China is of great importance for Saint Lucia,
an island country which covers 616 sq.km and has a population of
150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Antony noted that China is a major economic power which plays
an active role in economic globalization and the formation of a
new world economic order. China's efforts to help relax the Asian
financial crisis has not only benefited Asian countries, but also
small countries like Saint Lucia.
</P>
<P>
Anthony said China and Saint Lucia signed an economic and
technological cooperation agreement during the visit. He expressed
the belief that bilateral relations should not simply be
determined by political relations, but instead in terms of
cooperation at all levels. Anthony cited the vast potential for
broad cooperation and said Saint Lucia welcomes Chinese investment.
"China has opened its door to us and we will reciprocate," said
Anthony.

MOGADISHU, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Abdalle Aroneh clansman, and
Eli-Omar clansmen loyal to Ali Mahdi Mohamed of the main Abgal
clan signed a four- point peace deal over their conflict on Monday
night in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Twenty delegates, 10 each, from the two sides attended the

The two sides agreed to implement an immediate and effective
cease-fire beginning mid-day Tuesday, exchange the 24 war
prisoners (five from one side and 19 from the other side) caught
during the fighting and kept in the countryside Tuesday, open the
200-meter-long road linking Mogadishu to the coastal towns
northeast of the capital and settle all prior disputes between the
two sides, including the land ownership and grazing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
(NPC) Financial and Economic Committee is currently reviewing the
nation's 1999 economic plan and budget.
</P>
<P>
Five government departments reported to the Committee on issues
concerning implementation of the 1998 plan for national economic
and social development and the budget.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee reaffirmed the government's role in
scoring a rapid economic growth rate during 1998 in spite of the
impact of the Asian economic crisis and severe summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
Members also voiced a number of opinions on "difficult issues
of public concern," including reform of the state-owned sector,
the national debt, deficits and investment in science research and
education.
</P>
<P>
The law requires preliminary examinations of the economic plan
and budget affairs at least one month before the full annual
session of the NPC which is responsible for adopting the formal
annual economic development plan and budget.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuqing said that state-owned enterprises still face
difficulties and noted that last year's reform efforts had little
effect.
</P>
<P>
"We have two years left to extricate loss-making state-owned
enterprises from difficulties and transform them into profitable
ones," according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
He said China needs to adopt flexible credit measures to
encourage consumption and stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Government departments estimated the ratios for budgetary
deficits and accumulative national debts to GDP will hit 1.7 and
10 percent respectively in 1999, with both ratios much lower than
the internationally recognized warning levels.
</P>
<P>
However, Yao Zhenhuai noted that the financial situation of the
central government is subject to a certain degree of risk if it is
in fact the sole debtor.
</P>
<P>
"Related factors must be taken into account when drafting the
central budget," said Yao.

Liu Bin, a member of the NPC Education, Scientific, Cultural
and Health Care Committee, criticized the government's failure to
invest legally prescribed growth rates for education and
scientific research over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, a member of the Financial and Economic Committee,
said government departments should correctly understand that
meaning of "active fiscal policy" does not only refer to spending
more, but also to "actively increasing government revenues."
</P>
<P>
He warned that local governments should avoid overspending in
order to avoid endangering the economic order.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the 7.8 percent economic growth rate for last year,
the State Statistics Bureau explained that China's GDP rose 7.2
percent in the first quarter of 1998, 6.8 percent in the second
quarter, 7.6 percent in the third quarter and nine percent in the
four quarter. The bureau noted that the annual growth rate reached
7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
This rising trend resulted from stronger government measures,
according to a bureau official.
</P>
<P>
The general principles for formulation of the national economic
plan and budget for this year include:
</P>
<P>
-- increasing domestic market demand as the major means for
promoting economic growth;
</P>
<P>
-- stabilizing agriculture and expanding industrial production
by deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- using all means possible to increase exports;
</P>
<P>
-- preventing and eliminating financial risk; and
</P>

-- maintaining sustained, rapid and healthy national economic
development.

MOFTEC is currently drafting ruled governing bids for import
and tariff quotas, according to Vice-Minister Gao Hucheng.
</P>
<P>
Shi called for follow-up, feedback, readjustment and control
mechanisms to strengthen management and ensure the efficient use
of quotas. China encourages imports of machinery and electrical
products, especially new and high-tech products, as well as key
equipment. Shi added that this year's plans call for increase
imports of goods which will promote readjustments of the economic

</P>
<P>
He called on chambers of commerce to strengthen coordination

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Official Attends Meeting on POWs Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah
Tuesday left for Geneva to attend a meeting on the issue of
Kuwaiti detainees in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A tripartite committee, which groups Kuwait, Iraq and the 1991
Gulf war allies, is due to meet on Wednesday and Thursday to
review the issue of Kuwaiti and other countries' prisoners of war
(POWs) captured by Iraqi troops during its occupation of Kuwait in
1990-1991, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it will not take part in the Geneva meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Salem, also head of the National
Committee for Missing and POWs, praised the role of the United
Nations Security Council members who recently decided to set up a
panel to assess Iraq's compliance with a international mandate
regarding the issue of Kuwaiti POWs.
</P>
<P>
These international efforts brought relief to the Kuwaitis,
Salem said.
</P>
<P>
A similar meeting scheduled for early January on the Kuwaiti
side of the border with Iraq was canceled because the Iraqis
refused to show up.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that Iraq still holds more than 600 detainees of
Kuwait and other countries, an allegation that has been repeatedly
rejected by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs remains one of the main stumbling blocks for
an improvement of relations between Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So far, other issues arising from the seven-month occupation,
namely the U.N.-mediated demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border
and Iraq's compensation through U.N.-monitored Iraqi oil-sales,
have been solved.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President in Congo (K) for Peace Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba is now in Kinshasa Tuesday in a fresh bid to end six
months of civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a report
reaching here from the Congolese capital said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba and Congolese President Laurent Kabila would discuss
peace talks to be held in Lusaka, Zambia in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The talks, to involve foreign and defense ministers from the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and those from
Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, Libya and Uganda, are part of Chiluba's
plan to secure a cease-fire in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa residents turned out in force Tuesday, lining the
streets to welcome Chiluba with singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
"I sense something important has been reached," Kabila's
cabinet director Abdoulaye Yerodia was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It seems something is coming up like the removal of the last
obstacle. And maybe soon one will be able to say peace has
returned," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba has spearheaded regional efforts to end the conflict
which erupted in Africa's third largest country on August 2 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda, who helped him topple former
President Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, of fomenting the revolt
by ethnic Tutsis and other opponents.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have all sent troops to
fight for Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda, who fell out with Kabila over how to ensure
security on their western borders, say their own security
concerns must be addressed first.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton touched off a struggle with the
Republican Congress over the size and role of government,
unveiling a nearly $1.8 trillion federal budget that rejects the
GDP's big across-the-board tax cuts and proposes aggressive use of
federal spending and tax policy to cure national problems.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. and European officials have begun detailed discussions
on the tasks, size and shape of a NATO peacekeeping mission to
Kosovo, signaling an increasing likelihood that American troops
are bound for the embattled Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Seeking to bolster an obstruction-of-justice charge against
President Clinton, a House Republican prosecutor interviewed
Monica Lewinsky under oath and on videotape for nearly four hours.
White House lawyers offered only an apology to the young woman and
made no inquiries of their own.
</P>
<P>
-- American officials said that momentum was building that
could lead to a substantial easing of economic sanctions imposed
on India after it conducted nuclear tests in May. It could also
lead to India's signing the test ban treaty, probably by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. manufacturing showed signs of strength in January as
production and new orders rose. Adding momentum, personal income
and construction spending rose in December.
</P>
<P>
-- In a clear sign that the advent of Europe's common currency
is accelerating a banking shakeout, France's Societe Generale and
Paribas announced plans to merge in a $17 billion stock deal,
creating a new European behemoth.

<HEADLINE> Saint Lucian Prime Minister Extols Friendship (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua)-- Today's bone-chilling winter
winds failed to dampen Saint Lucian Prime Minister Kenny Anthony's
fascination with the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
"I will never forget my marvelous visit to the Great Wall,"
said Anthony.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Saint Lucian delegation, which arrived in the
Chinese capital three days ago, also marveled at China's
achievements in recent years. "Visiting this extraordinary city
has been special experience," according to Anthony.
</P>
<P>
Saint Lucia achieved independence 20 years ago and its people
are concentrating on economic development. Anthony noted that
China clearly demonstrates the achievements a country can make
during the development process, while at the same time maintaining
its historical tradition. "I'm full of hope and confidence about
the future development of my nation," said Anthony.
</P>
<P>
Anthony is the first prime minister from Saint Lucia to visit
China since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in September
1997. Saint Lucia's decision to establish relations with China was
based on its realization of the importance of fully exercising
sovereignty and the fact that the two nations share common views
on many issues. "Our diplomatic relations have sound ideological
grounding," noted Anthony.

<HEADLINE> EU Commits Anti-Doping Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
committed on Tuesday its efforts in the fight against doping in
international sports.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to the world conference on doping in
sports, European Culture Commissioner Marcelino Oreja said: "The
European Union is totally committed to combating doping."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that the European council at the heads of
state and government level last December in Vienna had promised to
do whatever the 15-nation bloc could to stamp out this wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The union promised to work hand in hand with the sporting
organizations in the fight against doping and Europe has a special
political reason for it.
</P>
<P>
Oreja said: "Europe is the birth-place of the Olympics and more
world championships and Olympic Games are held in Europe than
anywhere else. So Europe has almost a natural duty to lead the
way in this fight."
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the European Union,
suggested a three-phase combat against doping in sports among the
union member states and countries elsewhere. Its measures include
unified regulation, unified measure and strict enforcement.
</P>
<P>
It believes that to make the fight effective there has to be a
clear-cut definition of doping, a single list of banned substances
recognized by all sporting organizations, harmonized tests and a
harmonized system of penalties.
</P>
<P>
The European Union promised to study intensively the doping
problem after the world anti-doping conference and before May to
decide what concrete actions it can take to implement the
agreements made at the world anti-doping conference.

<HEADLINE> Russian Minister Vows to Fight Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin vowed Tuesday to crack down on the radical-right Russian
National Unity (RNE) movement if its actions "go beyond the limits
of the law."
</P>
<P>
Several hundred members of the neo-Nazi movement, wearing black
uniforms and red armbands with a swastika-like symbol, staged a
march in northern Moscow on Sunday. Police detained some of the
marchers but soon released them, arguing that they had no formal
grounds for halting the march or arresting the participants
because the RNE was registered with city authorities.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin said a conference on Monday thoroughly discussed the
march, the latest in a series of incidents highlighting the rise
of political extremism, and some police chiefs have been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
"That march was illegal, and it was the duty of the police to
prevent it. I've issued an order, so they will hold no more
marches of this kind either in Moscow or in other cities,"
Stepashin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Russian Security Council will hold a special
session on measures to combat political and religious extremism.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged the State Duma, or lower house of the
Russian parliament, to speed up the discussion of draft laws on
ways of combating extremism.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prosecutor General Yuri
Skuratov resigned Tuesday for "health reasons," the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin, who returned to the Kremlin for the
first time after checking out of the Central Clinical Hospital
Sunday, accepted his resignation and sent a letter to the
Federation Council, or the upper house of parliament, the
presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has urged the council, which nominates prosecutor
generals, to free Skuratov from his duties immediately.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov's deputy, Yuri Chaika, told the Interfax news agency
that Skuratov was hospitalized after complaining of pains in the
area of his heart Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Lisov, head of the Chief Control Department of the
presidential administration, denied reports that Skuratov resigned
due to a conflict with the administration, saying his department
had a good relationship with the Prosecutor General's office.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said the Federation Council would consider Skuratov's
resignation on February 16.
</P>

A spokesman for the council said under the Russian Constitution,
"the prosecutor general is appointed and dismissed by the

<HEADLINE> China Observatory to Install Astronomical Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Astronomical
Observatory (BAO) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
plans to install an astronomical telescope with a diameter of four
meters at its Xinglong Station by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopy Telescope (
LAMOST) will be the largest of its kinds in the world, according
to BAO Astronomer Su Hongjun.
</P>
<P>
LAMOST will have a focal distance of 20 meters and will be able
to observe 4,000 astronomical spectrum in a single night, far
above the average 600 observations for other telescopes of its
kind, said Su.
</P>
<P>
The telescope will have the capacity to observe stars which are
millions of times darker than those visible to the naked eye,
according to Su.
</P>
<P>
CAS Academicians Wang Shouguan and Su Dingqiang proposed the
LAMOST Project which was listed as one of the top-priority
scientific projects in 1996. The State Planning Commission
approved the undertaking of the project in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Su noted that the project is in the initial design stage. He
added that the telescope will improve the research of stars and
galaxies both inside and outside the Galaxy.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthening Efforts to Protect Wetland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China is strengthening wetland
protection by drafting new rules, said an official from the
National Administration of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Today is set as the "World Wetland Day". Zhang Jianlong,
director of the department of the wilderness under the NAF, called
on the government to spare no efforts to protect wetlands in China,
which is facing continuing degeneration.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that China is formulating a plan of action
concerning wetlands protection, which will be submitted to the
State Council for approval by this mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NAF is also considering drafting a national
regulation on wetland conservation.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, the natural ecological systems often referred to as
the earth's "kidneys", play an important role in water
conservation and the prevention of erosion and flooding.
</P>
<P>
China now has wetlands with acreage amounting to 65.7 million
ha. The NAF launched an investigation on current wetlands in
china, and the results are expected to be available by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In past years, the increasing population and economic
development have resulted in the continued deterioration of
wetlands in China, noted Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the NAF show that in the past forty years, the
country lost some two million ha of wetland or one half of the
acreage of the country's coastal wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Some experts even said heavy flooding along China's Yangtze,
Nenjiang and Songhua rivers last summer have been caused, at least
in part, by the continuing degeneration of the wetlands.
</P>
<P>
China signed the "Wetlands Convention of International
Importance, Especially in Waterfowl Habitats" in 1992. So far, it
has set up 148 natural reserves to protect the wetlands, covering
an area of 12.83 million ha.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Visit Saudi Arabia on Bilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss is expected to start his first official visit to Saudi
Arabia on Saturday since he came to power at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Hoss said that the prime minister will hold a
series of talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and other
government officials on bilateral ties and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hoss will also meet with officials of Saudi Arabia's Chamber
of Commerce and the Saudi Development Fund to explain the new
regime's eagerness to encourage investment in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hoss's visit will be dedicated to head off a possible backlash
for foreign investments into the country due to the exit from
power of billionaire ex-premier Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's good personal relationship with leaders of some
foreign countries, especially France and Saudi Arabia, has helped
attract sizable investments in the country's multi-billion
U.S. dollars drive to rebuild Lebanon from the debris of the
1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Hoss was designated by the newly elected President Emile
Lahoud as premier last December after Hariri refused to stay in
office following a six-year mandate under former president Elias
Hrawi.

<HEADLINE> O'Sullivan May Miss World Athletics Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan on
Tuesday revealed she may ignore this year's World Athletics
Championships in Seville, Spain, to focus her training schedule on
the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Irish star have won both the European and world 3,000-meter
and 5,000m titles in the preceding years.
</P>
<P>
She has already opted to miss the forthcoming World Cross-
Country Championships, in which last season she won both the 8
kilomteres and 4-km gold medals in a two-day tournament in
Marakesh, Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Now O'Sullivan, who completed a unique 5,000m and 10,000m
double in last summer's European Championships, is weighing up her
options before making a final decision about competing in Spain.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility I may not run in Seville but there is
also a possibility I will. All I can tell you for now is that my
number one goal is the Olympics in Sydney," said 29-year-old O'

<HEADLINE> Pak-U.S. Talks on Non-proliferation Remain Inconclusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United
States ended their talks on issues of nuclear non-proliferation
and security here Tuesday with no specific results.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides agreed to hold further expert-level meetings on
export controls and strategic restraints in March and April," said
a joint statement issued after the talks held between Pakistan's
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed and U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
The two countries considered further steps to advance the
objectives of the dialogue and agreed to remain in close touch
during the negotiations on Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the
Conference on Disarmament, according to the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government reiterated its position on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty enunciated by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif in his address to the U.N. General Assembly in September
last year, that is Pakistan will sign the CTBT until all sanctions
against it are lifted.
</P>
<P>
This was the eighth round of talks on the issues of nuclear
non-proliferation and security between Pakistan and the United
States in eight months, which were held in a "positive and
constructive atmosphere", said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reviewed the security situation in South Asia
particularly in the context of the agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side expressed its "strong support" for the current
talks between Pakistan and India including on Kashmir, and the
Pakistani side urged the United States to play a more active role
towards the solution of the Kashmir dispute, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the next round of the dialogue will
be held before the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both Shamshad and Talbott were optimistic about the
process of dialogue. "During these eight rounds of talks we have
significantly achieved our objectives," said Shamshad during a
briefing at the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign secretary declined to go into details
about what the two sides had achieved.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said on the occasion that "we covered full gamut of our
issues in the relationship. The United States and Pakistan have
many, many interests across of wide scope that we want to develop
and we have touched on a number of those here, too."
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who arrived here from New Delhi Monday afternoon, also
called on Prime Minister Sharif and held a meeting with Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Talbott, Sharif emphasized Pakistan's
desire for "a durable peace and stability" in the region and the
role which the United States and the international community
should play for "an expeditious final settlement of the Jammu and
Kashmir dispute which lay at the center of security problems in
South Asia," said a press release by the Prime Minister's Office.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Somalia Aid Coordination
Body (SACB) Monday condemned the murder of Dr. M.S. Bohgal, an
Italian aid worker, in Somali's Gedo Region on January 26.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued here, SACB Executive Committee
said that while the events leading to this tragic and horrific
incident remain unclear, the SACB wishes to make it clear that any
atrocity against aid personnel is totally unacceptable and will
not be tolerated under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Bohgal belongs to Terra Nova, an Italian humanitarian group,
and the statement did not specify where Gedo region is situated in
the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The international body consisting of donors, United Nations
Agencies and international non-governmental organizations
demanded in the statement that relevant local authorities "act
responsibly and expeditiously to bring the perpetrators of this
heinous and repugnant crime to justice".
</P>
<P>
As a response to the crime, the SACB has recommended the
immediate suspension of all current and proposed rehabilitation
activities by international agencies in Gedo region.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate in
January was 2.97 percent, lower than that of the same period in
previous year which recorded 6.88 percent, the Central Statistics
Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The higher inflation in January 1998 was caused by a very low
exchange rate of Indonesian rupiah against the U.S. dollars which
reached 15,000 rupiah per dollar in that month, Chief of the
agency Sugito Suwito told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate in January this year was 8,000 to 9,000
rupiah per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The 2.97 percent inflation in January was due to the increase
of consumer price index, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said the inflation rate from April 1998 to January 1999
was 43.89 percent, compared with 15.97 in the same period of the
previous fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> IOC Inquiry not Extended to Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee stated that the ad-hoc commission looking into
allegations of unethical behaviour by the IOC members would not
extend its inquiry to the Sydney bid for the 27th Olympic Summer
Games in 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release of the IOC, pursuant to the
recommendation of the ad-hoc commission, the IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch sent letters of inquiry on January 29 relating
to all past Olympic Games bidding cities for the 1996, 1998, 2000,
2002 and 2004 Olympic Games. A similar letter has been sent to
the 2006 Olympic bidding cities citing together with further
instructions on the bidding process. Sydney is expected to
respond to this letter, as are the other bidding cities, before
February 15.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympic Committee John Coates disclosed last month
that he gave 35,000 U.S. dollars each to two African IOC members
on the eve of the IOC's voting for 2000 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said that no further official inquiry has been opened,
and no decision to open any inquiry on past bidding practices will
be taken until further information is received from the bidding
cities.
</P>
<P>
The IOC reiterated that the inquiry into the bidding practices
of Salt Lake City was based on specific facts and documents, not
rumors or unfounded allegations.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the Salt Lake City bidding scandal has
led to resignation of four IOC members and five more suspended.

<HEADLINE> EU Studies Duty-Free Cut-off Effect on Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
on Tuesday that it has initiated a study that will re-examine the
effects on employment when duty-free sales end on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, the EU agreed unanimously to abolish duty-free
sales of tobacco and alcohol at EU ports and airports in mid-1999.
Such sales were seen as a blatant distortion within the bloc's
single market.
</P>
<P>
Abolishing duty-free sales will eliminate nearly 350,000
permanent jobs within the union, and see a loss in annual revenues
in the billions of euros.
</P>
<P>
The EU, harassed by high unemployment for the past decade, is
being challenged with the wisdom of abolishing the job-intensive
trade at a time when almost all union member states are striving
to increase employment.
</P>
<P>
European Union states such as Germany, France and Britain
recommended revising the duty-free cut-off decision during last
December's EU Summit in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
But any revisions need the unanimous agreement of the 15
finance and economy ministers from the member states to allow the
extension.
</P>
<P>
Denmark has been one of the outspoken critics of the revision
idea. It argues that an extension of duty-free sales after July 1
would damage the credibility of the European Union.

<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Civil Affairs
plans to accelerate the establishment of a minimum living standard
system for Chinese urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
The system, an essential part of the comprehensive social
security network, will be carried out at a crucial point in the
reform of state-run enterprises and will have a dramatic impact on
unemployment and social stability, according to a circular issued
by the Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that the system should be established in
most cities no later than the end of June this year, with
postponement of the deadline to the end of this October applicable
only to areas subject to abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
The circular stressed that establishment of the system is a
realistic measure which will be carried in line with the needs of
economic development and establishing a minimum living standard.
It notes that priority should be given to laid-off workers and
retirees.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide social security system should absorb more
educated staffers with a sense of responsibility and more
regulations are needed to ensure that the system functions
satisfactorily, according to the ministry.

BRUSSELS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Tuesday that it has approved the entry of Motorola as a
shareholder of Symbian in producing an operating system for
wireless information devices (WIDs).
</P>
<P>
The approval means that Motorola can now join with its Symbian
partners in developing and producing the operating system.
</P>
<P>
Symbian is a joint venture created last August by European
mobile phone manufacturers Ericsson, Nokia and the hand-held
computer and operating system manufacturer Psion.
</P>
<P>
The aim of Ericsson, Nokia and Motorola, as manufacturers of
wireless information devices, and Psion, as a developer of this
technology, is to establish the EPOC operating system as a
standard for wireless information devices and to stimulate the
development of a mass market.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the watch-dog for fair competition within the
European Union (EU) market, has established that the entry by the
American mobile phone manufacturer into the WIDs cooperation does
not constitute an advantage against other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The commission also received a formal commitment from Symbian's
shareholders that the operating system will be licensed to third
parties on an open and non-discriminatory basis.

BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Medical experts in Beijing
announced today that the capital aims to contain the number of
AIDS patients to under 30,000 by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve this, Beijing is expected to step up the
detection of AIDS and unveil a set of regulations to prevent the
spreading of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The municipality will also use media coverage to increase
public awareness of AIDS prevention, and include information about
the prevention and treatment of AIDS into the public service
system.
</P>
<P>
By last December, a total of 285 people had been found to be
infected with AIDS, including 105 Beijingers and 65 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The challenge in preventing AIDS is severe for the city
authorities since the number of AIDS patients found climbed to 96
last year, compared with 20 to 40 in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has allocated nearly nine million yuan for the
prevention of AIDS during the past ten years, and 37 test centers
have been set up so far, making the detection of the disease
easier.

<HEADLINE> Drought Hits Vietnam's Northern and Southern Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's northern and southern
provinces were hit by drought, Vietnam's English daily "the Saigon
Times Daily" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Drought has gripped through northern provinces, leaving some
1.3 million people thirsty for water and threatening vast paddy
areas, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
The Water and Irrigation Management Department of Vietnam's
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said 360,000
hectares of 2.5 million hectares of winter-spring paddy in
northern Vietnam would likely to be parched.
</P>
<P>
If the water level of the Red River falls by 2.0 meters, but
irrigation canals are not dredged now to reserve water, the
on-going drought will impose more serious impacts, according to
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces have planned to use 30 percent to 50 percent of
more than 160,000 hectares of winter-spring paddy likely to be
destroyed by the drought for cultivating short-term cassava, sweet
potatoes, beans, peanuts or sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Mekong Delta is also in the same boat, said the
daily, with more than 200,000 hectares of paddy lacking fresh
water and invaded by seawater, including 100,000 hectares in Kien
Giang Province, 55,000 hectares in Soc Trang Province and 49,000
hectares in Tra Vinh Province.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said
local authorities had developed water sources and called for the
public to use water more economically, dig water wells and build
rain water reservoirs. If the situation gets worse, people can be
evacuated from affected areas.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Import 190,000 Tons of KCL Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans
to import 190,000 tons of KCL fertilizer and hundreds of thousands
of tons of other fertilizers to help solve a shortage faced by
farmers, Agriculture Minister Soleh Solahuddin said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the import plan will allay the worry being felt by
farmers," the minister told reporters after meeting with President
B.J. Habibie at Merdeka Palace here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soleh was summoned to the Merdeka Palace along with Trade and
Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan, State Minister for Food Affairs
A.M. Saefuddin and Bank Indonesia Governor Syahril Sabirin for a
discussion of efforts to make this year's paddy planting program a
success.
</P>
<P>
Soleh disclosed the government's KCL fertilizer import plan
after noting that farmers had recently complained about
difficulties in obtaining this type of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The price of KCL fertilizer has soared to 1,650 rupiah (about
0.2 U.S. dollar) per kilogram from 850 rupiah after the government
scrapped its subsidy to the fertilizer's price.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions on the estimated rice output for this
year, Soleh said, production would reach between 50 and 53 million
tons of dried hulled rice compared to last year's output of 46.5
to 47 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he was optimistic that this year's rice
output would increase as a result of a significant rise in the

<HEADLINE> Veteran Brazilian Cesar to Join Panathinaikos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Borussia Dortmund has agreed to
release veteran Brazilian defender Julio Cesar and allow him to
join Greece's Panathinaikos Athens, the Bundesliga club said in
Dortmund on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cesar, 35, will move to Greece in a transfer deal worth 300,000
marks (about 173,360 U.S. dollars), Dortmund said.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian angered Dortmund's front office last week when he
left the team's training camp in Turkey, reportedly with a knee
injury. But he failed to consult a Dortmund doctor and instead
reportedly attended to private business in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
Cesar rejoined Dortmund in November, after a six-month stint
with Botafogo of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian had already played for Borussia Dortmund between
1994 and 1998, winning the European Champions Cup title in 1987
and the German Bundesliga championships in 1995 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Obstructing Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Health Ministry on
Tuesday accused the U.S. and British representatives in the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking the approval of two important
health contracts concluded under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed source in the ministry told the Iraqi News Agency
that one contract is related to purchasing an apparatus called
Arjon Lazer that can be used to treat diseases of retina.
</P>
<P>
This contract was suspended by the U.S. and British
representatives under the pretext that the apparatus was of dual
military use, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The source added that the apparatus was of limited capacity
less than two watts and could not be used for other purposes, and
that Iraq had imported such kind of apparatuses in the 1980s and
they were used by physicians to save patients from blindness.
</P>
<P>
The other contract that was suspended by U.S. representatives
is related to an apparatus called "Laser Exaimar" that can be
operated by lazer radiation and ultraviolet ray to treat diseases
such as short-sightedness, far-sightedness and astigmatism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. representative put this contract on hold under the
pretext that some of its components could be used in tests of
missiles, said the source, adding that such kind of apparatus
could only be used for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been suffering from shortages of medicine and medical
appliances due to the over eight-year U.N. sanctions imposed on
the country following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, now under its fifth phase, allows Iraq
to export limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 22 million people.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, Japan Shine Fourth Day of Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, February 2 (Xinhua) -- It was the
Kazakhstan and Japan's turn to shine in the Kangwon Winter Asiad
on Tuesday when they split the four gold medals of the fourth day
of the games, with South Korea and China content with just silvers
or bronzes after their medals haul in previous competitions.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, who won all cross country competitions except women'
s relay at the last edition of the Games in Harbin, China, in 1996,
took the gold medal in the men's cross country 4x10 kilometers
relay on the Rainbow Snow Course in Yongpyong, while Japan claimed
the other gold on the skiing in the men's giant slalom.
</P>
<P>
The close rivals also played even in the Outdoor Ice Rink in
Chunchon where Kazakhstan pocketed the gold in the men's speed
skating 5,000 meters race and Japan won the women's 3,000m today.
</P>
<P>
Both Japan and Kazakhstan grab three golds, trailing behind
medals leader South Korea, with eight golds atop in the medal
standings, and China at the second place with six golds.
</P>
<P>
However, China, who would not be content to be also-ran after
significant performances of their short track skaters in the first
three-day competitions, opened the day with a record-breaking
victory from veteran Xue Ruihong, who topped the first round
competition in the women's 500m race with a time of 39.290 seconds,
a time bettering the Asian record.
</P>
<P>
"It was Xue's fastest time after the 1994 Winter Olympics,"
said Hu Chunfang, manager of the Chinese speed skating team. "She
has the gold in her pocket could she skate like today on Wednesday.
"
</P>
<P>
Xue finished fourth in the same event in the Lillihammer
Olympics in 1996 and won a World Cup in the following year.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Yang Chunyuan was second in 40.610 while Japan's
Yumiko Osuga was third in 40.840.
</P>
<P>
Radik Bikchantayev of Kazakhstan dented Japan's dream of
defending its men's 5,000m speed skating title, winning in a time
of 7:16.46, with South Korean Jun Moon taking silver in 7:17.97
and Japanese Kazuki Sawaguchi third, 7:17.29.
</P>
<P>
Bikchantayev, who skated in the last pair of six with Park Jae-
man of South Korea, took the advantage of the missing of Japan's
Shigekazu Nemotoin, who beat him in Harbin in 1996, to the final
victory.
</P>
<P>
Led by Vladimir Smirnov, who took the first gold for Kazakhstan
in the men's 15km cross country classic on Sunday, a Kazakhstan
quartet, included Pavel Ryabinin, Andrey Nevzorov and Igor
Zzubrilin, led the whole way to the finish line of the men's 4x10
km relay in one hour 41 minutes and 12.8 seconds. Japan and South
Korea finished second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
Japan's first gold Tuesday came from women's 3,000m speed
skating when Aki Narita beat her country fellow Yuri Horikawa to
second and Song Li of China, who took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Join Kawaguchi was Japan's hero Tuesday as he outclassed three
South Koreans to win the men's giant slalom gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Kawaguchi, 24, who was silver medalist of the Super-G slalom
Sunday, revenged his loss to beat Hur Seung-woo of South Korea to
capture the title with a combined time of 2:35.40. Hur took the
silver with his teammates Lee Ki-Hyun and Choi Moon-sung following
in turn.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds blew after the first round in the morning when
Kawaguchi led the herb with a time of 1:21.64, giving the Japanese
a chance to vault to a winning time of 1:13.76 in the second round
three hours later.
</P>
<P>
Hur finished first in the second round in 1:13.02 but the time
was not enough to beat the winning gap of the leading Japanese
after the Korean only skated to 1:22.95 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
At the ice hockey rink, Japan celebrated for its women's team
edging over Kazakhstan 2-1, while men's defending champion
Kazakhstan trounced South Korea 12-1 in its first group match
before roaring host fans at Kangnung Indoor Ice Rink.

<P>
He became the first Malaysian to circumnavigate the globe in a
wind-powered yacht "Jalur Gemilang" (shining stripes) named after
the national flag.
</P>

without any stop.
</P>
<P>
This was the third challenge to bring glory to the country made
by Malaysians after the failures of the conquest of Mount Everest
and the North Pole Expedition, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Azhar, who will be 41 on February 11, is attempting to set two

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The public are concerned with
the cleanliness and hygiene conditions in Hong Kong, in particular
the littering problem.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the key findings revealed in the first two of a
series of 10 opinion surveys commissioned by the Steering
Committee on Healthy Living of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The surveys, conducted by the Social Sciences Research Center
of the University of Hong Kong in mid-December and mid-January,
aim to gauge the attitude and behavioral patterns of Hong Kong
people on hygiene practices and standards and the overall
cleanliness of the city.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,600 respondents were asked during the two surveys
to assess the cleanliness of Hong Kong by using a scale of zero to
10. The benchmark findings show a rating of 5.2 on the overall
cleanliness of the local environment.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the survey findings Tuesday, Deputy Secretary for
Health and Welfare Robin Gill said the results confirmed the
rationale for the government to launch the Healthy Living Campaign
which aims to instill healthy life-style concepts in the community
through the promotion of healthy habits, proper hygiene practices
and environmental improvement.
</P>
<P>
"To make Hong Kong a cleaner and more healthy city is the joint
responsibility of the government and the public at large," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that with the active support and participation of the
community, we will together make Hong Kong a cleaner and healthier
home for every one," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bank of East Asia Continues Expansion Despite Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Bank of East Asia
(BEA) Tuesday announced a consolidated profit after a tax of 928
million HK dollars (118.97 million U.S. dollars) for the year
ending December 31, 1998, a decrease of 55.5 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Announcing its final results for the year 1998, the BEA, the
largest independent Chinese bank in Hong Kong, said earnings per
share decreased to 0.68 HK dollars (0.087 U.S. dollars) from 1.56
HK dollars (0.2 U.S. dollars) for the year 1997.
</P>
<P>
Operating profit before provisions fell by 2.7 percent to 2.645
billion HK dollars (339.1 million U.S. dollars), while operating
income declined slightly by 1.1 percent to 4.345 billion HK
dollars (557.05 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The directors of the bank recommended payment of a final
dividend of 0.14 HK dollars (0.018 U.S. dollars) per share which,
together with the interim dividend of 0.18 HK dollars (0.023 U.S.
dollars) per share paid in September 1998, constituted a total
dividend per share of 0.32 HK dollars (0.41 U.S. dollars) for the
year. The combined dividend represented a decrease of 55.9 percent
over the total dividend per share paid for the year 1997.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 1998 was exceptionally difficult for the whole
banking industry in Hong Kong, BEA Chairman and Chief Executive
David Li stressed that the underlying performance of the bank had
been very positive during the year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the weak business environment, Li said, the bank
enjoyed a 3-percent increase in net interest income. This was the
result of careful management of interest rates for both loans and
deposits, Li explained.
</P>
<P>
The bank also controlled its costs very effectively, with
operating expenses rising only 1.4 percent, Li said. Most of all,
the bank achieved a very healthy level of profit before taking
provisions into account, just 2.7 percent below the record level
of 1997, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed the decline in profits to two main causes:
weakening demand for loans and an increase in specific provisions
for bad debts.
</P>
<P>
Despite the temporary difficulties in the economic environment,
BEA continued to develop its business in 1998, in line with its
longer-term strategy, Li continued.
</P>
<P>
It opened seven new retail outlets in Hong Kong, bringing the
group's local network to a total of 105 outlets.
</P>
<P>
In China's mainland, BEA opened a new representative office in
Chongqing and became one of just two overseas banks with
permission to conduct Renminbi business in both Shanghai and
Shenzhen. Expansion also continued overseas, with a fifth branch
opening in Canada.
</P>
<P>
While the bank will continue its expansion, 1999 will be
another difficult year, said Li. "We will continue to exercise
prudence in all aspects of our business and place special emphasis
on such areas as costs, customer service and training."
</P>
<P>
In both Hong Kong and the mainland, he said, the bank would
endeavor to broaden its income sources by offering more high value-
added products and services and by placing greater emphasis on non-
interest income.

<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The lingering financial turmoil
continued to hit the manufacturing sector of the Philippines with
the volume of production down 24.4 percent for November 1998 from
November 1997, the National Statistics Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The value of production for November 1998 dropped by 18.1
percent from its previous year's level, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The value of net sales also dropped by 10.7 percent and its
corresponding volume by 16.1 percent from a year earlier, it said.
</P>
<P>
The drop in production was largely attributed to the declines
in petroleum products, food manufacturing, electrical machinery,

During the same period, gainers in both value and volume of
production were the paper and paper products, rubber products,
textile, and wood and wood products sectors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Are Against Fortune Telling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Scientific boffins in China
have called for a new campaign to crack down on superstitious
activities and persuade the public from going to fortune tellers.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent social survey conducted by the China
Association for Science and Technology (CAST), 35.5 percent of the
people questioned now believe in fortune telling, compared with 28.
7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The experts say the development of a market economy has given
Chinese people many opportunities but has increased their stress
levels because of fierce competition. They say that people's
cultural and scientific awareness must be improved to cater to
their sense of spiritual barrenness.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that the better educated the public, the
less they believe in fortune telling. And it seems that the
majority of the people are against superstitious activities such
as geomancy, palm reading and analyzing the components of a
written Chinese character to forecast one's future.
</P>
<P>
A CAST official, in charge of the survey, said that China
should increase people's scientific awareness, and ban the
publication of books and magazines disseminating superstition.
Those who make money by telling fortunes should be punished
according to the law.

state-owned enterprises in the red get out of difficulty within
three years, he said, and basically introduce a modern enterprise
system among most major state-owned enterprises at the same time.
</P>
<P>
He noted that offering a basic livelihood and reemployment for
laid-off workers is crucial for the reform and development of the
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments at all levels must try their
best to help laid-off workers, farmers in poverty-stricken areas
and other people in need, and make sure the relief funds for laid-
off workers and pensions are allocated in time, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this work must be given top priority, as it is
directly related to the smooth progress of the reform and
construction, as well as social stability and progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also required the local government and Party committee to
properly handle the issues concerning ethnic groups, noting that
the national unity and common development and prosperity of all
ethnic groups are critical to the future and fate of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Primary
Industries Minister Lim Keny Yaik said Tuesday that his country
would continue to seek suitable places abroad to cultivate oil
palm to ensure a steady supply of palm oil in anticipation of
increasing global demand.
</P>
<P>
The global demand for palm oil is predicted to reach 24 million
tons by the year 2005 and further to 44 million tons by the year
2020.
</P>
<P>
Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia has conducted studies
in Latin America and West Africa which are believed to have the
potential and environment for oil palm cultivation, the minister
said here.
</P>
<P>
Local entrepreneurs are encouraged to go abroad, especially in
the countries of these two regions, for long-term palm oil
production, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has embarked on joint ventures in oil palm plantations
with other producing countries to help boost palm oil production
for increasing world consumption.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is one of the leading palm oil producers with its
production amounting to 9.05 million tons in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Hospital Overflows With Corpses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The mortuary at the Army Base
Hospital in Lagos is filled with corpses of Nigerian soldiers of
the West African peace- keeping force of ECOMOG killed in the
war-torn country of Sierra Leone, The Post Express newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources at the hospital as revealing that "the
place is overflowing with dead bodies".
</P>
<P>
Many of the corpses were seen at the hospital lying in
hurriedly-made coffins and they were covered with the national
flag just behind the pathology department inside a room referred
to as the "engine room", according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Wounded soldiers littered the eight-block ECOMOG Ward which can
no longer accommodate fresh intakes and the hospital authorities
have converted the pediatrics department into an extension of the
ECOMOG Ward, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
A wounded soldier told the paper that in Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone, especially within the ECOMOG camp at the Lungi
International Airport, there is a large army of wounded soldiers
waiting to be ferried back to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The soldier who pleaded anonymity added that when he was
brought back on January 22, it was difficult to secure even a
standing space inside the aircraft because of the high casualty
rate of soldiers waiting to be brought back home.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "on January 22 when we returned, 20 corpses
accompanied us while over 30 returned a week earlier."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Secures Loan From Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday secured a
loan of 300 million U.S. dollars from Japan as part of its
requested 5 billion dollars under Japan's Miyazawa initiative of
30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 300 million dollar untied loan was provided by Export
Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM) to Malaysia's Industry Bank.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed signed here
Tuesday a letter of guarantee for the loan on behalf of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The loan initially negotiated in May last year was incorporated
into the Miyazawa initiative, a financial stimulus package aimed
at helping battered Asian economies recover from the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa told a press conference after the signing that during
the informal summit of East Asian leaders in Hanoi in December
last year, Japan pledged 1.5 billion dollars in assistance to
Malaysia, of which 500 million dollars were under JEXIM.
</P>
<P>
He said another 200 million dollars could come in another two
to three months' time while the remaining 1 billion dollars
pledged will be channeled through Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said the loan is not tied to any particular conditions
like goods or services that have to be bought from Japan or
contracts that have to be awarded to Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
The loan would be used by Industry Bank and its subsidiary,
Exim Bank of Malaysia Bhd, to meet their financing requirements in
supporting the industrial sectors and the promotion of exports
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 10-year loan will be denominated in the yen while
the balance will be in U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> American Trade Fair to Be Held in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The American Chamber of
Commerce of Sri Lanka (ACCSL) will hold its fourth American Trade
Fair here from February 8 to 11, according to informed sources
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair will provide a unique platform for increasing
awareness about American products and services while providing an
opportunity for new American firms to enter the Sri Lankan market,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is currently Sri Lanka's biggest trading
partner, accounting for over one-third of all Sri Lankan exports,
and a key source of capital and technological know-how for direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
The sources said more than 60 percent of Sri Lanka's garments
are sent the United States, while other major exports are rubber,
leather products, ceramics, gem and jewelry, toys, sporting
equipment, tea, spices and coffee.
</P>
<P>
About 50 U.S. companies and local businesses with substantial
U.S. investment are now operating in the country and many of them
will participate in the trade fair, the ACCSL sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the fair is also intended to help
identity potential distributors in Sri Lanka and encourage new
American firms to enter the Sri Lankan market.
</P>
<P>
The ACCSL, a growing association of 220 Sri Lankan and U.S.
companies, is associated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
largest business federation in the United States, the sources
said. He added that its main aim is to strengthen and promote
healthy business relations between the two countries for mutual
benefit.

<HEADLINE> IOC Takes Biggest Step to Save Sport from Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee took the biggest step in its 106-year history to save
sport from doping with the opening of the World Conference on
Doping in Sport here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which opened amid the Salt Lake City 2002
Winter Olympics bidding scandal, will deal with four themes:
protection of athletes, prevention of doping, the legal aspects
and financial consideration. The goal of the conference is to
establish and adopt effective measures against doping to be
implemented by all in the world of sport and in collaboration with
government organisations.
</P>
<P>
In his addressing to the opening of the conference, the IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch admitted that the IOC has been
confronted with a serious situation over the past few weeks with
regard to allegations of wrongdoing leveled against some of its
members.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken all the necessary measures and are continuing
our investigations to ensure that Olympic ethics are respected,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake City bidding scandal, the biggest threat to the
Olympic movement in its history, has led to the resignations of
four IOC members with five more suspended.
</P>
<P>
By firing members accused of breaking rules on taking gifts or
cash from Salt Lake City before the city won the right for the
2002 Olympic Winter Games, Samaranch is now trying to re-establish
the credit and confidence of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
The president said at the conference, "The International
Olympic Committee was the first to recognize the threat of doping,
and in 1968 it established a Medical Commission."
</P>
<P>
He promised that the IOC will seek to adopt concrete measures
for combating doping at all levels of sport.
</P>
<P>
"We want to send a clear message to athletes, governing bodies
and organising committees that we are committed to doping all we
can to eradicate doping, which is poisoning the world of sport,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the key aims of the conference is to establish an anti-
doping agency, which would oversee the global fight against drugs
in sport. It would be comprised of representatives from the
Olympic movement, governments, medical and scientific community
and athletes.
</P>
<P>
Chair of the Working group responsible for the formation of the
agency, Canadian lawyer Richard Pound, said "We believe that a
single, international body will make a significant contribution to
combating doping in sports. The agency will also be responsible
for overseeing and enforcing a code of ethics for doping in sport.
"
</P>
<P>
The conference will also seek to agree on a clear definition of
doping, a single Medical Code and list of banned substances, a
code of ethics regarding doping and a program to improve
communication about the dangers of using drugs.
</P>
<P>
The conference is attended by more than 500 delegates,
including IOC officials, head of national Olympic Committees,
heads of international sports federations and athletes.

<P>
Healthy companies and corporate groups, in particular, will be
encouraged to go abroad and compete for a share of the business on
the international market.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also step up efforts to explore the potential
for such projects in Africa and Latin America, and to further
cultivate the dwindling markets in east and southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
It will make every effort to encourage business in the Middle
East and tap the market in European Union nations and other
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The new move is aimed at changing China's dependence on the
Asian market in the project contracting and labor services sectors.
More than 60 percent of China's business within those fields are
currently in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, MOFTEC has urged the companies involved to improve
their technological standards and quality control in any
contracted projects, and improve their services to win more market
share.

<TEXT>
<P>
The ministry said it will enhance the management and
supervision of relevant companies and projects, and establish a
quality control and guarantee system for contracted projects.
</P>
<P>
Initiated in the late 1970s, China's project contracting and
labor service sector has been growing quite rapidly over the past
20 years.
</P>
<P>
China signed 11.773 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas
contracts last year involved in engineering, labor services,
design and consultancy, a 3.7 percent increase over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The turnover soared 20.9 percent in 1998 to a record 10.13
billion US dollars, bringing the cumulative total to 58.37 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By November 1998, Chinese companies had signed overseas deals
in these fields worth 81.72 billion US dollar, with the turnover
reaching 56.66 billion US dollars, and a total of 1.75 million
workers sent abroad.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, commented that the activities MOFTEC was focusing on
had huge market potential but as yet China has only secured a tiny
share of it.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, global construction investment totaled 3,200
billion US dollars, but China's involvement only accounted for one
to two percent of the world's contracting market and one percent
of labor flow, so there is still enormous room to expand," he said.

This will be Hun Sen's first visit to China after he assumed

Chinese leaders would exchange ideas on Sino-Cambodian relations
as well as other issues of common concern with Hun Sen during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also urged the Macedonian authorities to
correct the serious mistake of establishing so-called "diplomatic

soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question if China and the Democratic People's

visits between the two countries' leaders "will continue". But she
said there is no further information concerning Kim's China visit.

<P>
Asked to comment on a U.S. report that the Clinton
Administration ordered a formal assessment of a U.S. Congress
panel decision that China stole U.S. military technology through
bilateral economic exchanges, Zhang said that the panel decision
is "totally groundless and irresponsible".

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Sailor Sets Sail for World Voyage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's sailor Azhar
Mansor Tuesday set sail in a non-stop solo voyage around the
world.
</P>
<P>
He became the first Malaysian to circumnavigate the globe in a
wind-powered yacht "Jalur Gemilang" (shining stripes) named after
the national flag.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad flagged off the
historic record attempt by Azhar Mansor at Awana Porto Malai in
Pulau Langkawi resort island, northern Malaysia, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said on the occasion that Azhar's effort would be
tough as he has to sail around the world in less than 105 days
without any stop.
</P>
<P>
This is the third challenge made by Malaysians, after the
conquest of Mount Everest and the North Pole Expedition, to bring
glory to the country, Mahathir noted.
</P>
<P>
Azhar, who will be 41 on February 11, is attempting to set two
world records -- the first non-stop solo circumnavigation of the
world on a new west-east route verified by the World Sailing Speed
Record Council United Kingdom and the fastest non-stop solo world
circumnavigation for 15m/18m yacht.
</P>
<P>
With 20 years' experience in the sea, Azhar has received a
letter of authorization from the World Sailing Speed Record
Council for the trip.
</P>
<P>
Azhar had prepared for two and half years for this trip
including charting his route.
</P>
<P>
He is known as the first yachtsman to begin the challenge of
going around the world from the Indian Ocean compared with others
who started off from the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
He has taken along with him two tons of canned food for the
100- to 130-day voyage.
</P>
<P>
The sailor plans to return to Langkawi sometime in May this
year.

<HEADLINE> Inflation to Go Up in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's inflation is likely to
shoot up further in the early part of this year from the 30.6
percent recorded last December, Standard Chartered Bank has said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Zambian Financial Mail quoted the Business Trends, a
publication by Standard Chartered Bank, as saying the continued
depreciation of the Zambian currency and increase in food prices
is likely to further push up the inflation.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year inflation recorded at 30.6 percent rose from
27.6 percent the previous month. Business Trends attributed the
increase to weak capital inflows the country experienced last year
and the balance of payment difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to see what government can do now to slow
inflation, since the real money is already falling, thereby adding
to the already inflationary pressures at work in the economy,"
said Business Trends.
</P>
<P>
According to the publication, the government is reluctant to
see interest rates driven much higher, knowing that such
development would further intensify the cash flow and liquidity
problems of many firms.
</P>
<P>
The longer the trend will continue, the stronger would be the
upward pressure on interest rates, the publication said.

The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bank Ready to Intervene in Money Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (BI), the
country's central bank, said here Tuesday that it is ready to
intervene in an effort to calm down the money market.
</P>
<P>
"BI is ready to intervene in the market, for how much it
takes," BI governor Sjahril Sabirin said.
</P>
<P>
Since October last year, BI has been continuing its
intervention in the money market by injecting 5 million to 10
million U.S. dollars every day. The value of the rupiah, the local
currency, against the U.S. dollar had been kept at 7,000 to 8,000
rupiah per dollar between October to December last year.
</P>
<P>
However, it dropped to 9,000 rupiah per dollar in mid-January
because of the outbreak of monetary crisis in Brazil and the
unstable political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last month, Sabirin said, the government would
make efforts to keep the exchange rate of the rupiah below 7,000
per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed slightly firmer at 8,900 against the
greenback in very thin trading on Monday as share prices fell
nearly 1 percent due to a lack of fresh leads in the local market.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the monetary crisis in Southeast Asian
countries in July 1997, the value of the rupiah has lost more than
60 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin said that if the rupiah strengthens, intervention will
only be limited to between 1 million and 5 million dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
He said the key factor in the recovery of the rupiah is the
final discussion on three draft political laws and clearer
information on banking recapitalization.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's House of Representatives on January 28 passed three
political bills concerning the June general election, which were
described as progress in political reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the prolonged economic crisis, the government has
decided to finalize the recapitalization of more than 70 troubled
banks in the country by June this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone to Strengthen Military Ties with Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A high-powered Sierra Leonean
military delegation is due in Nigeria Tuesday in a bid to
strengthen military cooperation between the two countries, media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member delegation led by Sierra leonean Chief of Defence
Brig-Gen. Maxwell Khobe is expected to consolidate renewed talks
on military cooperation initiated last week by a Nigerian
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian delegation signed with Sierra Leone a
comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding which emphasized the
need to train the armed forces of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of Defence Information Lieutenant Col. Sam
Tella said Monday in Lagos that the delegation would visit various
military training institutions including Command and Staff
College, Nigeria Defence Academy and Nigerian Army Depot.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be divided into three groups to visit the
army, navy and air force respectively during its seven-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Under the Status of Forces Agreement signed in 1997 between the
two countries, Nigeria was given powers to train the Army of
Sierra Leone, and develop its Navy and Air force.
</P>
<P>
Brig-Gen. Khobe, until his appointment as Sierra Leone's Chief
of Defence Staff, was the Commander of the West African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG in Sierra Leone, which
recaptured Freetown from Major Johnny Koroma-led government.
</P>
<P>
The reinstated Tejan Kabbah government faced fresh crisis last
month when rebels loyal to the Revolutionary United Front launched
attacks on capital Freetown.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Call Rates Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korean call rates Tuesday
fell to the 5-percent range Tuesday, the record low in the country,
showing the government's determination to hold down overnight
rates among financial institutions, said the Bank of Korea (BOK).
</P>
<P>
Call rate stood at 5.98 percent at five p.m. Tuesday and the
yields on three-year state bonds were also down 0.09 percentage
points from Monday's 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three-year corporate bonds posted yields of 8.12
percent, down 0.01 percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Observers attributed the fall of call rates to the government's
move to cut rates.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the central bank said its monetary policy for 1999 will
focus on lowering market interest rates further in a bid to boost
the economy and stabilize the won-dollar exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to cut our repurchase rate further to help bring the
overnight call rate down," BOK Governor Chon Chol-hwan said at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Call rates, which banks charge to each other for overnight
lending, hovered around 13.1 percent in October 1997, surged to 31.
3 percent in December 1997, when the worst financial crisis in 50
years hit the nation. And then it gradually declined to 6.00
percent as of last Saturday after the government took measures to
recover the economy.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Soldiers to Return to Barracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian soldiers are all to be
moved into the barracks within one month to prepare ground for the
impending civilian governance, Commander of the Nigerian Army
Corps of Artillery Maj-Gen. Abdul-One Mohammed was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said on Monday in Ogun State that the plan of the Head of
State General Abdulsalam Abubakar to cede power to civilians in
May had necessitated a schedule of activities in the military
including the movement of soldiers to barracks this month, The
Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that General Abubakar would keep faith with his pledge
to hand over power on May 29 this year and the army was inclined
to stick to its constitutionally assigned role by being
continuously loyal to Nigeria and its people.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper New Nigerian reported Tuesday that army
headquarters in Lagos had directed soldiers serving in the Lagos
State anti-crime outfit " Operation Sweep" be reduced by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
A circular to that effect had been issued to the headquarters
of the team and gradual withdrawal of military men from the team
would commence this month.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement is in line with presidential directive that
military participation in various organs assisting the police to
maintain law and order be phased out to prepare for overall
withdrawal of military persons from civil organs.
</P>
<P>
The military coordinator of "Operation Sweep", Lt. Col. Kenneth
Minimah, confirmed receiving such directive to reduce army
strength by 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Parties Stress Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite a strong need for U.S.
dollar reserves amid the current economic woes, Indonesia's next
government should adopt an environment-friendly development policy
as its platform, spokesmen of several political parties said.
</P>
<P>
The common views on the significance of putting environmental
protection in the country's development policy were raised by
spokesmen of the ruling Golkar (Functional Group), the United
Development Party (PPP), the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI),
the National Awakening Party (PKB) and the Moon and Star Party
(PBB) in a dialogue on the environment.
</P>
<P>
In the dialogue, sponsored by Antara News Agency here Tuesday,
the upcoming government has been also urged to continuously
strengthening law enforcement in settling environmental cases.
</P>
<P>
PPP Vice Secretary Bachtiar Chamsyah underscored the weakness
of the legislative body in supervising the government in exploring
natural resources because of the domination of a single majority
political party during 32 years of former President Soeharto's
rule.
</P>
<P>
Under the former government, law enforcement personnel in the
country seemed not to have the courage to bring those who damaged
the environment to court, he said.
</P>
<P>
A similar view was also aired by Marcus Wauran from the PDI,
who said law enforcement in environmental cases should become the
main policy of the next government in a bid to help the country
avoid making the same mistakes as the Soeharto regime.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abu Hasan Sadzili, a legislator from the ruling
Golkar, said it is high time for the mushrooming political parties
to synchronize the industrial policy to the needs of protecting
the environment.
</P>
<P>
He said the environment is an international issue which the
Indonesian people can not neglect nor separate from political and
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
PBB Vice Secretary Hamzah underlined the urgency of setting up
a special investigation team in the environmental ministry whose
main job is probing each problem dealing with nature and
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will hold general election on June 7 this year.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Trio Ready for Historic Desert Trek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Three veteran Canadian
adventurers will soon launch their much-awaited attempt to cross
the Empty Quarter of Arabia, the world's largest sand desert, the
Dhabi-based Khaleej Times reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trio, to kick off their grueling expedition from Oman, will
pass through Saudi Arabia and end their two-month-long journey in
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
With the help of three native Bedouins and 12 camels, the Jamie
and Leigh Clarke brothers together with Bruce Kirkby plan to set
out from Salalah, Oman, this week in a bid to become the first
Westerners in more than 50 years to make a foot crossing of the
Empty Quarter, or the Rub Al Khali.
</P>
<P>
They will try to retrace the route taken by British explorer
Wilfred Thesiger, the last Westerner to complete the crossing in
1947.
</P>
<P>
Wilfred was the first and the only person to have navigated the
treacherous eastern section of the Empty Quarter, which is
largely in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
During the journey, the trio is expected to face numerous
challenges, notably the Uruq Al Shaiba, a mountainous range of
towering dunes hundreds of miles long.
</P>
<P>
They will also have to skirt the famous quicksand of Umm Al
Samim, or Mother of Poison.
</P>
<P>
Jamie, 30, a former cross-country ski champion of Canada,
successfully scaled the summit of the Mt Everest in 1997. His
brother Leigh, a lawyer and adventurer, and Bruce Kirkby, an
engineer-turned wilderness guide, will produce a film on the
expedition stretching over 1,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The 300,000-square-kilometer Empty Quarter has more sand, both
in surface and volume, than any others on earth.
</P>
<P>
The world's best known desert, the Sahara, constitutes just 10
percent sand with the remainder being made up of rocks, scrub and
mountainous terrain, the paper said.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Six Indonesian cabinet
ministers arrived in Ambon, capital of Maluku Province, at noon
Tuesday, shortly after fresh rioting broke out in the riot-torn
city, according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The ministers were ordered by President B.J. Habibie to visit
Ambon to assess the damage from the violence involving both
Muslims and Christians, natives and migrants.
</P>
<P>
The violence which erupted on January 19 claimed 61 lives and
left at least 758 houses, 12 mosques, 13 churches and hundreds of
shops and kiosks burned or damaged.
</P>
<P>
The ministers include Coordinating Minister for People's
Welfare and Poverty Eradication Haryono Suyono, Forestry Minister
Muslimin Nasution, Public Works Minister Rachmadi Bambang
Sumadhijo, Health Minister Farid Anfasa Moeloek, Religious Affairs

Baharsyah.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the ministers have met with Maluku
Governor Saleh Latuconsina and chief of the regional military
command Maj. Gen. Amir Sembiring.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fresh rioting flared up in the city Tuesday noon,
leaving one injured and one motorcycle burned.
</P>
<P>
There was no report on the cause of the clash, which has thrown
the people into panic, prompting them to seek refuge in military
camps.
</P>
<P>
Those who had gone to work had to stop their activities while
those on the road had to find shelters and school children were
brought to local police stations.
</P>
<P>
Military personnel posted to guard the city were able to stop
armed citizens on the street as two helicopters hovered over the
city, Antara News Agency reported.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Both the leftwing and rightwing parties of France have
criticized the refusal by the French Senate to approve the law on
guaranteeing equal access to political posts by men and women. The
call for the holding of a referendum on the issue, which must be
agreed upon by President Jacques Chirac, is on the rise, as a
referendum can approve the law without the Senate.
</P>
<P>
-- The political scenery of Israel is atomized as nine new
political parties have come up to compete in May for the seats in
the parliament, where 11 parties already exist. Since 1996,
Israelis vote to elect members of parliament and prime minister at
the same time. It is enough to be elected to parliament with only
1.5 percent of the suffrages.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The merger of two great banks, to be made through the
launching of buying of shares of Paribas bank by the Societe
Generale at a record cost of 15.1 billion euros (17 billion U.S.
dollars) in France, will produce the world's fourth largest
banking group after Bank America and CitiGroup of the United
States, and Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corp of Britain.
</P>
<P>
-- Between 1976 and 1983, the leaders of four military juntas
of Argentina systematically kidnapped the children of political
prisoners. For the past 15 years, the grand-mothers of these
children have been looking for their traces with obstinacy. An
association of these grand-mothers said nearly 400 children had
been kidnapped.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's King Sihanouk Considers Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk is considering his successor, opposition party leader Sam
Rainsy disclosed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rainsy, president of his self-named party, told reporters at a
press conference held at his party headquarters that he had an
audience with the King on Monday at the royal palace for nearly
three hours.
</P>
<P>
He said he and the king had discussed many topics including a
successor to the throne.
</P>
<P>
The king revealed that his successor may be his son Prince
Norodom Sihamoni or his wife Queen Norodom Monieath, Sihamoni's
mother, according to Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
But he said there are also some other possible candidates
including Prince Norodom Ranariddh, another of his sons and
president of the National Assembly, and Prince Norodom Sirivudh,
the king's half-brother who has just returned home from three
years of exile abroad.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitutions, the king's successor would be chosen
by a royal council and from among the king's sons or members of
the main branches of Cambodia's royal family. Although Prince
Ranariddh is the king's eldest son, he would not automatically
take the throne.
</P>
<P>
So if Queen Monieath is to be the king, the constitution would
be amended.

<HEADLINE> Pak Calls Good Talks With U.S. on Non-Proliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United
States Tuesday concluded their eighth round of official talks on
the issues of nuclear non-proliferation and security with positive
comments from both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a detailed session and we have had good
discussion, characteristic of the tradition of frankness and
cordiality that we have established over the past seven rounds of
talks," Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed told the media
after his talks with visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said Pakistan and the United States have held eight
rounds of talks on the concerned issues in the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
"That itself indicates the seriousness and intensity of our
engagement and this engagement, I am sure, has been for a purpose,
and that purpose has been bringing our position and our respective
concerns and objectives closer," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During these eight rounds of talks, we have significantly
achieved our objectives," Shamshad said. However, the foreign
secretary did not go into the details about what the two sides had
decided, only saying a joint statement will be issued after
Talbott's meetings with Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz and
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether the United State had got any
commitment from Pakistan on signing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) and deweaponization, Talbott said Prime Minister
Sharif made a commitment on the CTBT at the United Nations in
September last year. "It has always been on the agenda," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We covered full gamut of our issues in the
relationship. The U.S. and Pakistan have many, many interests
across of wide scope that we want to develop and we have touched
on a number of those here, too."

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the
Canadian province of Ontario has called for more investments from
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the province, a newspaper report
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Linking the Canadian and U.S. markets, Ontario has emerged as
the economic powerhouse of Canada, the English daily Khaleej Times
quoted Alberta Al Palladini, Minister for Economic Development,
Trade and Tourism of Ontario, as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception hosted by the Canadian Business
Council in Abu Dhabi, Palladini said Ontario is poised to grow
more rapidly than the G-7 economies over the 1998-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the sophisticated business services which
anchored a diversified economy in the province where foreign
investments over the last decade stood at about 93 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Canadian official had talks with his UAE
counterparts from the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(ADCCI).
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed the will to strengthen economic and trade
cooperation, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Omar Abdullah, Director-General of the ADCCI expressed
a keen desire to step up two-way trade between Abu Dhabi and
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a broader agenda in our business meetings in
the future," he said at the reception.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Macedonia to Revoke Communique with Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the
Macedonian authorities to correct as soon as possible the serious
mistake of establishing so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan
and to revoke the relevant communique.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue made the
remark in reply to a question at a regular press conference here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese side has made solemn representations
to the Macedonian government and made clear China's principled
stance on the issue of Taiwan over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
China noticed that the Macedonian president has firmly opposed
the establishment of "diplomatic ties" between Macedonia and
Taiwan and criticized its foreign minister for his decision of
signing the communique with Taiwan, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Macedonian authorities will abandon the
illusion of "dual recognition" and bring the Sino-Macedonian
bilateral relationship back to the normal track, she concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
cautioned Burundi not to overstretch the good will of the regional
leaders and international community who agreed to suspend economic
sanctions on the country in January.
</P>
<P>
The warning was contained in a press release issued by the
Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Burundi peace negotiations have been dragging on for long
largely due to diversionary obscurantist propaganda introduced by
those bent on either delaying or defeating the process," it said.
</P>
<P>
All the parties in the country "should not overstretch the
patience of those who have been kind enough to fund and support
the negotiation process, " the press release added.
</P>
<P>
It said that Uganda believes that the Arusha peace initiative
remains the most viable and peaceful avenue of bringing peace to
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed by countries in the region in July 1996,
were suspended at the seventh regional summit on the conflict in
Burundi in Arusha on January 23, mediated by ex-Tanzanian leader
Julius Nyerere.

<HEADLINE> "Five Principles" Are Common Ground, Says Lithuanian Politician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Lithuanian Parliament
Chairman Vytautas Landsbergis said today that he considered he had
found common ground for developing ties with faraway China: the
Five Principles for Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that his Baltic nation adopted a foreign policy
"similar with the 'five principles'."
</P>
<P>
It was Landsbergis' first China visit following his election as
chairman of the parliament. During his Beijing stay, he met with
Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, Vice Premier Qian Qichen and Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan. "I told the Chinese leaders of our willingness to develop
bilateral cooperation in all fields and the response was very
positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although geographically far apart from each other, he insisted
that distance was not a barrier for the two countries to enhance
cooperation partially thanks to modern transport and telecom
convenience. "And there is hardly any point mentioning that we
have no political barriers or disagreements," he added.
</P>
<P>
This musician turned politician was also ambitious to play, as
he said, high notes in state-to-state politics. "The bilateral
exchanges should not be confined to reciprocal visits. I hope
future cooperation can bear more tangible results after my visit,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He was delighted that "a certain consensus" had been achieved.
"I and the Chinese leaders all considered that our two countries
have potential to tap in transportation, investment, tourism and
cultural areas of exchange. I will take back these messages in a
bid to encourage our government to speed up their pace of activity
and interaction with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
On inter-parliamentary exchanges, he said the contacts could be
expanded to the level of special committees inside the law-making
bodies besides the mutual visits paid by official parliamentary
delegations.
</P>
<P>
The former pianist was deeply impressed by the extent of China'
s cultural heritage after visiting such gems as the Forbidden City.
"I also saw the gigantic construction site in the downtown areas,
obviously an indicator of a healthy and developing economy," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tea Production Hits All-Time Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya tea output in 1998 hit a
record high of 294.17 million kg, an increase of 33.27 percent
over the previous year, according to statistics released Tuesday
by the Tea Board of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The board, which regulates the operations of the tea industry
in Kenya, attributed the output increase to the plenty of water
brought by heavy rains last year and efforts by farmers to apply
required inputs as well as enhanced processing factory capacity.
</P>
<P>
A report by the African Tea Broker (ATB) based in Mombasa shows
 increased tea output in major tea producing countries in 1998.
India registered 629.17 million kg of tea, with Kenya ranking the
second followed by Sri Lanka, 280 million kg.

According to official data, Kenya tea output was 220.72 million
kg in 1997 when the crop was badly hit by drought, 257 million kg
in 1996 and 209 million kg in1995.
</P>
<P>
But the ATB and other industry sources said forecast of a
drought in the first half of 1999 meant that the performance in
1998 could not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Tea growing areas in Kenya have reported limited rains since
early last December. Kenya's Meteorological Department said
drought has something to do with the La Nina weather phenomenon,
which often follows the El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Tea is Kenya's leading foreign exchange earner ahead of
tourism, coffee and horticulture. Kenya is the world's leading
exporter of black tea.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Travel Agency Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Five foreign travel agencies
have formally filed applications for setting up joint venture
travel agencies in China, following the government's go ahead for
an increase in such activities in a bid to open up the sector.
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of overseas travel agencies have expressed
their interest in such ventures after the "Interim Rules Governing
the Establishment of Sino-Overseas Travel Agencies" were
introduced on a trial basis last December, Wei Xiao'an, a
spokesman for China National Tourism Administration (CNTA), said
here today.
</P>
<P>
It represents a further step in China's opening up policy after
overseas travel agencies were first allowed to set up joint
ventures on a trial basis in the country's 12 national holiday
resorts in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, although many foreign travel agencies had
expressed their wish to enter into the China market, they were
quite cautious because of the lack of regulations governing such
activities," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
To date, according to him, only one Sino-Swiss travel agency
been given permission to set up a joint venture in the Dianchi
Lake Holiday Resort in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Wei declared that the new policy will be conducive to
accelerating the internationalization of China's tourism industry,
to using the international sales network to help expand China's
inward bound tourism figures, and to improving the quality of
China's own travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Wei acknowledged that it may aggravate competition in the
country's travel sector, warning that perhaps the expansion should
be introduced in a gradual manner.
</P>
<P>
"The current proposals are to allow only one such joint venture
travel agency for each of the provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the interim rules do not allow the joint venture
travel agencies to be engaged in the outbound market, Wei said
that at present only 67 Chinese travel agencies have approval to
handle outbound tours, plus 300-odd businesses serving as tour
agents.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, for those domestic agencies without such permission,
it seems unfair to give such rights to joint ventures. Besides,
there are also some technical considerations." added Wei, who is
also director of CNTA's Policy and Law Department.
</P>
<P>
Wei added that in an effort to improve the quality of travel
agencies, the government's watchdogs revoked the business licenses
of over 1,500 unqualified travel agencies in 1995. And the
following three years saw a similar ruling applied to an average
of over 400 travel agencies annually.

<HEADLINE> Quality and Market Diversification Key to China's Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to raise the
quality of export commodities and develop a diversified foreign
trade market this year, according to Shi Guangsheng, the minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
China is to export more high-tech, high value-added and further
processed industrial finished goods this year, Shi said a recent
national conference on foreign trade and economic cooperation, the
International Business Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Exports of machinery and electronic products, especially
complete sets of equipment and high-tech products, are extremely
important, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, primary industrial finished goods make up the bulk
of China's exports.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Shi also stressed that the export of
namebrand commodities should be encouraged as well as expanding
the variety of goods available.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he reiterated that China should develop a
diversified market for foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Markets in Africa, Latin-America, East Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) have great potential, he
said and urged entrepreneurs to find appropriate ways of
exploiting the trade in those regions by developing efficient
marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the traditional markets that China has
developed in the United States, Japan and Europe to be
strengthened, saying that efforts to expand them should be
intensified.
</P>
<P>
A focus on quality and a strategy to diversify the markets
should be given some importance when considering overseas
investment for China, including agreeing contracts for foreign
projects and services, he added.

<P>
DHAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Dhaka International
Trade Fair '99, the largest one of all kinds in the country, began
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the month-long fair,
which has been organized by the Ministry of Commerce and the
Export Promotion Bureau, aiming to give a boost to the country's
exports.
</P>
<P>
The fair is being held on an area of 1.5 million square feet
and a total of 302 local companies and 86 companies from 27
countries and regions are participating in the fair with an array
of world-class products.
</P>
<P>
The firms and organizations have put on sale their commodities
in 93 pavilions.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the fair is put on-line, so people in
other parts of the world can watch it on the computer screen
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The export sector of this South Asian country has developed
rapidly since the country's independence in 1971 due to relentless
efforts made by the government.
</P>
<P>
From a paltry earning of 448 million U.S. dollars in 1972-73,
the country achieved an export earning of 5.161 billion dollars in
1997-98, according to the official figures.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Bangladesh is now trying hard to diversify its export
base and expand its international market with a view to earning
more from export.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets Rules on Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 2 (Xinhua) -- No miller or individual in
Kenya will be allowed to market coffee on behalf of farmers,
except the Coffee Board of Kenya, Agriculture Minister Musalia
Mudavadi said in a Kenya Gazette Supplement, the East African
Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has finally gazetted tough rules
governing the operations of the coffee industry in line with
recommendations made by a task force appointed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the gazette supplement dated January 29, Mudavadi said that
no person is allowed to market coffee unless licensed by CBK under
the Coffee Act.
</P>
<P>
The rules also re-affirm the established tradition in the
country where coffee is sold from a central auction. Sale of
coffee by private treaty, as demanded by some stakeholders, has
been rejected.
</P>
<P>
The new rules also say that the government will confiscate
coffee sold directly to millers without going through an
authorized agent.
</P>
<P>
Licenses of such a farmer should be revoked or suspended and
notice to the effect publicized, the minister said.

<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today that China welcomes the
recent decision by the UN Security Council to establish three
evaluation groups concerning the Iraqi issue, describing it a
progress in breaking through the stalemate.
</P>

The Council has agreed upon the formation of three separate
groups to evaluate the disarmament of Iraq, the living condition
of its people, and the repatriation of Kuwaiti prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
With the decision, the spokesman pointed out at a routine news
conference this afternoon that the following key issue is to
guarantee the three groups would conduct an objective and just
evaluation over the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, she stressed, the UN Security Council should tighten
its political guidance over the evaluation groups.

China hopes that the UN secretary-general would play an active
role in the evaluation work, and calls on all parties concerned to
show their sincerity so as to push forward the comprehensive
implementation of relevant UN resolutions with a just and
cooperative attitude, she added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace in Mindanao Still Far Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Guns are now silent in Mindanao
and both President Joseph Estrada and Muslim rebel leader Hashim
Salamat have expressed their willingness to achieve peace in the
area, however a lasting peace in the southern Philippines remains
elusive.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, heavy fighting between government troops
and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels has left more than
 30 people dead, dozens of others wounded and thousands of
civilians homeless.
</P>
<P>
However, neither side has admitted violation of a cease-fire
reached by the rebel group and the Ramos administration in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the two warring parties signed a new cease-fire
and agreed to start formal peace negotiations on February 8. A
cease-fire, although shaky, is holding in Mindanao, despite some
isolated incidents of gunfights, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
Although the government declared that war is over in Mindanao
and the situation there is under control, observers believe new
fighting could easily erupt again before obstacles are removed to
a lasting peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The biggest obstacle to striking an accord on peace in Mindanao
is the demand of the rebel group for an independent Islamic state
there, which the government described as non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, the 12,000-strong MILF, a break-away
group of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), has been
fighting for an Islamic republic in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
When the Ramos administration and the MNLF signed a peace
accord to end a 30-year-old civil war in Mindanao in September
1996, the MILF rejected the document and vowed to achieve its
objective by force.
</P>
<P>
So far, the MILF has not changed its separatist aims -- the
founding of a new, independent Islamic republic and recognition of
its sovereignty over 46 places in Mindanao, where it maintains its
own military camps.
</P>
<P>
But such a demand will not be accepted by the government.
President Estrada said Monday that he would like to meet MILF
Chairman Hashim Salamat to discuss peace in Mindanao, but the
territorial integrity must be excluded from their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, so long as the rebel group sticks to its demand for
an independent state in Mindanao, peace talks cannot produce any
concrete results, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle to peace in the south lies in the difference
between the two sides in identifying the main problem in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government has considered poverty as the root cause of
insurgency in Mindanao and promised more investments in the region
in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, MILF leader Salamat said: "Our concern is to be
free from oppression. We desire full opportunity to truly build
our culture, our own religion, our own way of life."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that studying the problem from a Muslim's point of
view might help the government find peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But as the government regards the MILF's concern as
secessionist, no compromise could be made.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the MILF has accused the United States of instigating
the conflict in Mindanao, saying Washington had orchestrated the
recent fighting there to justify the approval of a proposed
Visiting Force Agreement (VFT) between the U.S. and Philippine
governments.
</P>
<P>
When fighting broke out last week, the Philippine Senate was
deliberating on the VFT which would enable the two countries to
resume large-scale joint military exercises.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has a vested interest in the Philippines,
particularly in Mindanao," a senior MILF official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the MILF cannot produce any evidence to back up the
allegation, the accusation reflected the complicatedness of the
Mindanao problem.
</P>
<P>
As their differences over the Mindanao issue cannot be easily
overcome, both the government and the MILF have to make greater
efforts to push the peace process forward, observers said.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people have died of
cholera in Zambia since the disease broke out last month.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka City Council spokesman Daniel M'soka has confirmed

In Ndola, capital of Copperbelt Province in north Zambia, the
death toll has reached eight and 18 new patients were admitted to
the hospital between Sunday night and Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Cholera is a 100 percent killer disease which can be compared
to an atomic bomb and therefore there is need for everybody to
take precautionary measures," M'soka said.
</P>
<P>
He has appealed to people with relatives who have died of
cholera to bury their dead as quickly as possible to prevent the
disease spreading.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Meet MPs on Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to take place at his home in Mbarara
District in southwestern Uganda, the New Vision paper said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kagole Kivumbi, the public relations officer in the
Parliament, told Xinhua in a telephone interview Tuesday morning
that two committee chairmen had received invitations to meet the
president, but refused to confirm whether the talk is on or not.
</P>
<P>
The president passed the information to the clerk of the
Parliament who will notify the particular MPs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Musumba who chairs the committee on national economy and
Benedict Mutyaba who heads that of natural resources are expected
to brief the president on their committees' position on the
proposed dam at the tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Nile Independent Power (NIP), a joint venture between AES of
Arlington Virginia and Madhvani International SA, plans to
construct a 250-MW hydro- electric generating plant on River Nile
about 10 km from the Owen Falls dams.
</P>
<P>
However, some MPs are contesting certain provisions in the
agreement, threatening to block the approval of the power purchase
agreement under which Uganda Electricity Board (UEB) must buy NIP
power.
</P>
<P>
The legislators want a comprehensive law in place before the
construction work begins.
</P>
<P>
They argue that the project will rip the country of colossal
amount of money. UEB must bear the responsibility to make monthly
payments whether or not it is able to re-sell all the electricity
generated by the project.
</P>
<P>
It also takes the risk of the water level decrease in Lake
Victoria, which will make the tariffs shoot up.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and traditionalists are also against
construction of dams, saying that the dams would destroy the
famous Bujagali Falls and the cultural sites there.

mines scattered around its former demilitarized zone Quang Tri
Province, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Danish-funded project in the central war-torn province will

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will re-open its
embassy in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the next
fiscal year, Deputy Foreign Minister Emmanuel Mwambulukutu has
said.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of Tanzania's strategies to boost economic
co-operation with other African countries, Mwambulukutu was quoted
by media reports Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament in the central city of Dodoma Monday,
 Mwambulukutu said Tanzania's embassy in former Zaire was degraded
to a consulate several years ago as a cost cutting measure.
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, the country has lowered it embassy in Rome
to a consulate, and closed its embassies in Angola, Burundi, the
Netherlands and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister, however, said in order to increase
trade and economic co-operation with the neighboring DRC, Tanzania
is prepared to have an embassy in Kinshasa in the next fiscal year
starting July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mwambuluku further said Tanzania will reinforce its embassies
in all African countries by sending experts as envoys to the
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said a foreign policy is being prepared under which envoys
would be required to concentrate on economic diplomacy.

BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- China's Red Cross Society (CRCS)
plans to send food worth one million yuan ( 120,000 U.S. dollars)
to residents in disaster-hit areas to mark the Spring Festival
celebrations, the country's biggest national holiday.

<P>
Five CRCS working teams have been sent to the areas to ensure
the food reaches every needy household, he said.

<P>
HARARE, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Bureaucratic bungling within the
Ministry of Local Government and National Housing has delayed the
processing of grain loan applications, leaving at least 100,000
families in Darwin District on the brink of starvation, the daily
Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 hunger-stricken families applied for maize
under the grain loan scheme last August, but misunderstandings
between the district and provincial offices of the ministry have
seen the application forms being shuffled between the two offices.
</P>
<P>
Last week the disgruntled villagers told Border Gezi, Governor
of Mashonaland Central, that they were now surviving on wild
fruits, tubers and roots. Some villagers are surviving on relish
and tree leaves.
</P>
<P>
"I know there are misunderstandings between the personalities
in the two offices and that problem has resulted in my people
suffering. I am taking up the processing of the applications
personally and I promise that maize will have been delivered to
starving villagers soon," Gezi said.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Malaysia's Manufacturing Sector Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Proposed total capital
investments in Malaysia's manufacturing sector in 1998 fell by
44.5 percent compared to 1997, according to an official report
released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed total capital investments fell to 18.9761 billion
ringgit (about 4.993 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 from 34.177
billion ringgit (about 8.993 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997,
according to the report on the performance of the manufacturing
sector in 1998 released by International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
In terms of number, applications for manufacturing projects
received in 1998 totaled 729 compared to 849 in 1997, registering
a decrease of 14.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafidah said foreign investments as a whole remained
encouraging in the year under review as applications with foreign
participation registered an increase to 507 from 494 in 1997,
constituting 69.5 percent of the total number of applications and
foreign investments totaled 12.6512 billion ringgit (about 3.329
billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 66.7 percent of the total
proposed capital investments.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign investments were only 12 percent lower than
1997. The significant drop in total proposed capital investments
were mainly attributed to the substantial decline in domestic
investments which fell sharply by 68 percent to 6.3249 billion
ringgit (about 1.664 billion U.S. dollars) from 19.7941 billion
ringgit (about 5.208 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 given the
adverse effects of the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The top five sources of foreign investments for 1998 were the
United States, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore and United Kingdom,
together accounting for about 80 percent of total foreign
investments.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of 844 projects were granted approval compared
to 759 in 1997, reflecting an increase of 11.2 percent, with
approved investments increasing by 2.3 percent to 26.5056 billion
ringgit (about 6.975 billion U.S. dollars) from 25.82 billion
ringgit (about 6.794 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, she said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in approved projects increased by 14
percent to 13.0828 billion ringgit (about 3.442 billion U.S.
dollars) while domestic investments fell by 7.1 percent to 13.3228
billion ringgit (about 3.506 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Rafidah Aziz said despite the difficult economic conditions,
the Malaysian manufacturing sector had shown continued resilience
and a creditable, though lower performance in terms of overall
investments and output growth.
</P>
<P>
But the minister did not reveal the output growth figures for
the sector for the whole year of 1998, only saying output in the
sector declined marginally by 1.4 percent in the third quarter of
1998 compared to the sharper contraction of 13.2 percent in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government, which recently liberalized
the equity policy for the manufacturing sector, will continue to
undertake various measures to bolster investor confidence and
carry out aggressive investment promotion efforts to key target
countries and regions such the United States, Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the manufacturing sector, which has provided
the main impetus to the growth of the country's economy, should
continue to be encouraging in 1999, she said.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Lamas Learning More About Outside World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- UNESCO officials found it hard to
believe that Nyima Cering, a lama at the Johkang Temple in Lhasa,
capita of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, could speak English so
well when he described the history of Tibetan Buddhism to them.
</P>
<P>
His lucid explanation made the basics of Tibetan Buddhism
clearer to the U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old lama has to recite a lot of Buddhist scriptures
and has to pray every day, but he still finds time to study
English and classical Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Languages are important tools for communication with the
outside world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was recommended by the monastery to take part in a journey
sponsored by the Buddhist Association of China last November and
traveled by plane to Wutaishan Mountain in Shanxi Province, to
Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, and to
Badachu in western Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said he enjoyed the chance to learn more about the outside
world and to exchange ideas with people in other parts of China.
"Only by learning about the outside world can I serve Buddha
better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngagwang lama, 38, shares the same view. He said he likes
raising flowers and watching TV, in addition to studying the
scriptures and praying, and especially likes watching Brazilian
football.
</P>
<P>
He has been at the Zhebung Monastery, 20 km west of Lhasa, for
16 years. There are five pots of flowers in his 8-square-meter
room and pictures of the 12 football teams of the 1998 World Cup
on his walls.
</P>
<P>
The 650 lamas at the 600-year-old monastery have an enjoyable
life, he said, and great changes have taken place in their lives.
Many of them have radios, tape recorders, calculators, calendar
watches, or popular sports shoes.
</P>
<P>
In the past, it was very difficult for lamas to know anything
about the outside world because of financial problems and a lack
of communications. It took three months to travel from Lhasa to
Beijing in the 1950s. Now it takes only one day by plane.
</P>
<P>
Lamas now cook their food with liquefied gas or in a solar
energy-powered kitchen. There are telephones and air-conditioners
in their houses, and, in addition to reciting scriptures and
praying they can learn about the outside world through newspapers
or TV.
</P>
<P>
Ali, 19, has a different hobby. He prefers studying English,
listening to popular music and playing computer games in addition
to studying mathematics and Chinese. His dream is to travel around
the world and make a contribution to the spread of Tibetan
Buddhism.

<HEADLINE> Hope Project Helps Poor Students Return To School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- For many times, Song Guangzhou,
the teenage son of a Red Army soldier in Yan'an in northwest China'
s Shaanxi Province, stood by the school gate, enviously watching
other children of his age go to class. He could not do so because
of financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
However, he has now become a top student at the Hope School in
the village of Xinyaoze, thanks to the Project Hope, which started
in 1990 to raise money for pupils who had dropped out of school in
poverty-stricken areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an is one of China's poor revolutionary bases. Its 1.8
million people had a per capita income of 1,300 yuan (159 U.S.
dollars) in 1998. It has received 54 million yuan worth of
donations and built 220 schools since 1990, helping about 13,000
young people return to school.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao Jinjiang, who is in charge of the city's
Project Hope, the Hope School in Wenhuagou Village was the first
in the province. It was established in 1993 with 700,000 yuan
donated by central government employees, including President Jiang
Zemin and Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, the people of Longgang District in the
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in Guangdong province have donated
8 million yuan for 33 schools in Yan'an and some students in Japan
donated 60,000 yuan to the village of Muya for a Hope school that
made it possible for more than 70 pupils to have better classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The older generation in Yan'an have also tried to help the
younger generation. One man, 70-year-old Tian Shenggui, has
donated 2,700 yuan in the past couple of years, and local people
have donated more than 6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The schools'teaching quality has also improved, according to
the Yan'an Hope School' Principal Dai Chengdong.
</P>
<P>
But, there is still a long way to go, says Yao Jinjiang,
because 50,000 sq.m. of school buildings are still needed in the
city and nearly 10,000 school dropouts need help.

The Jerusalem Post

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Athletes Only Receive Portion of IOC Scholarships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Four Indonesian athletes who
have been selected as recipients of an International Olympic
Committee (IOC) scholarship worth one thousand and two hundred U.S.
dollars per month will only receive a small portion of the amount,
the Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A National Sports Council (KONI) official in charge of
educational affairs Aribinuko Tjiptoadhidjojo said on Monday that
each athlete's share in the form of an allowance was just part of
eight items covered in the scholarship awarded under the Olympic
Solidarity Program.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the pocket money, the IOC will also pay training
expenses, coaches salaries, medication, expert team consultation
expenses (in psychology, nutrition and coaching), medical
insurance, board and lodging and administration fees.
</P>
<P>
Three badminton players -- men's doubles specialist Candra
Wijaya, women's doubles player Deyana Lomban and men's singles
Taufik Hidayat -- and female lifter Sri Indriyani were named the
scholarship recipients.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship winners should have received their money since
September last year. It has drawn complaints from some of them,
not to mention the information that they would only receive three
hundred U.S. dollars out of the total.
</P>
<P>
"We want a clear explanation of this matter," said Taufik,
Indonesia's rising star who is expected to win the gold medal in
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) also cut
a player's scholarship, but the policy was fair.
</P>
<P>
"It's OK with me, because the PBSI has provided all my needs.
But what about KONI? As scholarship recipients we don't get any
special attention from them," said Taufik.
</P>
<P>
"If that's our right, please give it to us. Why should they
keep it? If there's a problem, please talk to us. But if we only
receive three hundred U.S. dollars, it's not equivalent to our
huge responsibility to qualify for the Sydney Olympics," added
Candra.
</P>
<P>
Aribinuko denied that KONI intentionally delayed the
disbursement of the scholarships. He said the council would give
the money to the four athletes after finishing all paper work.
</P>
<P>
"The money is ready for disbursement, but we are waiting for
details from the PBSI to revise estimated expenses they spend on
their athletes", he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI's deputy chief of athletes development Hadi Nazri said the
association would not give special treatment to the scholarships
recipients.
</P>
<P>
"PBSI won't treat them differently from the others just because
they won the scholarships. Everybody will undergo the same
training program," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Needs New Consumer-Oriented Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
called for new consumer-oriented policies in China's current
efforts to protect economic growth by tapping into the consumer
market, China Securities reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bangzhu, vice-director of China's Economic and Trade
Commission, said that the new policies should focus on consumer
credit, leasing, and auctions.
</P>
<P>
Departments in charge of the circulation of goods and the
financial sector need to make a combined effort to provide loans
for more people to buy cars and agricultural machinery by paying
in installment.
</P>
<P>
They also need to commit themselves to leasing, especially
daily-use items and production equipment. The financial sector
needs to establish a leasing system for finance companies and
enterprises, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Consumer demand potential is found in the four areas of
residential housing and related products, automobiles and
motorcycles, computers and telecommunications equipment, and
tourism-related products, according to him.
</P>
<P>
But, Chen said, sales and services in those areas did not show
good profits last year because of the restrictions of old consumer
policies, thus new ones are needed to suit the buyers' market.

XI'AN, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi
Province will build four parks featuring places of historical
sites in the Zhou, Qin, Han and Tang dynasties, provincial
governor Cheng Andong announced here recently.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, whose capital Xi'an served as the capital of 13
ancient dynasties, has a great number of historical remains on or
under the ground surface.
</P>
<P>
A project on top of the agenda will be the construction of
exhibition halls separately containing terra cotta horses and
chariots and articles unearthed from the tomb of Qin Shihuang, the
first man to unite China. He founded the Qin Dynasty and assumed
the name "Shihuang", a Chinese word meaning first emperor. The new
exhibition halls will be near the Museum of the Terra Cotta Horses
and Warriors.
</P>
<P>
A park featuring the culture of the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.
D.) will be built at a place 10 km north of Xi'an, the provincial
capital. Archeological diggings show the place has a large
underground graveyard containing numerous cultural relics of high
artistic value.
</P>
<P>
The other two parks will be built in Baoji City, known as the
hometown of bronze ware, and in the northeastern part of Xi'an,
where are the ruins of the Daming Palace in the Tang Dynasty (618-
907).

<HEADLINE> 54 People Killed on New Zealand Roads in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- January marked the worst
start to a
year on New Zealand roads this decade.
</P>
<P>
The Land Transport Safety Authority (LTSA) of New Zealand said

Tuesday in a release that 54 people were killed on the country's
roads
last month, making it the worst January road toll recorded since
1990,
when the same number died. The monthly toll was 11 higher than
January
1998, when 43 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very disappointing start to the new year,
particularly we
started the year announcing a record low road toll for 1998," the

release said.
</P>
<P>
A particularly disturbing aspect of January's road toll was
that 27
deaths occurred in head-on crashes, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to popular belief, most head-on collisions are not
caused
by overtaking. They are a symptom of the much bigger problems of
speeding, drunk-driving and fatigue," the release said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Economy Bouncing Back, Says PM Shipley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny
Shipley Tuesday confirmed her country's economy is bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
After the New Zealand Cabinet was briefed by Reserve Bank
Governor Don
Brash and Treasury Secretary Alan Bollard Tuesday, Shipley said
that the
Economic indicators of New Zealand are improving, the Evening Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
"All the indicators are moving in a positive direction, and it
is the
first time since the early part of this decade where we've seen
such a trend
emerging," the Wellington-based newspaper quoted the prime
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The signs that are now emerging are promising for New
Zealand," Shipley
added.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the Treasury and the Reserve Bank have warned
there are
still international risks which can affect the New Zealand
economy, although
these do not appear to be as significant as those faced last year.
</P>
<P>
The briefing follows New Zealand Treasurer Bill Birch's
prediction last
week of a swifter-than-expected economic recovery, including one
year of
deficits rather than three and unemployment peaking at lower than
the 8.7
percent forecast in December by the Treasury.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Releases World War II War Crimes Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 1 (Xinhua) -- World War Two concentration camp
guard Nada Sakic, extradited from Argentina last November on war
crimes charges, was released from prison on Monday by the Croatian
judiciary authorities after three months of investigation.
</P>
<P>
A court statement said the state attorney's office decided to
drop criminal proceedings against her because there was not enough
evidence to prove guilt.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sakic, 72, was suspected of torturing inmates to death
when she served as guard in the women's block of the Jasenovac
prison camp from 1942 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
A warrant issued in July accused her of "carrying out torture,
inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as terror, intimidation
and collective punishment of civilians."
</P>
<P>
During the world War II, tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews,
Gypsies and anti-fascist Croats were killed at Jasenovac, the most
notorious of more than 20 concentration camps run by Croatia's
Nazi puppet state.
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors failed to find a single inmate who could
confirm the allegations against Mrs. Sakic after three months and
26 witnesses, the court statement said.
</P>
<P>
Their investigation also could not prove that Mrs. Sakic held
any position of authority after arriving at the camp at age 16.
</P>
<P>
Sakic fled Croatia when Nazi rule was crushed and lived in the
resort of Santa Teresita after arriving in Argentina in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Sakic's husband Dinko, 76, was extradited in June and is facing
a similar trial in Zagreb. He is accused of ordering, witnessing
and participating in the war crimes committed in the Jasenovac
camp, which he commanded between 1942 and 1944 and being
responsible for the death of at least 2,000 people at Jasenovac.
</P>
<P>
He remains in jail and his trial is expected in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav authorities have demanded the extradition of Nada
Sakic to put her on trial. However, Croatia has ruled out the
possibility of extraditing her as she is a Croatian citizen. Nada
Sakic has indicated her willingness to stay in Croatia after her
release.

<HEADLINE> Women Are Cooks in Most Urban Chinese Households </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted in three
Chinese cities has shown that the female members of 79.4 percent
urban families do the cooking.
</P>
<P>
The study of 888 people in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province,
Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, and Qingdao in Shandong Province found
that younger and middle-aged women did 44.7 percent of the daily
meal preparation, and older women, 34.7 percent of that work.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, which was done by the Beijing-based
Horizon Market Survey Company, male members of the family only do
the cooking during festivals or special gatherings, because they
consider cooking a sort of art form.
</P>
<P>
It was a tradition in China that men brought home the bacon
while women were in charge of household work, which included
preparing the meals and taking care of children.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays however, some Chinese women in cities are reluctant to
give up a job even after having had a child.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Demolish Rundown Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to demolish 2.6
million square meters of rundown and potentially dangerous
buildings to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of New
China and to give the Chinese capital an improved, modern image.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the municipality's environmental
improvement department, the project will be carried out in three
phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase is to pull down buildings illegally built on
both sides of the 255 main streets within the urban area in the
early half of this year; the second stage will tackle 420,000
square meters around the outskirts, suburbs and tourist
attractions by the end of August; and finally those in the
remaining old hutongs, lanes and neighborhoods by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Rundown buildings that impede traffic, fire fighting units or
generally create an inconvenience in the daily life of the people
will be listed as top priority. Once they have been razed the land
will be used to create more green, grassy areas and improve the
infrastructure of the city.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the municipal government at the end of last year
showed that most such buildings took up a total of 7.33 million
square meters, mainly located in the outskirts, neighborhoods, and
the 255 alleys and hutongs within the urban area.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Opens Commerce Ministers' Meeting in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) opened its Third Commerce Ministers'
Meeting here Tuesday morning in a bid to forge close economic
links among the seven member countries.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the two-day meeting, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
said SAARC member countries "need to develop a harmonized and
coordinated approach and strengthen our efforts to defend and
develop our economies" as their economies "are vulnerable to
natural and external economic shocks."
</P>
<P>
Although the Sixth SAARC Summit held in Sri Lanka in 1991
decided to set up the South Asian Preferential Trade Arrangements,
"its results are yet to be felt" and intra-SAARC trade continued
to be stagnant at around 3 percent of the total trade of the
member countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
She called for efforts to increase trade and commerce within
the regional grouping and intra-SAARC investment flows. "Surplus
funds from members of SAARC should flow into other member
countries... in the form of joint ventures and direct investment
preferably with buy-back arrangements," she said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, a regional economic bloc comprising Bangladesh, India,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives, was
established in 1985. "The success achieved by SAARC to date has
been much less striking" compared with some other regional
economic groupings such as the European Union, Commerce Minister
Tofail Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the intra-regional trade accounted for 3.6 percent
of the total trade of the region in 1995 and "no significant
improvement has occurred over the last three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, the most liberal regime in the region, has been the
destination of around half of all intra-regional imports while
India has been the origin of about four-fifths of total
intra-regional exports, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Some 18 percent of Bangladesh's imports come from other SAARC
countries, but it could market only 1.7 percent of its exports
within the region, he complained. "Efforts have to be made not
only to increase the volume of intra-regional trade but also to
ensure a more equitable distribution of its benefits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed also proposed that SAARC commerce ministers work out at
the meeting a common strategy for the World Trade Organization
Ministerial Conference scheduled to take place at the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
SAARC Secretary-General Nehal Rodrigo, commerce ministers from
Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, and India's
commerce secretary attended the inaugural session.
</P>
<P>
India's commerce minister is not participating in the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Likely to Enact New Law to Ban Trade Unions in Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- A new law is likely to be enacted
soon to ban trade unions in Bangladesh's banking sector including
the Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, the Bangladesh
Observer newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister is now drafting two separate bills
regarding the new law.
</P>
<P>
The two bills, one for banning trade union in the central bank
and another endorsing suspension of trade unions in the scheduled
banks, are expected to be placed by the finance minister in the
current session of the parliament, the report quoted official
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister is going to place the bills in the
parliament after evaluating the recommendations of the Task Force
(TF) which submitted its report on February 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The activities of trade unions were severely hindering the
day-to-day affairs of all the banks in the country including the
central bank, according to the TF's report.
</P>
<P>
In the name of trade unions and the central bargaining agents
(CBAs), leaders of the trade unions and CBAs are virtually running
a parallel administration controlling posting, promotions and
transfers of the bank's employees and officials, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The TF said that discipline in the banking sector could be
restored by banning trade unions and CBAs for a period of at least
three year, adding that all the activities of the trade unions and
CBAs would be considered punishable offense during the period.
</P>
<P>
But the existing law does not allow the government to stop the
activities of trade unions in the banks and other financial
institutions, the press report added.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Rate Drops 15 Percent in S. Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Suicide rate in Sri Lanka,
which was viewed among the highest in the world, has decreased by
15 percent from 7,364 cases in 1993 to 6,228 in 1997 according to
the latest police statistics.
</P>
<P>
This figure is expected to fall further by year 2000 according
to projections made by the Special Presidential Task Force on the
Prevention of Suicide.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Task Force said that there was much greater
awareness among the people about the problem. Further community
participation in activities against suicide had increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
The high suicide rate has been largely blamed on failed love
affairs, extramarital pregnancy and joblessness.
</P>
<P>
Many community programs carried out for the elimination of
suicide had proved successful. It has also been observed that the
medical community specially in the peripheral hospitals in the
country were becoming increasingly sensitive to the issue.
</P>
<P>
New initiatives in acute management of poisoning have also
commenced at hospital level islandwide.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force experts noted that awareness programs had to be
targeted mainly at youth especially in rural precincts. According
to statistics the majority of suicide victims (around 30 percent)
belong to the 20 to 30 year age group.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers taught
the Chicago Bulls' another lesson Monday night with a 89-83
victory in the final preseason game for both teams in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Even though Toni Kukoc shot 32 points, the game was controlled
by the Pacers most of time.
</P>
<P>
Dale Davis netted 16 points and grabed nine rebounds in 24
minutes, shooting a 50 percent from the free throw line and
blocking three shots.
</P>
<P>
Kukoc had 25 points in the second half to help the Bulls rally
from a 17-point deficit. The former champion team led three times
briefly.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, who had beaten the Bulls twice earlier in the
exhibition games, gave their reserves plenty time after taking a
10-point lead, but sent their regular lineup back to the court
with five minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
All five Indiana starters remained on the bench as the Pacers
built a 43-30 halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Parties Condemn NATO's Air Strike Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav political parties and
organizations on Monday vehemently condemned NATO's decision to
authorize the use of force against Yugoslavia over its handling of
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Socialist Party lodged a strong protest against
NATO, saying that the open military threat to an independent and
sovereign state runs counter to the wish of the international
community of seeking political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The threat also constituted a violation of the United Nations
Charter because it serves as an open support to the ethnic
Albanian "separatists and terrorists " in Kosovo, it said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The NATO decision is not understandable but unacceptable, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade Municipal Commission of the Leftist Coalition
expressed its resentment to the NATO decision, saying that the
military threat was not only unreasonable, but also immoral.
</P>
<P>
Another Yugoslav party, the Serbian Radical Party, said the
NATO move was an aggressive interference in a sovereign state and
an open violation of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the Belgrade University Students Association
lodged a strong protest against the NATO authorization, urging
peace talks between the government and the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the North Altantic Council authorized NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana to order air strikes against
Yugoslavia if the six-nation Contact Group deems them necessary.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Gene Could Help Delay Menopause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A new study has shown that
mice, which are missing a particular gene, have ovaries that
function for much longer than normal, avoiding the degeneration
associated with menopause.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston created
the strain of mice by disabling a gene called Bax. The mutant mice
have three times the number of ovarian follicles as normal mice,
according to a report in the February issue Nature Genetics.
</P>
<P>
"The research, which is far from application in humans, may
eventually lead to new techniques for delaying menopause and
reducing its associated health risks," said a statement from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Tilly, the senior author of the report in Nature
Genetics, believes that it's too early to speculate about whether
scientists could extend ovarian life in women or what good that
might be.
</P>
<P>
The study is the first to find that follicle depletion and loss
of ovarian function, the cause of menopause, can be stopped.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Election Body Sets Campaign Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Election
Agency has scheduled the election campaign to run from May 18
through June 6, and banned the mobilization of the masses in order
to prevent clashes among party supporters.
</P>
<P>
The election agenda which included the campaign season has been
arranged to give ample time for the political parties to prepare
for the June 7 polls, the chairman of the agency, Minister of Home
Affairs Syarwan Hamid, told reporters here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"So what we have here is a tentative schedule starting from the
registration of political parties to the actual balloting and the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) General Session in November,"
he said after a meeting of the election agency leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said in accordance with the legislation on general
elections, political parties contesting the poll were required to
hold indoor campaign activities.
</P>
<P>
"Political parties will not be allowed to mobilize the masses
in open fields and party supporters will be barred from taking to
the streets. These measures are meant to prevent clashes and
violence like in the past," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said around 30 out of the around 200 political parties
are expected to be eligible to contest the elections.
</P>
<P>
According to John Sani, deputy head of the agency, all
activities relating to and resulting from the June election will
be carried out in seven phases over a period of about seven months
starting February 1.
</P>
<P>
The first phase would be time for the registration and
screening of the political parties that would take part in the
elections. The time span would be February 1 to March 1.
</P>
<P>
The second phase would be for voters' registration and run from
March 18 to April 17.
</P>
<P>
During the third phase, March 1 to April 15, the parties would
name their nominees to district, provincial and national
legislative assemblies.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth phase, May 18 through June 6, the election
contestants would hold their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the time lapse of one month between the third
and fourth phases, Sani said that it would be used for
administrative processing activities.
</P>
<P>
The fifth phase would be polling and vote-counting at polling
stations on June 7. According to the head of public relations at
the Ministry of Home Affairs Herman Ibrahim, 13 days would be
required to finalize the vote-counting.
</P>
<P>
During the sixth phase, the results of the general elections
for the different legislatures would be formalized, namely June
20-26 for district legislative assemblies, June 27-July 2 for
provincial legislative assemblies and July 3-12 for the central
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The seventh phase would be for the oath-taking of members of
the various legislative assemblies, namely July 20 for district
legislative assemblies, July 25 for provincial legislative
assemblies and August 29 for the central parliament.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Home Affairs Ministry observed this year's
election could not be done in 12 phases like the previous ones
because of the limited time available.
</P>
<P>
"While in the past, the 12 phases required one year and a half,
now we only have a few months," he added.

COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Elections to five Sri Lankan
Provincial Councils which were postponed under emergency
regulations last August are now likely to be conducted on the same
day in March this year, informed sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court, which heard a petition from the Free Media
Movement against the postponement of these elections, on January
26 directed the Elections Commissioner to announce new dates for
the elections within two weeks and to hold the elections within
three months.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the government was now in favor of holding
the elections to the five provincial councils of Western,
Sabaragamuwa, Uva, North Central and Central Provinces
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Sri Lanka's main opposition United National Party
leader Ranil Wickremesinghe threatened to boycott the five
provincial council elections if they are not held on the same day.
</P>
<P>
On January 25, the ruling People's Alliance won the elections
to the North Western Provincial Council despite severe allegations
of violence and violation of election laws.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Elections Dayananda Dissanayake will have to
fix the dates for the elections before February 11 in keeping with
the Supreme Court order.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Open Capital Link for Ailing SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) is considering to set up a new board for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with lower listing requirements,
an SET official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the new board, cash-strapped SMEs can look forward to
tapping the capital market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The SET organized a seminar Monday, at which Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai promised to push for enactment of the Small- and
Medium-sized Enterprises legislation by the end of this year for a
big chunk of the country's real sector to tap the capital market.
</P>
<P>
There are about 130,000 SMEs in Thailand, which account for 98
percent of all registered factories. These SMEs employ 1.6 million
workers, or 50 percent of the industrial workforce, according to
government statistics.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposed legislation, an SME is a company with
no more than 50 million baht (1.39 million U.S. dollars) in
capital and employs no more than 200 workers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50 billion baht (1.39 billion dollars) will be
available to increase SME liquidity. The funds will be used to
support the government's policy on recapitalization and debt
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
However, a top banker cautioned that it will not be easy to
recapitalize SMEs and restructure their debts because they
generally have high risks and investors are now more risk-averse.
</P>
<P>
Bantoon Lamsam, president of Thai Farmers Bank, warned that
tapping the capital market would be difficult or even impossible
for SMEs unless they undergo simultanous financial and risk
restructuring to increase efficiency and long-term
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
To increase the prospect of turning around SMEs, he said, there
should not be only debt or financial restructuring but also risk
restructuring given that SMEs generally have higher risks than
large enterprises due to higher funding costs, less technology
competitiveness, less management skills, less personnel
development and less transparency.

Bank official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to stimulate liquidity in the market, the Exim Bank is
negotiating with ADB to expand the borrower target eligible for
the remaining 800 million U.S. dollar support facility from ADB.
</P>
<P>
The Exim Bank said the target should be expanded from only
narrowly-defined exporters, who directly export goods overseas, to
all businesses generating foreign currency, the official quoted
Exim Bank President Pridiyathorn Devakula as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far, ADB has approved a support facility of one billion
dollars to Thai exporters via the Exim Bank, who have only
utilized 200 million dollars of the total available.
</P>
<P>
The president said that as the liquidity of commercial banks
has improved significantly since the second half of last year,
commercial banks would not need additional supporting loans from
the ADB.
</P>
<P>
He said the Exim Bank aims to extend between 9-10 billion baht
(250-277.8 million dollars) in additional funds this year.
</P>
<P>
The Exim Bank this year will focus on exporters whose
businesses may have great potential but are facing financial
difficulties. These exporters' loan applications were mostly
rejected by commercial banks which are currently very cautious of
lending.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economy this year depends heavily on exports since
internal demands will see no significant increase.
</P>
<P>
The government has predicted that the country's exports this
year could grow by four percent mainly from the automobile and
steel sectors.
</P>
<P>
Exports account for 44-45 percent of Thailand's gross domestic
product at present.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Deputy PM Backs Acceptance of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister
and Chairman of the Serbian Renewal Movement Vok Draskovic on
Monday voiced his support for the Yugoslav government to accept
NATO's invitations to peace talks on Kosovo in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic told a press conference that although the government
had yet to decide whether to send a delegation to the talks, he
and his Serbian Renewal Movement definitely stood for a positive
response to the invitations.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic said the delegation dispatched by the Yugoslav
government should point out at the negotiating table that some of
the demands contained in the resolution passed by the foreign
ministers of the six-nation Contact Group for former Yugoslavia in
London last Friday were unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He said the delegation should stick to the important principled
stand against establishing "Greater Albania," granting Kosovo
independence or turning Kosovo into "the third republic of
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the deployment of ground forces by NATO in
Kosovo, Draskovic said as long as the international delegates
abide by the U.N. Charter and international norms at the Paris
meeting, there is no need for the Yugoslav government to build up
anti-terrorist forces in Kosovo or for NATO to station troops
there.
</P>
<P>
Only when the international delegates explicitly condemn
terrorism and do not back Kosovo's independence will those who
depend on NATO ground forces for the establishment of a "Greater
Albania" discard their illusion, said Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group, make up of the United States,
Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy, issued an ultimatum on
January 29 in London urging the warring sides in Kosovo to start
peace talks on February 6 and reach agreement within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
On the following day, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
threatened military intervention in Kosovo if the conflicting
parties failed to fulfill the demands of the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who
chaired the Contact Group meeting, delivered their demands to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. Milosevic
responded coolly to the ultimatum, saying that the Republic of
Serbia and the Yugoslav government will reply after having
carefully studied the Contact Group's statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 2 (Xinhua)-- The Supreme Court of south
China's Guangdong Province improved its efficiency levels in 1998
with an increasing number of cases being resolved.
</P>
<P>
Lu Botao, president of the court, in his report to the
provincial committee of the National People's Congress, revealed
that it had handled some 480,000 cases and reached verdicts in 410,
000 of them last year, representing an annual increase of 17
percent and 18 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to an anti-corruption move initiated in
February last year among court functionaries, which helped to
settle over 2,000 cases which had been in the system for a long
time, 482 cases which had been unduly delayed and 203 cases with
sentences considered unfair.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 92 court officials were investigated for
various corruption activities and four of them were sentenced.
Meanwhile, the court has cut its ties with 97 affiliated companies
to ensure law enforcement is conducted fairly and openly.
</P>
<P>
The court president added that it had worked closely with
police forces in fight against organized crime, such as armed
robberies and smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Won't Leave East Timor Abruptly: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will not abruptly
leave East Timor as Portugal did in 1975, should the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) decide to grant independence to the
former Portuguese colony later this year, Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"No, we will not do that," said Alatas Monday when asked by
reporters whether Indonesia will do what Portugal did in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Portugal abruptly abandoned its former colony following 400
years of colonization. Indonesia announced the integration of East
Timor into the country in 1976 and declared it as the 27th
province, but the United Nations has not recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
Alatas was speaking to reporters after he and other ministers
holding political portfolios met with President B.J. Habibie at
the Merdeka Palace here to discuss domestic and overseas reactions
to the latest move by the government.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise announcement last week, the government said it
will ask the MPR to grant independence to East Timor, if the
region rejects a special status for the area, together with
wide-ranging autonomy proposed by Jakarta now being discussed at
the U.N. sponsored talks.
</P>
<P>
"The president has asked me to continue monitoring (comments on
East Timor). I met him to convey a progress report on East Timor.
There are a lot of things I need to report to him, such as who
have made comments and what those comments were," Alatas was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Alatas also reported about a planned
tripartite meeting between himself and his Portuguese counterpart
under the aegis of the U.N. secretary general.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to set a suitable date for the meeting because
the U.N. secretary general wants to hear directly from the
Indonesian foreign minister about Indonesia's latest stand on East
Timor," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- With the 1998-1999 NBA
season four days to open, Dennis Rodman is still waiting for a
team to sign him.
</P>
<P>
The seven-time rebounding champion wishes that either the
Orlando Magic or Los Angeles Lakers would sign him, although his
first choice seems to be Orlando, where he would be reunited with
his former coach Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
Since Orlando owner Rich DeVos dislikes Rodman's bizarre
reputation, "The Worm" could end up being available to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say we're interested or we're not interested," Lakers
general manager Jerry West said Monday. "But there would be an
awful lot to talk about it internally before we'd do something
like that."
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal said he dislikes Rodman, even though the
Lakers need a power forward.
</P>
<P>
"I would not want to go against my big man," coach Del Harris
said. "I have the highest regard for the abilities of the guy who
could win the rebounding title seven years in a row and who has
been on two different championship teams as many times as he has."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Produce, Sell Gas from Yetagun by Year-End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will be ready by the end
of this year to produce and sell natural gas from the country's
Yetagun Field off southern Tanintharyi coast.
</P>
<P>
According to the Myanmar Energy Ministry sources, of the
67-kilometer onshore pipeline, 42 km has been laid, and of the
206-km offshore pipeline, 178 km has been connected.
</P>
<P>
Laying of the two pipelines at Kanbauk region in the
Tanintharyi division began in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The Yetagun gas field, constituted with four blocks, has been
explored and being developed by a foreign oil group made up of
Britain's Premier, Japan's Nippon, Thailand's PTTEP, Malaysia's
Petronas and Myanmar's state-run Oil and Gas Enterprise since
1990.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, located in the Andaman Sea at a depth of 101
meters and about 200 km away from the Myanmar coast, reportedly
has a reserve gas of 1.2 trillion cubic-feet and crude oil of 2
billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
According to a 30-year contract reached between the Petroleum
Authority of Thailand and the developers in March 1997, the
Yetagun gas will be sold to Thailand at 200 million cubic-feet
(5.6 million cubic-meters) per day.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the output of natural gas and
crude oil of Myanmar was 1.798 billion cubic-meters and 3.63
million barrels respectively in 1997-98 fiscal year, and the
figures in the first 10 months of 1998 went to 1.464 billion
cubic-meters and 2.865 million barrels separately.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the oil and gas sector reached 2.303
billion U.S. dollars in 46 projects at the end of October 1998 out
of 7.089 billion dollars' total foreign investment.

COLOMBO, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will not be a
signatory to the Ottawa Anti-Landmines Treaty on the prohibition
of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of mines and on
their destruction which will become effective on March 1, a
newspaper here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Government officials told The Island that they had explained to
the world community that the war situation in Sri Lanka's north

The armed forces fighting Tamil rebels heavily depend on
various types of mines, officials were quoted as saying.

<P>
Asian diplomatic sources said that the entire seven nation
South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation group would not be
a part of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, the treaty has been ratified by more than 40 states,
the number required to activate the treaty, said Canada's new High
Commissioner Ruth Archibald.
</P>
<P>
Archibald told the paper that 133 countries signed the
convention beginning early December 1997 in Ottawa, of which 63

LIMA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Peru's hard currency reserves rose
to more than 9.4 billion U.S. dollars as of January 26 from 9.14
billion dollars at the end of 1998, the Central Bank said Monday.

<P>
BELGRADE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government urged
the United Nations Security Council on Monday to convene a special
meeting and take appropriate measures to prevent "NATO armed
aggression" against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It made the call after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (
NATO) authorized its secretary-general to decide when to use force
against Yugoslavia over its handling of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement that the NATO decision is "
an open threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"It is a violation of the principles of the United Nations
Charter", said the statement carried by the official Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
As a regional military organization, the statement said, NATO
does not have authorization from the U.N. Security Council, or
have the right to use force against a sovereign and independent
country.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO threat not only violated the basic principles
governing international relations, but also damaged the legal
foundation of world peace and security," it said.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, NATO authorized its secretary-general Javier
Solana to decide when to use air strikes to force the warring
sides in Kosovo to make peace.
</P>

Solana said on Monday that NATO forces were ready for any
military actions.

</P>
<P>
Last year, the zloty had stood firm against the U.S. dollar at
3.5 to one.
</P>
<P>
Although it plummeted to 3.8 against the U.S. dollar last
August at the height of the Russian financial crisis, it rebounded
very soon to the normal level of 3.45.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's financial turmoil also had little impact on the zloty,
which only registered a slight drop in value.
</P>
<P>
The latest devaluation is mainly due to Poland's domestic
troubles, according to banking sources.
</P>
<P>
The one-month strikes and demonstrations by peasants and
medical personnel made foreign investors quite uncertain about the
economic prospect of the country. And as a result, they begin to
sell the zloty. Even the Bank of Poland followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Some warned that if the zloty devalued further, some foreign
investors could consider withdrawing from the country.

<HEADLINE> IMF Team Studies Brazil's Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A technical team from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued its meetings on Monday
with Brazilian officials to assess the crisis affecting the
largest economy in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Amaury Bier, the finance ministry's economic policy director,
said that the IMF team has split into two groups, one for
examining fiscal policies and macroeconomic indicators, and the
other for reviewing balance of payments, money supply and bank
system supervision.
</P>
<P>
Bier said the assessment is preliminary to talks on Brazil's
economic goals scheduled for the next few days with the
participation of IMF's chief economist Stanley Fisher, who is due
to arrive on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bier said that due to the review of the goals, the IMF could
postpone until the end of February its second tranche of about 9
billion dollars from the 41.5 billion U.S. dollar international
credit granted to Brazil in November.
</P>
<P>
In December, Brazil received 9 billion dollars from the IMF and
used it to bolster its sagging currency reserves, now at 36
billion U.S. dollars, down from 74 billion dollars registered last
July. A second installment might help restore investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team arrived in Brazil last Saturday to review the pact
reached last November with Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Celebrates St Trypon's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Wine producers and viticulturists
throughout Bulgaria celebrated the tradition of St Trypon's Day on
Monday, hoping the patron saint of wine would bring a good harvest
and rebuild the country's wine industry.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Sofia, a ceremony was held in the cellar of
the National Wine Quality Control Institute to honor the St Trypon
where two Bulgarian wines, Mavroud and Cabernet, were named "St
Trypon" and "St Valentine".
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's Trade and Tourism Minister Valentin Vassilev
attended the vine-cutting ceremony held in the 120-year-old cellar
of the institute.
</P>
<P>
Vassilev cut a vine in the yard of the institute, a ritual
viticulturists perform on St Trypon's Day.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Chen Delai and 12 other foreign ambassadors
to Sofia attended the ceremony. They tried some organic Cabernet
wines produced without the use of pesticides or preservatives, and
the cellar's 44-year-old brandy.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its favorable climate and soil conditions, Bulgaria
has a long history of wine production and most of its wine is
exported.
</P>
<P>
However, many vineyards across the country have been laid waste,
but vine acreage is increasing again after years of destructive
agricultural policies.
</P>
<P>
Now the country is determined to boost its wine industry.
</P>
<P>
Ventsislav Vurbanov, the agricultural minister, said while
attending the St Trypon's Day feast in the city on the Danube that
the future of wine-growing depends on new vine planting.
</P>
<P>
To encourage new vine planting, he said, the Agricultural State
Fund will provide about 150 billion leva (260 million U.S. dollars)
this year to help viticulturists and open new credit sources.
</P>
<P>
But vine-growers should show more enterprise to recover the
industry, Vurbanov added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investors in Bulgaria Insured Against Currency Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC) of the U.S. government will provide insurance
to U.S. investors in Bulgaria that will pay out in case there is
trouble converting the local currency leva into U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The move places Bulgaria on an equal footing with Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic, which all benefit from sizable
American investment.
</P>
<P>
The OPIC has already received 20 letters of investment intent,
said Stuart Eizenstat, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State for Economic
and Business Affairs, who is co-chairman of the high-level
Bulgarian-American economic working group. The priorities of
bilateral cooperation are infrastructure, environment and the
energy industry.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Bulgarian Foreign Investment Agency, Ilian
Vassilev, who also participated in the working group, said the
OPIC will provide insurance against deterioration of the host
country's ability to convert investors' income from the local
currency into U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Bulgaria had solid foreign currency reserves
and there was no danger that investors would be unable to convert
their currency.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the meeting of the working group were
representatives of 26 Bulgarian and 10 U.S. government
institutions. Along with Eizenstat, the co-chairman of the group
is Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Bozhkov.
</P>
<P>
The working group's 1999 agenda includes helping Bulgaria
stabilize its judicial system with the aid of the syllabus of the
institute for magistrates' training. The United States will also
offer technical assistance in preparing and implementing the legal
reform with the view to improving Bulgaria's trade and investment
climate.
</P>
<P>
According to Eizenstat, the U.S. government will provide 39
million dollars to assist Bulgarian reforms in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Strives for Improvement of Health Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been implementing
its national health policy and plans compatible with the country's
situation to materialize the social objective of uplifting health
and fitness.
</P>
<P>
A five-year National Health Plan from 1996 to 2001 is under
implementation through the strategies of programming community
health care, disease control, hospital care, environmental health,
health systems development and management.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 50 detailed work projects of these six broad
programs are being carried out, of which priority is given and
serious attention is paid to primary health care, rural health
care, promoting health care systems equally in urban and rural
areas, and cooperation of not only government organizations but
also social, private and joint venture ones.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1988, a total of 95 new hospitals have been opened
and 72 old hospitals upgraded with 56 rural health care centers,
20 regional health centers and 76 clinics added to provide health
care services in villages and the areas lagging behind.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also pays attention to the nurturing of adequate number
of doctors, specialists and technicians as human resources
development, while working out more programs such as health
research paper-reading sessions, medical seminars and development
of new medical curriculum for promotion of medical science and
health education.
</P>
<P>
The government also encourages local doctors to continue
further studies to attain higher degrees.
</P>
<P>
To promote its health services for the entire population,
Myanmar introduced a cost-sharing health care system beginning
last year on account of the government's limited ability to bear
all the national health expenditures alone and has set up trust
funds at some major hospitals to provide health services to poor
and needy patients.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Myanmar pays attention to the development of
traditional medicine, opening up more related hospitals and
treatment and research centers, and nurturing more traditional
medicine practitioners.
</P>
<P>
The country has also been carrying out prevention and control
programs against diseases of malaria, AIDS and polio, while
disseminating health education through mass media to promote
public awareness of health information and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, up to the 1997-98 fiscal
year, there registered 734 hospitals with 28,943 beds, 350
dispensaries, 1,410 rural centers and 348 maternal and child
health centers in the entire country with 14,007 doctors, 11,840
nurses and 9,524 midwives.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Glenn Hoddle's future as England
coach will be decided at lunchtime on Tuesday when English
Football Association (F.A) made an announcement about his job
following his controversial remarks about the disabled people.
</P>
<P>
FA executive director David Davies said on Monday:"Clearly we
have had to move quickly to bring people with scheduled
arrangements together but our priority is to do what's right for
English football and the English football team.
</P>
<P>
"Glenn has given his version of events in a couple of TV
interviews and what he said is being considered, although he will
have the chance to say those things first thing tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hoddle's agent Dennis Roach said the England coach
wanted to issue a libel writ against The Times which carried an
interview last Saturday in which he allegedly said the disabled
people are paying for the sins they committed in an earlier life.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle was quoted as saying: "You and I have been given two
hands and two legs and half-decent brains.
</P>
<P>
"Some people have not been born like that for a reason. The
karma is working from another lifetime."
</P>
<P>
There have been widespread calls for Hoddle's resignation since
the interview was published, but Hoddle said he would not resign
as England coach, a position he has held since the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In television interviews on Monday, Hoddle said: "I never said
it and I don't believe it and I am sorry for the distress I have
caused disabled people and their families."
</P>
<P>
"I made a big, big mistake in taking a journalist into my
confidence, I let my guard down in talking about my personal
beliefs and letting the interview stray from football matters.
</P>
<P>
"I do believe in reincarnation, but to say that I think the
disabled are being punished could not be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
"I am frustrated that my job is hanging in the balance because
of the way an interview I gave was totally misconstrued and
misunderstood."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- About 120,000 handicapped
Chinese who have recovered from leprosy are expecting love and
concern from the entire society, China's Health Minister said in a
recent visit to leprosy hospital.
</P>
<P>
"Society should pay more attention to and be on good terms with
people who have recovered from the disease, instead of
discriminating against them," Zhang Wenkang said during his visit
to the hospital in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged governments at all levels and the public not only
to provide financial and policy support for patients' treatment,
but also to help recovered patients find jobs.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 of the handicapped patients were homeless and
lived in special houses, today's China Daily quoted Li Wenzhong,
an expert with the Skin Disease Institute of Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide efforts would be made to achieve an incidence rate
lower than one per 100,000 people in 95 percent of Chinese
counties by the end of this century, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, about 85 percent of counties and cities had
lowered their leprosy incidence rates under the level. The number
of patients dropped to 4,045 in 1997 from 500,000 in the 1950s.

<P>
CHANGSHA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Yueyang Customs Office in
central China's Hunan Province stopped an illegal shipment of
antimony bound to Thailand and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed company from neighboring Hubei Province submitted a
customs declaration for 80 tons of aluminum alloy, with an ensuing
routine check by Yueyang customs officers revealing that the
contents of the shipment failed to conform with documents
presented.
</P>
<P>
A test revealed that the shipment in fact contained antimony
with a purity of over 96 percent. The Customs office noted that
antimony exports must be licensed and taxed in accordance with
related regulations.
</P>
<P>
China currently accounts for over 70 percent of the world's
total antimony production. China's 20 largest antimony producers
have signed an agreement last year to join in the campaign against
antimony smuggling in order to help maintain normal prices on the
international market.

"These new changes are extremely important to the development
of a socialist market economy in China," he said.
</P>

of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).

JAKARTA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 180 police offices
have been torched and vandalized since riots erupted in many parts
of Indonesia last year, said Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi, chief of the
Indonesian Police.
</P>

The 180 offices of police sectors and resorts have not

The meeting was attended by deputy chiefs of police districts
across the country.

Roesmanhadi asked each province to submit a plan for
operational budgets, including those needed to repair the police
offices attacked by mobs.

He said the police must also replace shields which were damaged
during encounters with rioters.

"Nearly 100 to 200 police shields in each police resort must be
replaced with new ones," he was quoted by Antara News Agency

Roesmanhadi said: "We are even thinking of operational costs
for police officers to safeguard against riots in several parts of
the country."

To solve the funding problems, the police began efforts to
maximize revenues from public services, including from the
issuance of driving licenses and vehicle plates, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Making More Efforts to Protect Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
expected to take more vigorous actions to protect its wetland
resources, said a forestry official yesterday, on the eve of the
third annual World Wetlands Day, which is being celebrated today.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, measures will be taken to
regulate exploitation. National standards and systems for
evaluating environmental damage caused by the abuses of wetlands
are expected to be established.
</P>
<P>
The government is working on a draft of the China Wetlands
Protection Plan. It expects to increase state funding for
protection plans and to implement a comprehensive survey of
wetland resources, said Zhang Jianlong, director of the Department
of Wild Animals and Plant Protection of the State Forestry
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China will establish 180 wetland ecosystem reserves
by 2000, up from the existing 148 reserves. Of the 148 protected
zones, seven of them are listed by an international convention on
protecting wetland resources of international significance.
</P>
<P>
Major threats to China's wetlands come from human incursion,
worsening pollution, damages to ecological diversity, degeneration
of the wetland ecological functions and abuse of it as a resource,
said an expert.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest wetland areas in Asia at about 65 million
hectares, or 10 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands in north China and in the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze River have deteriorated, forcing migratory birds to
change their migratory behavior from relying on inland China to
relying on the coastal areas of east China.

<TEXT>

LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon striker John Hartson
received a record-equalling 20,000 pounds (US$32,790) fine and
three-match ban on Monday for kicking former West Ham teammate
Eyal Berkovic in the head.
</P>
<P>
Hartson was caught on a supporter's video kicking his Israeli
teammate full in the face during a training session last September.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Wimbledon set club's new transfer record of
7.5 million pounds ($12.30 million) to buy Hartson from West Ham.
His ban starts on February 15, but is subject to appeal.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a player had faced a misconduct charge
over a training ground incident but F.A. spokesman Steve Double
said: "We regard the incident as being within our jurisdiction as
John is a professional player, subject to our rules. From the
Football Association's point of view this was regarded as an
unpleasant incident, damaging to the game's image."
</P>
<P>
The fine matches the one handed out to Vinnie Jones for putting
his name to a video of vicious tackles and to Patrick Vieira for
an obscene gesture to the Sheffield Wednesday crowd last September.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Argentina and Brazil are
preparing the February 8 summit between presidents Carlos Menem
and Fernando Cardoso, an Argentine official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Industry, Commerce and Mining Minister Alieto
Guadagni was quoted by the press here as saying that the two
presidents will discuss ways for the members of the Mercosur trade
bloc to strengthen their links by modeling on European practice
and eventually adopting a common currency.
</P>
<P>
The member countries must "set clear and defined macroeconomic
goals for the future," and sign a "Maastrich treaty for the
Mercosur," he said.
</P>
<P>
Guadagni added the Mercosur countries are seriously affected by
the devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Menem and Cardoso is seen as being crucial
because Argentina and Brazil are two leading members of the trade
bloc and are also mutually dependent, with one third of Argentine
exports going to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, the largest trade bloc in Latin America, groups
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Chile and Bolivia as
its associate members.

At present, there are 106 convents housing 3,727 nuns in the
Tibet Autonomous Region. Most women with religious beliefs in
Tibet believe in the Tibetan form of Buddhism, while others
believe in Islam and Catholicism. Female clerics from various
religions in Tibet enjoy full liberty to conduct normal religious
activities, while all temples and convents are managed in a
democratic way.
</P>
<P>
Women in Tibet enjoy equal employment rights with men.
Currently, Tibet has some 477,000 female workers, accounting for
45.8 percent of the region's total employment, and 67.1 percent of
women above the age of 15 years in Tibet have a job.
</P>
<P>
According to 1997 statistics, there were 58,254 female workers
in cities and towns in Tibet, 35 percent of the region's total
urban workers. Tibetan women are hired in all major sectors of the
national economy, especially in ethnic handicrafts, finance,
tourism, health and medical care, education, culture and arts, and
post and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Female workers make up 45 percent of the total employees of the
ethnic handicraft sector in Tibet, and in areas like wool spinning,
tailoring and rug-knitting, the proportion of female workers is as
high as 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 10.53 percent of deputies to people's congresses at all
levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region are women. Among the
deputies to the 7th Autonomous Regional People's Congress, women
account for 20.09 percent, up by 0.09 percentage point compared
with the 6th Autonomous Regional People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The old Tibet had no female government employees, let alone
female officials. After the democratic reform, the state has
attached great importance to selecting and training women
officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are facts and
figures about the social status of women in the Tibet Autonomous
Region:
</P>
<P>
As a result of social progress, women in Tibet are gradually
gaining rights, opportunities and dignity of which they had been
deprived in the old Tibet, where the social system and cultural
tradition discriminated strongly against females. There is now an
obvious change of destiny for Tibetan women.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, by the end of 1997 there were
1.2184 million women in the Tibet Autonomous Region, making up 50.
2 percent of the region's total population. Apart from some 1.12
million women from the Tibetan ethnic group, women there also come
from 30 other ethnic groups, including Han, Hui, Lhoba, Monba,
Mongolian, Naxi and Sherpa.
</P>
<P>
In the old Tibet, women were denied political and educational
rights. They were subject to excessive economic exploitation by
land owners and to numerous social and religious discriminations.
At that time, a pregnant woman had to give birth to her child in a
sheepfold according to religious taboos, and as a result the
mortality rate for new-borns then was as high as 430 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
In March 1959, the central government of China launched a
democratic reform in Tibet, bringing emancipation to the over one
million serfs and slaves there, who won not only personal freedom
but also the right to subsistence and development. All ethnic
groups in Tibet gained equality, while women there were also
granted equal legal status with men.

BRASILIA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's currency reserves
totaled 36.1 billion U.S. dollars last Friday, a central bank
statement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement shows that the country's currency reserves
remained at the same level in the past two weeks, countering
rumors that they were dwindling due to capital flight in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In an agreement signed last year with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to receive a 41.5 billion dollars rescue
package, the Brazilian government pledged to maintain the reserves
at a minimum level of 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank did not disclose the amount of cash it keeps on Monday,
but analysts estimated it at 35.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
To curb rumors about massive capital flight, the central bank
suspended its daily reports on the amount of the country's
exchange operations, which remained negative last months. Starting
from Monday, the bank will issue report every two weeks.

ROME, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema said on Monday that in the coming five years, the southern
region of Italy can draw on funds of 120 trillion lire (70.6
billion U.S. dollars) in construction of infrastructure from the
central government.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Sicily Monday, D'Alema affirmed that the
southern region of Italy which links to poverty and Mafia, can
change face in five years if there is political stability with a
convergence of commitments.
</P>

He said that the fate of the government is bound to employment
and economic development as criteria for its success or lack of
success.
</P>
<P>
He also said that "this is not a dream book but something we
can do to create a new season of economic development through
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, D'Alema said that in the past, "funds from the
central government often permitted corruption and the enrichment
of the Mafia," but adding that this use of aid will certainly not
be continued.
</P>
<P>
"Thus a moral battle will be needed to teach young people to
reject crime and violence, to create a way of thinking against
easy riches," he said.

felling and closed 30 timber companies and outlets. However,
influenced by higher prices for timber, several hundred villagers
in Minxian county clashed with forest rangers, seriously injuring
12 of them. They are still detained in hospital. Three police cars
were also smashed up and a pistol stolen.
</P>
<P>
The incident has greatly concerned the provincial government. A
joint team composed of public security and forest protection
officers has been dispatched to Minxian to make investigations.
</P>
<P>
The government of Minxian county is now calling a public
meeting to explain the importance of protecting the forest to
villagers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public security units have increased their patrols
in forest zones. They have already stopped 20 trucks laden with
timber cut down without permission, confiscating 200 cubic meters
of timber.

NEW YORK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Stocks ended mixed on Wall
Street Monday as investors responded to different news from
economic and financial sections.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,345.70, down

<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets posted
strong gains Monday after news of mergers in the banking and
insurance markets.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 of leading shares hit a peak of 6045 in mid
afternoon when it stood up 149 points, but it later calmed to
close up 116.4 points to 6012.4.
</P>
<P>
Guardian Royal Exchange said it had agreed to a 3.4 billion
pound (5.44 billion U.S. dollars) takeover by Sun Life and
Provincial Holdings Plc, majority controlled by France's Axa.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector also had a boost following tie-ups between
French banks Paribas and Societe Generale.

Observers here said the move prompted expectation of further
consolidation in the banking business, or at least the hope that
competition would prompt greater cost efficiencies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mulls Response to India's Indication on Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering backing away from its opposition to World Bank loans
for India as New Delhi indicated its willingness to sign an
international nuclear test ban treaty by a specific date, the
State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Progress has been made" during U.S.- India negotiations on
nuclear issues last week and as a result Washington is
"considering an appropriate response," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We have said all along that our sanctions policy would be
adjusted based on progress in nonproliferation negotiations.
Progress has been made in these most recent negotiations and
We're consulting with Congress and other members of the
international community on how to respond to movement in the
right direction in terms of the comprehensive test ban," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to define movement in the right direction, he said:
"With respect to the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban ...
we receive some encouraging indications on the timing."
</P>
<P>
The United States and other major powers have been pressuring
India and Pakistan to sign the nuclear test ban treaty since
India and then Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May 1998,
triggering fears of a regional arms race.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi and Islamabad told the U.N. General Assembly in
October 1998 that they would work toward successful completion
of the pact by September 1999, but Washington has wanted a specific
signing date from both countries. Some $1.7 billion in World Bank
loans to India have been on hold because of international
outrage over the tests.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Largest Bank Created by Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's two leading banks
announced Monday that they have agreed to merge, creating a
largest bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Byblos Bank and Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce (BLC) signed
on the merger agreement and thus the largest banking group in
Lebanon and one of the leading financial institutions in the
region is created," said a statement issued jointly by the two
banks.
</P>
<P>
The combined bank will operate under the name of Byblos and
become Lebanon's largest bank in terms of deposits which are
estimated at 360 million U.S. dollars, assets which reach 4.4
billion dollars, in addition to market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
The new Byblos Bank will also have the country's largest
network of branches, 82 in Lebanon and eight abroad.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be carried out after the Abou Jaoude family,
which owns 53 percent stake of the BLC, sold their shares to
Byblos for around 110 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BLC, which is valued at 215 million dollars, will be
represented by two seats of the 12-member board of the new entity,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Francois Bassil, president of the Byblos, said at a news
conference after the signing ceremony that the tie-up will make
the bank play a more efficient role in the country and the region
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He added that the merger will also enable the bank to serve
every Lebanese family, small- and medium-sized companies across
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanon's law, the merger still needs the
ratification of general assemblies of the both banks and the
Central Bank which has been encouraging Lebanon's 70 banks to
consolidate.
</P>
<P>
The BLC, founded in 1949 by Abou Jaoude family, has a branch in
Paris and four in the United Arab Emirates in addition to 35 in
Lebanon. Its total assets at the end of last year stood at 930
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
With total assets of 3.46 billion dollars and 55 branches,
Byblos Bank is known for its retail banking such as housing loans
and credit cards.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Sector Workers Win Pay Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- More than a million public
sector workers won above inflation pay rises in the government's
public sector pay awards Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nurses were awarded a rise of 4.7 percent across the board --
inflation stands at 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But some workers did far better than others. The minimum
starting salary for nurses will jump by 12 percent to 14,400
pounds (23,700 U.S. dollars) from 1 April.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet approved pay awards for the 1.3 million public
sector employees, including teachers, doctors and judges, last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a written Commons answer, Prime Minister Tony Blair said,
"In the Comprehensive Spending Review, the government made it
clear public sector pay settlements would need to be fair,
affordable and consistent with the targets we have set."
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident the new awards were in line with these
criteria and "the government's prudent and disciplined approach to
public spending and its commitment to delivering high-quality
public services and low inflation."
</P>
<P>
The average pay increase for public sector workers in the
spending review is 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the education sector, some primary school head teachers are
receiving up to 9 percent, with secondary heads getting a 6
percent boost.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of People Fleeing Guinea-Bissau's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people are fleeing
the capital of Guinea-Bissau as heavy shelling in Bissau is
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shelling began early Monday morning in the government-held part
of the city and continued through the whole morning, reports
reaching here quoted U.N. World Food Program spokesman Wagdi
Othman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of Bissau's population of 300,000 was fleeing the city
toward port areas and the interior after the rebels announced on
a radio station that they would launch a final attack on the
capital by 1300 gmt Monday, said the spokesman from Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire, from where he was in contact with aid workers in
Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
He said aid workers had reported some civilian casualties in
the fighting with some soldiers of the west African peacekeeping
force of ECOMOG wounded.
</P>
<P>
There are 110 ECOMOG troops, mostly from Togo, in Guinea Bissau
as part of last November's peace accord and hundreds more were due
to arrive this week to replace the Senegalese and Guinean troops
backing President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between dissident army troops and forces loyal to
Vieira has suspended the deployment of ECOMOG troops in the
country while a French navy ship carrying several hundred
peace-keepers to Bissau was forced to stay off shore because of
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord signed in November last year in the Nigerian
capital of Abuja called for the withdrawal of foreign troops, a
peace-keeping ECOMOG deployment, a government of national unity,
and general elections in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion broke out last June because of the dismissal of
top military commander Ansumane Mane, who now is the rebel leader,
for allegedly arms smuggling for separatist fighters in the
southern Senegalese province of Casamance.

<HEADLINE> No Guaranteed Kosovo Peace Talks: UK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Monday that it
had no guarantee the peace talks between the warring Serbs and the
ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo would succeed.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot confirm that the talks which we seek will take place.
Nor can I guarantee that if they take place, they will succeed,"
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement read in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, which
comprises the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and
Russia, summoned the two sides in Kosovo to hold peace talks in
France this week to avert all-out war in the southern Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas, formed by
ethnic Albanians, would not be able to stop the talks by staying
away.
</P>
<P>
He warned Yugoslavia at the same time that NATO was ready to
act if it refused to attend the talks, which will last a maximum
of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that possible air strikes could take place in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Cook made his speech in the parliament two days after he had
delivered the Contact Group's ultimatum to Yugoslav and Kosovo
leaders, which said NATO's threat of action applied to both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said neither side would have to give up its long-term goals
by attending the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to rule out the chances of the province
eventually gaining full independence, which was opposed by both
Belgrade and the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
"Those who want to see an independent Kosovo -- which does not
embrace the Contact Group -- can take this opportunity of creating
democratic structures which would create a political community
within Kosovo which could be ready, if that was the outcome at
some future date, to take that extra step," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Aims at Women's Full Participation in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Two major documents
adopted in China in recent years have far-reaching effects on the
elimination of the various forms of discrimination against women,
according to a Chinese envoy here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the remarks at the 20th session of the Committee on
the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in the
capacity of the head of the Chinese Delegation to the session.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin referred to the Law on the Protection of the
Rights and Interests of Women adopted in 1992 and the Program of
the Development of Chinese Women formulated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The first document defines four principles, namely equality
between men and women, protecting the special interests of women,
gradually improving the social protection of women, and
prohibiting the discrimination against, and maltreatment and
torture of, women.
</P>
<P>
As China's first basic law to protect women, it sets out the
political, cultural, educational, labor and economic rights of
women, as well as their rights on marriage, family and the person.
</P>
<P>
The second document, also the first of its kind, was formulated
after the framework of the Platform for Action of the Fourth World
Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
It is most effective in pushing governments at various levels
to take concrete steps for women's full participation in social
development, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
The CEDAW, formed after the U.N. Convention on the Eliminations
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women adopted in 1979, is
now reviewing China's reports on the progress made in the
implementation of the convention.
</P>
<P>
The reports cover the period from 1989-1995.
</P>
<P>
Since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
on July 1, 1997, the implementation of the convention by the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is put under
consideration by the CEDAW as a part of China's report.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law provides that SAR social, economic and legal
systems differ from those of the mainland, thus the report drafted
by SAR will be introduced separately.
