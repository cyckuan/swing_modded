ANGELS LOSE IN NINTH 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- It went down in the scorebook simply as
a stolen base, but the ninth-inning play enabled the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays to steal a game from the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Johnson's bases-loaded single in the bottom of the ninth
drove in Miguel Cairo from third with the winning run in the Devil
Rays' 2-1 victory before 13,210 Thursday night at Tropicana Field.
But it was Cairo's steal of third moments earlier that set up the
game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays had runners on first and second with nobody out
in the ninth and the game tied at 1. The Angels called for the
``wheel'' play. In anticipation of a bunt attempt, third baseman
Troy Glaus charges the plate while shortstop Benji Gil covers
third.
</P>
<P>
   But when batter Bobby Smith didn't square to bunt, Gil stopped.
Cairo broke for third and beat Gil to the bag. With the potential
winning run now on third, the Angels walked Smith intentionally to
load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Darin Erstad was brought in from left field to give
the Angels five infielders, but Johnson's line drive off Shigetoshi
Hasegawa (5-2) sailed just over Gil's outstretched glove and into
center field.
</P>
<P>
   After the game Gil re-enacted the play in the Angels clubhouse
with coach Alfredo Griffin, a major league shortstop for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play is designed for me to beat the baserunner to third
base if (the batter) squares,'' Gil explained. ``Once he didn't
square, I have to stop as quickly as possible and play the
position. I never thought he was that close to me, I should have at
least two or three steps on him. It wasn't so much that he had me
beat, but that he was inside of me and (catcher) Bengie (Molina)
had no throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my responsibility. It's a funny game. I've never seen
that happen, much less happen to me. If that situation comes up
again, I promise now one will beat me. I don't care who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil's mistake was set up by another Angels mistake earlier in
the inning. With Cairo on first and no outs, Steve Cox hit a slow
chopper to Adam Kennedy at second base. In his haste to turn a
double play, Kennedy bobbled the ball and got nobody. Kennedy
appeared unsure of whether to try to tag Cairo or get the force at
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really sure what I was going to do,'' Kennedy said.
``I was trying to catch the ball first. Once you commit to go get
it, you can't stop. I never had it to commit either way.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss ruined another stellar outing by an Angels starting
pitcher. One night after Brian Cooper threw eight scoreless innings
only to watch the Angels lose in the ninth, Jarrod Washburn gave up
just one run and two hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bubba Trammell's solo homer with one out in the sixth,
the last three Angels starters -- Seth Etherton, Cooper and
Washburn -- had combined for 17 consecutive scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Devil Rays starter Steve Trachsel was just as good. Trachsel
gave up a run in the seventh inning and nothing more, throwing a
complete game. Before Wednesday, the Devil Rays had one complete
game all season. But Albie Lopez threw one Wednesday, and Trachsel
made it back-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of the game, and the story the last two nights, is
we're not swinging the bats,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.
``We're going through a little dry spell and we wasted real good
efforts from the starting pitchers. That's the way it goes. The
hitters have been picking up the pitchers for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   With runs at a premium, the Angels lost one early in the game.
With Darin Erstad on second and two out in the third, Scott Spiezio
singled to right field. Right fielder Jose Guillen made a strong
throw to the plate, but Erstad clearly slid across the plate and
under the tag of catcher John Flaherty. However, homeplate umpire
Mark Wegner called Erstad out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was safe,'' Scioscia said. ``He missed the call. But we
can't hang our hat on a missed call. If we're going to be a
championship club, we have to overcome those breaks. And that was a
break for them.''

WEST NILE TEST MAY SET OFF INSECTICIDE SPRAYING IN QUEENS
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City health officials said on Thursday that
they were preparing to spray insecticide over a broad swath of the
Corona section of Queens next week after tests showed that a
chicken in the area had been infected with the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's
health commissioner, said the spraying in Corona would take place
only if follow-up tests on the chicken confirmed the diagnosis of
West Nile encephalitis, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. The
tests should be completed over the weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If spraying is ordered, officials said, it could begin as early
as Monday night, using trucks that would spray only at night. The
officials said it would not involve either aerial spraying from
helicopters or the insecticide Malathion, both of which provoked
protests when they were used to combat an extensive outbreak of the
virus last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the city would use Resmethrin, marketed under the
brand name Scourge, a substance he described as ``relatively
nontoxic to humans, dogs, cats and other mammals.'' But he urged
people in Corona with asthma or respiratory conditions to stay
indoors when the spraying occurs and to keep their doors closed and
air-conditioners turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Corona chicken provided the first example of the
city's efforts this year ``to identify the possible return of West
Nile virus as early as possible.'' The chicken was part of an early
detection procedure in which 14 small flocks of chickens have been
placed in coops _ providing a form of mosquito bait _ across the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also includes intensive monitoring of dead birds in
the region and the use of millions of tiny fish that eat mosquito
larvae in the city's waste treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   If the chicken from Corona is found to be carrying the West Nile
virus, it will be the first confirmed case in New York City this
year. Last week, the disease was found to have killed three crows
not far from New York City's borders, in Rockland County and in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The city's selection of Resmethrin came after angry protests
last year over the use of Malathion, an insecticide that some
experts had associated with severe health side affects. After its
use by the city, Malathion was subjected to a fresh safety review
by federal environmental officials, who last month said they had
concluded that it was safe for routine use in killing mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, director of the Center for Children's
Health and the Environment at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said
yesterday that Resmethrin was ``much safer than Malathion.'' He
said the city's plan to confine its spraying in Corona to trucks
and avoid aerial spraying would ``greatly reduce the risk of
insecticide drifting into areas beyond its control.''

ON PRO BASKETBALL: AT 21, THE LAKERS' BRYANT IS LIVING HIS DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Kobe Bryant was tracked down in a dark corridor
at the Conseco Fieldhouse Thursday by an admirer who shared an
opinion with the wunderkind guard of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know with that game last night, the way you pulled it out,
you crossed the threshold,'' the man said. ``You know that,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you're right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever invisible barrier exists between the spectacular and
the transcendent, Bryant stepped into another world Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the numbers _ he scored eight of his 28 points in
overtime _ that piggybacked the Lakers to a 120-118 victory over
the Indiana Pacers in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the body language, the way he sneered at Reggie
Miller on the perimeter before blowing past him to the basket. It
was not the way he kept his right wrist cocked in a follow-through
motion after dropping in a 23-foot jump shot with 1 minute 20
seconds left in overtime, a pose reminiscent of Michael Jordan's in
1998, when he nailed the coffin shut on the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the sweet reverse layup off a rebound with 5.9
seconds left that demoralized the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the interview room _ the sweat barely dried and a 3-1
lead in the NBA finals secure _ where Kobe Bryant showed he was 21
going on 40. He understood the moment, carrying the team after
Shaquille O'Neal fouled out with 2:33 left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the game I've been dreaming about, to be honest with
you,'' Bryant said. ``These are the type of situations I dream
about every day. When I was a kid, watching the NBA on TV, I always
wanted to be in a game like this, where you can't stop them from
scoring and they can't stop you. This is what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When exactly was Kobe Bryant a kid? The player who starred in an
NBA heirloom in the heartland looked older and sounded much wiser
than 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome,'' Larry Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe was great,'' Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was so enraptured with Bryant's performance that he
deigned to bestow a nickname on Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Little Brother,'' O'Neal said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has deftly avoided the Jordan comparisons. Of Bryant's
performance on Wednesday, the Lakers' coach said: ``I've seen a lot
of great ones, but, you know, when you compare the fact that I
probably coached, what, 100 games, 110, 115 games with Michael
Jordan, I saw a lot of games above or beyond that level from an
individual performer. But that's not to take anything away from
Kobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Thursday led everyone along on the journey _ from the
cocksure 18-year-old rookie who fired up air balls against the Jazz
in the playoffs to the impetuous, one-on-one All-Star who had
trouble co-existing with O'Neal to the consummate star and
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought the game to me in a different light,'' Bryant said
of Jackson. ``It was more kind of relaxing, going with the flow of
the game, you know, just investigating the floor really.
</P>
<P>
   ``You penetrate. You know that you can get to that spot, so you
say: `O.K, I know I can get there. I'll come back there later. I
might come back there in the fourth quarter.' Little mind games
that you play. That's how he approached it with me. He taught me
very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, after the Lakers were knocked out in the second
round by the San Antonio Spurs, Bryant intimated to several of his
former high school teammates that life in L.A. was not all good.
</P>
<P>
   He and O'Neal were privately feuding _ they engaged in slap
fight before last season _ trying to work out the dynamics of their
relationship on and off the floor. Worse, observers in and out of
the league wondered aloud if Bryant was not more about himself than
the Lakers, whether he could ever get out of his one-on-five
shoe-commercial mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset that we kept losing in the playoffs,'' Bryant
said. ``I was upset with people talking about my game as far as not
being a team player or being great defensively. I just wanted to
make a change. I wanted to make it happen. I wanted to prove, you
know, that what they were saying was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   This season Bryant passed more often, improved his shot
selection and slowed the game down in his mind, picking his spots
rather than attacking the basket on every possession. Now, he and
O'Neal are on the cusp of their first title.
</P>
<P>
   You have to feel for the other poor souls in Bryant's class at
Lower Merion High School outside Philadelphia. At the 10-year
reunion, bank presidents and biophysicists will have to compete
against a fistful of championship rings, unimaginable wealth and a
keen understanding of the world their classmate has attained
without setting foot in a university lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's planning on getting married this summer at 21,'' Jackson
said. ``That seems pretty young in this day and age. Maybe not when
I graduated from college. But I think he's mature beyond his years.
I think he's handling this very well. I think he's grown a lot in
one year. And yet, I see a young man who's still got 13, 14 years
of excellent basketball ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made about Bryant's decision to get engaged _ as
if there was some unwritten rule that an NBA player must have 29
girlfriends in 29 cities before settling down _ that the kid can't
possibly know what he is doing by committing to a 17-year-old high
school senior.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he is already an old soul, who needs neither the bar scene
nor hotel groupies to validate the continued adolescence that
professional sports promotes.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocritical, no, given how fast we want our young stars to grow
up. Whether it is Tiger Woods telling a crude joke or Allen Iverson
paying blind homage to his trouble-making friends from the
neighborhood, we often malign young athletes for transgressions we
made at their age. We give them no grace period to grow up, to
learn to be adults before they take over their companies and
dominate their chosen professions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, here is Bryant, ruining the curve for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   This is what he did after the most 47 scintillating minutes of
his career on Wednesday. Bryant did not celebrate with childhood
friends until the wee hours of the morning. He retreated to his
hotel room, telephoned his fiancee, Vanessa Laine, his mother, Pam,
and father, Joe ``Jellybean'' Bryant, a former NBA player, elevated
his sore ankle that kept him out of Game 3 to reduce the swelling,
and fell asleep. No clubs, no parties. Just a responsible employee,
readying himself for work the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant was 19, cruising through Venice Beach in his
jet-black BMW, he admitted that he liked the music of the Spice
Girls. Now, this could be seen as culture suicide, the end of his
hip-hop icon status. But Bryant liked the idea of young kids
pushing the limits, and we was not afraid to share that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know a single 19-year-old in America who would make such
an admission about the Backstreet Boys today?
</P>
<P>
   Byrant also felt a kinship with Martina Hingis and the Williams
sisters, Venus and Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out there doing the impossible at such a young age,''
he said. ``You can't help but admire that, that they know what they
want that young.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conventional thoughts circulating in the league
was that Bryant had somehow been coaxed by his management into
early marriage; that in order to project a cleaner, corporate image
like Michael the Infallible, he needed to have the appearance of a
family on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we reach for things that aren't there. Closer to the
truth, Kobe Bryant probably went after the girl he dreamed of
marrying with the same passion and zest he went after Game 4. Not
everyone needs their 20s to grow up anymore. The kid knows what he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Now fit him for two rings: one for the wedding and another for
the championship.

ALBANY PASSES BILL ON FALSE ABUSE CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York state Legislature passed a measure
Thursday that would remove the names of hundreds of people who have
been wrongly accused of child abuse from a state registry of
suspected child abusers.
</P>
<P>
   The registry has been in existence since 1973, though the
information it contains is only available to child abuse
investigators, not to the public. It contains the names of about a
million individuals accused of child abuse, as well as the names of
their victims.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the names of suspected abusers were
removed from the registry when the authorities concluded that the
allegations against the suspect were unfounded or determined that
there was not enough evidence to substantiate the claim.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed after the 1995 death of 6-year-old Elisa
Izquierdo. The child was killed by her mother, who had repeatedly
come to the attention of child welfare workers as a result of
allegations of child abuse that were leveled against her.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mother's name was never on the state list, there
was a public outcry resulting from the case, and Gov. George Pataki
and the Legislature changed the registry rules to prevent unfounded
allegations from being expunged until 10 years after the 18th
birthday of the youngest child in the alleged abuser's family.
</P>
<P>
   The measure that was passed Thursday will allow people who were
wrongfully accused to get their names removed from the list when
they provide ``clear and convincing evidence'' of their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, similar proposals have failed because of
disagreements about how much proof would be required to remove a
person's name from the registry. The new law was sponsored by state
Sen. Nick Spano, a Republican, and state Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky, a Democrat, both of Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was passed in the Assembly Thursday morning; the
Senate ratified it Wednesday night. It is expected to be signed
into law by Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky said the new law would balance the needs of
investigators to know as much as they can about a suspect with the
rights of the wrongfully accused who want to protect their names.
``We unintentionally created a new class of victims and we're now
giving them a chance to get out from under a bureaucratic nightmare
that is not of their own making,'' he said. ``I'm only sorry it
took this long to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear precisely how many people currently on the
registry have been wrongfully accused. Brodsky and other experts
estimate that there are at least hundreds. The two houses also
passed a bill that would allow the state's Department of Correction
to grant work-release to women convicted of killing their spouses
or boyfriends, provided that the woman can show that they were
being abused by the person they killed.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Scott Stringer, a Democrat from Manhattan who
sponsored the bill, said there are about 100 such women in state
prisons today. He said the legislation is especially important
since the state's decision to eliminate parole has meant that these
women have no choice but to serve their whole sentences just like
other convicted killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of tough-on-crime legislation, this is one of the
few times we've moved in the direction of mercy,'' Stringer said.
``These women deserve a second chance at life, at rejoining their
families. There's basically no recidivism among women like this.''

INTERNET GAMBLING BILL HITS SNAG IN HOUSE COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional effort to ban Internet gambling ran
into a roadblock Thursday as a House committee questioned whether
the bill had already been hijacked by gaming interests.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, a version of which passed the Senate by
unanimous consent last November, would ban Internet gambling,
except for horse racing, dog racing, jai alai (a game popular in
Florida), ``fantasy sports'' and some Indian gaming. According to
some surveys, online gambling is growing explosively and is
expected to reach an estimated $2.3 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and
Trade questioned the exceptions, wondering if by allowing certain
types of betting, the bill might actually expand Internet gambling,
as the Justice Department contends.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy also highlighted the rising difficulties
Congress faces in grappling with the broader issue of whether and
how to attempt to regulate the Internet, a decentralized medium
that by its nature evades control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has serious implications for electronic commerce and the
whole issue of regulating the Internet,'' said Rep. Anna Eshoo, a
Palo Alto, Calif., Democrat and one of congress's leading sponsors
of high-tech legislation. The bill is attempting, she argued, ``to
put artificial boundaries on the Internet, when the Internet was
designed specifically to transcend boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo said the legislation was full of loopholes and could
threaten privacy and civil liberties and put an ``inappropriate
burden'' on the high-tech industry by forcing Internet service
providers to block online gambling sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican pushing the
legislation, insisted that one of the reasons the Internet ``has
not reached its true potential'' is that ``many folks view it as a
wild frontier, with no safeguards to protect children'' and prevent
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the Internet to ``penetrate every home and
community across the globe,'' Goodlatte argued, poses ``a challenge
to the sovereignty of civilized communities, states and nations to
decide what is appropriate and decent behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Interstate gambling is already outlawed under as many as five
federal statutes, primarily one covering gambling over ``wire
communications.'' But the bill's supporters said the federal ban
needs to be strengthened to cover non-wire Internet transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte maintained that the exemption for online horse and dog
race betting was necessary because some states already permit such
betting on ``closed-loop, subscriber-based systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte also said his bill would prevent states from putting
their lotteries online, by requiring that such lotteries only sell
tickets in public places. No state has yet offered an online
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   But critics charge that the measure was shaped by powerful
interest groups, from the pari-mutuel horse racing industry to
convenience stores that see the Internet as a threat to state
lottery ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major lobbies pushing for the legislation is the
casino industry, which similarly views online betting as potential
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the congressionally charged National Gambling Impact
Study Commission predicted that online wagering ``promises to
revolutionize the way Americans gamble because it opens up the
possibility of immediate, individual, 24-hour access to the full
range of gambling in every home.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that one web site, ``Rolling Good Times''
provides links to 1,000 Internet sites that offer some form of
betting, including 110 sports betting sites.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte argued that online gambling posed a threat to children
and families, citing stories of people betting their families into
financial ruin over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association and religious groups, including the Christian Coalition
and the Family Research Council. But the Traditional Values
Coalition withdrew its support arguing that the bill would actually
expand gambling through its various exemptions.

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH - ``The back is fine,'' Hal Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Golf's aging comeback kid couldn't say the same of his back nine
Thursday, plummeting from the lead he had forged with the help of
the first opening-hole eagle at a U.S. Open in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to take a lot of medicine coming in,'' said Sutton, who
couldn't stay out of the club-twisting rough at Pebble Beach Golf
Links and bunched a double bogey and two bogeys in his final four
holes.
</P>
<P>
   The staggering finish left Sutton at 2-under-par 69 and four
strokes off the lead after he had moved to 6-under par with
consecutive birdies on Nos. 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical U.S. Open golf course,'' the Shreveport, La.,
native said. ``You hit it in the rough, you're gonna pay a price.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was just golf's way of evening things out.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton has been sizzling lately, no small feat for a 42-year-old
man who appeared washed up in 1993. Ten years after after upsetting
Jack Nicklaus to win the '83 PGA Championship at Riviera Country
Club, Sutton had slumped to 185th on the money list and needed his
final exemption to remain on tour.
</P>
<P>
   He somehow rediscovered his game in '94 and hasn't slowed since.
The revived Sutton has won six times including the 1998 Tour
Championship and this year's Players Championship
</P>
<P>
   and was both inspirational and playing leader on last year's
winning U.S. Ryder Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing slowing Sutton's progress has been nagging
injuries, the latest of which struck him Monday, when his back hurt
so much he couldn't swing a club.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, all he needed was tincture of time.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton rested Tuesday, tested the back Wednesday, then opened
his Open with an eagle on the par-4, 381-yard first hole, finding
the cup with a punched 8-iron from 146 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kinda eased up there and went right in,'' said Sutton,
whose opening eagle was the first since Deane Beman holed a 4-wood
from 230 yards in the 1967 Open at Baltusrol.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, long known for his strong driving and accurate iron
play, has added patience to his power during a comeback that
rekindled memories of his 1980s label as the next Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not quite as much of a risk-taker now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Solid, if less-spectacular play has paid dividends, particularly
at this year's Players Championship. There, Sutton's steady
shotmaking kept him narrowly in front of runner-up Tiger Woods
throughout a tense final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that was the highlight of my career,'' he said,
``winning at that tournament and certainly winning against Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sutton can muster up the kind of play he had going for 14
holes Thursday (six birdies, one bogey), he might find himself
pushing for another career highlight this week.
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach rough could foul the plan. But the injury-forced
lack of practice won't slow Sutton much if recent history is any
indication: He played just nine practice holes before defeating
Woods at the Players Championship.

   WASHINGTON _ Personal wealth and power do not necessarily
correspond on Capitol Hill, with some of the leading members of
Congress holding few assets and avoiding the booming stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, took the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader and a former
college professor, has no assets beyond a checking account. He
supplements his income of $151,800 with an annual teacher's pension
of less than $2,500, according to House personal financial
disclosures released Thursday. (Other lower ranking members make an
annual salary of $136,700.)
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, earned a salary of
$175,400 for 1999. He reported assets from investments and real
estate, but also had considerable liabilities. Hastert listed
property, including a 270-acre farm in Shipman, Ill., a town house
in Washington and an opera house in Plainfield, Ill. The building,
which he now rents out, once housed a theater and his father's
restaurant. Hastert valued the farm and opera house at $100,001 to
$250,000; rental income from the farm and opera house, he said, was
$15,001 to $50,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   He is paying mortgages on the property. And he signed loans for
home repair, and co-signed several loans with family members.
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, reported a
mutual fund worth $15,001 to $50,000, with several other
investments of less than $15,000. But the cost of education
countered his assets. Gephardt, who earned $151,800 in salary, owed
$50,001 to $100,000 on one student loan, and $15,001 to $50,000 on
another. He also borrowed $15,001 to $50,000 on his life insurance
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, and the House's
third-ranking Republican, valued his Exxon stock at $50,001 to
$100,000 and reported a bank account of $1,001 to $15,000. He has
no significant debt.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, members of Congress have been required
each year to file broad financial disclosure reports that reveal
that they do not have holdings that might pose a conflict of
interest. The rules permit the members to provide a rough snapshot
of their assets and debts.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., was very active in the stock market last year, buying and
selling technology stocks. He made more than 100 stock transactions
last year, sometimes buying and selling stocks on the same day.
Torricelli's stock holdings were valued from $260,000 to $775,000,
for technology companies like Amazon.com and CompUSA Inc., the
computer retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Torricelli bought $1,001 to $15,000 worth of the
DrKoop.com stock on Aug. 5 and sold it the same day. He listed a
purchase of the same amount of Novell stock on Aug. 10 and sold it
the next day. And on Aug. 11, Torricelli bought $15,001 to $50,000
worth of AmeriTrade stock and sold it on Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., reported $250,000 from the
Heinz family foundation for the 1998 Heinz Award in Public Policy.
Moynihan, who is retiring, received a special exemption from the
Senate Ethics Committee allowing him to accept a gift worth $50 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is a former investment banker,
reported assets of $1 million to $5 million and $500,000 to $1
million in two Merrill Lynch accounts. He also listed $100,001 to
$250,000 in a Longview Capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, John Rockefeller IV, D-W Va., reported three
blind trusts worth more than $80 million. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill.,
listed stock he owns in the Bank of Montreal that he inherited from
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Not all members of the Senate were drawn to the stock market.
Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., reported two credit union accounts
of less than $1,000, and at least $15,000 of debt owed to
Mastercard. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., held a Senate credit union
savings account of $1,001 to $15,000 and property in his home state
worth $200,001 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's disclosure statements, which were made public on
Wednesday, were not without some quirky details. Sen. John Breaux,
D-La.,, won $5,625 in prize money at a charity tennis tournament on
Long Island. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, received $241.68 for a
brief appearance on the CBS television series ``Walker, Texas
Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, earned composing income of $6,125 from Prime Recordings
Inc. of Provo, Utah, and royalties of $12,048. Hatch, who has
written lyrics for hundreds of songs, and has produced or
co-produced seven CDs, says on his Web site that his music focuses
on ``family, faith and love of country.'' He reported $500 of
royalties from MTV, the music television network.

WOODS OPENS WITH FLAWLESS 65 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The first round of the 100th U.S. Open
turned into a pillow fight Thursday. The guy in the striped pajamas
was the winner. Not everyone went to bed, either.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed by atmospheric conditions and out-of-this-world
expectations, the Open office-pool pick, Tiger Woods, emerged from
the fog with a flawless effort at Pebble Beach Golf Links, shooting
six-under-par 65 to lead by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Play was stopped because of the low-hanging clouds that obscured
vision and left 75 golfers on the course. Because so many rounds
went unfinished, the Open could be pushed into Monday, or even
Tuesday with a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   They might as well give Woods the silver cup now. Why anyone
would want to go three-plus more rounds with this guy defies
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Woods hit four shots inside two feet. He hit irons off the tee
and a driver off the fairway. He waded through the thick haze
buffeting the Monterey Peninsula, rough steeper than U.S. Open
tradition and the world's best players _ and he didn't bogey.
</P>
<P>
   He was so good, in fact, that his 65, coming on the heels of his
final-round 64 at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro Am, was the
lowest U.S. Open score recorded on this regal oceanside track.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining himself, Woods was almost smug about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt if I could drive the ball well I could score,'' he
said. ``I drove the ball beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Fog suspended play at 3:56 p.m., but hardly anyone noticed.
Woods had finished playing three hours earlier. He came away one
shot ahead of Spaniard Miguel Angel Jiminez, two in front of
journeyman John Huston and three better than moonlighting CBS golf
analyst Bobby Clampett.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was unflappable on a day when he had every reason to be
distracted.
</P>
<P>
   Fans called his name from an oversized yacht as he walked the
front nine. Boaters honked at him on the back nine. San Francisco
FBI agents and Monterey County sheriff's deputies walked all 18
holes with him, on the watch for overzealous fans. The caddy he
fired, Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan, was in Woods' group, carrying Jim
Furyk's clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was that shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Not his _ Jesper Parnevik's bright-orange madness. The Swedish
golfer was dressed so garishly, fans joked that he must be
considering a career change _ maybe a jockey _ or was headed for
the disco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was noticeable out there,'' Woods said, grinning. ``You
could see him in the fog. He was our beacon so nobody could hit
into us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a more conventional black Nike shirt with red and white
stripes, Woods was dressed immaculately. He played that way as
well.
</P>
<P>
   He tapped in for his first birdie on the 331-yard fourth hole
and drained a 20-foot putt for another on the par-3 seventh. He
birdied the 10th, rolling in a 15-footer, and the 13th, 14th and
18th with more tap-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't make a mistake until the 11th hole, when he sent
his tee shot sailing deep into the right rough. It was his first
missed fairway. He took it personally, muttering, ``Damn it,'' and
thumping his club on the ground before uttering another expletive.
</P>
<P>
   He composed himself and recovered nicely, slashing his ball out
of the thick stuff and near the green with what he called his
``shot of the day'' for another par-saver.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also rebounded on the par-3 17th. His tee shot to a back
pin went long and his chip shot coming back skipped 12 feet past.
But he found the cup with another putt.
</P>
<P>
   He had people talking excitedly when he pulled out his driver
for his second shot on the par-5 14th, 257 yards from the front
edge. He missed the green to the left. He only wanted to get close,
maybe land in a bunker, certain the power of his big club would
leave him with a good lie. He chipped close and birdied.
</P>
<P>
   Woods called this his second-best Open round, surpassed only by
a 69 he shot as an amateur after a first-day 76 in the 1996 event
at Oakland Hills near Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In the press tent, the only issue that golf's great one had to
answer for was skipping Payne Stewart's greenside tribute the day
before. He didn't dodge it. Woods said he needed to prepare for the
Open. He had been to enough memorials. He had moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I handle things a little differently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving his way through the fog, Woods reaffirmed as much.

LAKERS LOOK TO END L.A.'S TITLE DROUGHT TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL, LISA VAN PROYEN AND RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just one win away from Los Angeles' first national
championship in 12 years, the city has gone wild about the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Instant fans are everywhere - at water coolers, schoolyards,
neighborhood bars, even at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight could be the night when the drought ends. The Lakers, up
3-1 after Wednesday night's thrilling overtime win over the Pacers,
play for the NBA title in Indianapolis at 6 p.m. Or maybe it will
be back home at Staples Center on Monday night or Wednesday night
or ... don't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   The town is in a tizzy like it hasn't been since Ronald Reagan
was president and the Lakers and Dodgers both took home world
championships. The excitement creates a moral dilemma for those who
must work tonight like Rabbi Steven Jacobs of Temple Kol Tikvah in
Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will be in temple,'' Jacobs said Thursday. ``My heart
is with the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no divided loyalty at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday:
Laker-mania was in full effect.
</P>
<P>
   Rhiannon Talley attended the game between the Dodgers and the
first place Arizona Diamondbacks with her fiance. She said the
Dodgers game felt like, well, a Lakers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everybody in the stands was glued to portable
TVs,'' said Talley. ``Everybody was screaming and there was nothing
happening on the field. During the seventh-inning stretch everybody
ran to the TVs in the smoking areas. They were yelling and
screaming over the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was madness.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was just as boisterous at the Rich Man, Pour Man's Bar
and Lounge in Panorama City.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, patrons and employees still were cheering on their
home team - a day after the Lakers and Pacers kept them on the edge
of their seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lakers, Lakers,'' a few women hollered out, before giving a
high-five and reflecting on Wednesday night's pivotal moment:
Reggie Miller's three-point shot at the buzzer that fell just
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Are they going to make the shot or not?' It was
too close for comfort,'' said Lisa Hersom, who ordinarily is not
interested in the game of basketball, but admits, ``The adrenaline
was up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was hyped up about the game. I don't even like
basketball, but it was nerve-racking to watch them go into overtime
and it was so close. It was a good game,'' Hersom said.
</P>
<P>
   Hersom isn't the only recent addition to the Lakers bandwagon.
In fact, it's hard to find any Angelenos not rooting for the Purple
and Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sociological thing,'' said Stan J. Katz, a clinical
psychologist in Beverly Hills. ``People tend to get excited when
other people get excited. It's nice to have something that all
colors and creeds can get together and be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 12,000 people will get together at Staples Center tonight
to watch the Lakers play - only the Lakers won't be there. The game
at Conseco Fieldhouse will be televised on giant TV screens at
Staples.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the virtual-live event were gobbled up in less than
10 minutes Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Police will add patrols around Staples Center tonight, but say
they expect more euphoria than mayhem. A few officers may even get
caught up in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the Lakers,'' said Los Angeles Police Department Capt.
Sharyn Buck. ``When they win this thing, we're going to be out
there in a ticker-tape parade.''
</P>
<P>
   So will a lot of people. City officials, expecting the Lakers to
restore sportsman-like honor to Los Angeles and unafraid of the
``Curse of Celebrating Early,'' have planned a victory parade
through downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers win tonight, plans call for the parade Monday. If
the Lakers clinch the championship on Monday, the parade will be
Wednesday. And if victory doesn't come until the seventh game, the
parade will be next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever day it occurs, the parade will start at 11 a.m. at the
Department of Water and Power Building on Hope Street with a brief
ceremony. Players in double-deck buses or other vehicles will start
on First Street, go down a ramp to Figueroa Street and down that to
Staples Center at 11th Street and Figueroa, where the big
celebration will be held outside the arena in parking lots 2 and 3,
which can accommodate 90,000 people. Jumbotrons also will be set
up.
</P>
<P>
   As a Lakers fan, Mike Anello hopes to see the trophy tonight.
But as manager of Yankee Doodles in Woodland Hills, a seven-game
series wouldn't exactly hurt business at his sports bar/restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked the Lakers, even when they were stinking way
back when,'' Anello said. ``If I get a chance to watch - I'll be
really inundated - I'll stop by and check out the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey, a big
Lakers fan, said the department is hoping for a quiet night.
Usually they answer 40 calls every hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we're not permitted to listen to civilian radio
during our calls,'' he said. ``And the Fire Department dispatch
radio does not hold a candle to Chick Hearn's play by play.''

WIN OR LOSE, BIRD'S TIME NEARS AN END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It could happen as soon as Friday night. It
definitely will conclude after a possible seventh game Wednesday in
L.A.
</P>
<P>
   As the end of Larry Bird's NBA coaching career approaches, the
retrospectives, replete with soft background music, are leaving
Hoosiers morose.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the man himself sees it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I want to keep it going (to Wednesday). I have
nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pressroom laughter subsided, the thought occurred that
the only man in the house unsloppy about Bird's retirement from his
second career was Larry Joe himself.
</P>
<P>
   That would include players, reporters and the NBA. Something
about his standards, his candor and his Mohave-dry wit have again
endeared him to a hoops nation that was barely getting over his
retirement as a player.
</P>
<P>
   The forum of the NBA Finals, where his Pacers in Game 5 try to
climb out of a 1-3 ditch dug for them by the Lakers, has brought
home how unexpectedly successful was his tenure, and how
unexpectedly abrupt is his imminent departure.
</P>
<P>
   When he succeeded Larry Brown in May 1997, with no previous
experience, the sport's wise guys recoiled, figuring he was doomed
to spoil his legend by doing what most superstars do who turn to
coaching _ fail.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Pacers made three consecutive Eastern Conference
finals as well as _ for the first time in franchise history _ the
NBA championship round. Yet despite the success, he is sticking
hard to a commitment that might be referred to in Seattle as a
traditional Seahawks offense:
</P>
<P>
   Three and out.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, that means years.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bird, 43, has been vague, Pacers guard Mark Jackson was
asked to explain how someone so successful and driven could pack up
his ego and go bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't,'' Jackson said. ``I don't think anybody can. I
respect the fact that he made a decision from day one and then
stuck to it, where a lot of people probably wouldn't have.
Especially after they get a taste of what has been accomplished
this year. So I respect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, he's a different breed.''
</P>
<P>
   A different breed? That only hints at the distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   As the first coach in Finals history who's already made
basketball's Hall of Fame (another 17 coaches eventually made it to
a Springfield enshrinement), Bird brought magnum prestige and
almost no Xs-and-Os formality to the Pacers position.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he assemble an entourage of assistants that make the
bench look like a law firm's Monday meeting on billable hours. He
has two, Dick Harter and Rick Carlisle, to whom he freely gives all
responsibility and credit for offensive and defensive strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Bird hasn't been the perfect coach _ Bird-bashers will refer to
his use of Travis Best and Sam Perkins instead of starters Jackson
and Rik Smits in the final minutes of Wednesday's epic Game 4
defeat _ but he has been the perfect antidote for these basketball
times.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seems that star players, using their
multimillion-dollar guaranteed contracts as cudgels, are beating
their teams and the game to death, Bird has stepped in with
honesty, directness and wisdom and revived the position of field
general _ an intimate, intimidating leader of his troops.
</P>
<P>
   At least a part of the success is right place, right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in Indiana, man _ he does no wrong here,'' said Perkins,
laughing. ``He can spit, he can jaywalk, he probably can get into a
car accident and it won't be his fault. And he also coached here
because he had a pretty good nucleus of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Perkins is quick to point out that Bird won over his players
not just because of his r &UR; gfacute &LR; esum &UR; gfacute &LR; e and birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike all the other coaches I've played for, he doesn't try
to sugar-coat,'' he said. ``He'll joke with you when it's not
basketball-related, but other than that, he's straight. He comes in
with a plan that isn't much on paper, but it's real to-the-point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man who's so well respected, players do listen, even
younger players.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this series, as well as his coaching career, Bird has
been as blunt as the front end of his pickup truck when it comes to
assessing his players.
</P>
<P>
   He has said after Finals games that ``Jalen Rose didn't show up
tonight,'' that Smits ``isn't getting the job done,'' that Reggie
Miller ``wastes his energy on officials'' and of his point guards,
``We'd be a lot better if they were more consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   On many other teams, such public criticism would be grounds for
revolt. But since he's usually right, and since he says the same
things to players in private, they recognize the words are honest
and without a political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches have favoritism, and when guys see that, they
hate it,'' said Perkins, who could well be speaking of his Sonics
experiences. ``Some guys who (benefit) don't even like it, because
they get teased afterwards: `He's your daddy,' stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're better off treating everybody the same. Even
veterans appreciate that. No nonsense. Nobody's in anybody's
pocket, trying to schmoose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats everybody the same. Coaches around the league try to
do that, but not everybody does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird is in a small class of coaches _ which most prominently
includes his Finals rival, Phil Jackson, along with Utah's Jerry
Sloan and Miami's Pat Riley _ who recognize the primacy of players
in the NBA game but also can maintain control through force of
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked the player-first demeanor that coach Bird
has taken into this game, understanding that players are what make
coaches,'' Jackson said Thursday. ``Players have to be promoted.
Coaching is an important job that goes along with it, but it's the
players that you've got to get playing for you, and together.''
</P>
<P>
   As for himself and his departure from the sidelines, Bird will
acknowledge the difference in competitive zeal between him and
today's players has taken a predictable toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get frustrated sometimes when I don't get the effort that I
want in practice and in the games,'' he said. ``But you have to
learn to deal with it, and over the course of the three years, I
think I improved immensely. I feel I've been very patient with
these guys. You have to be. This has been my best year as far as
watching younger guys develop. I've enjoyed it. It's been a hell of
an experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want it to end next Wednesday. I want these guys to have
the opportunity to play for the world championship in the seventh
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are in a strong position to deny him the opportunity.
But there's always been more talented opponents in the way of the
pasty country boy with no hops and, later, not enough coaching
smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the man has nothing else to do _ except the only thing
he's ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Win.

WHTE SOX, AIDED BY 3 THROWING ERRORS, CRUSH YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everybody has a breaking point, Chuck Knoblauch said
last month after his throwing jitters resurfaced, and the New York
Yankees' second baseman apparently reached his after his problems
erupted worse than ever on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing away three balls in the first six innings of
Thursday night's 12-3 loss to the Chicago White Sox, Knoblauch left
the game. Then he left Yankee Stadium, as well, walking out in his
street clothes while the game was still in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch said last month that he had two possible career paths.
Either he would solve his throwing problems, or he would ``take it
to the house'' _ as in quit baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Yankees Manager Joe Torre said that Knoblauch came to
him and was ``pretty low.'' Torre said he told Knoblauch that he
was taking him out and to leave the park to avoid the reporters who
would be waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, shortly after Knoblauch made his third
error of the night, the Yankees made a pitching change. While the
rest of the infielders gathered at the mound and three outfielders
met in center field, Knoblauch stood alone at second base, his
hands on his hips, his frustration apparent in his expression. The
inning ended on a ground ball to shortstop Derek Jeter, Knoblauch
circling behind first base to back up the play, as he has done so
many times in his 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Knoblauch had left the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who turns 32 next month, has the rest of this season
and next season on his current contract, at $6 million a year.
Shortly after the Yankees traded for him in February 1998, an
agreement _ never announced _ was made to pay him $9 million
annually for the 2002 and 2003 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has played in four All-Star Games, collected 1,584
career hits and ranked among the game's best leadoff hitters since
he broke into the majors in 1991, successes he has reminded himself
of constantly since he began having throwing trouble in 1998. But
Knoblauch has eight throwing errors in his last 21 games, and 12
errors over all this season.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch made several nice plays in games against Boston on
Tuesday and Wednesday. But his throwing problem errupted fully on
Thursday night, only one inning after he made a nice scoop and
throw on a grounder hit by Herbert Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the third inning, Ray Durham smacked a grounder
directly at Knoblauch, who fielded it easily before stepping and
throwing to first base. All season long, Knoblauch has tried to
throw the ball harder, rather than loop it tentatively. But this
throw was far to the left of the first baseman Tino Martinez, who
came off the bag to catch the ball, and he was unable to tag Durham
passing by. There was a burst of murmurs and jeers, and some booing
when Knoblauch ran off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Paul Konerko was on third with two outs when
Carlos Lee grounded to Knoblauch. It was another easy play, but
Knoblauch again threw wide of Martinez, pulling him off the base.
The boos in the Stadium crowd were louder this time, and they
continued when Knoblauch led off the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The error that drove him from the field occurred the next
inning. With runners at first and second, Frank Thomas hit a
routine double-play grounder at Jeter, and the shortstop shoveled
the ball to Knoblauch. With the runner closing on him _ but not
enough to really impede the throw _ Knoblauch fired far to
Martinez's right, eluding the dive of the first baseman. The ball
got away and the runner who had been at second, Ray Durham, raced
around third, to a torrent of boos.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch made a terrible throwing error against the White Sox
May 24, and after that game he suggested he would quit baseball if
he couldn't conquer the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need this,'' Knoblauch said at the time. ``I'm not out
here for the money. I'm out here to have fun. I don't need the
money. I don't need this. The money is not keeping me here. The
competitiveness is keeping me here. I mean, I know I can play. This
isn't about money at all, it's never been about the money. But
everybody has a breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was asked at the time if he was close to the breaking
point. ``Pretty close,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't need the frustration,'' said Knoblauch, a
Gold Glove winner in 1997, who made 26 errors last season and is on
a pace to make about that many again this year. ``I don't need it.
I know baseball is a small part of life, but when you're playing
it, it's a big part of life, it's what we do. And if you continue
to not do something well, you can't keep going out there and not
doing it well, because, No. 1, you'll drive yourself crazy, No. 2,
it's not any fun. It's a job, but you're supposed to have fun
playing baseball.''

TIGER LEADS BY ONE AS FOG SHORTENS OPENING ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH - First Hal Sutton's terrific start, then the
entire Pebble Beach Golf Links.
</P>
<P>
   Much faded away in Thursday's fog-suspended opening round of the
100th U.S. Open - but not the primary protagonists of Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   On a day fog halted play with 25 groups on the course,
tournament favorite Tiger Woods and Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez
wound up atop the mist-shrouded scoreboards - Woods a shot ahead
after his lowest round in six U.S. Open appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The world's No. 1-ranked player bunched six birdies into a
bogeyless round of 6-under 65 that got better as visibility got
murkier. His last birdie came on the potentially disastrous par-5
18th in fog so thick Woods' group could barely see their tee-shot
targets or the green on their second shots.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, who lost on the third playoff hole to Woods in last
year's Wold Golf Championships event at Valderrama in Spain,
finished 66 with seven birdies - five on the front nine - and two
bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   They were among only 81 players who completed play Thursday. The
remainder of the 156-man field will resume first-round play today,
starting at 6:45 a.m. Second-round play, originally scheduled to
start at 6:30 today, will get underway about an hour and a half
later.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Jimenez got to sleep in and enjoy rounds that are
their best in this tournament and rank with their best anywhere,
given the difficult course and playing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely one of my better rounds I've played.'' said
Woods, whose previous low in a U.S. Open was 67 at Congressional in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 156 players and all good players,'' said Jimenez, who
had never shot better than 69 in two previous U.S. Opens. ``I like
to be in this position.'' Pre-fog starter and finisher Sutton would
have liked it too, had he not got stuck in Pebble Beach's thick
rough coming down the stretch, when his 6-under score dipped to
2-under 69 in his final five holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Sutton, who held a two-stroke lead
before taking a double bogey on No.14 and bogeys on 16 and 18. ``I
played pretty well. Hit a couple of shots that I paid the price
for.'' He wound up sharing fifth with Angel Cabrera of Argentina,
both a stroke back of CBS commentator Bobby Clampett, a qualifier
who grew up in nearby Monterey. Clampett, who has played often at
Pebble Beach, used course familiarity to record four birdies in the
first 10 holes of his round of 68.
</P>
<P>
   John Huston, another early starter, held third place alone at 67
on a leaderboard that might have included several others had play
not been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo, 1995 U.S. Open winner
Corey Pavin and Kirk Triplett - winner in this year's Nissan Open
at Riviera were all 4 under after 13 holes. Loren Roberts was 3
under through seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   Before the murky conditions left 75 players waiting for two and
a half hours, then sent them home, Woods trudged toward his
improbable birdie on 18th aided by a foglight of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik, playing in the same group, was wearing an
orange shirt so bright it lit up the threesome, if not the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see him in the fog, that's for sure,'' Woods said.
``He's our beacon. No one would hit into us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clampett, thrilled as he was by his round, started early and
didn't face any fog but probably wished he could have seen more
putts drop. He missed four birdie attempts within 15 feet and had a
20-foot par attempt lip out on No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the 40-year-old commentator was hardly about to complain
after needing the right television schedule, then surviving a
first-stage qualifier playoff, then an agonizing wait as fourth
alternate just to get to Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Had CBS been broadcasting this year's U.S. Open instead of NBC,
or had his network not been broadcasting the Kemper Insurance Open
near his sectional qualifying site, Clampett never would have
participated in this memorable homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a gift from God just even being here and playing in
this championship,'' he said. ``And then to play as well as I did
today, especially the first 10 holes, it was almost like playing
golf in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Huston also dodged the fog with his early start but got wind,
especially on Nos.17 and 18. He survived those for par and offset
three bogeys with seven birdies on a day he said he got many
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I was in the rough today, I had a good lie,'' said
the man who holds the PGA Tour 72-hole scoring record of 28 under
par. ``So certainly, I was fortunate.''

IN SURPRISE SHUFFLE, GORE NAMES DALEY TO HEAD CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ In another major shakeup at the top of his
presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore announced Thursday
that Commerce Secretary William Daley will replace campaign
chairman Tony Coelho, who abruptly resigned, citing health
concerns.
<P>
   Daley, son of legendary Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and
brother of the city's current mayor, joined Gore at a campaign stop
in Cincinnati late Thursday and is expected to step down from his
cabinet post July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has been a loyal soldier for President Clinton and Gore
since 1992, when he ran their Illinois campaign. He also was the
point man in the administration's push to pass the North American
Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and more recently, to secure
permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to miss a beat,'' insisted Gore, even as labor
leaders who had battled Daley on the free trade accords expressed
dismay with the selection.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he offered the 51-year-old Commerce secretary the job
late Wednesday night, but had not informed Clinton until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took his Cabinet secretary before I told him,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he called Clinton to inform him of the development on
his way to the airport to catch up with Gore. There was no word
from the White House on who might replace Daley as Commerce
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup comes less than five months before election day, and
with Gore, the Democratic candidate, trailing Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, by 5 to 10 points in most
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's recent lackluster performance on the stump and in public
opinion match-ups fueled rumors over the past several weeks that
Coelho, a former congressman from California's Central Valley,
might be forced out.
</P>
<P>
   But Coelho, 58, who had been hospitalized since Monday for an
inflamed colon, said Thursday that concern for his health was the
only reason for his departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctors have told me that I need to slow down, eat better
and travel less for a period of time,'' Coelho said in a statement
released by the Gore campaign. ``Unfortunately, none of this advice
is consistent with the rigors of chairing a presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush had speculated earlier this month that Coelho would
go, telling Chris Matthews, host of MSNBC's ``Hardball,'' ``They're
going to dump him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark my words,'' Bush said during a break in the taping of the
show that was nevertheless recorded. ``Oh, they'll dump him. ...
There's no loyalty in those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho joined the Gore team a year ago when the campaign was
viewed as unfocused and losing ground. He is credited with bringing
discipline and order, engineered an early endorsement from the
AFL-CIO and oversaw Gore's commanding defeat of Bill Bradley in the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also carried baggage. He resigned from Congress amid
accusations of wrongdoing in 1989 (Coelho denied any wrongdoing)
and was under investigation for his role as head of the American
exhibit at the 1998 World Exhibition in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is like a Gen. Patton,'' said former White House chief of
staff Leon Panetta, who served with Coelho for years in the House
of Representatives. ``You want to take the hill, he'll take the
hill. ... He may make some mistakes and slap some people around in
the process, but he takes the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans used the opportunity Thursday to chide the Gore
campaign for its instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish (Coelho) well and hope his health improves,'' said
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``I wonder whether naming a new
chairman involves yet another reinvention of the Gore campaign.
Which Vice President Gore will campaign next week?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials said the vice president was stunned by
Coelho's departure and that it had nothing to do with the state of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has been an invaluable friend and adviser,'' Gore said
Thursday. ``I look forward to calling upon Tony's counsel and help
once again just as soon as his doctors give me the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta, echoing many other political observers, said he did not
doubt Coelho resigned due to health concerns, but suggested that
the difficulties of the past several months may have contributed to
the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho was ``obviously having to deal with a lot of incoming
fire, and I think that was part of it,'' Panetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho was admitted to a suburban Washington hospital Monday
night, complaining of stomach pains. He was being treated for
diverticulitis, an inflammation of the colon, and told the
Associated Press that he will undergo tests in hopes of ruling out
cancer in about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho also said he had suffered three epileptic seizures this
year, and doctors had told him he needed to lessen his workload or,
better yet, quit the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Daley is a highly regarded inside player who is well connected
in the Democratic Party and carries less controversy than Coelho.
He was chairman of the 1996 Democratic National Convention in his
hometown of Chicago, and was thought to be front-runner to become
Clinton's first secretary of transportation, a job that went to
then-Denver Mayor Federico Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Daley goes on `Face the Nation' or `Meet the Press,' the
questions are going to be about the Gore campaign, not about him,''
Panetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Daley succeeded Ron Brown, who died in a plane crash in the
Balkans, as commerce secretary in 1997. The announcement of his
appointment was memorable for his fainting and stumbling off the
stage into a row of reporters at the Old Executive Office Building
in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore reportedly offered Daley the job of campaign chairman a
year ago, but Daley said he was not ready to leave the Commerce
Department. Gore said it was Daley who recommended Coelho for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO president who muscled through an early
labor-federation endorsement for Gore, issued a surprisingly biting
statement. Daley's stewardship of NAFTA and the China trade bill
``put him squarely on the opposite side of working families,''
Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Caldwell, a spokesman for the Teamsters union, called the
appointment a ``slap in the face of labor'' that would not help
Gore win the union's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, who made a good living as an investment banker after
leaving Congress, drew no salary from the Gore campaign and will
continue to offer his advice informally, aides said. Daley,
however, will be given a salary, Gore said.

 STATE SENATE BUDGET SPENDS BIG ON SCHOOLS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The state Senate approved a $95 billion budget
Thursday that sharply increases public school spending and gives
taxpayers $2.7 billion in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by the state's red-hot economy, lawmakers had a record
$12.3 billion more dollars to spend than anticipated in January
when the budget process began.
</P>
<P>
   And spend it they did, increasing the budget by more than $15
billion over last year.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the new money was spent on public schools, tax
cuts and transportation, other areas of state government also were
lavished with income.
</P>
<P>
   University of California funding rose 18.5 percent over last
year. Money for the California State University system rose by 13
percent, community colleges by more than 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than $575 million was earmarked to make rental housing and
home ownership more affordable. Another $5.8 billion was slated for
projects paid for by park and water bonds approved by voters in
March.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers worried that the heavy surplus spending was
shortsighted or wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This document and work product could have been an
extraordinary long-lasting legacy. We didn't do that. That's
unfortunate,'' said Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the
special committee that cobbled together the budget. ``I doubt we
will be judged well by history.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents took an even dimmer view, portraying the
budget as an orgy of pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget is nothing more than a spending spree,'' said Sen.
Ray Haynes, R-Riverside. ``The swill generated by the pigs of big
government is the byproduct generated by this budget. The people of
this great state will pay a price for our irresponsible behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Gray Davis praised the spending plan, saying it
reflected the priorities he outlined in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great believer there should be something for everyone in
the budget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is required to approve a budget by midnight June
15, a deadline routinely missed. The Senate met the deadline last
year, but the Assembly did not.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly appeared headed that direction again Thursday with
most of the day spent in closed-door meetings and no action taken
on the budget by early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The plan proposed by the Democratic governor wanted the state's
windfall spent mainly on three things -- education, tax cuts and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The budget approved by the 40-member Senate on a bipartisan
31-to-9 vote largely does that.
</P>
<P>
   But it comes at the expense of cities and counties, who had
billions in property tax revenue taken by the state during the
recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $12.3 billion in unexpected cash, $200 million is
earmarked for fiscal relief of local government.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are the biggest winner in the Senate's budget.
</P>
<P>
   About $30.6 billion is spent on public schools, including $1.8
billion that districts can spend on what they wish, including pay
increases for teachers or other staff.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative budget writers estimate per-pupil spending will rise
by 11 percent over last year to $6,716 -- an additional $691 per
pupil over last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers did part ways with Davis on several key education
spending proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wanted teachers to be exempt from state income taxes, an
idea lawmakers said discriminated against other worthwhile
vocations and cut into the state revenue given to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Legislature gave teachers tax credits that increase
based on experience. A teacher with four or five years experience
would get a credit of $250. A teacher with 20 or more years
experience would receive $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's budget also spends more on child care, summer
school and after-school programs than Davis'. And it includes $425
million in one-time block grants schools can spend on anything they
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our budget reflects a desire to see districts have more
flexibility to meet their local needs,'' said Sen. Dede Alpert,
D-San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Davis got the amount of tax cuts he asked for -- $2.7 billion --
but in a far different form than he proposed.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to give individual taxpayers a $150 one-time rebate
check, double that for couples.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators rejected that as benefiting mainly the state's more
affluent residents.
</P>
<P>
   They persuaded Davis to accept a one-time sales tax rebate of
from $50 to $125, depending on income, which would go to a much
larger number of Californians and be more helpful to lower-income
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred an income tax (rebate) to sales, but a
check is a check, and it will have an economic impact on its
recipient,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis rejected a legislative plan to increase the state tax
credit for dependent children. His main objection, lawmakers said,
was that it wasn't his idea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they substituted an increase in the state's child care
credit and a 0.55 percent reduction in each of the state's tax
brackets.
</P>
<P>
   That means the state's highest bracket would fall from 9.3
percent to 9.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $224 million that tax cut will cost, taxpayers earning
$100,000 or above will see $165 million in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very Republican tax cut,'' grumbled one liberal
Democratic legislator.
</P>
<P>
   Despite misgivings over its workability, lawmakers largely
approved Davis' transportation plan.
</P>
<P>
   That plan, which some GOP and Democratic lawmakers oppose as a
glorified pork barrel list, is a series of transit and highway
projects picked by Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He proposes spending $5.3 billion in seed money over the next
five years to begin construction on them, although that
construction cannot begin with another $10 billion in state and
local revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate's budget takes half of the sales tax paid on
gasoline sales -- roughly $500 million -- and earmarks it for other
transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk is split between state highway projects and local
streets with some for projects of regional benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have better, it could have been worse,'' shrugged
Sen. President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because of our input there is more money for mental
health, more day care money, more money for clinics and more money
with less strings attached for schools,'' he added.

UNRAVELING THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF THE GASOLINE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: As gasoline prices soar, the conspiracy theorists are
reacting as they usually do and blaming Big Oil's pursuit of
obscene profits.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, though: If it makes you feel any better,
gasoline at a buck-eighty a gallon today is really only about 85
cents a gallon in 1980 dollars. So if your income has kept pace
with inflation over the past 20 years, you're breaking even. If
your earning power has outpaced inflation, smile: You're ahead of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   As for the reasons behind gasoline's price surge, what's
happening was inevitable. The only surprise is that gasoline prices
remained as low as they did for as long as they did. This is small
comfort to consumers filling 30-gallon SUV tanks, but this is the
way the real world works. Cheap energy isn't an American
birthright, despite widespread assumptions to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of such things, the next cry of anguish you're likely
to hear will be next winter from homeowners trying to heat those
huge piles they bought heedless of how natural gas prices might
behave in the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the market is working exactly as intended. The
primary reason gasoline prices have been climbing gets back to
OPEC's decision last year to boost oil prices by reducing
production. Nobody expected the cartel to make cutbacks stick,
because it never has. In the past, some producer has always cheated
and thus destroyed OPEC's solidarity. This time, however, OPEC's
resolve has held, which means global supply has held more or less
steady as demand has risen.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as often happens in these cases, American drivers
experienced bad luck in the form of Environmental Protection Agency
mandates for some areas to switch to a type of gasoline that
produces less air pollution. Early estimates of how much more
expensive this gasoline would be proved lower than predicted. This
isn't unusual when government requires something on the promise
that its cost to society will be negligible. The guesses are
probably lowballed to make them more politically palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the ``reformulated'' fuel more expensive than
guessed, but it also diverts a good deal of already scarce refining
capacity from its usual job of producing regular gasoline. This
further reduces supply, which not surprisingly creates more price
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   June's EPA-related price spike has been exacerbated, some
experts say, by OPEC's inability to convince the oil market that
the cartel wants stable prices. The resulting uncertainty has
caused traders to bid up petroleum's price even more than otherwise
would be the case.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, refiner profits are indeed rising,
providing extra money to buy up oil before the next price hike. The
paradox is that rising gasoline prices boost oil prices instead of
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's you _ if, that is, you've been smitten by the lure
of the gas-guzzling behemoths so popular in recent years. Just as
oil supplies have stabilized, you have added immensely to U.S.
gasoline demand. The logical result of increasing demand during a
time of stable to shrinking supply is, voila, higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   No conspiracy here. Just Murphy's Law at work.
</P>

HUNDLEY TARGETS HOUSTON SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Injured catcher Todd Hundley is hoping to return
to the lineup when the Dodgers open a three-game series in Houston
after missing the last 15 games with a strained right oblique
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the injury, Hundley took his first
right- handed swings in a batting cage session Thursday, and he's
aiming to hit left-handed today. He's been playing catch and
running in the outfield since the beginning of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday would be perfect,'' Hundley said. ``If everything goes
perfect, yeah, the Houston series. That would be good. If not
there, then St. Louis. But during the road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers can get Hundley's bat back in the lineup, it
would make it a more potent attack. Hundley was hitting .290 with
13 homers and 33 RBI in 35 games before he hurt his right side
running the bases May 30 against the Mets. Before the injury, which
came three days after Adrian Beltre was hurt, the Dodgers averaged
six runs per game. Since, they've average 4.6 runs.
</P>
<P>
   However, before Hundley's activated, manager Davey Johnson said
he wants Hundley to get his throwing arm back in shape. And the
Dodgers will make sure of that given Hundley's elbow troubles
before this season.
</P>
<P>
   City of Dodgertown: According to a proposal drafted jointly by
the Dodgers and local officials from Vero Beach, Fla., and Indian
River County, if the Dodgers sign a long-term lease to remain at
Dodgertown, the property would be split in half and include a hotel
and a ``small town'' section.
</P>
<P>
   For $1 a year for 20 years, the Dodgers would lease 64 acres for
a training center, a stadium and several practice fields. The other
62 acres would be sold and turned into hotels and possibly stores.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the Dodgers would pay for operating costs
but also keep all the revenue the spring training complex
generates.
</P>
<P>
   More melee insight: Just another tidbit the players association
will use during the appeals hearing next week:
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Camacho, whom Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter allegedly had
his hands around the neck of during the May 16 fight at Wrigley
Field, has been arrested at least nine times since 1987, a Chicago
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Todd Hollandsworth started in center field and
batted leadoff, marking the first time he's played since June 3 ...
Third baseman Adrian Beltre still has swelling in his right
hamstring. He said it would be three or four days, at the earliest,
before he could return from the disabled list. Right-hander Al
Reyes, acquired in a trade for Alan Mills on Tuesday, arrived and
was available ... The Diamondbacks optioned Turner Ward to the
minors to make room for Thursday's starter, Todd Stottlemyre...
Tickets are available for all three games this weekend against St.
Louis.

MANY SHAREHOLDERS ARE COOL TO WESTERN RESOURCES' UPBEAT MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Utility shareholder meetings are typically sedate
affairs with a few questions and a quick adjournment. Then there
was Western Resources Inc.'s annual meeting Thursday at the Topeka
Performing Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Topeka company has gone through a tumultuous year. Its bid
to buy Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. failed in January, and
Western's stock continued to languish. So when the company gave an
upbeat presentation Thursday about how things had begun to turn
around, many shareholders were clearly having none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the skeptics was John Oubre of Sulphur, La., who said he
had come to find out why his investment in the company was doing so
poorly. Somehow, he said, he found it hard to accept the company
line that nobody was doing anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company is stinking,'' he said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, shareholders got copies of an open letter
signed ``concerned shareholders'' and a list of suggested
questions, including why David Wittig, Western's chief executive,
should continue to be employed by the company, given its
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The tone continued inside when Wittig, in his initial remarks,
said: ``This is a very different company than it was a year ago.''
The audience laughed. A year ago, Western's stock was 27 1//2. On
Thursday, it closed at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Wittig and other company executives did follow up with some
encouraging figures.
</P>
<P>
   Wittig said the company is on track to have record earnings for
the first six months of the year. Earnings for April and May were
50 cents a share, compared with 27 cents a share for the full
second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Wittig also said the company hopes by fall to identify a company
that will be interested in merging with or buying Western's
electric operations, which should boost the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Additional upbeat numbers came from Annette Beck, president of
Protection One Inc., a monitored security firm that is 85 percent
owned by Western.
</P>
<P>
   Protection One has struggled since Western bought much of the
company in 1997. But Beck said that the cost of gaining new
customers had been slashed in half, to $600 to $700 a person, and
that the number of customers being lost was also down.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the question-and-answer period. Wittig said that
there had been a board meeting just before the annual meeting and
that he had the full support of the board.
</P>
<P>
   One shareholder wondered whether the board was simply a rubber
stamp. He asked whether John Dicus, one of the directors, could
speak to shareholders about the board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Wittig said he was chairman of the board and could speak for
it. ``There is no rubber stamp,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another shareholder said a recent cut in the dividend, the
continued languishing of the company stock's price and the
downgrading of the company's debt to junk status raised questions
about the company's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need new leadership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting adjourned at 4 p.m. _ 2 1//2 hours after it had
begun _ with at least one person still wanting to ask a question.

ENDANGERED RHINO AT ZOO EXPECTED TO GIVE BIRTH THIS SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A female rhinoceros of a critically
endangered breed is in the latter stages of an apparently healthy
pregnancy at the Kansas City Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The birth sometime this summer will mean one step back from the
brink of extinction for the eastern black subspecies of rhino, of
which only a few hundred remain.
</P>
<P>
   For an exhilarated zoo staff, this is the big prize. It is the
culmination of years of effort and anguish, and two trips to South
Africa to collect females from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the whole darned thing is about,'' said chief
veterinarian Kirk Suedmeyer, pinching his fingers together for
emphasis. ``We're that close now.''
</P>
<P>
   Grainy images of the wriggling 50-pound fetus appeared on small
screens Thursday as the mother, Luyisa, patiently allowed humans to
perform an ultrasound procedure on her enormous belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This white line is the skin of the fetus, there's an ear
here,'' said Suedmeyer, pointing to the black and white picture.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later what appeared to be the baby's snout came into
view, as the vet reached between the bars of a special restraint
and gently rubbed the gel-covered ultrasound wand across Luyisa's
skin.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors were warned to be quiet and still around the one-ton
animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black rhinos notoriously respond negatively to anything
unusual,'' said zookeeper Wendy Shaffstall, who called out
reassuringly to the mother: ``Good girl. We've got some company
here today. Very good girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Zookeeper Aimee Goldcamp focused Luyisa's attention during the
procedure by feeding bits of apple, yam and banana into her mouth.
A country radio station provided background noise for the animal.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first ultrasound that Luyisa has put up with.
Zoo staffers have spent literally hundreds of hours over several
years to get the animal comfortable with the restraint and the
touch of human hands. She even permits rectal ultrasounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Zoo is one of two zoos able to routinely perform
such procedures on a rhino without drugging the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Suedmeyer and vet technician Lani Castaner knelt on the concrete
floor while administering the ultrasound. They were able to measure
the fetus as well as the amniotic fluid surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fetus is moving, there's plenty of fluid,'' Suedmeyer
said. ``As best we can tell, everything is proceeding like it
should.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate stall on the other side of the barn, Rudy the sire
rhino poked his horns through the bars, straining to get a better
view of the commotion.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of two male rhinos acquired from other institutions
after Kansas City built a spacious new breeding facility during the
last decade's multimillion-dollar makeover of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and again in 1997 zoo Curator Conrad Schmitt traveled to
South Africa to collect female rhinos for the breeding program. New
bloodlines were needed to broaden the gene pool of the captive
population.
</P>
<P>
   But the first female was sickly and died a year ago. Only then
did the zoo learn she had been pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Luyisa, whose collection from Africa was reported firsthand by
The Kansas City Star, has been healthy, and her pregnancy has been
monitored by ultrasound for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Officials still don't know whether she is carrying a male or
female, but they are hoping for a female because young rhinos in
captivity are disproportionately male.
</P>
<P>
   Luyisa will remain on display on weekends until mid-July when
she will retire to her stall to await the birth. After about 16
months of gestation, babies can weigh 80 to 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes well, zoo visitors next spring will be
treated to the sight of a rhino calf _ the first milestone in what
the Kansas City Zoo hopes will be a long and productive breeding
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the money spent and all the time put in comes down to the
day that (Luyisa) has the baby,'' Schmitt said. ``And when it
successfully is an adult and starts reproducing its own offspring,
then we're really there.''

POLICE WIRETAP VIOLATIONS MAY RESULT IN RETRIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON AND BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bolstering a year-old federal ruling that police
backed by prosecutors conducted illegal searches and seizures, a
judge ruled Thursday that two convicted drug dealers may be due
retrials because they were not told they were the subjects of
wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in that ruling and the previous ruling - involving
seizure of $265,000 from a man who was never charged - is whether
Los Angeles police and the District Attorney's Office used wiretaps
illegally to gain search warrants and convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings raise many of the same questions about civil rights
violations and how they are handled by the criminal justice system
in Los Angeles that have surfaced in the Rampart Division scandal
where anti-gang officers planted evidence, illegally searched
suspects and testified falsely in court.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ruling by U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz is
related to the case before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Larry
Paul Fidler - a sweeping lawsuit brought by the Public Defender's
Office over wiretaps of thousands of people who were never told
that their cell phone calls were taped, as the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Fidler said prosecutors and police did not follow
his order in some cases to disclose wiretaps to people so they
could defend themselves properly. Fidler is expected to issue a
final ruling next week, but Thursday he said he wants convicted
drug dealers Ramon and Martha Perez to appear before him on a
motion seeking reversal of their 1997 cocaine conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In his order March 8, 1999, Matz condemned the nondisclosure of
the wiretap in the search warrant application used to seize money
from Efrain Rodriguez Alvarado's account on Oct. 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Matz ruled LAPD officers obtained a search warrant to seize the
$265,000 by falsely claiming the officer eavesdropping on the cell
phone conversations was a confidential informant. The judge ordered
the money returned 2 years after it was seized, saying the police
lied to conceal the wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles Alejandro
Mayorkas said a confidential informant cannot be used in a search
warrant if the information was instead obtained by wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be done,'' Mayorkas said. ``It's an inaccurate
statement in an affidavit.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Public Defender Michael Fischman said the Matz ruling
shows how police and prosecutors work together to cover up improper
use of wiretaps. ``It's an example of how they lie to the judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Matz said that a federal prosecutor apparently initially didn't
know the search warrant was falsified when a judge granted it, but
he sought to defend the ruse anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, however, even after learning that fact, in
opposing these motions the government insisted that this Court
should pay no attention to the falsehood,'' Matz concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Matz said he was shocked a prosecutor would ``rely upon such
statements from a detective who herself had executed a false
affidavit and then would advocate to this Court a position that was
dependent upon a finding that a state court judge had been
complicit in a violation of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Falsification of probable cause to win convictions is central to
the Rampart police corruption scandal exposed by
dirty-cop-turned-informant Rafael Perez. It was illegal searches
and false testimony by corrupt officers - not planted evidence -
that tainted most of the 78 vacated felony convictions, a recent
Los Angeles Daily News investigation uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   John Yzurdiaga, former president of the Criminal Courts Bar
Association and defendant in another wiretap-related case, said
Matz's opinion revealed what usually is a hidden secret in the
justice community: that probable cause is routinely fudged by
police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not new to people in criminal defense, but to a citizen
it's shocking that a police officer who commits perjury is subject
to zero consequences,'' he said. ``This is a perfect example of how
a Rampart happens. Officers begin to believe they're untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Several local law enforcement and prosecutorial officials
insisted Matz was wrong, and that the deceit was an acceptable,
routine method to mask probable cause on search warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy LAPD Chief David Gascon said the department investigated
shortly after the ruling and concluded none of the officers did
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of what the judge said, and we think the judge is
mistaken,'' Gascon said.
</P>
<P>
   An LAPD supervisor in the asset forfeiture division, Detective
Hugh Wilton, said the police were following district attorney
guidelines in disguising the source of information on the search
warrant and that it was done with Superior Court Judge William
Pounders' approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the confidential reliable informant as a term for the
wire with the permission of the District Attorney's Office so that
we wouldn't disclose we used a wire,'' Wilton said. ``It's a common
practice. It went all the way up the line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pounders issued the warrant, he was well aware that
`confidential, reliable informant' meant a wire; Hermosillo told
him; we interviewed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pounders could not be reached immediately for comment.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons
denied there is a policy to disguise wiretaps in search warrants by
claiming information came from confidential informants.
</P>
<P>
   She said that since the ruling, prosecutors have worked to
educate LAPD officers that such deceit is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have notified Judge Fidler that this is not our policy, and
that we have gone to great lengths to make sure this doesn't happen
again on any search,'' Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Fidler said the District Attorney's Office made
``mistakes'' but did not act maliciously by failing to notify
defendants that key information in their case was gathered through
wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there was no deliberate attempt to do it, they
clearly were negligent. There was negligence involved in this
because of all the cases that got overlooked,'' said Fidler, the
criminal courts supervising and wiretap judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Huntington Park couple were arrested carrying a suitcase
containing 24 kilos of cocaine as a result of information derived
from a wiretap, said Deputy Public Defender Michael Fischman. Both
are serving time in state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only evidence against them was obtained from an unlawful
wiretap,'' Fischman said. ``This is the first case where there is
an order bringing people from state prison for this purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schirn, head deputy in charge of the District Attorney's
Major Narcotics and Forfeiture Division, said after the hearing
that more than 100 people have been notified their cases were
derived from wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given the discovery notices to all the defendants we
think have had their cases derived from wiretaps,'' Schirn said.
``Fidler is concerned there may be some more cases out there we
haven't identified.''

GRANDMA CRIES FOR TOT, JUSTICE

(UNDATED) - OAXACA, Mexico _ Paula Galindo Flores couldn't stop
kissing her granddaughter and caressing her face.
</P>
<P>
   The baby girl was returned to her Thursday, June 15, more than a
month after she was found in the Arizona desert in her dead
mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-month-old Elizama and her mother were part of a group
of 10 Mexicans who followed a smuggler of illegal immigrants into
the United States, only to be abandoned in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Gonzalez, 19, had walked about 14 miles when she gave
her baby the last ounce of water she had, then collapsed beneath a
paloverde tree.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was turned over to Mexican authorities, who decided
that Elizama should temporarily go to her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   `Mi pequena hija (My little girl),` Galindo repeated softly as
the baby lay in a crib, kicking at a pink plastic bunny and then
drifting off to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But Galindo, 43, had more on her mind than reunions.
</P>
<P>
   She called on U.S. and Mexican officials to identify and arrest
the smuggler who abandoned her daughter and the others on a hot,
late May day near the border on the Tohono O'odham reservation.
</P>
<P>
   `I want this miserable `coyote` who sent my daughter to her
death brought to justice,` said Galindo, surrounded by a battery of
microphones and video cameras from the national Mexican press.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo also blasted her son-in-law, Hermilo Hernandez Velasco,
who was working in Portland, Ore., at the time of the desert
crossing. She said he ignored demands from the smuggler to come up
with more money to guide the group across 20 miles of desert at
temperatures well above 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   `My son sent a lot of money to this coyote, but my daughter's
own husband did not respond when he was asked for some more money,`
Galindo said.
</P>
<P>
   Hermilo Hernandez, 22, who returned to his home village of San
Pedro Chayuco, Oaxaca, a week ago, denied in an interview earlier
this week that he had any dealings with smugglers. He said he had
never asked his wife to come live with him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will seek custody of the child, but so far he hasn't
been able to afford the cost of the documents required by the
Mexican government for custody.
</P>
<P>
   `This is my child,` he said. `I named her Elizama, which is a
name from the Bible that means `God listens.` I believe that God is
listening now to my prayers for my child.`
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said a decision concerning custody will be
made Monday, June 19, but that Galindo had been the only person to
submit paperwork to take in the child.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who had been working in a restaurant in the Portland
area, apparently without the proper paperwork, said he refused to
meet with U.S. officials, Mexican diplomats and social-service
workers in northern Mexico about Elizama because he feared he would
be deported.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he and his family scraped together enough money for
him to get home. He made his way to the Mexican border at Tijuana
and then rode the bus nearly 2,000 miles to his impoverished
mountain village.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, appear in Oaxaca, where Elizama was brought
Thursday, June 15. That left the spotlight on Galindo, who waited
stoically for the baby on a wooden bench outside a government-run
nursery, where state officials stockpiled a large supply of
clothes, diapers and baby formula for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, a van pulled up, and a government worker handed
Galindo the baby. Galindo broke into tears, thanking the officials
and walking to a nearby fence to talk to reporters. She asked the
reporters to thank the U.S. Border Patrol for saving her
granddaughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Luciano Paz, a pediatric surgeon in Oaxaca who examined
Elizama, said the child had been given antibiotics for a cold
before leaving Mexico City, which delayed the flight 30 minutes,
but was generally in good health. &QL;

DEMOCRATS ASKING LOS ANGELES FOR $4 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Faced with what is now projected to be a $10
million shortfall, planners of this summer's Democratic National
Convention are breaking from their pledge to fund the event
privately and asking the city for $4 million in cash, the Los
Angeles Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   However, knowing that the request could be a political hot
potato, city officials have been reluctant to come forward with the
money or even to discuss the request publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, who has devoted several hours a day for
the past several months to fund raising for the convention,
supports the request, according to an aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor does support this,'' spokesman Manuel Valencia said
Thursday. ``The fund raising is continuing, and to the extent the
city can assist financially, it would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But public opposition is already mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a city where they can't even afford to fix the
sidewalks, and they're talking about a contribution for a political
party,'' said Kris Vosburgh of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think even Los Angeles Democrats, if asked, would rather see
the money spent on the sidewalks. It's not so much a question of
the cost, but of what is not being done in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council President John Ferraro confirmed through an aide
that he has been approached by the convention committee chairman,
Terry McAuliffe, about the need for millions of dollars in city
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ferraro is looking at it, and to his way of thinking the
potential benefit to the city from a successful convention and the
additional money it would bring to local businesses could make it
worthwhile,'' spokeswoman Gayle Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking is the request would be a mere fraction of that
potential benefit, plus avoid the embarrassment of a failed
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   She said no specific proposal to the City Council had been put
together, however, as of late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe, who was brought in this month to chair the committee
after former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer was selected to be Los Angeles
schools superintendent, spent most of Thursday talking with city
officials about his plans and the convention's needs.
</P>
<P>
   When organizers first proposed hosting the convention, they said
it would be financed with private donations while the city would
provide in-kind services, such as security and traffic control,
expected to cost roughly $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money needed for the convention and the pace at
which it has been raised have long been a concern of local and
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to appear at a fund-raiser next
week to raise a portion of the money that is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has budgeted $4 million to cover security costs
of the California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Broad, one of the co-chairmen of the host committee, said he
was unaware of any request to the city but believes one would be
appropriate because of new requirements from convention planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have raised 85 to 90 percent of what we pledged, and the
mayor and I and others will make sure we get to what we promised,''
Broad said. ``I do know we want to raise more money to do some
additional things the DNC has put on the agenda, and we will do our
best to accommodate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The host committee pledged to raise a total of $35.5 million and
has raised $32 million, said Noelia Rodriguez, chief executive
officer of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to show the world
what Los Angeles is all about,'' Rodriguez said. ``We would welcome
an enhanced partnership with the city of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying she would need time to consider the matter, Councilwoman
Laura Chick noted the other contributions the city would be making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it isn't from the general fund, but we're making a
significant payment in services,'' said Chick, who is running for
city controller in next spring's election. ``And, when this first
came to council, we were told it wouldn't involve taking any money
from the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do want the convention to be a success and it's just very
regrettable that a commitment was made by the mayor and others that
the necessary dollars would be raised, and now we are looking at
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden, who has opposed using city funds for
private enterprise in the past, said he believes the spending would
be justified in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the Republicans are getting something like $14
million from the city of Philadelphia and the state of
Pennsylvania, I think this is appropriate,'' Holden said. ``We will
be getting a big boost here and will more than make up the money
with all that will be spent here.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden said he believes the committee also should ask Los
Angeles County government to help with some of the costs since it
also will benefit from the tax dollars generated during the
presidential nominating convention, expected to draw tens of
thousands of people to Los Angeles from Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Joel Wachs said he opposes such a use of public
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way. I think it's outrageous,'' said Wachs, a candidate for
mayor in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the amount requested for the DNC is roughly
equivalent to the amount the city plans to spend from the general
fund next year to fix only a few dozen miles of the 4,600 miles of
broken and crumbling sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they want is the equivalent of every sidewalk we're going
to repair in this city when we have a 4,600-mile backlog. There's
never enough money for basic services. People who have power get
money, and the average person doesn't get money. You ask for trees
to be trimmed or sidewalks to be fixed, and there's no money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already providing for the things we should be providing
- police and security and traffic. We haven't even had an
accounting for the services we're going to be providing.''
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In yet another reshuffling of his presidential
campaign, Vice President Al Gore announced Thursday that William
Daley, the U.S. secretary of commerce and a shrewd operative in
Democratic politics, would replace the campaign chairman, Tony
Coelho.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, who was hospitalized on Monday night with an inflamed
colon, said he decided to step down on the advice of his doctors,
who urged him to restrict his travel and slow his pace. But many
Democrats said the move was inevitable, given the way Gore's
campaign has struggled in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Daley flew to Lockland, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb, from
Washington to join Gore at a prescheduled campaign event Thursday
afternoon as Gore advisers sought to project a sense of forward
energy and optimism despite the latest upheaval to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is to visit the Gore headquarters in Nashville next week and
relocate there to become what Gore called a ``full-time, hands-on''
manager. He will leave his Cabinet post on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Coming less than five months before Election Day, the change
seems unlikely to bring any immediate strategic or visible changes
to the campaign. Even so, Daley is taking over at a time when
crucial decisions will have to be made about a running-mate, the
national convention and where to pump the campaign's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to miss a beat,'' Gore told reporters at a
food warehouse as he announced Daley's appointment, the secretary
at his side.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Daley said of the campaign: ``I don't see any
problems whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has been largely on the defensive since the
primary season ended. Although national polls show the race is
relatively close, his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has
pulled ahead in many surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to Democrats, however, is that in many states
that could help decide the outcome in November, surveys show that
Bush is ahead. There is also a sense among strategists in both
parties that Bush has been far more successful in making the
transition to the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When Coelho came to the campaign a year ago, he was former House
majority whip, known for his aggressive fund-raising prowess. He
had served in Congress from 1978 to 1989, representing part of
California's Central Valley. He resigned 11 years ago after
questions were raised about whether he had profited from a junk
bond in what looked like a sweetheart deal.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has never run a national campaign. But he is known as a
skilled manager who is highly regarded in Democratic circles, as
well as in the business community. In 1992, he helped the Clinton
campaign navigate the politics of the Midwest, the crucial
battleground for the coming general election. He is a son of the
late Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, who dominated Chicago politics
for two decades, and the brother of current Mayor Richard M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   While the overhaul was prompted by Coelho's health, several Gore
campaign officials said that in recent weeks the vice president had
recognized that he needed to make changes in his campaign, which
seemed to drift after Gore clinched the Democratic nomination
nearly three months ago. Two people close to the campaign also said
that Gore's wife, Tipper, had expressed concerns about Coelho's
health for the past month or more, wondering whether he was up to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   And while Democrats hoped that the shift would energize the
campaign, it created another unwelcome distraction for Gore and
largely overshadowed his effort to promote the prosperity of the
Clinton years and offer new proposals that take advantage of the
growing budget surplus. Thursday, in fact, Gore doubled the size of
his proposed tax cut, to $500 billion over the next decade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Campaigns, generally, are not won or lost by campaign managers.
But Coelho's departure is significant because it reflects how, even
after years of preparation, Gore still has had trouble assembling a
stable inner circle to run his organization.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bush has maintained the same tight circle since
announcing his candidacy, and Bush's aides seemed to take delight
in the Gore campaign's woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder whether naming a new chairman involves yet another
reinvention of the Gore campaign,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the Bush
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's move also underscores worries among Democrats that
Gore needs to move quickly to energize his campaign as it prepares
for the Democratic National Convention, a time when the vast
majority of voters traditionally begin to pay close attention to
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This transition better be seamless, and it better be fast
because there is no time to lose,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J. ``George Bush is well-funded and well organized and clearly
has developed a sense of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, of course, may not be Coelho himself, but
the overall health of the Gore campaign. ``If anyone understands
that you live or die by the sword it is Coelho,'' said Rep. Luis
Gutierrez, a Democrat from Chicago. ``He's a consummate politician.
I'm sure he left for two reasons: He's genuinely sick and he
understands there are genuine problems with the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Coelho and Gore said the two never worked well
together, and that the vice president was increasingly bypassing
him and turning to other advisers like Carter Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony and Al Gore never really liked each other,'' said a top
Democratic official who knows Coelho well. ``There's little mutual
respect and no affection. They're very different people.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gore named Coelho his campaign chairman in May 1999, the
campaign was beset by overspending, and many Democrats credit him
for cutting costs and successfully steering through a treacherous
series of primary contests.
</P>
<P>
   But other one-time allies said that his controlling personality
had led him to reach into virtually every aspect of the campaign
and that an abrasive manner had alienated many of those with whom
he worked, including Donna Brazile, the campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, federal investigations into his past
financial activities created even more problems. For example, one
Gore ally said, Coelho could not be an effective spokesman for the
vice president because he declined to appear on television, largely
out of concern that he might be questioned about the federal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his problems were internal within the campaign,
Coelho also took the blame for one of Gore's biggest political
fiascos, his call for Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban
castaway, to be given permanent residence in the United States, a
position that put him at odds with President Clinton and others in
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore said today that he had expected Coelho to last
through November, if not for his health problems. And he said he
was not concerned ``in the least'' that the investigations of
Coelho would have undermined the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Coelho has had less of a role in running the
daily operation, as Tad Devine, one of Gore's top consultants, had
been shifted to a more central role at the campaign headquarters in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The news was delivered at campaign headquarters this morning,
and was not unwelcome. ``If you're in the doldrums, you need a
cathartic event to turn things around,'' said one adviser. ``Our
biggest challenge at this point is to stay disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Coelho acknowledged there had been
mistakes, particularly that the campaign allowed Gore to become
enmeshed in the Gonzalez case. But Coelho also said he brought
discipline and order to the campaign _ and stepped in so the vice
president did not have to make all the decisions. Asked if Gore was
a micro-manager in the mold of President Jimmy Carter before Coelho
took over, he said, ``I think he probably was. People said he did.
But since I've been on board, he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many inside the campaign and out perceived the illness as a
convenient cover for Gore to ease Coelho to the sidelines after a
somewhat tumultuous year-long reign.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat who works closely with the campaign said that while
Coelho's health concerns were ``legitimate,'' they also made for
``a very convenient'' excuse for Coelho to depart.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Coelho, who turned 58 Thursday, said the move came
strictly for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call I made to the vice president last night informing him
of my doctor's advice is one of the most difficult calls I have
ever had to make,'' he said in a statement released by Gore
headquarters in Nashville. ``My doctors have told me that I need to
slow down, eat better and travel less for a period of time.
Unfortunately, none of this advice is consistent with the rigors of
chairing a presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Two people close to Coelho, who has epilepsy, said he had
suffered several seizures recently.
</P>
<P>
   Daley had been under consideration as a running mate for Gore.
But Gore said in an interview Thursday night that he removed Daley
from consideration because ``it is not possible to be a full-time
hands-on campaign manager all the way through the election and also
be a vice presidential running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has such confidence in Daley that he has offered him the
post in the first place before he turned to Coelho. Daley, who has
been commerce secretary since January 1997, resisted the
entreaties, saying he had not been in office long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Thursday that Daley sprang to mind Wednesday night
immediately after he spoke with Coelho. Coelho had called Gore, who
was attending a fund-raising dinner in New York, about 11 p.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that after talking with Coelho, he talked with Frank
Hunger, his brother-in-law, who was with him in New York, and
called Mrs. Gore, who was campaigning in Florida. He said he then
called Daley in Washington after midnight, waking him up. Gore and
Daley said that neither of them had notified President Clinton
until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took his commerce secretary away before I told him,'' Gore
said, adding that he called the president Thursday morning.

FOG COULD START CHAIN REACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH - The fog that canceled first-round play in the
100th U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links may have started a
domino effect that could affect playing times through Saturday's
third round.
</P>
<P>
   That was the scenario described Thursday night by Tom Meeks,
Director of Rules and Competition for the U.S. Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   Because 75 players could not complete first-round play, they
will return to finish their rounds today at 6:45 a.m., forcing
second-round play to be moved back from a 6:30 start to 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks anticipates that will also mean second-round play cannot
be completed today, and that some players might have to come back
Saturday to finish rounds which will determine which players make
the cut for the final two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The top 60 and ties and all players within 10 shots of the lead
qualify to play in the final two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to come to be known as the Foggy Open,
unfortunately,'' said Meeks, who said play was originally halted
when Jeff Maggert told an official at about 3:45 p.m. that he was
not going to play his tee shot at the 10th hole because he couldn't
see the landing area.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Ridley, the Chairman of the Championship Committee, and
Meeks went to the 10th and agreed with Maggert, even while Ernie
Els, playing one group ahead, was jokingly insisting that he had
played Maggert's shot and could see fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was having a little fun with us,'' Meeks said, ``but we
knew we were close (to having to stop play for lack of visibility.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think our call to stop it when we did was right.
Because although we had five or six holes that were very visible
and very playable, those around 8, 9 and 10 know that it was not
fair to make those players play those shots down there.'' Play was
halted for nearly two and a half hours before being discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we stop play, we have to stop it for everybody,'' Meeks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The big question for Meeks was what will the weather be like for
the second round?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to tell you, I don't know,'' he said. ``I've heard
rumors even to the fact that the fog (for the second round) is
supposed to be worse than it was today.''
</P>
<P>
   Local watch: Area qualifiers David Berganio Jr. of Sylmar and
Jon Levitt, the former Cal State Northridge golfer from Alhambra,
both struggled on the back nine in their opening rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Berganio, one-time Alemany High standout and 1997 PGA Tour
regular appearing in his fifth U.S. Open, finished 6-over-par at 77
after playing the front nine in even-par 35.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt, playing in his first U.S. Open after missing on four
previous qualifying attempts, made the turn at 3-over-par 38 before
finishing bogey-triple bogey for a 79.
</P>
<P>
   Out with a bang: John Daly, the long-hitting but erratic crowd
pleaser who has won two major titles, withdrew from the U.S. Open
after a first-round 83 that included a 9-over-par 14 on his final
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in heavy fog, which later resulted in play being
suspended and then postponed until today, Daly hit his first shot
OB to the right of the par-5, 543-yard 18th.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't discover the penalty until walking up the uphill hole,
then returned to the tee and hooked his next two shots into
adjacent Stillwater Cove. His next shot his seventh stroke with
penalties wound up in the fairway, from where Daly laid up short of
the green, only to knock his following approach into a bunker and
against a seawall.
</P>
<P>
   That forced the right-handed Daly to hit a shot left-handed, and
he failed to get the ball out of the bunker. He reached the green
on his next shot, two-putted for the 14 to complete a 12-over-par
round that had been 3-over starting the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always unfortunate when a contestant withdraws prior to
completion of his regulation rounds,'' said Marty Parkes, Senior
Director of Communications for the USGA. ``We were very sorry that
John's struggles at the end of his round today caused him to
withdraw.''

CHARGES AGAINST SERIAL KILLER SUSPECT ARE PRESENTED IN COURT

<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ John Edward Robinson Sr. on Thursday made the
first of what is likely to be many appearances in Johnson County
District Court.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Olathe resident is charged in Johnson County
with two counts of capital murder, aggravated kidnapping, two
counts of aggravated sexual battery and felony theft.
</P>
<P>
   A weeklong preliminary hearing on the charges is to begin Oct.
2.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Cass County, Mo., Robinson is charged with three
counts each of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.
Prosecutors there said the Johnson County case would be prosecuted
first.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also have linked Robinson to four women and two
girls who have disappeared since 1984. On Thursday, they asked for
help from people with information about Sheila Dale Faith, who
would be 51, and her daughter Debbie Lynn Faith, who would be 21.
They disappeared between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   - The owner of an Olathe self-storage facility said Thursday
that police searched a locker there on June 2, the day Robinson was
arrested at his Olathe mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had rented a locker at the facility since 1998, the
owner said. Robinson paid the rent using an account from his
company, Specialty Publications of America, the owner said.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty Publications, incorporated in Missouri, still exists
but has not filed an annual report that was due April 15, according
to the Missouri secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   The storage facility owner said police did not say what they
found in Robinson's unit.
</P>
<P>
   A task-force detective declined Thursday to discuss whether
investigators had searched the Olathe locker.
</P>
<P>
   - Another address linked to Robinson is a duplex in Overland
Park, Kan., that was rented by a woman who is listed as a witness
on court documents in Robinson's case.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and the woman co-signed the lease for the duplex in
September 1999, according to a lawsuit filed against them in April
for not paying rent. The woman is not his wife, to whom he has been
married since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was dismissed in May, but no reason is given in the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, to whom detectives have spoken, no longer lives in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Task-force spokesmen also declined to comment on the duplex.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's court appearance, Robinson was represented by
three attorneys from the Kansas Death Penalty Defense Unit. They
took over his defense after murder charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was not required to enter a plea at the hearing and
spoke only once, answering yes to a question from District Judge
Pro-tem Earle Jones.
</P>
<P>
   At the preliminary hearing in October, prosecutors will present
evidence to a judge who will decide whether there is probable cause
to proceed to trial. He would then be arraigned, and prosecutors
would have five days to file a motion to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison said Thursday it
would be premature to discuss whether such a request would be
filed. He also said it was ``way too early'' to talk about the
possibility of plea negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just looking at it as a capital case with the potential
of the death penalty,'' he said after Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's attorneys, Ron Evans, Christian Zoller and Mark
Manna, received a copy of the charges against him and waived their
reading in court. They left the courthouse without commenting to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said the process of turning over to the defense
thousands of pages of investigative reports would begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson County, Robinson is charged with killing Suzette
Trouten, 28, and Izabela Lewicka, 21. Their bodies were found June
3 on land owned by Robinson in Linn County, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged in Cass County with killing Beverly J. Bonner,
whose body was found June 5 in a Raymore, Mo., storage locker. He
also is charged with killing two other women found at the same time
who haven't been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, police said they had connected Robinson to three
other women _ Paula Godfrey, Catherine Clampitt and Lisa Stasi _
and Stasi's baby girl, Tiffany, who disappeared in the 1980s after
being in contact with Robinson.

NEAR-CRASH COSTLY TO KANKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ MK Kanke's lead in the NASCAR Featherlite
Southwest Series was short-lived - one week to be exact. The
Kennedy High graduate entered Saturday's Snap-On 125 at Rocky
Mountains Raceway in West Valley, Utah, with a one-point lead over
Matt Crafton.
</P>
<P>
   Now he trails Crafton by nine after a sixth-place finish in
Utah. An incident on the last lap of the race almost cost Kanke his
top-10 finish and could have added more damage to his championship
run.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pratt, who was driving in fourth and one place ahead of
Kanke, got sideways coming out of turn two on the 3/8-mile oval. As
Kanke and Pratt came into turn three, Crafton tried to pass low,
making it three-wide on the final turn for the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke backed off and settled for sixth. Crafton ended up fourth
with Pratt in between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have done the same thing as Matt,'' said Kanke, who
drives the Buyer's Choice Auto Warranty/Air Gas Pontiac. ``But if I
stayed in there, I would have put all three of us into the wall.
That's not the way I drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Nelson of Hemet earned the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Woodside of Saugus finished ninth, Bob Lyon of Agua Dulce
was 14th, Greg Pursley of Newhall was 15th and Frank Maronski Jr.
of Quartz Hill was 20th in a 26-car field.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Southwest Series is the Snap-On Tools/AAA
200 at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma on June 24. The Southwest
Series will accompany the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit for a weekend
of racing in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   When Kanke beat Daddy E: Sears Point Raceway is a 1.949-mile
road course, one of two road courses on the Southwest Series
schedule. As an accompanying race to the Winston Cup event, it's a
good bet that some of the Cup drivers will compete in the Southwest
Series event. Which is fine with Kanke, who has fond memories of
racing against Darrell Waltrip, Neil Bonnett and Dale Earnhardt in
1980 at Ascot Park in Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, Bonnett and Earnhardt were at Ascot for a Winston Cup
race and also ran in a NASCAR Late Model event at the old track.
Bonnett even had to borrow one of Kanke's back-up cars to compete
in the Late Model race. Not that it really mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke had the fastest car of the night, winning the Late Model
race and holding off Earnhardt, who finished second. Earnhardt went
on to win his first NASCAR Winston Cup points title later that
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Earnhardt were battling all night long,'' Kanke said.
``It was a lot of fun, probably the highlight of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday in front of rookies: Ron Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale
reclaimed the rookie lead in the NASCAR Busch Grand National
Division with a fourth-place finish at the Textilease/Medique 300
at South Boston Speedway on Saturday. Hornaday had fallen to second
for the first time this season in the rookie standings after the
Dover Downs International Speedway race on June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday and his team liked the results in the NAPA Auto Parts
Chevrolet at South Boston so much that they are taking the same car
to Myrtle Beach this weekend. However, the car needs a little body
work after Hornaday narrowly escaped two disasters at South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This car is the best short-track car we have,'' Hornaday said.
``The damage to the nose was just cosmetic and isn't that hard to
repair. This car just had the right feel. I could feel the car for
the first time all year and that made adjustments a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really looking forward to Myrtle Beach. We tested very
well there and I expect to have a shot at the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, who is also fourth in championship points and
searching for his first victory on the Busch series, leads Kevin
Harvick of Bakersfield by five points in the rookie standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Myrtle Beach 250 at Myrtle Beach Speedway is on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth time's a habit: It's becoming automatic for Rip Michels
of Mission Hills in the NASCAR Grand American Modified division at
Irwindale Speedway. Michels won for the fourth straight time on
Saturday night, finishing ahead of Travis Thirkettle of Sylmar for
the second week in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In other action at Irwindale Speedway, David Gilliland won the
Food 4 Less NASCAR Super Late Model main event; Gary Scheuerell of
Temecula won the Legends Cars main event and Bill Helgeson of
Riverside won the Ultra Wheels Spec Trucks main event.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders on USAC Midget circuits: Jay Drake of Val Verde
closed the gap Saturday on Kasey Kahne in the USAC MCI Worldcom
National Midget Car series standings, while Bobby Boone lost some
ground in his drive toward the USAC Western Midget Car series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Both USAC classes were at Heartland Park Topeka in Kansas for
the races. Drake won the National Midget Car race and closed to
within a point of Kahne, the series leader, who finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, who has a 36-point lead in the Western Midget Car
standings, had mechanical problems and failed to qualify for the
Topeka race.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop for the National and Western Midgets is at Pikes Peak
International Raceway this weekend. In addition to the Midget
races, the Indy Racing Northern Lights Series Radisson Indy 200
will be at Pikes Peak.

   AFGHAN-MINES (Kandahar, Afghanistan) _ Afghanistan, one of the

million of the deadly devices concealed in the rocky soil _ about
one for every three of the nation's people. A mine-clearing
operation has in 10 years managed to reduce the number of maiming
explosions by half. Each day now, only 10 to 12 people make a

the Smithfield hog plant here is the value of a sharp knife. The
second thing you learn is that not everyone has to work with a
knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they all have
their separate stations, but it is blacks and Mexicans that are
left to battle over the dirty jobs at the factory, one of the only
places within a 50-mile radius in this muddy corner of North
Carolina where a person might make more than $8 an hour. While
Smithfield's profits nearly doubled over the past year, wages have
remained flat. So a lot of Americans have quit and a lot of
Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But the workers see
one another, more than management, as the problem, and they see the
competition in skin tones. By Charlie LeDuff.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Inside the Metrodome, a place where the sun never
shines, the Mariners offense finally started to see the light.
</P>
<P>
   The primary source of light in the Seattle attack these days
comes from center fielder Mike Cameron, who has been positively
incandescent lately.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night was center stage, the total spotlight. He had his
first career four-hit game, hit his first career grand slam and
matched his career best with five RBIs in the Mariners' 12-5 win
over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for this one,'' Cameron said. ``It seems
like I've been up a lot with the bases loaded this year. The
closest I got was a ball I hit off the wall, and all I got out of
that one was a single.''
</P>
<P>
   The center fielder did three bases better this time around by
sending the ball over the wall. That came in the second inning,
moments after Rickey Henderson's RBI single broke a 1-1 tie.
Cameron left the Mariners in charge with a 6-1 lead, and Seattle
had the game well in hand the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   For all their offense _ 18 hits, 12 runs _ Seattle scored in
just four innings. In three of those, Cameron was directly involved
in getting the offense to click.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. Cameron has reached base in 14 of his past 18
trips to the plate, with 10 hits and four walks. In that stretch,
he's also grounded out twice, struck out once and dropped down a
sacrifice bunt. He has two homers during the first seven games of
this 10-game road trip, the season's longest. The rest of the team
had three until Alex Rodriguez and John Olerud both hit two-run
shots in the ninth Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron showed the rest of the lads the way. Seattle has been
miserable hitting with the bases loaded (.224); he hit a homer with
the bases full. Seattle has been mediocre hitting with men in
scoring position (.276); he had a hit each of the three times he
came up with men in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   A .200 hitter on April 24, he goes into tonight's game with a
.293 average that includes nine homers and 25 RBIs since his April
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cammy's been great for us, defensively and offensively,''
Rodriguez said. ``He's been doing this all year. And as good as
he's been, we know he can be even better. We expect more from
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez expects more from himself, too. He took almost no
pleasure in his ninth-inning homer, which helped expand the comfort
level after the Twins had cut the lead to 8-5. Rodriguez's 18th
blast made it 10-5, but he couldn't forget his third-inning at-bat,
when he'd popped out with one out and the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homer is a little consolation,'' Rodriguez said. ``But
when you have the opportunity to put a team away like I did (in the
third) and you don't do it, it stays with you. I've got to do
better. We've got to do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to be in this (pennant race), we've got to be more
effective with our hits. We had something like 20 hits tonight, but
a lot of them didn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One item of note that had a great deal of meaning was the win,
which was credited to Rob Ramsay, of Vancouver, Wash., and
Washington State University. The lefty reliever, who took over
after starter Paul Abbott came down with cramps in his right
hamstring, won his first big-league game. It was a special moment,
and Ramsay's teammates didn't let him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we get our first? Did we get our first?'' Mark McLemore
said in a comic falsetto from across the clubhouse. He kept saying
it until he worked his way across the room to high-five Ramsay.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Ramsay's teammates were more upbeat about the win
than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to get the first one,'' Ramsay said. ``But you'd
like to think you earned the first one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay gave up two runs in 22/3 innings after Abbott allowed
just one run in four innings. Under baseball rules, the starting
pitcher must go five innings. Abbott couldn't _ ``I wanted to, but
nothing good would have come of it; I could only have hurt
myself,'' Abbott said _ so Ramsay took over and vultured the win,
the first for a Seattle reliever since Jose Mesa won on May 19
against Tampa Bay. Since then, Mariners relievers had been 0-6.
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Abbott isn't expected to knock him out of the
rotation, but his early exit meant the Mariners had to run through
more relievers than they'd have preferred. Ramsay, Frankie
Rodriguez, Arthur Rhodes and Jose Paniagua all pitched before the
Twins were put away for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about (adding) a 12th pitcher,'' manager
Lou Piniella said. ``But with the McLemore situation (McLemore is
due to serve a suspension early next week), I think we're going to
have to made do with 11.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager did make it clear that Abbott will eventually wind
up in the bullpen once starter Freddy Garcia comes off the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott would rather start, but he wasn't about to whine. He
didn't even let the win that could have been his, but wasn't,
impact his night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good for Ramsay,'' Abbott said. ``I'm glad I could
accommodate him.''

BROWN SHUTS OUT ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Center fielder Todd Hollandsworth made up for
nearly two weeks of missed time in one night and Kevin Brown made
sure some early run support was much appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth led off the bottom of the first with a homer and
had three hits and Brown threw his first shutout of the season as
the Dodgers beat Arizona 4-0 to earn a split in the four-game
series Thursday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (6-2) allowed four hits, struck out a season-high 10 and
didn't issue a walk. Gary Sheffield added a two-run homer and leads
the Dodgers with 19 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good,'' Brown said. ``I don't know if you'll
ever get in a situation, or they're very few and far between, where
you walk out there and say, 'Oh, my goodness. I feel so good
they've got no chance.' It's just a matter of trying to make do
with what you've got that night.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Brown's 17th career shutout and second since joining the
Dodgers. He beat the Chicago Cubs 6-0 Sept. 4, 1999. At one point,
Brown retired 13 straight Arizona hitters with only one ball
leaving the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown was something else,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``He's turning it up a notch, kind of raising the bar up. He
was filthy. He was in complete command of the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Dodgers are without Todd Hundley and Adrian
Beltre, considering they lost the series opener, and considering
Carlos Perez had to oppose Randy Johnson the day before, the
Dodgers will certainly take the split.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a pathetic part to the series. With NL
West-leading Arizona in town for a quartet of games, the Dodgers
averaged 29,264 per game, including 30,103 for the finale. But the
Dodgers ended the series as they began it, two games behind the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're banged up ... and just to be able to hold on with the
leaders in the division is important,'' Johnson said. ``Not only in
the standings but psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown made sure of the series split by throwing his third
straight complete game. Brown's won four of his last five decisions
and with the effort against Arizona, he lowered his ERA from 2.41
to 2.18.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers gave Brown all he would need in the first.
Hollandsworth, who pulled his right hamstring June 3 in Anaheim and
hadn't played since, led off a game with a homer for the fourth
time this season. Hollandsworth singled in the second and doubled
in the fifth, but his bid to become the second Los Angeles Dodger
to hit for the cycle (Wes Parker did it in 1970) ended when he
popped out to third in the seventh. He also made a catch against
the center-field fence off Bernard Gilkey in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek singled to center and Sheffield
homered to center field to make it 3-0.

ALI'S DAUGHTER WINS IN FIRST ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One thing about Laila Ali. She may or may not be a
legitimate boxer, but her name certainly is.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old daughter of Muhammad Ali packed the Universal
Amphitheatre on Thursday night and delivered a first-round knockout
of Milwaukee's Marjorie Jones - and the crowd of 3,845 loved every
minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one minute and eight seconds. That's how long it took Ali
(7-0, seven knockouts), a 173-pound former nail salon owner from
Los Angeles, to dispose of the embarrassingly inept Jones (2-5),
whose peculiar style of leading with her chin wasn't exactly a
model of textbook boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Ali knocked down Jones three times, the first in eight seconds,
finishing her with a right to the jaw, as proud papa looked on from
the first row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice being here in front of my family,'' she said, ``but
I told the ref to let me knock her out cold. I didn't even break a
sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main event - in name only - Carlos Navarro of Los Angeles
retained his IBA junior lightweight title by knocking out Nestor
Lopez (Tabasco, Mexico) at 2:19 in the ninth round.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro (22-1, 17 knockouts) spent most of the evening chasing
Lopez (19-7, 15 knockouts) before finally pinning him against the
ropes and putting him away with a crisp right cross.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, hurt for the first time by a series of body shots a round
earlier, went down for the 10 count and never attempted to get back
on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Oba Carr improved to 51-3-1 with a unanimous 10-round
decision over Juan Soberanes (Culiacan, Mexico). Soberanes
(44-25-2) went down in the fifth and was in trouble in the sixth
but rebounded to briefly hurt heavily favored Carr in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Cruiserweights Ted Cofie (Nottingham, England) and George
Ibidiro (Las Vegas) opened with a six-round draw. Cofie is 15-4-2;
Ibidiro is 3-5-1.

AFTER 14 ON 18, DALY PACKS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ John Daly added to his collection of
surreal golfing accomplishments yesterday while competing in a
surreal setting.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in a heavy fog, Daly closed his opening round with a 14
on the par-5 18th hole, then closed the books on his bid to win the
U.S. Open at Pebble Beach Golf Links.
</P>
<P>
   Daly withdrew after posting an 83, his highest score at the Open
since a first-round 88 in 1986. In reaching a 12-over-par total,
Daly did most of his damage at No. 18. He headed to the tee box at
3 over and putted out at 12 over.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way to posting a 14, Daly hit his first tee shot out
of bounds to the right. He pulled two additional tee shots into the
Pacific Ocean before landing a 5-iron in the fairway. With
penalties, that was his seventh stroke. Daly laid up roughly 115
yards from the green, then pulled his approach into the ocean.
After another penalty stroke, he dropped in a greenside bunker and
was forced to play his 10th shot left-handed when his ball wound up
next to the seawall. He advanced the ball slightly, then hit a sand
wedge to 20 feet on his 12th stroke. From there, he two-putted.
</P>
<P>
   It marked Daly's highest score on a hole since he took an 18 at
No. 6 during the 1998 Bay Hill Invitational in Orlando, Fla. After
completing his round, Daly withdrew from the tournament and left
the course without comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' said Rocco Mediate, one of Daly's playing
partners. ``I didn't know \Rabout the 14\S. I thought it was a
seven or eight.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 Open, Daly received a two-stroke penalty for
hitting a moving ball after an uphill putt did a U-turn and rolled
back toward him at Pinehurst (N.C.) Country Club. \Nsubheds:Erratic
Sutton Hal Sutton began his day by holing an 8-iron approach for
eagle, then added two birdies in the next three holes. He finished
with five birdies but offset them with three bogeys and a
double-bogey at the par-5 14th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, the only person other than leader Tiger Woods to reach 6
under during the opening round, finished at 2-under 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Sutton, who flew the green at No. 14
and took double-bogey from the deep rough. ``I hit a couple of
shots that I paid the price for. I'll just have to regroup.''
\Nsubheds:Shots in the dark Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks began
warming up before dawn's early light in preparation for yesterday's
6:30 a.m. (PDT) tee time, the earliest start of his professional
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first golfer on the range, at 5:15, and it was still
dark,'' said Brooks, who pushed the first competitive shot of the
2000 U.S. Open into the right rough but rallied to par the hole.
``That's too early for me. This is just an observation, but I think
7 o'clock is plenty early to start. At least it would have been
daylight when we got to the range.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who was greeted by 50 fans at the first tee, said the
early start did not create a problem with shadows on the greens or
play a role in his opening 74. Instead, Brooks found only eight of
18 greens in regulation and took bogeys on both back-nine par-5s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed some good chances there,'' said Brooks, whose
approach at the par-5 14th hit within a foot of the pin but bounded
into the deep rough behind the green. ``Overall, I played decent. I
hit three bad shots, and that's the difference between what I shot
and even-par.'' \Nsubheds:Campbell rises, falls Chad Campbell, an
Andrews native and five-event winner on the 2000 Hooters Tour,
surfaced briefly on the leader board after a birdie on the sixth
hole moved him to even-par and gave him a share of 10th place.
Campbell made only one birdie the rest of the way, fading to 74,
but said he was pleased because he ``got pretty much everything I
could'' out of a round where he hit only 10 of 18 greens in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed in my score,'' Campbell said. ``I just
need to keep the ball out of the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, 26, said he never felt awed by playing his first
competitive round at Pebble Beach. But his caddie, Fort Worth
resident Jud Burkett, termed the walk between the ropes ``really
cool.'' Burkett, a former UT-Arlington golfer, wore a Colonial cap
during the round. \Nsubheds:Jobe surges late Brandt Jobe, a
Southlake resident, said he avoided ``a complete mess'' by
collecting four birdies in his final six holes during a round of
72. Jobe reached 5-over par with a double-bogey at No. 10 and said
he ``was ready to keep walking'' back to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But he stabilized matters with a 15-foot birdie putt at No. 13,
added another on the next hole and closed with consecutive birdies
at Nos. 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long way to come back,'' said Jobe, who has missed
the cut in three of his past five PGA Tour events. ``It was a nice
way to end the day. That kept me in the tournament.''
\Nsubheds:Briefly Afternoon starters endured a 21/2-hour fog delay
before play was suspended. As a result, 75 players must return
beginning at 6:45 a.m. (PDT) today to complete their opening
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Sergio Garcia wore knickers in honor of the late Payne
Stewart, the 1999 Open champ.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, on playing partner Jesper Parnevik's bright orange
shirt: ``You could see him in the fog, for sure. He was our
defense, so no one could hit into us.'' nn

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Bobby Clampett redefined the concept of
role reversals in professional golf yesterday at Pebble Beach Golf
Links. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clampett, a CBS golf analyst, helped describe Tiger Woods'
historic comeback from a seven-stroke deficit to win a sixth
consecutive PGA Tour event at Pebble Beach in February. Four months
later, Clampett has emered as one of Woods' primary roadblocks in
winning a U.S. Open on the same course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Playing in only his second professional tournament in the past
21 months, Clampett collected four birdies and a bogey. He posted a
68 in his first round at the Open since 1986 and stands three
strokes behind Woods. Among the golfers who completed play in
yesterday's fog-shrouded opening round, only three finished ahead
of Clampett. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clampett, who retired from the PGA Tour in 1995 and has only
played about one round per month for the past two years, said he
considered his startling success ``a gift from God.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can't describe my emotions right now,'' said Clampett,
40, who choked back tears on the ninth green after draining a
25-foot, downhill birdie putt to move within a stroke of the lead.
``Is this unbelievable, or what? The first 10 holes were like
playing golf in heaven. Even the putts I hit too hard went in.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of those occurred at No. 10, a sliding 10-footer that put
him _ briefly _ in a tie for the lead with Hal Sutton at 4 under.
With a chance to take a solo lead, Clampett missed a two-foot
birdie attempt at No. 13, which he termed ``my only bad stroke of
the day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clampett collected his only bogey after visiting a greenside
bunker at No. 16, which hardly diminished the enthusiasm of the
Carmel, Calif. native, who grew up playing at Pebble Beach. As a
tour rookie, Clampett finished third in the 1982 Open at Pebble
Beach. But his swing soured, causing Clampett to turn to the
television booth in recent years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He attempted to qualify for this year's Open only because it was
at Pebble Beach and because NBC, not CBS, is handling the weekend
broadcasts. That provided Clampett a week off, which has begun
unfolding in a manner Clampett said he would not have envisioned in
his wildest dreams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nantz, CBS' lead golf announcer who traveled to Pebble Beach
to follow Clampett, said his colleague ``just delivered the most
special, most unexpected round of the year'' in professional golf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is amazing stuff,'' Nantz said. ``The guy is retired. He
had to qualify to get here. He's the ultimate underdog, everyman
golfer. And he just shot 68 at the Open.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he left the course, Clampett exchanged hugs with family
members, as well as Nantz. He reflected on his lifelong goal: to
win a U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, his home course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream is still alive,'' Clampett said, smiling broadly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For one more day at least. &QL;

   ``One of the best movies I've ever seen,'' says the architect of
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, West felt relaxed enough to watch Game 4 at
his home in Bel Air, and the epic battle that went to the Lakers in
overtime left a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best games I've ever seen,'' says the man who on
June 26, 1996 traded Vlade Divac to the Charlotte Hornets for a
17-year-old high school senior named Kobe Bryant and three weeks
later convinced Shaquille O'Neal to sign with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the vital contributions West has made in putting
together these Lakers, you would think that West would be basking
in the limelight of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   You would think he would be getting vast television exposure,
and would be the feature subject in off-day articles of the some
1,000 newspaper reporters on hand for the Laker-Pacer series.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that the NBC TV cameras would be zooming in on
him during games as he sat in the crowd either at Staples Center or
Conseco Fieldhouse. But Jerry West hasn't even attended a game yet.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago he was in Chicago at an NBA Draft combine.
</P>
<P>
   This week he has remained in Los Angeles, even though the Lakers
were conducting their business in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just better for me from a health standpoint to stay
away,'' says West, whose stress level has been known to get
dangerously high during Laker games.
</P>
<P>
   West isn't surprised that the Lakers hold a 3-1 advantage over
the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a better team,'' he says simply. ``I think right
now that we have two of the five best players in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   West isn't given to loosely throwing out bouquets, but the stout
work of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant has him doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has been unstoppable ... no one can handle him,'' says
West. ``He's taken his game to a level few centers in basketball
history have been able to reach. And his discipline and restraint
are so impressive. Remember, this is a man who routinely gets
flagrantly fouled, but because of his size it's seldom ever called.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Kobe, it speaks volumes of him that his teammates
wanted him to have the ball in overtime. I think having him back
gave the team renewed confidence. It also put less of a burden on
our role players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable to see the way Kobe has grown and matured. I
think the fans of L.A. are fortunate to get to see Kobe go from
being a teenager to an adult. And he's going to get better and
better in the upcoming seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West has made many deft moves across the seasons in his
position as executive vice president for basketball operations for
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But his greatest legacy as an executive might turn out to be
Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw Kobe in a workout, he was so spectacular that I
felt we had to get him regardless of the cost,'' says West.
</P>
<P>
   The cost was modest, and the Lakers are benefiting from West's
keen foresight.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, the Lakers wouldn't be on the doorstep of their
first NBA title since 1988. ...
</P>
<P>
   - I've never seen Shaqille O'Neal expend as much energy at both
ends of the court as he did during his 36-point, 21-rebound
performance Wednesday evening against the Pacers. I'll be surprised
if he can repeat such a passionate effort tonight. ...
</P>
<P>
   - I'm going to say it again to those over-50 types immersed
hopelessly in the fog of the past Shaquille O'Neal is better than
Wilt Chamberlain. ...
</P>
<P>
   - That proverbial torch just might have passed from Michael
Jordan to Kobe Bryant during that Game 4 overtime session in which
Bryant gave a rousing impersonation of Jordan. ...
</P>
<P>
   - Maybe it's just me, but I keep getting the feeling that the
NBC commentator, Doug Collins, fired once by the Chicago Bulls and
replaced by Phil Jackson, is rooting for the Pacers. ...
</P>
<P>
   - They say NBA superstars get special treatment from the
officials Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird certainly
did but that isn't the case with Shaquille O'Neal. He routinely
gets called for fouls that aren't called against the men who guard
him. ...
</P>
<P>
   - I still don't understand the reasoning behind Phil Jackson's
decision to start A.C. Green over Robert Horry. But I've never
understood the reasoning behind Green, badly past his prime, being
on the Laker roster in the first place. ...
</P>
<P>
   - In order for Sugar Shane Mosley to emerge victorious Saturday
night against Oscar De La Hoya, he will either have to knock De La
Hoya out or dominate him so thoroughly that the judges will have no
choice but to award him the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But if the fight is even faintly close, you can be sure that De
La Hoya's hand will be raised at the conclusion because De La Hoya
has all the political edges aligned on his side.
</P>
<P>
   While the California State Athletic Commission assigned the
officials referee Lou Moret and judges Pat Russell, Marty Sammon
and Lou Filippo you know all these men are quite aware that the
match is sanctioned by the WBC.
</P>
<P>
   And that Oscar De La Hoya holds the WBC title. And that the
WBC's biggest sanctioning fees come from De La Hoya's matches. And
that the WBC's president-for-life, Jose Sulaiman, has become close
pals with De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum. And that Sulaiman
assigns officials to work WBC title fights in faraway countries.
</P>
<P>
   And that no forthcoming cushy foreign assignment will be offered
by Sualiman to any official brazen enough Saturday night to cast
his ballot for Mosley in a close encounter. ...
</P>
<P>
   - Actually, on second thought, the one judge I doubt would be
swayed by such peripheral influences would be Lou Filippo, the
long-time Downey resident and ex pug who's a beacon of probity.
Filippo is a fiercely independent sort who gained lasting notoriety
for himself in April of 1987 when he was the lone judge to vote for
Marvelous Marvin Hagler in Hagler's split decision loss to Sugar
Ray Leonard. ...
</P>
<P>
   - Monsignor Gualderon's 17th annual St. Anthony's Golf Classic
will be staged Monday at Recreation Park. The famed Long Beach
religious icon has raised more than $480,000 in his charity event
for athletic equipment and student scholarships for St. Anthony
High. ...
</P>
<P>
   - But At Least He Doesn't Take Credit For The Salk Vaccine: He
hasn't scored a point, or grabbed a rebound for the Lakers, but
KFWB's dreaded Big Nasty, Joe McDonnell, feels he's had a major
impact in the team being on the brink of a world championship. ``I
give Jerry Buss credit for coming up with the money, I give Jerry
West credit for coming up with the players and I give myself credit
for kicking off the campaign to get Del Harris fired,'' says
McDonnell, never one to minimize his role on human events. ...
</P>
<P>
   The McDonnell-Douglas show, featuring Press-Telegram columnist
Doug Krikorian and radio personality Joe McDonnell, can be heard
Sunday evening on KABC (790 AM) between 9 p.m. and midnight.

NHRA SEASON HITS TOUGHEST STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lazy days of summertime?
</P>
<P>
   Not for National Hot Rod Association competitors, who beginning
with this weekend's Pontiac Excitement Nationals near Columbus,
Ohio, embark on the toughest portion of the 23-national event
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the heat just wears guys out,'' said Top Fuel veteran
Doug Herbert, referring to the eight-race summer season that also
includes stops at St. Louis, Denver and Sonoma before concluding
with the U.S. Nationals in early September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess over the years I've gained a lot of experience running
on slippery surfaces in some other racing circuits, so I'm not
afraid to try some things that others might not.''
</P>
<P>
   But mainly it's the hot, slippery track conditions that concern
drivers. The summer heat makes an already narrow tuning window even
smaller for crew chiefs who must find a way to tame their
6,000-horsepower machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat and less-than perfect racetracks should even out the
field a little bit, which then puts things more in the driver's
hands,'' veteran Funny Car pilot Whit Bazemore said. ``Instead of
just flooring it and seeing what the car will run, you'll see
pedaling contests, where two Funny Cars are fighting for traction.
In that case the better driver is going to win. I truly enjoy those
situations, and believe that could work in the Kendall/Matco team's
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows that better than nine-time Funny Car champ John
Force, who hasn't won at Columbus since 1990 and hasn't advanced to
the semifinals since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The track has) been marginal a lot of times over the years,''
said Austin Coil, Force's crew chief since 1984. ``The heat and
humidity in that location certainly has made it difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   -The NHRA is expected to release both its 2001 national event
and television schedule within the next month. Industry sources
indicate that the national event schedule will include major
changes, including a possible second date for Route 66 Raceway near
Chicago. Bristol Motor Speedway, which has hosted the special
non-points Winston Showdown the past two seasons, is expected to be
awarded a national event. The schedule would remain at 23 national
events with the second Chicago date and the Bristol event replacing
races at the Texas Motorplex near Dallas and the fall race at
Houston Raceway Park. Both of those facilities have hosted two
events since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's also speculated that The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway
will host that special event next season, possibly in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the television schedule are expected to include
coverage by ESPN, which will have a void to fill next season when
NASCAR Winston Cup begins a multi-year TV deal with NBC and Fox
Sports. Both ESPN2 and TNN, which have shared NHRA coverage this
season, will continue in that role in next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought NASCAR leap-frogged everybody 10 years
ago,'' Force said. ``I think (with NASCAR's) move to (NBC and Fox)
that has opened the door for us, if I got the story right. NHRA is
going to make a move. NHRA president Tom Compton has already proven
with the 90-percent nitro rule and the 75-minute rule that he can
make the right changes to make it better. Now there is going to be
a big announcement by NHRA. I don't know what it is, but I know
ESPN, ESPN2 has been around us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   -Glendora's Donnie Hendricks dominated a Castrol NHRA Junior
Drag Racing League event earlier this month, winning a pair of
races at the Jr. Dragsters West racetrack in Rialto on June 3-4.

TEEN HAS DRIVING AMBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy Brown addresses everyone around the race track as
``Mister'' or ``Sir.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old looks more like a tall 12-year-old. He's a
rail-thin, 5-foot-9, 120-pounder with peach fuzz. He will become a
West Covina High senior after today, when the semester ends. He
hopes to receive his first graduation present as a high school
senior on Saturday a victory when he races in the Mechanix Wear
Speed Truck series event at Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   But he's quickly gaining respect from the other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   A rookie in the series, Brown has yet to reach victory lane. But
he's come close. He was fourth at El Cajon Speedway two weeks ago,
is seventh in the series point standings and leads the rookie
points race by 12 points. He has made the Irwindale trophy dash
twice.
</P>
<P>
   All in eight races in the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just learning and gaining experience,'' Brown says. ``I
hope I'm gaining respect from the other drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is not Brown's first foray in racing, but it is the
first time he's raced in a NASCAR-style series and the first time
he's raced on asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has been racing since he was 9, won 10 quarter midget
series championships, four track titles at Pomona and four
California State Monza titles. But he could only race in the series
until he was 16, so late last year, his father, Bob, a former
racer, bought a Speed Truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seemed like the natural class to get into,'' Randy said.
``I think this could lead to Super Late Model and then Busch Grand
National.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brown raced until the death of his wife, Connie, 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I couldn't race any more and raise two children,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has a 19-year-old daughter, Wendy, and he helps Randy prepare
the truck as the crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone way beyond our expectations,'' Bob Brown said.
``We're tickled to death.''
</P>
<P>
   -A field of more than 100 cars is expected on Saturday, as
NASCAR Late Model, Super Stock and Mini Stock and the American
Racing Truck series take to the track.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary heat races will be run before the 7 p.m. opening
ceremonies. Gates open at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   -With the NASCAR Winston West Home Depot 250 at the speedway for
the first of three visits next week, teams have been testing at the
track. On the track Wednesday was defending series champion Sean
Woodside, who is in a one-race-only deal; Ben Walker, who is second
in Irwindale's Super Late Model points race; Jason Small, last
year's NWWS rookie of the year; and Eric Norris, son of actor Chuck
Norris. On Thursday, El Monte's Kenny Smith tested. Testing ends
today.
</P>
<P>
   -The Winston West series will hold a golf tournament to benefit
Motor Racing Outreach.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston West Open will be held June 23 at Azusa Greens
Country Club and an awards banquet will follow at Glendora
Performance Motorsports, which is the home of series driver Joe
Bean.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, which begins at 11:30 a.m., will include lunch,
prizes, raffles and gifts. The banquet will include food and music.

<P>
   The end of an era, it is said. And good riddance to it, if true.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad's 30-year dictatorship is honored for giving Syria
stability after years of political chaos. But it was stability of a
kind that most countries would gladly be without: an equilibrium
enforced by a coercive regime with the help of a dozen intelligence
agencies, which deprived people of free speech and led the economy
into a statist dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians, once in the van of Arab intellectual life, deserve
better.
</P>
<P>
   Does Bashar Assad, the son-of-dictator-about-to-be-president,
belong to the evanescent twilight of the old era, or does he usher
in a more enlightened one? Can he perhaps be helped to move from
one to the other?
</P>
<P>
   He seems decent enough: modest, intelligent, reform-minded. In
his brief apprenticeship, cut short by his father's death, before
taking his place in the Arab world's bizarre system of republican
dynasties, he set about modernizing Syria's antique economy,
introducing innovations such as mobile telephones and access to the
Internet, which had previously been considered too dangerous to
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Whether his open-mindedness extends to politics is still
unclear. But there is at least a chance that Syria's new president,
like Morocco's new king, will, after a respectful pause, try to
drag his country free from a father's leaden legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early for Bashar Assad to have made his opinions known
on foreign policy. His exposure to western ways, during his
training in Britain as an ophthalmologist, may make him an easier
man for outsiders to deal with than was his unbending father.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis will be mistaken, however, if they believe that the
son, any more than the father, will yield on the return of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israelis, whose public comments
have been less respectful of the dead Assad than most outsiders'
carefully phrased official epitaphs, seem divided on the timing of
their next approach.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israelis believe that the new Syrian regime must show
itself to have a fair-to-good chance of survival before there can
be any renewal of peace-seeking. And this, they wager, could take
months, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   An indefinite postponement is less worrying to Ehud Barak than
it would have been in his first months as Israel's prime minister,
when peace with Syria was his foreign-policy priority. But the
Syrian exchanges came to a rough halt and, with Israel's soldiers
safely out of Lebanon, the need is now less pressing.
</P>
<P>
   It was always known that it would be a struggle to get a Syrian
deal approved by a referendum in Israel, but now, with an
increasingly uncertain majority, Barak faces a struggle in
parliament too. This inhibits all peacemaking, including Barak's
ploy of playing the Syrians against the Palestinians and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, waiting for Syria to settle down will suit many
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   There is another way of looking at things. If Bashar Assad is
truly a reformer, bent on making his country a freer, more
forward-looking place, he needs help.
</P>
<P>
   A deal in which he completed his father's quest to win back the
Golan Heights would help remarkably. The agreement collapsed
because the Syrians insisted on getting the whole region back and
the Israelis insisted on retaining control of the Sea of Galilee's
shoreline. Both sides were stubborn, and emotional too.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever an issue called for some creative formulaic
solution, probably with an international ingredient, to save Syrian
honor while calming Israel's fears about its water, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Assad may well have been hoping for something along
those lines when he and U.S. President Bill Clinton had their
disastrous meeting in Geneva in March. After that meeting, it is
more difficult to get things right, but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bashar Assad has been crowned president (sorry, for that
should read: once the Syrian parliament has approved Assad's
nomination, and the Syrian people have accepted or rejected him,
and the results have been made known by the end of July), the
Syrian-Israeli peace track could be replayed _ but with a more
imaginative ending.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, who were put off by the unsmiling countenance of
Assad senior, should be able to expect a warmer face from the son.
And the Syrians, who will be on the lookout for signs of Bashar's
weakness, will have to be assured that the entire Golan Heights
will, at least in stages, become theirs once more.
</P>
<P>
   What has Barak to gain from embarking on a new formula-seeking
initiative? As Bashar Assad himself observed, in a rare interview
with a Saudi-owned newspaper shortly before his father died,
Israel's prime minister is in a weak position at home to make any
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the whole region, Israel included, stands to gain if
Syria can move out of the darkness that has eclipsed it for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad has inherited the presidency but may not be able to
keep it. His legitimacy is, at best, dubious. A second son, plucked
from his chosen career when his playboy elder brother was killed in
1994, he is inadequately groomed for the job, his support network
not yet in place. He belongs to a minority sect, resented by the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The corrupt old guard could oust him. But if it turns out that
he has indeed set his face in the direction of reform _ the
evidence as yet is slight _ outsiders have a strong interest in
encouraging him.
</P>
<P>
   Success could mean not only an Israeli-Syrian peace, but the
re-emergence of a Syria that was stable, and not because of fear. &QL;

<P>
   They met, they chatted, they may meet again soon. This week's
summit dispelled some of the personal chilliness between South
Korea's Kim Dae Jung and North Korea's Kim Jong Il. It made less of
an impression on the deep-frozen hostility that still divides the
two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years spent formally at war, they will have to make up
the rules of re-engagement as they go along, and cautiously. But
for South Koreans _ North Koreans are not at liberty to say _ the
summit has rekindled hope that divided families will be reunited
and that someday, somehow, preferably step-by-step and peacefully,
Korea will be too.
</P>
<P>
   After centuries of being leaned on by bigger neighbors, and
decades of being carved up between them, North and South Korea now
have a chance to regain some control over their joint destiny.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that these days the outsiders that matter, America,
Japan, China and Russia, all agree that the Cold War between the
two has lingered dangerously long into the post-Cold-War era.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving a measure of peace and predictability on the Korean
peninsula would remove one of the chief threats to East Asia's
stability. Yet even if the ice between North and South Korea really
does start to shift, there could still be some dangerous moments
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate the problems the two will face even if
they are sincerely bent on reconciliation. They understand little
of each other's ways.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is a developed, open-market, open-minded success. By
contrast, North Korea's Stalinist tendencies, combined with the
wacky juche (self-reliance) dogma of its leaders, have stranded it
on the wrong side of history. It is an impoverished, feudal place,
unable to feed its people, surviving off the charity of China and
handouts from America, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea long ago lost the battle of ideas with South Korea.
Yet, as the North has tottered closer to collapse, South Korea's
leaders have prudently set aside demands for early reunification,
offering instead to help repair North Korea's shattered economy.
This, they hope, will make eventual union a more manageable
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The southern Kim won his welcome in Pyongyang this week with
offers of investment and promises of big infrastructure projects.
North Korea can use all this sort of help it can get, and South
Korea is the only country offering it.
</P>
<P>
   So will North Korea grasp the South's helping hand? Despite this
week's smiles for the cameras, the northern Kim's intentions are
still unknown. He talks the language of reunification, but his
overriding aim is to keep himself and his cronies in power.
</P>
<P>
   His difficulty is that survival by means of good old-fashioned
repression is getting harder in a world where even the remaining
Marxists find they cannot insulate themselves from some of the
dictates of the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, on a surprise visit to China, he hinted that he
was toying with Chinese-style economic reforms at home.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea desperately needs a shakeup. Yet even a little
reform and opening up to affluent and democratic South Korea could
just as easily spell the end of the North's discredited regime.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea needs to proceed cautiously too. North Korea may not
want to run the risks of real reconciliation. It may simply want to
extract what economic concessions it can _ like the 200,000 tons of
fertilizer South Korea promised just before the summit _ and then
resume hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   If so, there would be little point in South Korea building roads
and bridges in the North only to see them used to ferry more tanks
and troops to their dangerously over-armed border.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be ruled out. North Korea is by now adept at
provoking crises and then demanding a payoff for defusing them
again.
</P>
<P>
   Few of them are in fact fully defused, certainly not the big one
relating to the North's nuclear ambitions, still less the newer one
caused by its testing of a long-range rocket over Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And even if North Korea is preparing to take a gamble on reform,
periodic upsets in relations _ whether calculated or miscalculated
in Pyongyang _ are probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   All the more so if, in the effort to keep North Korea talking,
South Korea lets tensions emerge with its two chief allies, America
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, North Korea has played these three off against each
other. By closing ranks in the past two years, they have helped
push North Korea to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet South Korea's capital, Seoul, is already in range of the
thousands of short-range rockets just over the border, so its Kim
is less worried where North Korea's new, longer-range missiles
might fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has the other Kim's attention, he would rather talk
about trade and family contacts, not the nuclear and missile
worries of his allies. But giving cash to North Korea without
making clear the consequences of its going too far will only
encourage more brinkmanship.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia, after years of shrugging their shoulders and
mostly leaving the crises between the Koreas for America to manage
alone, are now also keen to get in on the diplomatic act. They
could be of help.
</P>
<P>
   If North Korea really is ready to open up a bit to the South,
even the perversely self-reliant Kim will at times need China to
hold his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Keen not to be outdone, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has
invited himself to Pyongyang next month. Both have lately been
encouraging North Korea out of its bunker. But both also have their
differences with America, most recently over its plans for limited
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   They will now be tempted to use the opening between the Koreas
to pursue their rivalry with America for influence in the region.
That would be folly. Even without Chinese or Russian cover, North
Korea needs little encouragement to misbehave.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, its missile test two years ago is what prompted America
to pursue the missile defenses that so offend China and Russia. Yet
if he thinks they are keen to tweak America's nose, the northern
Kim may miscalculate he can get away with a lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Mishandled, there is still plenty of danger on the Korean
peninsula to damage everyone's security. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   So Tony Blair is mortal.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months Britain's prime minister has suffered a
series of reverses. His party was defeated in the local elections
and humiliated in the London mayoral election.
</P>
<P>
   An innocuous if incompetent speech by Blair to the Women's
Institute was heckled and slow-handclapped. The Tories under
William Hague have found their voice and closed to within three
points in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Blair entered 10 Downing Street, it is
imaginable that Labour could actually lose the next election.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects Blair commands sympathy. His overall record is
creditable _ particularly on the economy. He showed courage over
Northern Ireland and Kosovo. Some of his domestic reforms,
especially his efforts to raise standards in schools, are
important.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a certain justice in the difficulties New Labour
has encountered. The party based its appeal on wildly overblown
political rhetoric. Its problems are rooted in a growing public
realization of the gap between all that talk and reality.
</P>
<P>
   Blairite hyperbole has taken a variety of forms. During the 1997
election, New Labour lamented 18 ``wasted'' years of Tory
government and bewailed ``savage cuts'' in public services.
</P>
<P>
   In power, Blair has continued to indulge his taste for
evangelical, transformational exuberance _ promising to
``modernize'' all he sees, to make Britain the envy of the world
and a ``model country for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also made some specific rash promises _ to end waiting
lists in the National Health Service and eradicate child poverty,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Labour's electoral pitch was always contradictory. Blair managed
simultaneously to denounce the legacy of the Tories, and to assure
the electorate that he would preserve its most important features:
low taxes, light regulation, privatization.
</P>
<P>
   In government the chasm between all the talk of revolutionary
change and the reality of moderate continuity has begun to dawn on
people and wear them down.
</P>
<P>
   New Labour has been genuinely radical in reforming the
constitution. But the party's key promise was that it would revive
Britain's public services _ health and education, especially. Blair
argued that voting for Labour was a matter of ``saving'' the NHS.
</P>
<P>
   New Labour pressed home the idea that spending on the health
service had been cut under the Tories, and that money had been
wasted by the creation of an internal NHS market.
</P>
<P>
   All this was thoroughly disingenuous. Health spending under the
Tories had consistently risen in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   In power New Labour said it was dismantling the internal market;
in fact it has preserved, and arguably extended, its crucial
feature _ the split between purchasers and providers of health
services.
</P>
<P>
   For all his avowed radicalism, Blair's record on public services
is essentially one of pragmatic, well-intentioned conservatism.
While he is in thrall to ``modernization,'' he seems to have no
interest in reforming the fundamental structures of key state-run
institutions like the NHS or the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Truly radical ideas _ like expanding the role of the private
sector in the provision of health, or introducing education
vouchers _ remain firmly off the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's approach is to try to make existing institutions work
better by increasing public spending and taxation, and by
tightening central control in the name of spreading ``best
practice.'' This is a perfectly respectable way of trying to deal
with issues like health and education, though one that is likely in
the end to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate difficulty for Blair is that he appeared to be
promising so much more than a program of cautious, tax-raising
pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Even now he still feels driven to dress his policies up in
grand-sounding, ``deeply personal'' and embarrassingly half-baked
political philosophy: the ``third way'' (yawn) and all that.
</P>
<P>
   If British voters are beginning to tire of this blather, he
should not be surprised: they have done well to put up with it this
long. &QL;

<P>
   Few things, you might think, are as enduring as a national stock
exchange. From pillared entrance to pulsating floor, they display
an institutional solidity that can surely defy forces for change.
</P>
<P>
   And yet most of the world's bourses are now in turmoil, as they
scrabble to be seen making alliances or mergers, to fend off
electronic competitors, or simply to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even New York, the biggest of the lot, is worried; while London,
the biggest in Europe, seems to lurch from one misstep to another.
</P>
<P>
   Two outside forces have come together to create all this
turmoil. The first is electronic. The growing power of the computer
and the spread of the Internet have made share-dealing easier and
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been increased pressure on intermediaries,
whether stockbrokers or exchanges, to cut their costs. Another has
been the arrival of competition for organized stock exchanges in
the shape of entirely new electronic markets.
</P>
<P>
   The second force is a growing desire on the part of investors,
companies and investment banks to move beyond national borders for
trading shares and raising capital _ and to do it more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   This is expressed most strongly in Europe, where the arrival of
the euro has made the notion of running separate national stock
exchanges seem increasingly pointless.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger goal is global: to move towards a 24-hour market
for blue-chip shares in the world's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   The established exchanges are keen to work towards this, not
least because, if they do not, those upstart electronic newcomers
might get there first.
</P>
<P>
   Why has such a global marketplace not been created before?
Shares in, say, IBM or Microsoft are widely held by foreign
investors. Commodities and foreign exchange are traded around the
globe, so why not equities?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies partly in conservatism on the part of investors
and issuers, partly in national regulation and accounting
standards, and partly in downright protectionism on the part of
exchanges. All this is changing, albeit more slowly than it should.
</P>
<P>
   For all today's talk about globalization, most investors have
remained surprisingly parochial. Some fret about taking on foreign
exposure or currency risk. Others simply feel more comfortable
dealing in companies they know.
</P>
<P>
   But both investors and companies are learning the benefits of
spreading their risks across borders. It is already possible to
discern the makings of at least two global networks of exchanges
that are emerging in response.
</P>
<P>
   One, led by the New York Stock Exchange, would encompass
Euronext, the proposed merger of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels
bourses, and Tokyo; the other would be built around iX, the
putative London/Frankfurt merger and its associated joint venture
with New York's big rival, Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   A new electronic network may emerge. And it is equally possible
that, with all exchanges talking to all others almost all the time,
they might all get together, with the outcome being a single global
equity market.
</P>
<P>
   Previous experience, admittedly, suggests that more alliances or
mergers between stock exchanges are planned than carried to
fruition.
</P>
<P>
   The vested interests that own and control the bourses are hard
to satisfy; regulation of markets that operate across borders is
inevitably awkward, since it has long been jealously guarded at
national level; old-fashioned protectionism impels many governments
to preserve ``their'' stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is now irresistible pressure on the world's bourses to
find some way of going global. This raises issues of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   One is how such a market should be regulated. There is unlikely
to be a world Securities and Exchange Commission any time soon:
regulation will remain largely at national level. But national
regulators should be doing more together on such matters as common
listing requirements and international accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   This week's announcement of moves to enforce common accounting
standards across Europe is to be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   If such rules can be brought into greater harmony, fears of
damaging regulatory ``arbitrage'' _ with some investors or
companies seeking to take advantage of locations that have laxer
regulation _ may prove groundless. The evidence is anyway that most
participants prefer to deal on well-regulated markets.
</P>
<P>
   Another legitimate concern is whether a global market will make
it easier to achieve one stated aim of nationally regulated
exchanges: the best prices and execution for all investors.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that all investors, even small ones, will
ultimately benefit from the greater liquidity and lower costs that
a global market should bring.
</P>
<P>
   This will be especially true if clearing and settlement systems,
which account for a big chunk of share-dealing costs and are
especially burdensome for trades across borders, can be merged and
simplified.
</P>
<P>
   A longer-term question is whether to worry about the risk of a
single global stock market exercising monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Because trading always gravitates to whichever market has the
biggest share of liquidity, stock markets have a tendency to be
natural monopolies. They also have some of the characteristics of
public utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in stock markets, as in utilities, competition is often the
best way of forcing down costs and ensuring good service.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the rivalry between the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq has benefited both the American economy and the exchanges
themselves, so it would be better for the world to look for two
global equity markets rather than one.
</P>
<P>
   But, as national exchanges have found, even a monopoly is
vulnerable to attack by new rivals. So for now it would be better
if regulators, investors and stock exchanges worried less about the
impact of consolidation than about how to foster it. &QL;

<P>
   DAMASCUS _ When an Arab ruler dies, shutters are supposed to go
down and alcohol to disappear. Not so in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   The day after President Hafez Assad's death, locals took
advantage of their day off to pour into the city's most famous
ice-cream parlor, Bekdash, for a scoop and a natter. In the big
hotels, waiters kept offering their patrons extra mugs of beer.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a pro-Syrian mob smashed up a shop in neighboring
Lebanon for daring to serve falafel at such an emotional moment,
Damascene sandwich merchants were doing a roaring trade.
</P>
<P>
   There was mourning, of course, of an improbably exaggerated
sort. The official news agency described the dead president as ``a
giant immune castle'' who had ``wrestled hurricanes,'' a ``planet
that shone in the sky of Syria and the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few religious mystics demonstrated their despondency by
sticking swords through their more superfluous folds of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   As Assad's funeral procession passed, several women in the huge
crowd collapsed in fits of noisy anguish, while the more
rambunctious youths tried to rush the police cordon to touch the
coffin of the fallen leader.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little of the sort of personal, heartfelt grief
that overwhelmed many Jordanians at the death of King Hussein last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was more like that of a football match. Young men
in black headbands piled into cars and drove about town, honking
their horns, shouting slogans and waving flags and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Brass bands marched around the streets, churning out
semi-mournful, semi-martial music for appreciative crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The international response was equally halfhearted. Plenty of
Arab rulers made the trip, as did Iran's president Mohammad
Khatami. But Jacques Chirac, the president of France, was the only
western head of state to put in an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state, showed up, but
only after declaring that Syria must pursue democratic reforms and
a peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout, both western and Arab, was noticeably lower than at
the funerals of both King Hussein and King Hassan of Morocco _ a
good thing, perhaps, since Damascus has so few five-star hotel
rooms that the government had to kick out the existing guests to
put up their distinguished visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians seemed torn between their agony at the former ruler's
death and their elation at the new one's accession. A few muddled
up the names of father and son in their chants. Everyone agreed
firmly, however, that the bereaved young man would make a wonderful
leader. Why? Because he is his father's son. No other reason is
required.
</P>
<P>
   As one passerby put it, perfectly encapsulating Syrian politics,
``The decision has been made. We are just the people. We wait for
events to happen.'' &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ More than trees and houses have gone up in smoke at
Los Alamos in the seven weeks since a forestry-service fire ran out
of control and immolated a large tract of the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent casualty is, at a minimum, the reputation of
America's most famous nuclear weapons laboratory for guarding its
secrets, and at worst, a chink in the country's defenses against
nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer hard drives, carrying details of American and
Russian nuclear weapons, as well as simpler devices that might be
put together by less sophisticated engineers, are missing.
</P>
<P>
   The drives, each the size of a pack of cards, are part of the
emergency kit kept at Los Alamos National Laboratory and at
Lawrence Livermore, its sister laboratory in California, and other
institutions within America's nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   They are intended to help the Nuclear Emergency Security Team
(NEST) defuse atomic bombs set by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was discovered on May 7 when two laboratory officials
retrieved one of three NEST kits from the security vault in which
they are kept just before fire overran Los Alamos and forced the
laboratory to close. The drives had last been seen at an inventory
check a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The team did not report their discovery to the laboratory's
security department until May 31, a week after Los Alamos had
reopened for business after the fire, even though regulations
require that security breaches are reported within eight hours. The
bad news was then passed the next day to the Department of Energy,
which runs the nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The loss _ and the delay in reporting it _ has infuriated the
Republicans. Los Alamos and the Energy Department were already
under scrutiny for the behavior of Wen Ho Lee, a physicist at the
laboratory who was indicted in December last year for allegedly
transferring classified weapons data on to insecure computers and
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also moan that Bill Richardson, the secretary of
energy, has frustrated their efforts to tighten security by
appointing his own departmental security staff to the top jobs in
the eight-month old National Nuclear Security Administration, which
was supposed to have independent oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The new scandal has not helped Richardson. The baying
Republicans are unimpressed by the bipartisan inquiry that he has
set up into the fate of the drives.
</P>
<P>
   One habitual critic, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, claims to know
of ``physical evidence to suggest theft,'' but has not elaborated.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which is investigating, has not ruled out espionage,
but there has been as much opportunity for carelessness as
criminality. About 86 people had access to the vault, and 26 of
them were cleared to visit it alone. No log was kept of what went
in or out.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drives were kept in locked bags, the keys were
attached to them, and spare sets hung on the wall of the vault.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13 the director of Los Alamos suspended the head of the
weapons division and five managers, while the FBI is planning to
give lie-detector tests to everyone who had access to the vault.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy has a hard time competing with human muddle in the face
of new technology. Britain's spies have run into trouble over
laptop computers left in trains and pubs. John Deutch, a former
head of the CIA, was caught keeping secret documents on his home
computer that he used for surfing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos's lost hard drives may yet turn up at the bottom of
someone's briefcase. Meanwhile, the ghost of Richard Feynman, a Los
Alamos physicist and prankster who used to trick his colleagues on
the original atomic bomb project by cracking safes containing their
classified documents, must be chuckling somewhere. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ At the center of Al Gore's presidential campaign is
a hole _ and it isn't the candidate's personality. The vice
president, the policy wonk's policy wonk, is weak just where he
should be strong: in defining what policies a future Gore
administration would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Fuerth, his national security adviser, says Gore's greatest
asset is his ability to spot changes before they appear on the
horizon, master the details, think out the policy implications and
then create the sort of environment in which policies can make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   There is something in this: Gore saw the significance of the
Internet and global warming long before most. But that makes it all
the stranger that the vice president is showing so few signs of
this skill in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks, the debate has proceeded as follows.
George W. Bush lays out one policy proposal after another:
education (he wants more competition between different types of
school); Social Security (he wants workers to put a share of their
payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts); nuclear weapons
(he proposes deep, unilateral cuts by America, and says it should
build a big nuclear defense shield unilaterally if need be).
</P>
<P>
   Gore's reaction? He barely tries to offer competing ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he brushes Bush's proposals away with the same mantra,
``a risky education scheme'', ``a risky retirement scheme,'' ``a
risky...'' _ you get the idea. He then proceeds to talk about the
success of the American economy over the past eight years. It is an
appeal that combines the defense of unreformed entitlement programs
with an exaggerated fear of change.
</P>
<P>
   In one way this is understandable, even sensible. The most
powerful argument in support of Gore's presidential bid is that the
economy is in great shape (which is true), that the administration
is largely responsible for this (debatable), and that to change
horses in midstream would endanger American prosperity (well, worth
a try).
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing Bush's ideas ``risky'' underlines Gore's reputation as a
safe pair of hands. It does not necessarily mean Gore is devoid of
ideas. (Indeed one reason why Bush has had to come up with all his
ideas is to counteract the idea that he is the shallower figure.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore could defend his campaign in two other ways.
First, he could say that if he is being too timid, that is merely a
reflection of the inevitable difficulty of running as a sitting
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Any such unfortunate wants to claim credit for the achievements
of the current administration while simultaneously showing his
future government would not be a clone of the existing one.
Striking the right balance is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more substantially, he could argue that he is right
on individual issues _ that privatizing Social Security and
encouraging school choice are both bad ideas; and that you should
be especially cautious about policy departures when the economy is
doing well.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if you accept this latter argument, that is still
not the end of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even if, one by one, the attacks on Bush's policies strike home,
the cumulative effect of this negative approach is disappointing
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   First, note that the difference between Gore and Bush on policy
matters is built into their campaigns. Bush has created the post of
policy coordinator for Joshua Bolten, a former director at Goldman
Sachs, and given him real influence.
</P>
<P>
   Bolten has created a sort of think-tank in Austin, with a staff
of about 20 busy young people dreaming up new ideas and borrowing
from other people (including Democrats).
</P>
<P>
   Gore has formidable figures to call on if he wanted to, notably
Larry Summers, the Treasury secretary, and Richard Holbrooke,
America's U.N. ambassador. He also has a policy coordinator: Elaine
Kamarck, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government who worked
with Gore on his project to ``reinvent government.'' But she has no
formal group around her.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, campaign tacticians dominate Gore's operation. Their
skill lies in slicing the American electorate up like salami and
tailoring the candidate's appeal to a series of individual interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's tactics-driven campaign seems to have originally derived
from a miscalculation. He underestimated Bush, thinking that no
serious intellectual competition was likely from that quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the summer wears on, the supremacy of campaign
tactics over policy development is undermining Fuerth's argument
that Gore can see beyond the immediate horizon and producing the
opposite impression: that the vice president is pandering to
entrenched interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, both he and Bush proposed similar ideas for
``digitizing government'' (they want to apply new information
technology to the backrooms of government departments).
</P>
<P>
   This idea was first put forward by the Progressive Policy
Institute, a think-tank close to Gore. Yet it was Bush who adopted
the most dramatic part of the proposal _ to appoint an information
czar to force government bureaucracies to change.
</P>
<P>
   Gore balked at this _ apparently for fear of public-sector
unions. His opposition to school choice may also be influenced by
the strength of the teachers' unions in the Democratic Party. They
are against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   By stroking such groups while concentrating relentlessly on the
past eight years of boom, Gore seems to be saying that the election
is an occasion for the nation to express its grateful thanks to the
administration, rather than a opportunity for America to address
the sort of future concerns that, Fuerth claims, Gore is so good at
framing.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late to change. In June of 1988, Vice President
George Bush was ten points behind in the polls _ a gap that widened
to 17 points by the time of the Republican Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But convention acceptance speeches are the occasions on which
candidates can define themselves as they want: the older Bush took
his chance to distance himself from his predecessor (as a ``kinder,
gentler Republican'') and went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can do the same thing. For Fuerth is right. Gore is good at
seeing around corners. But he needs to show that.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving all the running to Bush, he is increasing the burden
on his convention speech, and the chances that the next thing
around the corner will be his own defeat. &QL;

<P>
   CALGARY _ Canadians have long lived in fear of their country
being torn apart by the secession of French-speaking Quebec. But
today a bigger challenge to their tranquillity _ or complacency _
may come from Alberta, in the western prairies.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta's politicians are promoting a robust, American-style
agenda of less government, more individualism and more private
profit. And they are being successful enough to make opponents fear
that caring, consensual Canada might become a clone of its southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   With only 2.9 million people, Alberta is home to fewer than one
Canadian in ten. But it is booming: officials expect its economy to
grow by 5 percent this year, the fastest rate of any Canadian
province.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a flood of new migrants, the unemployment rate of 4.7
percent is the country's second-lowest. New industries are pouring
in and others are expanding: projects worth C$58 billion ($39
billion) are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new investment is going to Calgary. Long the home of
Canada's oil and gas business, the city has become a magnet for
high-tech companies and corporate head offices.
</P>
<P>
   It has displaced Montreal and Vancouver to become Canada's
biggest business and financial center after Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks fly on the steel girders of the new factories going up on
all sides, as huge earth-movers lay out new highways. New office
towers rise against the backdrop of the distant Rocky Mountains,
while on the city's northern edge, housing developments march
towards the foothills.
</P>
<P>
   All due to the ``Alberta advantage,'' says the province's
government, pointing to the lowest taxes in Canada, balanced
budgets (in fact, a record C$2.7 billion surplus last year) and a
skilled work force.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Alberta's legislature took two radical steps to
consolidate its advantage. Not only did it approve a bill allowing
limited private-sector participation in health care, but it passed
a law making Alberta the first province with a single provincial
income-tax rate, of 10.5 percent in its case _ Canada's answer to
the flat-tax idea of many Republicans in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics see Alberta's success as owing much to a strong
national economy, and especially to a surging oil price. Even so,
it is not surprising that Alberta's politicians should be touting
their model to the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, perhaps, is that over the past few years the
Albertan agenda, rather than that of Quebec, has come to dominate
Canada's national political debate.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous sign of the province's growing political
influence will come on June 24, when the Canadian Alliance, a new
national right-wing party, will hold a convention to chose its
first leader. The convention, appropriately enough, is to be held
in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance is a bold effort to reshape Canada's right by
merging Reform, a federal neo-conservative party of Albertan
origin, with sections of the Progressive Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three main candidates to lead the new party are from
Alberta: Preston Manning, who founded Reform in 1987, and Stockwell
Day, a former finance minister in the province. Neither man would
be out of place among America's Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Alberta has long been the most ``American'' of Canada's
provinces. It has been shaped by two influxes from south of the
border: first of ranchers and farmers, and then in the 1950s of
oilmen from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They have helped to imbue Alberta with conservative social
attitudes, Christian fundamentalism and anti-government political
views.
</P>
<P>
   But Alberta's dislike of big government also owes much to the
fact that for years it has paid for more than its fair share of it,
being the largest net contributor to the federal government's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albertans know who the enemy is, and it's Ottawa,'' says Tom
Flanagan, a political scientist at the University of Calgary (and a
supporter of Day's).
</P>
<P>
   In the past, other Canadians dismissed Albertans as ``redneck
cowboys.'' No longer.
</P>
<P>
   At the last national election, in 1997, Reform displaced the
more centrist Progressive Conservatives as Canada's main
opposition, winning 80 seats. Another Calgarian, Ralph Klein,
though a Conservative, as premier of Alberta since 1993 was the
first to put Reform's ideas into practice, slashing spending on
health and education and privatizing many government services.
</P>
<P>
   He has been copied by Ontario's Conservative premier, Mike
Harris, among whose advisers is Tom Long, the third candidate to
lead the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Liberal government has also espoused fiscal
responsibility, helped by several years of steady economic growth.
But many Canadians oppose any assault on their welfare state, and
especially their national health service (known as Medicare).
</P>
<P>
   In May, Klein's government alarmed such people when it pushed
through a new law allowing regional health authorities to contract
out routine operations, such as hip replacements, to private
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that this will cut costs and waiting
lists. Its critics disagree, seeing the law as the start of a move
towards an American-style, two-tier health service in which the
rich get faster, better, service at a price.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that American health-management companies may invoke
the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to force their way
into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, opponents of the new law staged nightly protests in
Edmonton, Alberta's capital. Just ``fear-mongering'' by a bunch of
``left-wing nuts,'' said Klein. But the health issue may serve to
limit the Alliance's national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the opinion polls, defending Medicare is Canadians'
top concern. Even a majority of Albertans oppose the new law. Both
Manning and Day favor expanding private health care.
</P>
<P>
   And all the Alliance's would-be leaders favor an Albertan-style
single-rate federal income tax (of 17 percent). They claim that it
would boost growth and prosperity, giving everyone a tax cut. But
as with private health care, the rich would benefit most.
</P>
<P>
   Such policies find favor with many United States Republicans.
But Canadians like to think they have a stronger sense of social
equity. Or has that changed? &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifty years after the credit card was invented in
Manhattan, its popularity knows no bounds. But the structure of the
industry supplying credit and other charge cards faces
unprecedented scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the trial began of an antitrust lawsuit launched by
America's Department of Justice (DOJ) against Visa and MasterCard,
which together account for around 75 percent of the country's $1.3
trillion credit-card market.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's antitrust watchdog also said it is probing
``Visa and credit cards in general.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, another trial will start, of a class-action suit by
many of America's retailers, seeking damages of $8.1 billion from
Visa and MasterCard for antitrust violations in the debit-card
business.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the card industry is uncompetitive may seem
bizarre to most consumers, particularly in America, where,
typically, a couple of card-solicitations arrive in the mail every
day. Almost anybody can get a card _ bankrupts, infants, even pets.
</P>
<P>
   If lack of opportunity for consumers were the alleged antitrust
violation, the charges would surely be thrown out more quickly than
you can say ``American Express.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is slightly more to the accusations than that. The DOJ
is unhappy for two main reasons. One is that it believes that Visa
and MasterCard are not really competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike American Express (Amex), a single company, and Discover,
owned solely by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Visa and MasterCard are
each owned mutually, by associations of thousands of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   These two associations operate under what is known as
``duality''; member banks are allowed to issue both Visa- and
MasterCard-branded plastic. According to the DoJ, this duality
means that the two leading brands are, in effect, one business.
</P>
<P>
   And second, the DOJ thinks that, although there is competition
between banks using their brands, the dominant market position of
MasterCard and Visa has enabled them to stifle competition from
rivals such as Amex and Discover, notably through exclusivity rules
forbidding banks from issuing rival cards.
</P>
<P>
   Since the DOJ launched its lawsuit in October 1998, the
Visa-MasterCard duality has started to unravel. In February 1999,
Citigroup, the world's biggest card-issuer, resigned from the board
of Visa; it is shifting all its business to MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the suit was started, John Reed, until recently
the joint-boss of Citi, admitted to Joel Klein, assistant
attorney-general, that it had been a mistake for banks to become
overlapping owners of both brands. He urged Klein, to no avail, to
give the industry more time to sort out the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan has since gone with MasterCard, while BankOne's
FirstUSA and Bank of America have thrown in their lot with Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the scene of the crime in this way might seem evidence
of guilt. Not necessarily. Some big banks have long wanted to
downplay the MasterCard and Visa connection, and increasingly their
cards emphasize their own brand.
</P>
<P>
   Some might even quietly welcome the antitrust action. They argue
that they have been subsidizing these two brands at the expense of
their own. The benefit has gone mainly to small banks, which have
been able to compete in the card business only because they carry
the MasterCard or Visa logos.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, one of the main arguments that the two brands offer
in their defense is that the DOJ's lawsuit could result in many of
these small banks leaving the industry, reducing competition.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that Visa and MasterCard do not compete vigorously
will be hard to prove. Internal documents suggesting this will be
submitted by the DOJ. They will be met with what is known in
antitrust circles as the ``demented middle-manager defense.''
</P>
<P>
   True, their advertisements do not criticize each other, though
they sometimes badmouth rivals such as Amex. On the other hand the
presence of competitors such as Amex means that the two cannot
afford to be an entirely cozy duopoly. Moreover, it is not clear
that the DOJ's action will increase competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The system of duality was actually introduced back in 1975 at
the behest of the DOJ, which then feared that Visa was becoming
dominant. As it unravels, the immediate impact has been to
strengthen Visa's position further. It had anyway increased its
market share, from 43 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 1999
(against MasterCard's 28 percent). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The argument that the current market structure inhibits
innovation has worked well for the DOJ in its case against
Microsoft. So it is no surprise to hear it used again in this case.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence suggests that innovation in the provision of
financial products to consumers has been more advanced in America
than in the rest of the world. It has been ahead in offering cards
to lower-quality borrowers, in varying interest rates and terms and
conditions, and in offering rewards and affinity programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Notable exceptions have been ``smart'' cards, which have had
more success elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The development of wireless products, such as Palm Pilots or
mobile phones that can download money from an ATM and digitally
transfer it to a retailer, is more advanced in Europe than America,
but that is probably because the wireless infrastructure is more
advanced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nor do Visa or MasterCard seem to be less innovative than rivals
such as Amex. They were quicker to introduce affinity programs,
such as MasterCard's pioneering tie-up with AT&AMP;T (no annual fee)
and its air-miles arrangement with American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   True, Amex has been first with its ``Blue'' smart card _ though
this is primarily a marketing coup, as the rest of the economy is
not yet smart enough to let it do much more than any other charge
card does.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ will also struggle to prove that merchants are paying
higher fees because of the dominance of Visa and MasterCard. Amex
has typically charged merchants more (though Discover has usually
been cheaper).
</P>
<P>
   Yet it will not be surprising if the DOJ succeeds in its attack
on the rules banning MasterCard and Visa's bank partners from using
other cards, if only because they look so dodgy.
</P>
<P>
   Such restrictive agreements are not always unacceptable: nobody
objects to Coca-Cola banning Pepsi from its soda fountains. And
banks can always choose to quit MasterCard and Visa if they want to
offer Amex cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic benefits claimed for the rules do not seem
large: if there were fewer small banks offering credit cards, would
they be missed?
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the case against MasterCard and Visa looks weak. But, in
contrast to the Microsoft suit, the result is unlikely to make much
difference, at least to consumers. &QL;

   TOKYO _ It looks for all the world like a rerun of the video
wars of the 1980s, when Sony's clever little Betamax cassette
recorder was eventually trounced by the Matsushita camp's clunkier
but more versatile VHS machine.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Japan's two consumer-electronics giants have been
girding up over the past few months to do battle again.
</P>
<P>
   And, appropriately enough, they are butting heads over which of
their digital video disc (DVD) recorder designs will replace the
aging video-cassette recorder (VCR) that they fought over a decade
and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difference today is that Sony and Matsushita may have left
it too late for either to gain any real advantage in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Delayed by wrangles with film studios and digital broadcasters
over how to prevent pirates from making pristine master copies of
their intellectual property, the two rival DVD recorders may turn
out to be obsolete even before going into mass production.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, Japanese manufacturers at last agreed on the
royalties to be paid to organizations that represent the
broadcasters and film producers. A 1 percent surcharge, with an
upper limit of Yen1,000 ($9.50), is to be added to the wholesale
price of all DVD recorders and blank discs, so that copyright
holders can be compensated for the copying done by legitimate
users.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Hollywood studios have accepted a copy-protection
scheme that allows them to decide whether their copyrighted
material can be copied freely, copied just once, or not copied at
all.
</P>
<P>
   With the royalty and copy-protection issues resolved, Japanese
manufacturers at last feel confident enough to start cranking up
production of DVD recorders and discs for the huge American market.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Matsushita has the upper hand. It had delayed
launching its DVD recorder until the copy-protection scheme that it
developed with Toshiba, IBM and Intel was accepted universally.
</P>
<P>
   The new Matsushita machine goes on sale in Japan on June 30, at
a list price of Yen250,000 ($2,375). The industry expects to ship
150,000 units by the end of the year, with a third of those going
to America.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping the gun, two of Sony's allies, Pioneer and Sharp, have
already launched video recorders based on variants of a rival
technology known in Japan as DVD-RW. But because their video
recorders use a copy-protection scheme that has not been accepted
abroad, they will have to develop wholly new models for export.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pioneer is pushing hard, Sony and other members of the
DVD-RW family are expected to miss this year's pre-Christmas rush
for DVD recorders in America.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, however, the advantage could swing back to the Sony
camp, thanks to a gamble taken on how digital video recorders will
be used.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD-RAM design adopted by Toshiba and Hitachi, as well as
Matsushita, functions as a replacement for both the VCR and the
recordable CD drive that is increasingly used in personal
computers. The advantage is that material recorded from a
television or video camera on a DVD-RAM disc can be edited on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, useful though that sounds, the DVD-RAM is not particularly
user-friendly, according to Masami Fujino, an industry watcher in
the Tokyo office of Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, a stockbroker. The
recording disc has to be stored in a special cartridge, making it
impossible to replay it on an ordinary DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 12 million DVD players in use around the
world, with a further 14 million expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the DVD-RW, developed originally by Sony in Japan
and Philips in the Netherlands, is a stand-alone product designed
solely to work as a replacement for the VCR. Besides being easy to
operate, its discs can be played back on existing DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   A DVD-RW machine can also record up to six hours' worth of
material, compared with its rival's more limited four hours.
</P>
<P>
   During the video wars of the 1980s, it was the longer recording
time of Matsushita's VHS that finally put paid to Sony's Betamax
design. But any success that the Sony/Philips offering might enjoy
is likely to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, a new recording technology will be in production that
uses a blue-green laser instead of the red one found in today's CD
players and DVD machines.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its much higher frequency, the blue-green laser will
cram three or four times more video on to a standard DVD disc _
enough, should it be needed, to record up to 24 hours of video at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody pondering what wondrous new gizmo should replace their
VCR had better wait. The latest episode of the video wars has
barely begun. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Why is the oil price shooting past $30 a barrel yet
again?
</P>
<P>
   When, three months ago, prices last soared so high, the
explanation was clear: demand outstripped supply by some 2 million
barrels a day. Big consuming countries such as the United States
then bullied the OPEC cartel into agreeing to boost output by about
1.5 million barrels a day at its meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
   As that oil came on to the market, prices fell sharply. Yet, in
recent days, they have shot up once again.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC ministers are due to meet again on June 21 in Vienna.
Predictably, big oil importers are pushing for another large output
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Priddle, head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), a
quasi-official group representing rich countries, this week said
that ``$31 Brent is not a signal of an adequately supplied
market.'' This time around, though, the cartel seems unlikely to
increase output by much.
</P>
<P>
   One telling portent was the collapse of its ``price band''
scheme last week. After the March meeting, OPEC ministers revealed
an ambitious new scheme to keep oil inside a target band of $22-28
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   If the price of a basket of seven OPEC crudes stayed above $28
for 20 trading days, they explained, the cartel would raise its
production by a modest 500,000 barrels a day ``automatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Pundits and traders placed their bets, confident that the cartel
would not risk the blow to credibility that would come from
breaking its promise. Surprise: the criterion was met a few days
ago, but the cartel has yet to increase output one jot.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to think that the cartel will resist pressure to
raise output is that its members believe the American economy is
showing signs of starting to cool. They do not want to repeat their
mistake on the eve of Asia's economic crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then, OPEC expanded output, sending prices steadily down to
below $10 a barrel, and nearly bankrupting many producers.
</P>
<P>
   The best reason to think that OPEC will agree to raise output by
only a modest amount, if at all, is the answer to the question
raised by the IEA's latest analysis of the oil market: ``Why $30
oil?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Priddle's views on supply, his own agency's boffins do
not argue that high prices are chiefly the result of a lack of oil.
In fact, they seem to suggest the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand for oil in the second quarter will average about
74.4 million barrels a day, the agency reckons, but global supply
last month, thanks to a huge rise in Iraq's output, was running at
about 76.9 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, crude oil stocks in rich countries are rising fast.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is an accident of timing that has caused
shortages in the American gasoline sector, the world's single
biggest guzzler of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of gas were already low in March, and they have yet to
recover. Demand is still soaring, fuelled by the economic boom and
the arrival of warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   Awkwardly, the government has chosen this moment to order firms
to start selling cleaner types of gasoline in a number of cities.
Teething troubles at refineries producing the cleaner fuel have
interrupted supply and made the market tighter.
</P>
<P>
   All this explains why Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC's secretary-general,
insists that, even at their current levels, ``prices are not overly
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Most cartel members agree with this assertion, but _ as at the
previous OPEC meeting in March _ not Saudi Arabia. The cartel's
heavyweight is one of the few members with lots of spare capacity,
is anxious not to offend the United States, and has hinted that it
wants an increase of a million barrels a day or more.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Saudis get such a huge increase? Probably not as easily
as they did in March. But with this rancorous cartel, nothing is
ever wholly predictable. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ A visit to Christian Dior's glittering boutique on the
Avenue Montaigne is a powerful lesson in how to sell luxury.
Exquisite handbags hang like modern art in classic, silvered rooms.
The floors have been imported from a castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Elegant assistants talk lovingly about the hand-stitching and
les petites mains that still work above the shop. Ask them nicely
and they will show you a hidden, brocaded room where duchesses and
pop stars come to try on the latest catwalk creations from Dior's
fashion designer, John Galliano.
</P>
<P>
   In such a surreal atmosphere, paying $1,000 for a Dior handbag
seems, well, rather a snip. But would it on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   The question that many luxury-goods companies now face is
whether they can peddle their illusions online, where shoppers go
for low prices and convenience, not mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Next week LVMH, the luxury-goods conglomerate that runs the
House of Dior, will announce the launch of www.eluxury.com, a Web
site selling luxury goods at full price.
</P>
<P>
   The site will feature 60 brands _ 2,500 items in all,
distributed from a warehouse in Memphis, Tenn. _ including
LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton, Celine, Kors, Givenchy and TAG Heuer,
plus other big labels such as Bulgari, Ferragamo and La Perla. It
will have editorial and videos of catwalk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are other luxury-goods Web sites, most have been
unable to persuade labels to supply them with anything better than
limited, out-of-date ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is fear of discounting. As luxury e-tailers have cut
their prices to survive, the labels, fearing that cheap prices mean
a cheap image, have fled.
</P>
<P>
   Though LVMH competes directly with the likes of Bulgari, it has
a big advantage. It controls DFS, a global chain of 154 physical
stores, where its own brands sell happily side by side with their
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Ullman, managing director of LVMH, says that, because DFS
has existing relationships with these other labels, it has been
relatively easy to persuade them to set up shop in cyberspace. He
says too that he has learned caution from the failure of boo.com,
in which Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman, had a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new site's launch is next week, marketing will not
begin until the autumn. Yet, however cautious the site launch, the
Internet will never create the same illusion of prestige as a
physical store or a live catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that selling luxury on the Internet will simply
destroy the image that companies such as LVMH have invested so much
to create. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mere weeks ago, Mexico's banking system looked
sickly and unpromising. Now it has a rather different air.
Following the second of two big mergers, the industry is stronger,
more solid _ and distinctly more Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   On June 12 the board of the country's biggest bank, Bancomer,
decided to reject a purchase offer from the country's
second-biggest, Banamex, and accept one from Spain's Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), ending weeks of uncertainty in a battle
of bids unprecedented in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, on which Bancomer's shareholders will vote on
June 29, the Spanish bank's local subsidiary, BBV-Probursa, will
merge with Bancomer. Though BBVA's $2.5 billion offer will give it
only 32.2 percent of Bancomer's shares, it will run the show.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Gonzalez Naranjo, a vice-president at the CNBV, the
banking regulator, thinks the deal is ``very good news.'' A
Banamex-Bancomer merger would have given him and his colleagues
headaches, since the combined bank would have had some 40 percent
of Mexican deposits and nearly 70 percent each of both mortgages
and consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had warned that such a superbank could be a
systemic risk all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   The BBVA merger, on the other hand, will leave two of Mexico's
three biggest banks under Spanish control (last month BSCH, another
Spanish bank with a Mexican subsidiary, bought Serfin, Mexico's
number-three bank, which had gone into receivership last year).
</P>
<P>
   There was none of the nationalism that might once have blocked
such deals. A good thing too: the extra capital brought in by BSCH
and BBVA will clean up their new banks' balance sheets, which have
looked poorly since the economic crisis of 1994-95 sent many of
their borrowers into default.
</P>
<P>
   Banamex does not have access to bags of foreign capital, which
is one reason why Bancomer turned its offer down. Even so, after
selling some assets this year, it is expected, like the other two,
to meet new capital-adequacy rules set by the CNBV _ two years
before the new rules come into full force.
</P>
<P>
   All this, combined with the acquisition of Banpais by Banorte in
1997, has led to a more consolidated, not to say rejuvenated,
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the economic crisis, banks have lent little, partly
because of a lack of capital, and partly because they have been
reluctant to lend to risky borrowers under a legal system that
makes it hard to collect debts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks two badly needed laws, a bankruptcy law and a
loan-guarantee law, were passed after months stuck in Congress.
They are untested and the judicial system is still slow and
unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws should boost efforts to persuade banks to restart
lending _ though not until after the closely fought presidential
election in July has passed, the markets have calmed, and interest
rates have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish acquisitions, combined with the presence of
America's Citibank, mean that around half the banking system will
now be under foreign control, putting Mexico on a par with such
countries as Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign expertise may be good for all the banks. But not all
such investments go smoothly. Citibank is currently in a row with
the government over a $2.5 billion promissory note, acquired when
it bought Confia, another casualty of the economic crisis, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To save interest charges, the government wants to prepay the
note, but Citibank, which wants to keep the asset on its books,
says this goes against the spirit, if not the letter, of their
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish invaders will need to be sure they have read the
fine print in their contracts. &QL;

<P>
   EDMONTON, ALBERTA _ Since the great Klondike gold rush of a
century ago, this rugged corner of Canada has seen plenty of booms
and busts.
</P>
<P>
   The next big boom looks likely to come from the ``black gold''
that lies under the region's forests: oil sands.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Pond, a British explorer, ran into the local Cree
tribe in 1778, he found them caulking their canoes with the bitumen
that is common in these parts. Three decades ago, firms began
commercial exploitation of the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to advances in technology and declining costs of
production, optimists now think the region's huge reserves of this
mucky material could meet half of Canada's oil needs by 2010, up
from just a quarter five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of such a bonanza might explain the upbeat mood in
Calgary, Alberta's second city and arguably its real oil capital.
The World Petroleum Congress (WPC) met there this week, and many of
the thousands of participants came to find out about the oil sands
of northern Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   The oil is trapped in a viscous tar that is found under forests
the size of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   There is reckoned to be 300 billion barrels' worth of oil here,
greater than Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves; if brought to
market, it could fetch trillions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there's the snag: extracting the oil from the tar-like
bitumen (tar sands is what old lags call oil sands) is not as easy
as sticking a pipe into the Saudi desert. It takes over a ton of
bitumen to make one useful barrel of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet firms have invested some $33 billion in the area to turn oil
sands into oil. Why? One reason is that oilmen see Canada, for all
its fissiparous tendencies, as much less risky than the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   It is also close to the giant American market. What is more,
says Wayne Kubasker of Exxon Mobil, ``The oil sands are there.
There is no risk in finding them. Finding and development costs are
much less than for conventional oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Production costs of $17 a barrel have fallen to less than $13 a
barrel over the past decade. The government helps with lavish tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Syncrude, whose main partners include Exxon Mobil, Gulf and
Occidental, mines two-thirds of the sands extracted today and plans
to do so for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   All this is encouraging, but the local optimism is probably a
bit excessive. After all, a barrel of Middle Eastern oil costs less
than $5 to extract. And little over a year ago, oil fetched less
than $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Until the cost of extracting oil from the sands drops by a lot
more, Saudi Arabia's supremacy in the petroleum world is probably
not under serious threat from Alberta. &QL;

 &HT;    That `dirt bag' Springsteen
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a time for healing,'' John Puglissi said at a news
conference announcing New York police officers' boycott of Bruce
Springsteen's Madison Square Garden concerts. Springsteen's new
song about the shooting of Amadou Diallo ``just reopens old
wounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement begs the question: Just whose wounds have started
to heal?
</P>
<P>
   The wounds of Kadiadou Diallo, the mother of the victim? When
she arrived at the Bronx apartment building where police fired 41
shots at her unarmed son, she crumpled to the street and cried out,
``Amadou, Amadou, Amadou.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounds of New York's black community _ have they healed? The
folks who are forced to think twice before they ``pull'' a wallet
or a cell phone?
</P>
<P>
   Puglissi said patrolmen object to the song because it ``is based
on racial profiling'' _ as if the mere mention of the problem were
an affront.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs an even more important question: How can such wounds
ever heal if we pretend the injury doesn't exist?
</P>
<P>
   ``If wounds are healing, it is only the wounds of those who
committed the offense,'' said Dennis Lieberman, attorney for three
Ohio youths who accused police of racial profiling. ``We're not at
the time where we need to heal wounds; those wounds are not opened
enough for us to be able to heal them.''
</P>
<P>
   We all feel outrage when police officers are second-guessed,
even in clear-cut, self-defense cases. We all know that police must
make split-second, life-and-death decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the controversial song is hardly an Ice-T-style,
anti-police diatribe. It recognizes those complexities in a chorus
that repeats the thoughts that might have run through the officers'
minds:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a gun? Is it a knife? Is it a wallet? This is your life.
It ain't no secret you can get killed just for living in your
American skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The last line ``could apply to both Diallo and the policeman,''
notes New York Times critic Jon Pareles. Such subtleties apparently
are lost on the song's detractors, including an FOP president who
called Springsteen a ``dirt bag.''
</P>
<P>
   What's troubling here isn't the name-calling or the boycott, but
the ostrich mentality they represent: ``Let's not talk about it;
let's make the mere mention of racial profiling a thought crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The village of Waynesville, Ohio is still grappling with what
happened on Feb. 26, when three minority teens accused police of
needlessly detaining them at gunpoint for almost an hour. The
Warren County Sheriff's Department exonerated police in a 62-page
report that often seemed less interested in investigating the
incident than in discrediting the background of the teens as well
as witnesses. (We learn, for instance, that witness Justin Bledsoe
``keyed'' a car in 1998.) No drugs were ever found and the teens
were never cited, yet the report concludes that there was probable
cause for the traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Warren County officials haven't made racial
profiling a verboten subject. Since the controversial incident,
many communities have established policies banning the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a sincere policy, it is a start,'' Lieberman said. He
worries, however, that it's a ``legal tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope it's a good-faith effort. We may never know what
really happened Feb. 26, but we do know this: The community must
move on from here.
</P>
<P>
   And the slowest way for the wounds to heal is by pretending it
never happened.

 &HT;    Today's newspaper ethics clash with home-cooked cravings
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. _ The newspaper business has changed a lot
since I first hired on nearly a half-century ago. Thanks to
computers and a lot of other technical stuff, the process of making
your newspaper is quicker, cleaner and safer. I doubt it's nearly
as much fun.
</P>
<P>
   When I started to work in the old Atlanta Journal building at 10
Forsyth St., we had decrepit pre-Depression typewriters and no air
conditioning. Everything had to be put on paper. We glued pages
together and yelled for a copy boy to ship them through pneumatic
tubes to the composing room, where rows of operators sat at
clanking Linotype machines, turning deathless prose into lines of
metal type, which were then transferred to a heavy frame the size
of a newspaper page.
</P>
<P>
   Next was a boiling-hot metal impression that cooled into a
half-circle-shaped plate to be trundled off to the press, paired
with another plate, and then bolted onto a cylinder where words and
sentences were finally married with paper and ink.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper business 50 years ago had not progressed much past
the horse and buggy. In the newsroom, rows of teletype machines
brought news in from wires strung all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody smoked, either cigarettes or cigars. Most of us had
seen Walter Matthau in ``The Front Page,'' the comic but accurate
movie about old-fashioned journalism. In our ignorance, we didn't
have to worry about cancer, but cigarettes made fires a constant
threat. Puffing away in Hollywood style, reporters paid little heed
to ashtrays and frequently threw their butts into the nearest
wastebasket.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing makes me feel older than walking into a modern newsroom.
There are no chattering teletypes, no paste pots to glue stories
together, no paper flying around, no noise. The newsroom could just
as well be an accounting firm. Smoking is against the law. Copy
boys no longer exist. They are politically incorrect, which the
Constitution's legendary Flash would find insulting.
</P>
<P>
   Flash made a career of being the Constitution's ace copy boy. He
ranked near the publisher in respect and knew more about the
newspaper than most editors and reporters, even after he slowed
down in old age and spent a lot of time napping in the supply
closet.
</P>
<P>
   Change hasn't been limited to technology. There has been a
seismic shift in newspaper ethics, and that is what troubles me at
the moment. Newspapering used to carry a lot of perks that
compensated for small paychecks passed out by stingy publishers and
owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, and later, we got free tickets to baseball and
college football games. Movie passes were available for the asking.
</P>
<P>
   All of this changed, along about Watergate, as I recall.
Newspapers, like Congress, finally caught on about ethics and
conflicts of interest, and got around to banning gifts of value,
which is why I'm afraid I'm in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When I complained about the scarcity of good Brunswick stew, the
Cawthon sisters showed up with a batch made from their daddy's
famous recipe. Our neighbor Webb Mask decided to share his annual
making. Bill Corry, the old coach, brought a sample from a secret
source in Morgan County. Items of value? Absolutely!
</P>
<P>
   When I whined about the sad state of my drought-stricken garden,
Dr. George Patton delivered beets, onions, a cabbage only slightly
smaller than a No. 2 washtub and an offer of lettuce. Webb Mask
showed up with sugar snaps and Vidalia onions he raised himself.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's visit with the sugar snaps reminded me that I'm guilty of
a serious oversight in failing to rank him among our local master
gardeners, along with Dr. Patton, Lester Bray and Johnny Lester.
Perhaps I have associated Webb and his wife too much with getting
me involved in the goat business a few years ago. However, I doubt
anyone can top him in the peach business.
</P>
<P>
   When I stopped by his house on some errand last summer, he made
the offer of a sack of fresh peaches off his backyard trees. When I
reluctantly accepted, he got out a stepladder and placed it under a
tree. Instead of picking peaches as I pick them, he eased the palm
of his hand under each candidate for my sack. If the peach came off
the tree when he lowered his palm, it went into the sack. If not,
it stayed on the tree for more ripening.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what I'll do if he makes his peach offer again this
year, or if Lester (aka Otis(at)Delta) Bray calls about his
fabulous snap beans, which should be about ready.
</P>
<P>
   My only hope is that when I'm hauled before the ethics police I
can get off on grounds of advanced age that qualifies me to be
grandfathered and allowed to play by 1950s rules. When it comes to
fresh vegetables and homemade Brunswick stew I'm clearly on the
take.
</P>

Journal-Constitution, 692 N. Glynn St., Suite A, Fayetteville, GA

 &HT;    Back to diet basics
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Americans spend billions of dollars each year
trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   The bloated federal government has announced an expensive new
effort to crack down on the proliferation of diet doctors and
weight-loss outfits that promise quick and easy weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   With all this money being thrown around in search of an
effective way to lose weight and keep it off, I felt the time was
right to offer the public my sure-fire weight-loss program.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it's fair to wonder if I know what I'm talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   This is where slick television weight-loss pitchpersons plug in
a testimonial from someone who lost 30 pounds drinking an expensive
diet supplement and following the complicated directions that
accompanied several cases of costly diet drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides testimonials, many weight-loss programs that can be
purchased in easy installments tout how their plans were developed
by scientists after extensive research.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I am no scientist. I also haven't done a lick of research
into diets, nutrition or weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   But I have dropped more than 70 pounds in the last six months. I
probably will lose a few more pounds before I reach my optimum
fitness level.
</P>
<P>
   NO-WORRY WEIGHT LOSS
</P>
<P>
   What's more, I haven't tried to lose weight. That's the key to
my sure-fire, weight-loss program. Don't worry about losing weight.
Don't make losing weight a goal. You don't even have to think about
losing weight if you don't want to. Still, the pounds gradually
melt away.
</P>
<P>
   You also don't have to buy a diet book, drink dietary
supplements or even go on an actual diet if you follow my sure-fire
weight-loss program. You don't even have to cut back on your food
intake. Eat as much as you want whenever you get hungry.
</P>
<P>
   My weight-loss program does not include an actual diet that
demands keeping track of calories or regulating the size of meals.
It does, however, include a dietary aspect. I'll come back to this
facet of my weight-loss plan later.
</P>
<P>
   First, let me give away my weight-loss secret that will save you
and other Americans billions of dollars spent each year on
expensive weight-loss programs that don't work. Here it is _ sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that's all there is to it. Sweat. Work out until you break
into a sweat and keep it up for as long as you can stand it.
</P>
<P>
   Do that five or six days a week and you'll lose weight. Keep it
up and you will continue to lose weight. At this point, I'm not
sure where my weight loss will end but I'm guessing somewhere
between 180 and 185 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, I weighed 260 pounds when I went to a
three-day motorcycle riding school in Nevada. That's when I
discovered that riding a motorcycle fast around a race track was
more complicated than a fat guy twisting the throttle.
</P>
<P>
   I came away committed to getting into shape. My goal was to get
fit, to turn fat into muscle. I did not set a goal to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   The key to losing weight, it seems to me, is to not worry about
how much you weigh. Rather than fret over gaining or losing a pound
or two, instead put your energy into workouts designed to get you
into good physical shape.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, getting into shape requires more effort than
30-minute walks around the neighborhood, a weekend round of golf or
an occasional tennis match with a friend. Working out means a
sustained investment of sweat equity in your body at least five
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The diet aspect of my sure-fire weight-loss program is to avoid
food with high sugar and fat content.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it _ a free sure-fire weight loss program.

 &HT;    Making a concave table _ don't ask
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today's topic will be methods of producing a concave
surface, inspired by a somewhat odd question found on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to create 'sprung' boards for a tabletop project,''
the gentleman writes. ``I tried intentionally sagging the outfeed
table on my jointer and just got lots of dips instead of the
concavity I was expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible to produce a nice concave surface?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it is, but not this way. Making a concave surface on a
jointer is possible, but tedious and rather uncertain. To start
with, it would be better to drop the infeed table rather than the
outfeed.
</P>
<P>
   I'm dying with curiosity, though. What place do concave boards
have in a table top? Gentlemen, however, don't ask those things.
</P>
<P>
   PLANE IT
</P>
<P>
   If I only wanted one concave board, I'd hand-plane it. If it
needs to be a sharp dip, I'd use a spokeshave, or get a circular
plane, an instrument which has a flexible steel sole that can be
pressed out into a curve shape.
</P>
<P>
   If a long board, a smooth plane would do it.
</P>
<P>
   The concavity would need to be carefully laid out. The simplest
way to do this is to take a piece of scrap at least as long as the
workpiece and saw a very thin slice off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Use this very flexible strip to mark out the desired concavity
on the edge of the workpiece. Plane down to the line.
</P>
<P>
   If a concave surface made up of multiple boards is wanted, then
I'd go about it differently. I'd make a carriage jig for a plunge
router.
</P>
<P>
   You do this by preparing two guide blocks, each somewhat longer
than the laminated workpiece. Mark the length of the workpiece
centered on one of the guide blocks, and then use that flexible
stick to draw out the concavity on the side of the block.
</P>
<P>
   Tape the blocks together and bandsaw out the curve. These blocks
will be clamped, center to center, on each side of the workpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Now make a carriage for the router. Some routers have holes
through the base for the edge guide; you can use these. It's
difficult to go into great detail on how to do this, especially
without illustration, but the idea is that the carriage allows the
router to be slid from side to side across the workpiece, while
riding forward and backward on the curve of the guide blocks.
</P>
<P>
   This way, taking bites no greater than an eighth of an inch, you
quickly rout a concavity into the entire workpiece.

``soccer moms'' _ shorthand for married middle-class women with
young children seeking to juggle competing demands. This time

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Americans spend billions of
dollars each year trying to lose weight. The bloated federal
government has announced an expensive new effort to crack down on
the proliferation of diet doctors and weight-loss outfits that
promise quick and easy weight loss. With all this money being
thrown around in search of an effective way to lose weight and keep
it off, I felt the time was right to offer the public my sure-fire
weight-loss program. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVEDMINTER-COLUMN _ The newspaper business 50
years ago had not progressed much past the horse and buggy. In the
newsroom, rows of teletype machines brought news in from wires
strung all over the world. (MINTER, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVEDMCCARTY-COLUMN _ We all feel outrage when police officers are
second-guessed, even in clear-cut, self-defense cases. We all know
that police must make split-second, life-and-death decisions. Yet,
the controversial Bruce Springsteen song is hardly an Ice-T-style,
anti-police diatribe. It recognizes those complexities in a chorus
that repeats the thoughts that might have run through the officers'
minds. (MCCARTY, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Tom Teepen writes about the 527s,
special-interest political players who raise and spend literally
untold millions secretly and who are named for the tax-code section
that provides the loophole for them. They can retain their
anonymity as long as they pull up just short of directly urging the
election or defeat of a specific candidate. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ If Cuban exiles want to declare war on Fidel
Castro, they should not fight that war in the United States and TV
ads should not be their weapon. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.)

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ It seems that in every U.S. election
cycle, pundits pluck out a group of voters for in-depth study who
are said to be in flux. In the 1996 race for the White House,
President Clinton was widely seen as winning out with so-called
``soccer moms'' _ shorthand for married middle-class women with
young children seeking to juggle competing demands. This time
around, so-called ``wired workers'' have taken an early lead in the
media contest to see who will emerge as the key group of ``swing
voters.'' (Andy Glass is a columnist for Cox News Service in the
Washington bureau.) MOVED THURSDAY.

   CINCINNATI-ZOO _ CINCINNATI _ When you're a 2,200-pound
2-year-old, keeping cool on a hot day is a major priority. Ganesh,
his mother and two other Asian elephants are the inhabitants and
main attractions of the new Schott-Unnewehr Vanishing Giants
display at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. And if Ganesh's
reaction when he finally got to enter his pool is any indication,
the elephants love their expanded home. (DAYTON DAILY NEWS). 20.

father. It's a miraculous transformation through birth or adoption
that changes a man's identity and outlook forever. We look at the
spiritual dimensions of fatherhood through fathers, and through the
eyes of doctors and nurses who have witnessed families being made.

   BAPTISTS-MERRITT _ Everybody's somebody in Snellville, as the
saying goes, but the Rev. James Merritt , pastor of Snellville
First Baptist Church is now somebody all across the 15.8 million
member Southern Baptist Convention. Merritt is expected to be
elected Tuesday to head the body for at least the next year. He
follows in the footsteps of Atlantans Charles Stanley and Bailey
Smith in a line of conservative leaders who stretch back two
decades. But Merritt marks a generational change. He's the first
Baby Boomer president of the convention. (Gwhite, Atlanta

Rev. D.D. Chestang, pastor of Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist
Church, is going home. The energetic Alabama preacher, who has been

Ohio, will deliver his farewell sermon June 25 in the sanctuary of

   JAZZ-CAMP _ BIRMINGHAM - The neck of his Fender Jazz Bass seems
almost too long for Jason Turner. He squeezes down the note for a
blues arrangment, looking as if he were holding a dance partner too
tall for him. Turner has played bass for just a year. But the
13-year-old has rhthym. During an improve class at the 11th-annual
City Stages summer jazz camp, he is rhythm. With nearly 100 other
summer campers, Turner is learning how to swing. Professional
musicians are training aspiring jazz artists who will perform today
(saturday) at a downtown music festival. You see, this is your
grandmother's jazz. Dixieland. Blues. It's the smoking riffs built
in the Deep South in the early 1900s. This is the stuff of Louis
Armstrong, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald. This is not
the commercial fluff from, say, Kenny G. (Manuel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.
</P>
<P>
   WEB-MOVIES _ The Internet's embrace of movies isn't in the
future. It's right now. At least a dozen Web sites (like
cinemanow.com, mediatrip.com and thenewvenue.com) feature movie
shorts and/or full-length flicks that film fans can watch for free.
For Hollywood studios, ``there's an element of panic,'' says
director Mike Figgis, whose recent ``Time Code'' illustrates
another aspect of filmmaking challenging conventional Hollywood _
digital technology. ``There's a real nervousness because they
regard the technology and the people who come with it like the
rabble at the door of the castle.'' Many see a mad scramble for
``web site territory'' (cinemanow.com, for example, is an arm of
Trimark). (BLonginio, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 16. EMBARGOED

West, Florida, New Orleans and Greenwich Village, Manhattan. At
each stopover, he learned new songs, new ways to sing them and new
guitar licks to stir into his developing style as a ``songman.''
The songs he wrote as he traveled tell the story of his life and
way of living and making music. Now, he's written this book that
fills in the details. It's a fascinating tale, whether or not you
are a Jerry Jeff fan. (Milner, Lufkin Daily News). MOVED.

   TEXAS-ARCHEOLOGY (Keeran Ranch, Texas) _ Rings, musket balls and
charms to ward off the evil eye are gingerly pried from the dark
clay here, as investigators piece together the rugged lives and
deaths of the inhabitants of the first European settlement in
Texas. For one of the few times since a ranch worker armed with a
metal detector found eight buried iron cannons in 1996 _ confirming
the location of the legendary Fort St. Louis _ state officials
permitted outsiders to view its remains. By DANE SCHILLER.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLINIST-FINGER (Albany, N.Y.) _ Violinist Jill Levy cut her
left hand in a mundane kitchen accident six months ago. After
surgery and therapy and more therapy and, later, therapy, she's
able to play again. By AMY BIANCOLLI. (For release Sunday, June
18.)
</P>
<P>
   BRAIN-RESEARCH (San Antonio) _ Brain researchers used to have to
rely on the cadavers of patients who died with odd brain deficits.
Now they have sophisticated technology and can watch neurons fire
away while the brain performs its duty as the body's command
center. But the science is still its infancy and many mysteries
about the brain remain. By CINDY TUMIEL.
</P>
<P>
   TANKARDS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Tankards are drinking vessels that are
mainly used for consuming beer or ale. Like most decorative
vessels, there are many variations. In the 17th and 18th centuries
some of the tankard handles were whistles that were used to summon
a refill. Tankards were often made from or in the shape of an
animal horn that was meant to be hung from a sword belt. By FRANCES
INGRAHAM HEINS. (For release Sunday, June 18.)
</P>
<P>
   GARAGES (Undated) _ What would most homeowners do without a
garage? This boxy structure not only provides shelter for cars, but
extra storage space for bicycles, the barbecue grill, lawnmower,
snowblower, ski gear, sleds, trash and recycling barrels and, in
some cases, a workbench, snowmobile, seasonal clothing and the
omnipresent basketball backstop. By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS. (For

   FILM-REVIEW-SHAFT (Undated) _ The original Shaft, played with
such splendid unflappability by Richard Roundtree in the 1971 film
by the same name, would have been flummoxed by the current
landscape of complex sexual and racial politics. He would have been
flummoxed, moreover, by the forced jokiness and summer-action
mayhem of this newly released update, which kowtows to movie
stereotypes as much as the first ``Shaft'' changed them. By AMY
BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BOYS (Undated) _ Former television director turned
teensploitationist Robert Iscove is at it again. The maker of
``She's All That'' returns with ``Boys and Girls,'' and he's
brought with him his cottage-cheese-chunky storytelling skills,
patented dance-so-no-one-notices-we're-tanking musical interludes,
and, oh yes, the redoubtable Freddie Prinze Jr. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   DIXIE-CHICKS (Sacramento, Calif.) _ There are a lot of people

 &HT;    BREAST CANCER HAUNTS AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Marilyn Gaston, the nation's assistant surgeon
general, was 59 when a routine mammogram discovered the beginnings
of cancer in one of her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   It was too early to even feel a lump, she recalled. But knowing
that risks of recurrence increase with age, she elected to have a
surgeon remove both breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for the gusto to get a total cure,'' explained Dr.
Gaston. And her diagnosis has been good in the two years since
then.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the medical system is supposed to work _ but how
it too often does not function for African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast cancer deaths are coming down for other women, but not
for us,'' said Gaston. ``We, as a group, need to take charge and
address this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaston will deliver the keynote speech here Saturday in the
first of a series of national symposiums aimed at educating black
women to their special danger of dying from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A National Cancer Institute study showed that black women are 12
percent less likely than white women to get breast cancer, but 29
percent more likely to die from the disease. African-American women
are also more likely to be stricken at a younger age. Among women
with breast cancer, blacks are 50 percent more likely than whites
to get the disease before the age of 35 and 50 percent more likely
to die of it before reaching the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
   The symposiums will bring together community activists and
experts on prevention, early detection, surgery and other aspects
of breast cancer and its treatment. The sessions are being
organized by the Breast Cancer Resource Committee, a non-profit
advocacy group for African-American women, and sponsored by
AstraZeneca PLC, manufacturer of the drug tamoxifen, which is used
in treating some breast cancers.
</P>
<P>
   A similar symposium is planned for Atlanta in the fall, said
Zora Brown, president of the Breast Cancer Resource Committee. The
conferences will be held in communities around the country, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 50, co-founded the group with her sister to increase
community awareness after seeing how breast cancer had haunted
their family for four generations. The disease had stricken Zora
Brown, her three sisters, her mother, grandmother, great
grandmother, three great aunts and a niece. The co-founding sister
and niece died from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put forth a concerted effort to reach
African-American women,'' Brown said. ``And we want to collect data
to understand why more of us are dying. We have a crisis and we
need to take control of it within our own community.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier detection is the key to ending the disparity in breast
cancer deaths between black and white women, said Gaston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no difference in outcome if it's caught in the stage
that it should be,'' she said. ``Our five-year survival rate is not
as good because we're getting it too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Because black women tend to be stricken at an earlier age, they
should begin to get routine mammograms in their 30s rather than
waiting until reaching the currently recommended age of 40 for
baseline screening, said Gaston.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers need to reach out to African-American women
to conduct more studies and the women need to overcome reluctance
to participate in the studies, she urged. It could be that the
disease is more progressive within black women and perhaps should
be treated differently, but research is needed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, African American women are uninsured or otherwise cut
off from the sort of health care that detected her own breast
cancer at an early stage, Gaston said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been seeing the same doctors for 15 years and
``they had all my mammograms,'' so tiny changes were readily
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to mobilize the African-American community'' so all
women get such screening and treatment, she said. ``And each one of
us, on a personal level, needs to take charge our health.''

&HT;     ARKANSAS SODA SHOP HAS TASTE OF YESTERYEAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTON, Ark. _ I sometimes wonder if America's high-speed
expressways represent a blessing or curse.
</P>
<P>
   Like many road warriors, I find myself rushing from Point A to
Point B, concocting timetables and setting goals as to how soon I
can zip past the next town while adhering to the speed limit. Lunch
break? Will it be McDonald's, Burger King or DQ? And here's
crossing my fingers that the gas station I approach has ``fast
pay'' services at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the quickest routing from Houston to Branson, Mo.,''
I routinely informed the AAA agent in advance of this trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are beautiful scenic routes through Arkansas,'' the
agent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't afford the time,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as the drive commenced and I began bypassing Lufkin and
Nacogdoches, Texarkana and Hope _ President Clinton's Arkansas
birthplace _ I rethought those words: Can we afford not to take
time to celebrate our nation's beauty, our culture, our history?
Our fellow men and women?
</P>
<P>
   To savor surprises we'd never encounter while speeding down an
Interstate?
</P>
<P>
   So it is that I'm now lingering into a third hour at Jerry Van
Dyke's Soda Shoppe near the courthouse square in Benton, a
community of 18,000 outside of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Jerry? No, not brother Dick, the doctoring sleuth
in television's Diagnosis Murder and the former star of the Dick
Van Dyke comedy series with Mary Tyler Moore. Jerry, as in Luther
Van Dam, football's most unlikely defensive coordinator _ and
perpetual clown _ for the Minnesota Screaming Eagles in Coach, a TV
comedy running from the late 1980s and into the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Luther _ whose antics remain on display thanks to reruns _ was a
mess, albeit a fun-loving, good-hearted mess (and a
characterization performed well enough to earn Van Dyke four Emmy
nominations). ``There is a lot of Luther in Jerry, too, and he's
one of the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet,'' says Jeremy
Ricketson, a waiter here when he's not performing at Jerry Van
Dyke's Royal Theater next door.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Van Dyke retired from show business and
purchased a block of property in downtown Benton. His wife,
Shirley, hails from nearby Malvern, where they own a ranch, and he
told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette at the time, ``I love small
towns, but they're becoming all the same. Everybody goes to the
same fast-food restaurants, the same stores. There's nowhere to
meet people.''
</P>
<P>
   The soda shop and a candy store, which jointly occupy the site
of a former drug store, have become a gathering spot for locals and
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry mentioned the shop during a guest appearance on
Diagnosis Murder, and a lot of people started looking for us,''
says Ricketson.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Dempsey, who now operates the eatery with husband Dan (an
Arkansas Parks and Tourism commissioner), says, ``We had visitors
just yesterday from Anchorage. But we're thrilled, too, that people
who live in Benton like to come here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The establishment is filled with posters and other memorabilia _
including a ``Screaming Eagles'' sweatshirt _ associated with Van
Dyke's television and movie career, but the decor also captures a
Benton of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has helped revive our town and build community spirit,''
says longtime resident Salley Biggs, who points proudly to
photographs on a wall showing her and contemporaries as youths.
``Look at this picture; can you tell that I'm upset?'' Biggs asks,
``It's because I didn't get to sit by my best friend that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Luther's _ er, Jerry's _ fun-loving spirit is evidenced by model
trains circling on tracks just below the ceiling. By a player piano
situated near the front window. By a loud whistle sounded when kids
age 8-to-80 pull two handles. By Coach episodes playing on a TV
above the soda fountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry is a collector of things unusual, and he's had a hand in
everything done here,'' says Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry isn't here today. He and Shirley now live much of the time
in Mexico but return frequently to visit their daughter and
grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he's back, he's at the soda shop,'' Ricketson says.
``Sometimes he'll sit outside for hours and greet people. Or he'll
go behind the counter and make sodas. One day he got down on the
floor and played with a little boy and his fire truck. And he sings
and dances with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The townspeople relish Van Dyke's appearances. ``We were having
lunch one day, and he just sat down and joined us,'' Benton
resident Marvalene James says.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs says, ``I ordered something, and he said, `You don't want
that today. Let me go fix you something special.' '' The food alone
_ touted as ``Luther tested, Dauber approved'' _ is worth exiting
I-30 (or making a 30-minute side trip from Hot Springs). The
``Coach Fox'' burger basket and ``Christine'' patty melt are
monstrous proportions. Dempsey's homemade broccoli-and-cheese soup
is delectable.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, those sodas and shakes _ five flavors, seven toppings,
everything made the old-fashioned way _ and peach cobbler.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that my brief visit doesn't coincide with one of eight
or nine live performances scheduled each year at Van Dyke's
theater. ``Two groups put on shows: the Jerry Van Dyke Studios and
Central Arkansas Community Players,'' says Ricketson. ``Some
productions last up to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets only cost about $10, or half that for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, when we did Grease, Jerry volunteered for a cameo
as a Teen Angel. We never knew what he'd do next on stage. He had
us laughing so hard we almost couldn't continue.''
</P>
<P>
   If only I could stay all afternoon. ``Here, take some candy for
the road,'' Dempsey says. ``We keep it affordable _ 25 pieces of
bubble gum for $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do here is bring back good memories, to
help people feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   I feel good. And I'm reassured that there are other delightful
small towns worth leisurely exploration along my route.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I'm well behind my timetable. The Interstate beckons.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     CRUISE LINE TRIES TO LURE TEXAS LANDLUBBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY SHATTUCK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They will cover only 130 square feet in vast shopping malls.
``Retail islands,'' promoters dub them. Fancy booths.
</P>
<P>
   But Carnival Cruise Lines' first-ever ``Vacation Stores,''
opening soon in the Houston and Dallas areas, are raising eyebrows
within the travel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Citing research that indicates Texans take 40 percent fewer
cruises than the national average, Carnival president Bob Dickinson
is _ one or more answers allowed _ (A) supplementing, (B) prodding,
(C) assisting or (D) bypassing traditional travel agencies with
what he describes as a ``high-tech, high-touch, cutting-edge''
marketing approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Soon you can find Inspiration, Fascination,
Ecstasy, Paradise and Destiny in a mall. You can book a cruise,
too, on these or any other Carnival ships _ including the
Celebration, which begins 4- and 5-night sailings from Galveston on
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The first Carnival Vacation Store opens this month in Arlington.
A second outlet debuts in August at The Woodlands shopping mall in
the Houston area. Each will sell only Carnival cruises, even though
the line is allied with Holland America, Cunard, Seabourn, Costa
and Windstar.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival sales personnel will staff the stores during regular
mall hours, including evenings and weekends _ periods when most
travel agencies are closed but when, Dickinson suggests, families
are most apt to consider (and shop for) vacation alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Is this direct-to-the-consumer marketing approach yet another
blow to travel agents, who already are at war with airlines over
commission cuts and online marketing ploys? With rare exceptions,
cruise lines have remained dedicated to _ and dependent on _
agencies in selling their product. Is Carnival, the world's largest
line, radically altering its strategy? Just the opposite, insists
Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``No agent should be scared of this,'' he says. ``The irony is
that if we went into Houston and said we're going to spend $360,000
on advertising our product, agents would kiss us. This is no
different: We're spending $360,000 on a three-dimensional promotion
for cruise vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dickinson says that spurring agency business is a prime
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to generate $1.5 million to $2 million in annual sales
at each Vacation Store,'' Dickinson says. ``But we expect to
generate 5-to-10 times that amount with incremental sales through
travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of our business is through travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our ideas is to offer people a coupon for a credit
toward shipboard expenses, and they could take it to their travel
agent for processing.''
</P>
<P>
   Houstonian Joe Galloway, president of the American Society of
Travel Agents (ASTA) and owner of Trans-Continental Travel in the
Galleria area, says he welcomes any endeavor that promotes
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   ``From ASTA's standpoint, we've never been concerned with people
buying directly, as long as we have a level playing field,''
Galloway says. ``And Bob Dickinson has assured us that they will
not be undercutting our prices at their stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know how many people will buy something as
expensive as a cruise on a Saturday night,'' Galloway says. ``My
agency once had a mall location and found that people weren't
interested in buying travel there. Maybe that's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway has concerns, too, about potential Carnival Vacation
Store customers understanding the huge variety of cruise products
in today's marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson has broached the concept of brand outlets for some
time, but he first envisioned travel agents operating the stores.
Agents could better serve consumers, he reasoned, by focusing their
expertise and sales on select cruise lines _ even on one line. In
theory, one existing agency would serve as a Carnival store,
another as a Royal Caribbean store and so on.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened, for good reason, according to Galloway.
Although many agencies establish relationships with what they refer
to as ``preferred suppliers,'' Galloway says, ``The strength of a
travel agency is that it's not a brand store. A good agent should
be working for the customer, not one company.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Carnival cruise may be ideal for one person but wrong for
another.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, there are a lot of questions that should be asked. A
travel agent can talk one-on-one with a customer and fit the
product to his or her needs.''
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing aspect of the Vacation Store concept _ ``old dog,
new tricks,'' Dickinson labels this adaptation of his original idea
_ is that Carnival plans to offer ``internships'' to travel agents
who want training in marketing the line's cruises. ``They will be
able to sell Carnival cruises at our store, and the agency will get
credit,'' Dickinson says.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what will happen, though, when a consumer asks a travel
agent _ not a Carnival employee _ at a mall store, ``How do you
compare Carnival Destiny with Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the
Seas, the Grand Princess and Norwegian Sky?'' Will the travel agent
speak the Carnival party line or provide the unbiased evaluation
expected at an agency? A conflict of interest seems inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   I'll also be interested to see _ as will travel agents _ if
Carnival initiates a trend. Will we soon shop at Royal Caribbean,
Princess and Norwegian cruise outlets?
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson cites two main reasons for placing the first two mall
stores in Texas (with a third planned for Illinois). ``One is that
Texas, for reasons I'm not really sure, generally underperforms the
rest of the nation (in cruise purchases). The other is that we're
bringing the Celebration to Galveston.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson describes early bookings for the Celebration _
primarily through travel agents _ as ``tremendous. Texas is a
sleeping giant. The growth potential here is enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   He's banking that a retail island will spur that growth.

&HT;     RESEARCHERS TRY TO CRACK MYSTERIES OF THE BRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CINDY TUMIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ On a projector screen inside the darkened
Municipal Auditorium here, identical images of actor Harrison Ford
flashed side by side.
</P>
<P>
   But the two pictures weren't really identical. One captured the
true Hollywood hero, with his classic chiseled jaw, strong brow
line and serious demeanor. The other picture was subtly different.
Computer magic had softened Ford's brow, rounded that sturdy chin
and puffed his lips a tad.
</P>
<P>
   David Perrett, a professor of psychology from the University of
St. Andrews in Scotland, posed a question to the audience: Which
Harrison Ford would you be more likely to loan money to?
</P>
<P>
   The chairs were filled with some of the world's foremost brain
researchers, but they readily played along with the psychology
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, the ``feminized'' Ford was judged more
trustworthy and got a thumbs-up for a loan _ if the millionaire
actor ever really needs to borrow a few bucks from a bunch of
brainy professors.
</P>
<P>
   But the test demonstrated one point in a growing body of
fascinating findings about the human brain _ that it perceives
personality traits as it views faces.
</P>
<P>
   Protruding jaw lines and thinner lips are masculine traits and
often are perceived as signs of strength, emotional coldness and
untrustworthiness. Feminine faces are softer and often are equated
with honesty and warmth, whether or not that really is the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to realize that complex social behavior can
rely on very discrete neural systems,'' said Perrett, the keynote
speaker this week at a conference of brain scientists. ``Where they
are and how they work is intensely interesting for neuroscientists,
and the public, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrett is one of 1,200 scientists in San Antonio for the
Organization for Human Brain Mapping annual meeting, which
concluded Friday. The researchers came from 29 different countries
to talk about their latest explorations into the mysterious world
of human brains.
</P>
<P>
   Brain researchers used to have to rely on the cadavers of
patients who died with odd brain deficits. Now they have
sophisticated technology, combining magnetic resonance imaging and
high-powered computers, and can watch neurons fire away while the
brain performs its duty as the body's command center.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of research has increased exponentially in the past
decade, but it still is considered a science in its infancy, said
Dr. Peter Fox, director of the Research Imaging Center at the
University of Texas Health Science Center, the conference host.
</P>
<P>
   So far, brain mapping scientists have found 3,000 to 5,000
functional areas on the surface of the brain, and they are
exploring how these areas connect with inner brain structures.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have begun to grasp how normal brains act, Fox said,
and are exploring abnormalities as varied as genetic birth defects,
learning disorders and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a systems-level approach,'' Fox said. ``We want to
understand what areas of the brain do, how they interact normally
and how they interact when abnormalities are present.''
</P>

   In Perrett's laboratory, the imaging technology is being used to
understand just how much is involved in the perception of a face.
The brain's complex circuitry detects features, recognizes familiar
faces, and imbues personality traits in fleeting milliseconds, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do so many things with faces,'' Perrett said. ``We can
recognize faces; we can recognize emotion. These are all different
systems in the brain.''

   &UR; BY ANNE APPLEBAUM &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Heartwarming though it may have been to see Kim Jong-il, North
Korea's ``dear leader,'' unexpectedly arriving at the airport this
week to greet Kim Dae-jung, his South Korean counterpart,
diplomatic gossip has it that this was not so much a show of
new-style hospitality, but rather of old-style paranoia: The
northern Kim was afraid that the southern Kim might make an
unscripted speech if he weren't there to head that possibility off.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, was the absence of South Korean flags at this
outwardly brotherly meeting an accident. For the past half-century,
the southern flag has been a completely forbidden symbol in the
North: To display it there would, from the northern point of view,
be the rough equivalent of the German government publicly flying
the swastika.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all the emotional talk of ``one nation'' and
friendship, the Koreas are still much further apart than were, say,
the two Germanys.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, there have been precious few
secret diplomatic exchanges, no family reunification programs, no
telephone or rail connections, not even any spy swaps. Instead of
selling their dissidents to the South in exchange for hard
currency, as East Germany once sold its dissidents to the West, the
North Koreans have preferred to lock them up, along with their
wives and children, in some of the world's most ghoulish labor
camps.
</P>
<P>
   But however distant actual unification may now be, the subject
is now in the air, and you'll hear more about it. For a
comprehensive guide to security and military aspects, and for
various unification scenarios, see the Rand Corp.'s recent report
(www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1040) on reunifying the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Or, based on what happened to the two Germanys and to Hong Kong
_ as well as what did not happen to Romania and Moldova, which have
not reunited _ I can offer this quick list of some of the coming
economic and political debates:
</P>
<P>
   A SINGLE CURRENCY? Migration prevention will be one of the
central issues for the reuniting Koreans: preventing the
northerners from all moving South, that is, and populating the
slums. The Germans attempted to head off this problem in part by
converting the worthless East Germany currency at a one-to-one rate
against the deutsche mark, temporarily enriching East Germans
enough so that they stayed put.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this expensive, it also, in the long run,
backfired: Since East Germans had to be paid the West German
minimum wage, it also meant that they were being paid, relative to
their productivity, far too much. As a result, East Germany
stagnated and West Germany was never able to take proper advantage
of what should have been a boom in cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, West German companies continue to produce things in
places like South Korea. If borders are opened, South Korea will
have to make a decision about its currency immediately.
</P>
<P>
   BORDER CONTROLS? Another option is to leave border controls in
place, at least temporarily. This is the solution that the Chinese
have chosen: Of course, not only do they want to keep poor Chinese
peasants out of Hong Kong, they also want to keep Hong Kong's
freer-wheeling inhabitants in.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Germanys, this would have been politically
impossible: After all, Berliners began physically destroying the
Wall (and selling bits of it to tourists) on the first night that
easterners began walking through it. North Koreans might just be
cowed enough to accept continued border controls, but will South
Korean students, notoriously fond of violent street demonstrations,
stand for it?
</P>
<P>
   TWO CLASSES OF KOREANS? If the Koreas do decide to depart from
the German model _ if, that is, the South is allowed to take
advantage of the cheap labor of the North _ reunification will also
produce two distinct and very unequal classes of Koreans. As this
is already the case, some might not mind. Others will.
</P>
<P>
   While it is hard to imagine anybody wanting to return to the
current state of affairs _ recent visitors to Pyongyang report
seeing locals surreptitiously harvesting grass out of parks in
order to make grass soup _ it is conceivable that, if plans are not
made to head it off, a serious anti-unification political movement
could develop in the North, complicating politics in the future.
</P>
<P>
   WHOSE SYMBOLS? Both the East Germans (by choice) and the Hong
Kong Chinese (by force of an old British treaty) completely gave up
their identity as nations. That is, they gave up their separate
governments, athletic teams, flags, songs and history, agreeing to
accept new versions of all of the above from West Germany and
China, respectively. While some, particularly in East Germany,
found this process harsh and disorienting, most consider it to have
been an absolutely necessary prerequisite to the formation of a new
nation.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has already indicated its reluctance to give up its
identity, so if the regime doesn't collapse altogether, a
compromise may be necessary, perhaps along the example of South
Africa, which invented a whole new flag to match its new,
post-apartheid identity _ if, that is, South Koreans can bear
including symbolic elements of the Stalinist hermit state in their
own songs and flags.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT FUTURE FOR THE NOMENCLATURE? A related issue is the fate of
North Korea's ruling elite, who, if unification is to proceed
without unpleasant surprises, will have to be persuaded to accept
it. This _ I promised to mention Moldova _ is precisely what didn't
happen there: The Moldovan elite could never see the point of
losing their power and influence in a reunited Romania, hence the
reunification of Romania never took place.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, South Koreans will be loath to buy off a
group of corrupt, evil men who have literally forced their
countrymen to die of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways around this, of course: It is possible to promise
the North Korean leadership various things?a role in the new state,
immunization from prosecution, and so on _ and then break the
promises later on. Many East European countries have also gone the
route of economic enfranchisement, effectively handing factories
and property over to the people who were in charge of them before
in exchange for their political power.
</P>
<P>
   This keeps the old men quiet, but it also converts a corrupt,
totalitarian elite into a corrupt capitalist elite, which is not
necessarily much better.
</P>
<P>
   AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHERS? The end of North Korea, if it were to
come about, might even have consequences in another, very different
part of the world. Three-quarters of a century after the Bolshevik
revolution, there would be but a single, genuinely Marxist state
left on the planet. China and Vietnam still pay lip service, but
only Fidel Castro would be actively pursuing the ideals that have
helped impoverish so much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Would this make him feel lonely? Empowered? Aggressive? Perhaps
we should start planning for the reunification of Cuba and Miami.

&HT;     NEW `SHAFT' DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE ORIGINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all know Shaft. He's the stone-cool guy in the turtleneck and
snappy leather coat. He's the man who can amble, unfazed by any
little thing like mortal peril, through bustling Manhattan traffic
without getting scratched. He's _ what did Isaac Hayes call him? _
the black private dick who's the sex machine to all the chicks.
</P>
<P>
   Sex machine: Now there's a term that went out with streaking.
You don't hear that used much any longer, unless it's meant to
describe some new, post-Viagral bio-mechanical device devised by
Harvard researchers. The original Shaft, played with such splendid
unflappability by Richard Roundtree in the 1971 film by the same
name, would have been flummoxed by the current landscape of complex
sexual and racial politics.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been flummoxed, moreover, by the forced jokiness
and summer-action mayhem of this newly released update, which
kowtows to movie stereotypes as much as the first ``Shaft'' changed
them.
</P>
<P>
   This new ``Shaft'' was directed by John Singleton, who has built
his career from insightful, in-your-face talk-ups of race relations
in America. It stars Samuel L. Jackson (as John Shaft the Younger,
nephew to John Shaft the Elder, played in a few brief scenes by
Roundtree), for whom ``in your face'' is a vaunted art form. The
resulting collaboration lacks any and all subtlety _ the
all-encompassing coolness of the original _ and winds up portraying
this iconic black figure as a renegade hothead. It's not Shaft;
it's Mel Gibson, freaking his way through a ``Lethal Weapon''
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember anything about the original ``Shaft,'' remember
this: Despite touches of humor, it was a deadly serious
undertaking. It was a film about the brothers taking care of
things, about a private detective and a crew of rag-tag black-power
activists rescuing a dope king's daughter from the clutches of the
Mafia. Later classed as ``blaxploitation'' (along with ``Superfly''
and its kin), ``Shaft'' was actually about empowerment _ about
African-American heroes attacking the heart of urban lawlessness.
Police were on the periphery. Whites were on the periphery. Only
blacks were at the center of things, making do for each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the new ``Shaft,'' the race lines aren't gone; they're
exaggerated. Shaft is now a New York cop with a mercurial
disposition and a wink-wink way with the ladies _ though we never
actually see him getting naked with chicks, perhaps indicating some
rusty gears on the part of El Machine. In any case, Shaft's hackles
are raised when a yuppie scumbag (Christian Bale, who played a
similar yuppie scumbag in ``American Psycho'') cracks the skull of
an African-American guy outside a tres-hip downtown club.
</P>
<P>
   The yuppie scumbag, who does double duty as a dirty racist pig,
jumps bail and phones Shaft from Switzerland, which of course
raises Shaft's hackles even higher. When the
yuppie-scumbag-dirty-racist-pig returns to the States two years
later, Shaft arrests him a second time and then watches, hackles
raised to nosebleed, as a judge lets the bail-jumper out on bail
again. But not before the YSDRP hooks up with a jailed Latino pot
dealer (Jeffrey Wright), who has a grudge against Shaft, who might
or might not be able to help the YSDRP in his quest to eliminate
the murder's one witness, who's played by Toni Collette in a
criminal waste of talent. Busta Rhymes plays Shaft's a rasta
sidekick; Vanessa Williams and Dan Hedaya play cops.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. True to its action-movie aspirations, the script
(by Singleton, the usually trustworthy Richard Price and Shane
Salerno, who contributed to ``Armageddon'') is a bullet-riddled
quilt of arch one-liners and hyper-edited bloodbaths, none of them
compelling as drama. This ``Shaft'' is more violent than the
original; its humor is more contrived; its limning of racist
attitudes is much more simplistic. It also makes less sense: At no
point does anyone think to test the murder weapon for fingerprints
or the murderer for blood traces (d'oh).
</P>
<P>
   As for Jackson, he's no suave gumshoe. Despite Armani
turtlenecks and a broad repertoire of scowls, he lacks the
imperturbable poise of Roundtree's proto-Shaft. He's best, and the
film is best, at the very beginning, as Isaac Hayes' mellow theme
song comes rolling over the soundtrack. David Arnold's score rides
that '70s wave to great effect for the next 100 minutes, but the
movie itself never finds the same groove: It never gives us the
black private dick in all his funky calm. The funk isn't there any
longer, or the calm. Just the dick.

ZEALOUS PRESS POUNDS BUSH ON DEATH-PENALTY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush Defends Streamlined Texas Death Penalty System,'' shouted
the front page of Wednesday's Los Angeles Times. According to the
article, ``Serious debate about how the death penalty is
administered in America has begun to percolate for the first time
in years _ a newly nuanced discussion that is spilling over into
Campaign 2000 and will likely dog Bush's campaign from now until
election day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dog? Spill? Percolate? These are the telltale verbs of a
self-concealing journalist. Once again, the media are driving a
story to embarrass George W. Bush _ and using the pretense of
objectivity to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's media-driven controversy was whether Bush had used
cocaine. Reporters kept saying the cocaine question was ``dogging''
Bush, as though the question had a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But questions don't dog politicians, reporters do. That maxim
bears repeating amid the current frenzy over Bush's use of capital
punishment. Debates don't dog politicians, much less percolate or
spill onto them. Journalists help decide when to brew those debates
and where to pour them.
</P>
<P>
   The press is well out of step with public opinion on the death
penalty. Reporters claim that ``America'' is ``rethinking'' the
issue. But while elite journalists overwhelmingly oppose the death
penalty, polls show that two-thirds of Americans still support it.
</P>
<P>
   And while the public's concerns are largely confined to whether
some people on death row might be innocent, most journalists oppose
capital punishment anyway, either in principle or because they
believe its application is racially discriminatory. They think it's
outrageous that Texas, under Bush, has executed more than 130
convicted murderers.
</P>
<P>
   They want to embarrass Bush and halt capital punishment by
exposing flaws in the Texas system.
</P>
<P>
   For months, out-of-state reporters have scoured Texas for
evidence of dubious murder convictions. Newspapers and
newsmagazines have churned out article after article to keep the
story going.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, The New York Times has published a dozen
major stories on the death penalty and the Texas system. The
Chicago Tribune issued a press release promoting its front-page
investigation (headline: ``Flawed Trials Lead to Death Chamber;
Bush Confident in System Rife With Problems''). The Los Angeles
Times sent a reporter to New Orleans to cover a federal appeals
court hearing on a screwy Texas case.
</P>
<P>
   When appellate courts find errors committed by trial courts, the
press cries scandal. When appellate courts don't find errors
committed by trial courts, the press cries scandal again. Look at
the June 12 Tribune. While the article on Page 7 protests that
two-thirds of the nation's death penalty cases ``were thrown out by
higher courts or sent back for reconsideration,'' the article on
the front page (''Justices Prove Reluctant to Nullify Cases'')
protests that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals often fails to
``acknowledge holes in the prosecution's case.''
</P>
<P>
   To obscure their zeal, journalists invoke the passive voice.
``New questions are being raised about capital punishment,'' says a
CNN report. ``Texas Lawyer's Death Row Record a Concern,'' adds the
New York Times. Whose questions? Whose concerns? Not the
reporter's.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Bush is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, the
case of death row prisoner Ricky McGinn ``has begun to take on
political significance,'' says The New York Times. Not that any
editor assigned the case such significance, mind you. The case
simply ``took it on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London agrees that McGinn ``brought the death
penalty issue into the presidential campaign.'' How McGinn
performed this delivery from his prison cell remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Every newspaper assault on Bush includes the obligatory
``scrutiny'' paragraph. The lines hardly vary. ``Texas' death
penalty system has come under increased scrutiny since Bush
announced his presidential candidacy,'' says the Tribune. ``Texas's
vigorous death penalty system is under close scrutiny because of
Bush's presidential campaign,'' says The Washington Post. ``With
Mr. Bush as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
capital punishment in Texas is under heightened scrutiny,'' says
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Who's heightening all this scrutiny? The cases themselves are
doing it. The upcoming execution of inmate Gary Graham ``is the
latest high-profile death penalty case to focus attention on Gov.
George W. Bush and how the death penalty is administered in his
state,'' says the Times.
</P>
<P>
   The issue doesn't just hound Bush (He's ``been dogged by his
remarks about Karla Faye Tucker, a Texas inmate executed early last
year,'' according to The Philadelphia Inquirer). It creeps up on
him (he gave McGinn a reprieve ``against a backdrop of creeping
unease over capital punishment,'' says Time) and occasionally
attacks him ('' '81 Death Penalty Case Confronts Bush,'' says the
Post).
</P>
<P>
   It has even arrested him. ``The Death Penalty on Trial,''
announces Newsweek's June 12 cover story. ``The death penalty is in
the dock,'' and ``capital punishment in Texas is in the cross hairs
this political season.''
</P>
<P>
   Whose cross hairs? Whose courtroom? Newsweek doesn't say.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Bush brought all this on himself. First he ran for
president. ``Bush Candidacy Puts Focus on Executions,'' reported
The New York Times. Then he hinted at a reprieve for McGinn. ``Talk
of Reprieve -- Brings Death Penalty Issue to Campaign Fore,''
responded The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went through with the reprieve, prompting CBS anchor Bob
Schieffer to conclude that Bush had ``rekindled the debate on the
death penalty'' and had ``put the focus on this whole idea of DNA
testing and whether people on death row have been correctly
defended.'' Bush, not the fourth estate, kept the fire going and
the issue in focus.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Texas criminal justice system is riddled with flaws.
Yes, there's an uncomfortably high probability that it has executed
an innocent person. But there's an even greater probability that it
has failed to bring hundreds of real killers to justice. The same
is true of other states.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is, journalists aren't writing those stories.
We're writing this one. That's our decision. And we ought to admit
it.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Camilla Parker Bowles is playing it safe.
</P>
<P>
   The mistress of Prince Charles was expected to adopt a higher
profile following the couple's first public appearance together in
London in January 1999, and her much-publicized trip last fall to
New York, where she was feted by everyone from Brooke Astor to her
favorite decorator. Social queens were all prepared to turn Parker
Bowles and the heir to the British throne into the next hot couple
on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget it. The Prince of Wales and Parker Bowles are
continuing with the same low-key approach they adopted when they
renewed their affair 13 years ago. They're seen in public more
often and are regularly photographed by the paparazzi at the
theater or opera, two of their many mutual passions. But they
aren't about to become the next Duke and Duchess of Windsor,
grabbing social invitations wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't changed that much, because I don't think they
want them to change much,'' one acquaintance says, as always
insisting on anonymity. ``I don't think Camilla wants to be out on
the party circuit every night. That doesn't interest her.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the couple is aware that the mere mention of the
name Camilla still generates antagonism among a large section of
the British public.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year she was voted the person the British would
least like to spend Valentine's Day with _ along with William
Hague, the balding, shrill leader of the Conservative party.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair as it may be, Parker Bowles still gets blamed for the
breakup of the fairy-tale romance between Prince Charles and Diana,
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and observers insist that for this reason it's unlikely
Charles, 50, and Parker Bowles, 53, will ever marry. No matter,
they essentially live together like husband and wife already.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bowles, who doesn't bother to keep a place of her own in
London, stays at Charles' apartments in St. James's Palace, except
in hunting season, when she spends more time in the country to ride
with the Beaufort Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   If Charles has an official evening engagement in London, Parker
Bowles will invite friends to the palace for dinner or go to their
homes. Her grown children, Laura and Tom, also pop into the palace
to see their mom.
</P>
<P>
   The couple spends most weekends at Charles' Highgrove estate,
where Camilla is the undisputed hostess. She now spends little time
at her own country house, Ray Mill, 16 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Their friends remain the same as always, including the Edward
van Cutsems, the Earl and Countess of Shelburne, actor Stephen Fry
and antiques dealer Piers von Westenholz and his wife, Jane, with
whom Charles and his sons, William and Harry, recently went skiing
in Klosters, Switzerland (along with the von Westenholzes' two
beautiful teen-age daughters, Violet and Victoria).
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles and Camilla live the life they always have and the
same one as their peers _ shooting weekends, fishing weekends,
holidays structured around the school term and friends to dinner,''
a friend says. ``It's a very low-key lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike with Diana, whose every step was chronicled ad infinitum,
little of Parker Bowles' comings and goings is actually known. She
and Charles didn't go on vacation together publicly until last
summer, when they took their children on a Greek Islands cruise,
although they'd had other, more private holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bowles regularly sees Charles' sons in the privacy of the
palace or Highgrove but has rarely been seen with them away from
home. One of the most recent times was when Harry watched her ride
with the Beaufort Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been absorbed into the family,'' a friend says. ``When
Charles and the boys are at Highgrove, or the boys are at home in
London, it's the four of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the low profile, Parker Bowles is hardly oblivious to
her public image. She and Charles are much more open about their
relationship among even casual acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more telling, Parker Bowles has become much more
conscious of her appearance, now favoring Valentino and Antony
Price, chic shoes with two-inch heels, the ubiquitous pashmina or
scarf and simple diamond jewelry, some of it presents from Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She dresses like what she is _ an affluent, well-bred,
middle-aged Englishwoman who is expected to look smart, not
fashionable,'' a friend says.
</P>
<P>
   But big questions remain. When will Parker Bowles, Charles and
the boys be seen in public as one big happy family? Will she be
invited to the Queen Mother's 100th birthday celebration in August?
And when will she be photographed with the Queen?
</P>
<P>
   Many speculate that William's 18th birthday on June 21 _ Charles
is hosting a dinner before William gets to go off with his friends
for a wilder bash _ might provide an opportunity for the young
future king and his father's paramour to be photographed together.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Queen Mother's party, observers say there's a 50-50
chance Parker Bowles will attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that Camilla decides to go on holiday with her
children,'' a friend says. ``But she could be invited. The Queen
Mother has seen her on numerous occasions. The Queen Mother dotes
on Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   The British press plays up the fact that the Queen continues to
refuse to receive Parker Bowles. But friends laugh off those
reports, slyly saying that no one really knows what the Queen does
in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Queen has known Camilla for over 30 years,'' one says.
``It's perfectly possible that she goes to see Charles at Highgrove
and Camilla is there. No one would know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, friends say, it doesn't matter whether the Queen
ever formally recognizes Parker Bowles' role in her eldest son's
life. The Prince and Parker Bowles are a couple, period.
</P>
<P>
   They no longer skulk about and, most important, they're no
longer desperately seeking public approval of their union.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the feeling that they've done what they can to make
people view them as normally as possible,'' a friend says. ``Now
they're just going to let things take their course.'' &QL;

<P>
   Camilla Parker Bowles is playing it safe.
</P>
<P>
   The mistress of Prince Charles was expected to adopt a higher
profile following the couple's first public appearance together in
London in January 1999, and her much-publicized trip last fall to
New York, where she was feted by everyone from Brooke Astor to her
favorite decorator. Social queens were all prepared to turn Parker
Bowles and the heir to the British throne into the next hot couple
on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget it. The Prince of Wales and Parker Bowles are
continuing with the same low-key approach they adopted when they
renewed their affair 13 years ago. They're seen in public more
often and are regularly photographed by the paparazzi at the
theater or opera, two of their many mutual passions. But they
aren't about to become the next Duke and Duchess of Windsor,
grabbing social invitations wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't changed that much, because I don't think they
want them to change much,'' one acquaintance says, as always
insisting on anonymity. ``I don't think Camilla wants to be out on
the party circuit every night. That doesn't interest her.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the couple is aware that the mere mention of the
name Camilla still generates antagonism among a large section of
the British public.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year she was voted the person the British would
least like to spend Valentine's Day with _ along with William
Hague, the balding, shrill leader of the Conservative party.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair as it may be, Parker Bowles still gets blamed for the
breakup of the fairy-tale romance between Prince Charles and Diana,
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and observers insist that for this reason it's unlikely
Charles, 50, and Parker Bowles, 53, will ever marry. No matter,
they essentially live together like husband and wife already.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bowles, who doesn't bother to keep a place of her own in
London, stays at Charles' apartments in St. James's Palace, except
in hunting season, when she spends more time in the country to ride
with the Beaufort Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   If Charles has an official evening engagement in London, Parker
Bowles will invite friends to the palace for dinner or go to their
homes. Her grown children, Laura and Tom, also pop into the palace
to see their mom.
</P>
<P>
   The couple spends most weekends at Charles' Highgrove estate,
where Camilla is the undisputed hostess. She now spends little time
at her own country house, Ray Mill, 16 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Their friends remain the same as always, including the Edward
van Cutsems, the Earl and Countess of Shelburne, actor Stephen Fry
and antiques dealer Piers von Westenholz and his wife, Jane, with
whom Charles and his sons, William and Harry, recently went skiing
in Klosters, Switzerland (along with the von Westenholzes' two
beautiful teen-age daughters, Violet and Victoria).
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles and Camilla live the life they always have and the
same one as their peers _ shooting weekends, fishing weekends,
holidays structured around the school term and friends to dinner,''
a friend says. ``It's a very low-key lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike with Diana, whose every step was chronicled ad infinitum,
little of Parker Bowles' comings and goings is actually known. She
and Charles didn't go on vacation together publicly until last
summer, when they took their children on a Greek Islands cruise,
although they'd had other, more private holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Bowles regularly sees Charles' sons in the privacy of the
palace or Highgrove but has rarely been seen with them away from
home. One of the most recent times was when Harry watched her ride
with the Beaufort Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been absorbed into the family,'' a friend says. ``When
Charles and the boys are at Highgrove, or the boys are at home in
London, it's the four of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the low profile, Parker Bowles is hardly oblivious to
her public image. She and Charles are much more open about their
relationship among even casual acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more telling, Parker Bowles has become much more
conscious of her appearance, now favoring Valentino and Antony
Price, chic shoes with two-inchheels, the ubiquitous pashmina or
scarf and simple diamond jewelry, some of it presents from Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She dresses like what she is _ an affluent, well-bred,
middle-aged Englishwoman who is expected to look smart, not
fashionable,'' a friend says.
</P>
<P>
   But big questions remain. When will Parker Bowles, Charles and
the boys be seen in public as one big happy family? Will she be
invited to the Queen Mother's 100th birthday celebration in August?
And when will she be photographed with the Queen?
</P>
<P>
   Many speculate that William's 18th birthday on June 21 _ Charles
is hosting a dinner before William gets to go off with his friends
for a wilder bash _ might provide an opportunity for the young
future king and his father's paramour to be photographed together.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Queen Mother's party, observers say there's a 50-50
chance Parker Bowles will attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that Camilla decides to go on holiday with her
children,'' a friend says. ``But she could be invited. The Queen
Mother has seen her on numerous occasions. The Queen Mother dotes
on Charles.''
</P>
<P>

&HT;     BORDER PATROL TO SEND MORE AGENTS TO SOUTH TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE PFISTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The government plans to deploy more than half of
the 430 new Border Patrol agents to be hired nationally this year
in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced it will
place 100 new agents in McAllen, 95 in Del Rio and 45 in Laredo
before Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Ten new agents also will be sent to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Garza, sector chief in McAllen, said he was pleased by the
reinforcements, which will bring to nearly 1,400 the number of
agents on patrol along 280-mile stretch of the border between South
Padre Island and Falcon Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing in Garza's sector has nearly tripled since 1994, while
at the same time apprehensions have dropped to 140,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Del Rio will see a 14 percent increase in its agents, to 792.
</P>
<P>
   John Montoya, the Laredo sector chief, said he was disappointed
with getting just 45 new hires, a 6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya said concentrations of agents in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley have forced changes in immigration patterns and have pushed
attempted crossings in the Laredo sector up 17 percent in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, apprehensions in the McAllen sector dropped
by a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate that the resources sent to McAllen and Del Rio
will incur more attempted crossings in Laredo,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said Thursday through an aide that
while every new agent is welcome, 430 are too few.
</P>
<P>
   Congress funded the hiring of 1,000 new Border Patrol agents in
2000, as it did in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agency hired only 370 agents last year. Even with a
$2,000 signing bonus, the agency can't attract enough qualified
prospects. Montoya cited the low U.S. unemployment rate as the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith aide Allen Kay said the INS lacks the political will
to hire enough field agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They managed to fill their full complement of citizenship
processors last year, despite the tight labor market,'' Kay said.
``When they want to hire people, they find a way.''

&HT;     FIGHT SHOWCASES ROLE MODELS OF BOXING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They call him Sugar for the sweetness in his
style, like Sugar Ray Robinson and Sugar Ray Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   And there seems a genuine goodness and civility that shines
through.
</P>
<P>
   Often there is little beauty in the beast called boxing. But
there is ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   A solid citizen and family man, Mosley is more familiar with rap
music than rap sheets. And at only 28, he's a big part of the
reason why his showdown with Oscar De La Hoya at Staples Center in
Los Angeles on Saturday night could be a classic, not to mention
the dose of credibility the fight game so desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   For, in the City of Angels, Mosley and De La Hoya are as close
to heaven as boxing gets.
</P>
<P>
   Good in the ring. Maybe even better out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both fighters are very respectful, even of each other,''
promoter Bob Arum said. ``Oscar and Shane are both legitimate role
models who deserve to have young people look up to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that boxing doesn't have to be thuggery and insults
and bad behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But also in boxing, that often is what sells, even if it isn't
always authentic. Fighters usually are told to snarl at the camera
and talk a little trash to help hawk a few tickets.
</P>
<P>
   This fight so far has seen none of that. And it doesn't appear
to have hurt at all. It is expected to be the richest fight in
California history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't create havoc or have any real adversity in my life,''
Mosley said. ``This sport needs success stories, and I feel I am
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known, no.
</P>
<P>
   At 34-0 with 32 knockouts, Mosley has one of the highest
knockout ratios of all time. His mix of speed, skill and passion
often invoke comparisons to Robinson and Leonard. But there is
substance behind the style.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he held a 2 1/2-year reign as International Boxing
Federation lightweight champion. He beat Philip Holiday on Aug. 2,
1997, to gain the title, then made eight successful defenses before
moving up 12 pounds and two weight classes to welterweight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other than in the neighborhood in which he grew up in
Pomona, a suburb of Los Angeles, no one has really ever heard of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike De La Hoya, Mosley is anything but a household name to
the casual fan.
</P>
<P>
   Had he won an Olympic gold medal as De La Hoya did, things might
have been different. He was a three-time national amateur champion,
but a loss to Vernon Forrest cost him a spot on the 1992 U.S.
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, on the other hand, won gold that same year and
riches followed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   For Mosley, the rise to the top has been much slower. In his
first four years as a pro, Mosley went 21-0 with 20 KOs, yet earned
a total of $65,000. De La Hoya loses more than that in his sofa
cushions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mosley fought at the Pond in Anaheim in front of 504
paying customers. Just last year, he headlined a card at the Hard
Rock Hotel &AMP; Casino against Willie Wise that drew a crowd of 1,400.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mosley maintains there never were hard feelings toward De
La Hoya, who is from neighboring East L.A. and was a frequent
sparring partner of Mosley's growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jealousy is a sickness,'' Mosley said. ``I'm grateful for what
I've gotten. Oscar's got what he's got because he earned it. I
think things not coming so easy for me has made me more
appreciative of what it took to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, his opportunity has arrived. A sellout crowd of 20,000
is expected Saturday night when he meets De La Hoya at the Staples
Center. Mosley is expected to earn $4.5 million for the fight _
more than all 34 of his previous fights combined.
</P>
<P>
   Add possible pay-per-view revenues, and Mosley could see an $8
million payday. Coupled with a new, multiyear contract with HBO,
Mosley is set for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the hype and money is nice,'' said Mosley, who is the
single father of a 6-year-old son. ``But I could push all that
aside and still have family. That's what's important to me.''

&HT;     TANKARDS: THE DRINKING VESSEL OF CHOICE IN YESTERYEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, June 18)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tankards are drinking vessels that are mainly
used for consuming beer or ale. Shaped like oversized coffee mugs,
they were popular in northern Europe, Scandinavia, Germany, the
British Isles and in Colonial America from the second half of the
16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The body of a tankard is cylindrical, with a hinged lid (making
it different from a stein, which is open on top) that's often
topped with a finial. The scroll-shaped handle sports a thumbpiece
on top.
</P>
<P>
   Like most decorative vessels, there are many variations. In the
17th and 18th centuries some of the tankard handles were whistles
that were used to summon a refill. Tankards were often made from or
in the shape of an animal horn that was meant to be hung from a
sword belt.
</P>
<P>
   Tankards have been made from horn, porcelain, pottery, carved
ivory and wooden staves hooped together, and precious metals
including pewter and silver. They are also made from a combination
of materials such as glass and silver or pewter and leather (waxed
or varnished to keep the hide from absorbing moisture).
</P>
<P>
   The term tankard originally applied only to a vessel holding
three gallons of liquid. By the 18th century, the term was also
used to signify a small, healthy-sized drink container with a lid,
which is how the term ``getting tanked up'' came about.
</P>
<P>
   Tankards vary in shape from 12 ounces to 36 ounces or more. Some
of the very large tankards were used as jugs.
</P>
<P>
   Antique tankards will often have dings or dents in them, from
centuries of merrymaking and toasts. It was common to clank
tankards together and slam them down on the bar or table. It was
easy to be rowdy with them because the closed lid kept the beverage
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 17th century, tankards (usually large ones) were
commissioned by guilds or businesses for presentation or ceremonial
use.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductions of traditional tankard styles date from the 17th
century and continue to be reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two decades ago, Christie's auction house sold an
18th-century pewter tankard for a record-breaking price of $15,000.
Prices vary with material, style, age and condition, but a new
polished pewter tankard should cost $28 to $100 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are often inscribed with initials, a date or decal
to commemorate a special occasion.

   Icebox: A just-launched site for often funny, if foul-mouthed,

entertainment sites _ including other newcomers such as iFuse.com,
The Romp, Synge.com and Thirsty.com _ trying to attract audiences
and attention. It has one potential advantage over most of the
competition: writers such as ``Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David

such as ``The Simpsons,'' ``Futurama,'' ``Frasier'' and many more. &QL; 
Features: ``Zombie College'' has gotten the most attention, a funny

HOPES FOR PEACE ON KOREAN PENINSULA SOAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The leaders of North and South Korea ended their
first summit Thursday as tens of millions of captivated Asians
watched on live television and saluted what many saw as a historic
step toward peace for the volatile Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   After a sendoff featuring hysterical cheers from half a million
flower-waving North Koreans, a military brass band, and a warm hug
from his longtime nemesis, Kim Jong Il, South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung returned home to an equally ecstatic hero's welcome on the
streets of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   More than any event in the 55 years since Korea split into the
capitalist south and the communist north, the summit raised hopes
of eventual reunification to a fever-pitch on both sides of the
world's most militarized border, and across Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest event of our history,'' Kim Dae-jung
declared before thousands of emotional, flag-waving South Koreans
Thursday. ``The people of the whole world want our cooperation and
reunification. . . . If we fail, the disappointment of the world
will be great. If we succeed, the great benefit we can expect will
be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   The aura of good feeling was reinforced by word that Washington,
in a dramatic turnaround, was poised to lift economic sanctions it
imposed on North Korea half a century ago when Pyongyang invaded
the south.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting sanctions would be the logical culmination of
Washington's rocky attempts to engage Pyongyang in recent years,
and could be a reward for the North's keeping its promise a year
ago to suspend missile tests, analysts said. The timing of the
announcement, expected Monday, seemed calculated both to avoid
upstaging the North-South dialogue and to ensure first that the
summit produced positive results.
</P>
<P>
   But almost nothing could have upstaged the astonishing scene
Thursday of the leaders of the two longtime enemy states, hands
clasped, singing a patriotic hymn and posing for photos like
long-lost brothers. In South Korea, experts and common people alike
found reason to believe that the move toward reconciliation would
succeed where earlier attempts had failed.
</P>
<P>
   The summit has tremendous implications for a peninsula long
regarded as a dangerous nuclear flashpoint, as well as for the
security of Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of eventually dismantling of the world's last Cold
War frontier raises obvious questions about America's future
strategic role in the Pacific and could have a dramatic impact on
proposals in Washington to develop a missile defense shield against
potential rogue states _ notably, North Korea. The United States
has 37,000 troops in South Korea to protect its ally from
aggression by a neighbor that boasts a million-man army, a
long-range missile program, and an alleged record of
state-sponsored terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul is almost certain to continue its tight military alliance
with the US. But Kim Changsu, director of US military studies at
the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, warned that summit
euphoria could also evolve into anti-Americanism and protests
against US forces stationed on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five to 10 years, as we approach the final stage of
reunification, we need safeguards, and US troops give that,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Even skeptical North Korea watchers in Seoul joined politicians,
diplomats, and common people in hailing the five-point agreement.
But as with any broad agreement full of niceties between longtime
enemies, the devil will be in the details _ and in the
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, the world rejoiced as rival neighbors India and
Pakistan signed a declaration of detente and cooperation in Lahore,
Pakistan _ a document that was became obsolete three months later
when Pakistan-backed insurgents set off a limited war in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the Korean accord to that debacle, Han Seung-soo, a
former South Korean ambassador to Washington, conceded that ``a
small incident somewhere along the DMZ (Korea's de-militarized
zone) could derail the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike North/South agreements in 1972 and 1991 that failed
to produce enduring results, the new declaration is the first
signed by the top leaders on each side, making this deal much more
likely to be implemented, observers said. As supreme leader of the
world's last Stalinist state, Kim Jong-il's ``word is final, and
once he decides something, it has to be carried out,'' said Park
Young-ho, senior fellow at the government-funded Korea Institute
for National Reunification in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, North Korea needs rapprochment more than ever _ or at
least the aid and trade that would come with it. Even those who
distrust the North say an economic boost through ties with the
South is the only way for Kim Jong-il to preserve his regime. The
North's factory-based command economy _ once light-years ahead of
the South's and the envy of many third-world nations _ is now
obsolete and paralyzed. Aid workers estimate that famine has
claimed 2 million lives in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can buy peace, I welcome that,'' said Cho Woong-kyu, a
national assemblyman from South Korea's opposition Grand National
Party, who fled south when war broke out 50 years ago. ``Kim
Jong-il needs assistance from us, and he and Kim Dae-jung could win
the Nobel Peace Prize if this works.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit document called for eventual reunification by
``independent'' means, cross-border visits by relatives long
separated by war, economic cooperation, a resolution of the fate of
political prisoners, and a return visit to the South by Kim
Jong-il.
</P>
<P>
   One element that the summit agreement did not address was
weapons and defense, a thorny issue between two
intensely-suspicious neighbor states that never signed a peace
treaty after a truce ended the Korean War in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim said Thursday he had had ``fruitful discussions and . .
. saw great hope'' on the sensitive issues of nuclear weapons and
missile testing.
</P>
<P>
   Defense and security issues are likely to be the last resolved
on any road to reunion, along with the question of what kind of a
political system a unified Korea would have.
</P>
<P>
   For the South, the cost of absorbing and resucitating the
economy of its communist brother _ estimated at $1 trillion _ is
bound to be another worry, especially with the vivid example of
Germany's problems since reunification.
</P>
<P>
   But from the halls of power to the streets, it escaped no one
Thursday that the ultimate payoff of peace in Korea would be a more
stable Asia. China said it ``heartily rejoices'' at the summit's
success, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori compared the
agreement to the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously things could go bad. (But) I don't think that's
likely,'' said one foreign diplomat in Seoul. And ``if it does
collapse, we wouldn't be any worse off than we were before.''

SYRIA POWER ELITE POSES PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QORDAHA, Syria _ Hafez Assad was born in a stone house in this
mountain village, and he came of age amid the hard, rural life of
the minority Alawite community that would help keep him in power
for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three days, Assad's son, Bashar, has greeted
throngs of mourners who have climbed the hills to the family
village, both to express condolences for the Syrian president's
death last Saturday and to pay political homage to the 34-year-old
heir to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, when Bashar descends from this mountain to
begin the process of accepting leadership of Syria's ruling Ba'ath
Party, diplomats and analysts wonder how long the Alawite community
can hold power in a land dominated by Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Bashar Assad's transition to power appears to
be ``very smooth and very well-scripted,'' said one veteran
diplomat in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But if he continues an aggressive campaign to root out
corruption among the Alawite military elite and a tight circle of
businessmen, he runs the risk of alienating those he needs to hold
on to power.
</P>
<P>
   And if he fails to go after this elite circle, he runs the risk
of losing the popular support he appears to be inheriting.
</P>
<P>
   The Alawite, which represent about 12 percent of Syria's 17
million people, are considered to be an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
Among Syria's elaborate mosaic of different faiths and ethnic
groups, the largest is the Sunni Muslims, who make up more than 70
percent of Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   The Alawite incorporate elements of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Mohammed Bad'r, one of the Alawite clerics at Qordaha's
Naisa Mosque, which is named for Assad's mother, said, ``We believe
all of the messages of Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed come together in
one essence.'' Asked how a small minority could maintain power,
Bad'r replied, ``The brain is a small part of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand Hafez Assad's rule it is necessary to understand
his Alawite background, and how adherents to the faith emerged from
poverty and persecution to become Syria's leaders. Most followed a
path through the military to rise, as did Assad, a general and
defense minister before taking power in a 1970 coup.
</P>
<P>
   The Alawite elite that surrounded Assad until his death were and
still are in control of the Army, the secret police, and the
Republican Guard, which virtually precludes a coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Alawite control, though, Assad was not a sectarian, and
throughout his tenure Sunni Muslims often held positions as defense
minister, prime minister, and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   But according to a biography of Assad by Patrick Seale, the
Alawite made up ``the security bedrock of the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He depended on his own community for security of tenure and
ultimate survival,'' Seale wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Riad Seif, an opposition politician and Sunni Muslim merchant,
said the Sunni majority supports Bashar Assad's stated moves toward
modernization and improving telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Bashar would have to continue to fight the
corruption within the Alawite ruling elite that surrounded and
supported his father.
</P>
<P>
   Seif said this would not pose a danger to Bashar, as the elite
only represents a fraction of the Alawite community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are weak enemies,'' he said. ``They have nothing to stand
on. What can they say, `We support corruption?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest challenge to Hafez Assad's rule came 16 years ago
in Hama _ and Assad brutally suppressed it.
</P>
<P>
   Today the farming center stands as a reminder of how Assad dealt
with opposition. In 1984, Assad ordered a military offensive on the
community and killed, by conservative estimate, 10,000 people.
Human rights groups have put the toll as high as 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few buildings still standing show the marks left by tank
and machine gun fire. After the massacre, huge tracts of a town
were bulldozed and left in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the place where most of the corpses are believed to have
been has been converted into a park and the grounds of a
government-run luxury hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no opposition left in Hama,'' said one businessman in
his mid-30s, who was raised in Hama but now lives in Damascus.
``They were either killed or they fled or they are very afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The loudest opposition to Bashar Assad has come from within his
family. His uncle, Rifaat, 63, asserted this week that Bashar does
not have the authority or experience to be president.
</P>
<P>
   A former vice president, Rifaat was forced into exile after a
failed coup attempt in 1984. Few see a scenario in which Rifaat,
now living in Europe, could emerge as a legitimate power.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rifaat's son, Moudar, dismissed his father's challenge.
``My father has a good heart, but he has people around him who do
not,'' said Moudar, 34, who is close to his cousin Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside the family home in Qardoha Wednesday, he said,
``There is no challenge to Bashar with any support. He is very
humble, very smart, and very forward thinking. And this is what the
country wants.''

PEBBLE BEACH IS AN OPEN BOOK TO CLAMPETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The word no one ordinarily pays much
attention to is ``Open.''
</P>
<P>
   It happens to be the ``United States Open'' just as it happens
to be the ``British Open.'' Now this doesn't mean you, me, or the
guy next door can take any of our pathetic parodies of a golf game
up to the first tee at Pebble Beach, but it does mean that any
certified professional, including the assistant pro at your club
who just this spring took the metal cleats off your shoes and
replaced them with the plastic ones, and any amateur with a
handicap only slightly higher than Pedro's ERA can go through the
qualifying process. If the fates are smiling, he might find himself
one of the 156 starters in a US Open.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this tournament, like all major golf tournaments,
will belong to a highly skilled and highly dedicated
52-weeks-a-year member of a Tour, either the PGA Tour or the
European Tour. But on Day 1, the most eyebrow-raising story will
always be some absolutely improbable guy who bubbles up from the
ranks of the qualifiers to shoot a wonderful score. This year, they
don't get any more improbable than Bobby Clampett, a qualfier who
shot a 68 at Pebble Beach Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a gift from God just even being here and playing in
this championship,'' he gushed.
</P>
<P>
   So while Tiger Woods shoots a bogey-less 65 a day after spending
two extra hours on the putting green even though ``I was making
them, yeah, but there are certain ways of making putts . . . I
didn't like the way I was rolling the ball,'' Bobby Clampett, who
has played in one tournament the last 21 months, goes out in 32 and
comes in with a 36. You've gotta love it.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Clampett. The name might ring a bell or two. Once upon a
time, he coulda been a contendah. Actually, he was a contendah,
finishing as high as third in this tournament back in 1982, when he
was 22 years old and, in the eyes of many, the Next Great Thing on
the PGA Tour. A three-time All-American at BYU, he shot a 70 in his
first Open round as an 18-year old.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, Mr. Can't Miss missed. His only tourney win
was the 1982 Southern Open. He last played on the Tour in 1995. If
people these days know his name at all, it's probably because he is
a full-time commentator for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   He is here for many reasons, but start with this: he is a
hometown boy, born in Monterrey. Pebble Beach is his course. He's
played it more than 200 times. That third-place finish 18 years ago
took place at, well, you've already guessed it.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's off the actual players' radar screen, he's still a
certified pro, and therefore eligible for the Open qualifying
process. He started out on May 18 by making it through the local
qualifying round as an alternate in his current place of residence,
Cary, N.C. From there he advanced through sectional qualifying in
Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about who he used to be. It's all about what he is, and
right now he explains his circumstance very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years, I've been a once-a-month golfer,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was just Pebble Beach muscle memory, or some kind of
damn memory, but he started his magical day with a birdie when he
hit a 7-iron ``about 4 feet below the hole and made it for 3.'' He
likewise birdied five, nine, and 10. By this time he knew he was
playing with house money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made the putt at nine, I was fighting back the tears
all through the front nine,'' he said. ``And when I made the putt
at nine that I hit too hard and was going to go probably 10 feet
past the hole, and it went right in the middle, I just looked up at
heaven and just thank God for that, because it was just _ it was
unbelievable. My eyes just swelled up with tears. It's hard to
describe that kind of emotion. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   He wobbled some in the back nine, but he made the shots he
needed to save every par but one. ``I've said this on the air many,
many times before,'' he declared. ``I don't care what the
circumstance is. I don't care whether you're in the lead or whether
you're behind. The only three things that matter most when you're
playing the game of golf are execution, execution, and execution.
Nothing else matters.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like something His Tigerness would say, and, speaking
of Tiger, wouldn't you know that Bobby Clampett couldn't get
through his own press conference without invoking the name of the
man with the 65, even though nobody was asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that's helped me is watching Tiger
Woods so much,'' said Clampett the Player on behalf of Clampett the
Broadcaster. ``The guy is so good, I'm fascinated by him. I love
watching him. I try to stay out of his way _ I love watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have that opportunity tomorrow, because shooting a 68
Thursday is no guarantee he won't shoot a 78 today. Tiger would
never do that, of course, but Open qualifiers have been known to do
it, and Clampett has no illusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have no expectations, to be honest with you,'' he
confided. ``Because I don't know. My swing is not tested. I know
that I have to play my A-plus game here to have any chance of being
in contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, but qualifiers, even qualifiers who once finished
third in this tournament, don't have an A-plus game.
</P>
<P>
   So relax, Bobby. Let Tiger search for the Perfect Putt. You just
take that Thursday scorecard back to Cary, N.C., and tack it up on
the wall. You've already had the qualifier's Open to die for.

 CORNING STEPS UP ITS ROLE IN THE FIBEROPTIC NETWORK MARKET

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Mass. _ Next year, Corning Inc. will celebrate the
150th anniversary of its birth as a little workshop making bottles,
lamps, and glassware just outside Union Square in Somerville.
</P>
<P>
   After several transformations, a divestiture of its cookware
division and a move to upstate New York, Corning is still making
plenty of glass products in Massachusetts _ but a thousand times
smaller, and a million times more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 18 months, Corning has spent roughly $5 billion
snapping up Massachusetts start-ups in the white-hot world of
optical networking, the use of tiny devices that send pulses of
light over fiber strands of glass to meet the exploding
communications demands of the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the world is adding more than 37 million miles of
optical fiber, equivalent to roughly 6 times the entire optical
network owned by Bell Atlantic in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   While attracting less notice than start-up buying binges by
Lucent Technologies, Cisco Systems, Nortel Networks, and Siemens
AG, Corning now counts 1,100 employees at eight sites in Greater
Boston and expects to add 300 more by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies added to the Corning stable in the last 18
months were Oak Industries in Waltham and its Bedford-based
Lasertron subsidiary, optical filter maker NetOptix of Natick, and
NZ Applied Technologies of Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Corning completed a $500 million acquisition of
the 67 percent stake it did not previously own in IntelliSense of
Wilmington. IntelliSense is developing microengineered mirrors to
build switches that can move voice and data traffic on optical
networks without converting it back to electricity to pass through
high-speed routers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where it all bubbled up from, but there is a lot
of optics activity in the Boston area, and the units we have added
there play a very important role in our strategy,'' Corning
president John Loose said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Loose declined to name other area optical start-ups Corning is
considering buying. But he said: ``I can't imagine that we're
finished. There are new technologies continually emerging, and that
(Boston) area is just a hothouse of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see a company that has a technology that's six months
ahead of ours, we will immediately move,'' Loose said. ``We don't
have a `not invented here' attitude. I think there are a lot of
companies in that quarter of the country that we are interested
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Corning dates back to 1851, when Boston entrepreneur Amory
Houghton bought an interest in a predecessor of Union Glass on
Webster Street in Somerville.
</P>
<P>
   The company, along with Lucent, in recent decades has dominated
the production of fiber-optic cables that can carry tens of
thousands of times more voice and data calls than standard copper
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years, the once-conservative company has
moved aggressively to cover a much wider range of the optical
networking market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sort of gone all out in this space,'' said Gerald J.
Fine, vice president and general manager of Corning's photonic
technologies division. ``We are very serious about covering every
aspect of the optical network. We are all trying to stay ahead of
the raging bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1990s, Corning's share of revenues from
telecommunications has soared from 25 percent to more than 70
percent, helping the company grow to nearly $5 billion in annual
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In part, its buying spree has been boosted by Wall Street's
exuberance over the optical communications segment. Corning shares
have soared fivefold in value in the last year. And Thursday they
closed at $249.75, up $12.75 in New York Stock Exchange trading
after analyst Hasan Imam at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities
raised his estimate of the company's target price to $270 from $230
per share.
</P>
<P>
   That runup has given the company ample currency to buy start-ups
in the form of stock swaps and keep up with acquisitive rivals such
as JDS Uniphase of San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Corning's $2 billion acquisition of NetOptix, formerly based in
Sturbridge, which makes devices to carry as many as 160 different
wavelengths of light over a single fiber, made NetOptix the
top-performing Massachusetts stock on this year's Globe 100 list.
NetOptix shares soared in value 35 times in the year ended March
31, thanks to Corning's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Clavenna, a consultant with Pioneer Consulting LLC in
Cambridge who follows the optical market, said that even with the
rich prices Corning has paid for Massachusetts optical start-ups,
``they have done extremely well, and they keep making good moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years they did a good job controlling the optical fiber
market, and only a modestly good job as a component company,''
Clavenna said. But in recent years, he said, ``they've been very
keen on operating like a start-up and trying to be as dynamic as
the optical networking market requires them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have speculated that big Corning component
customers such as Lucent, Nortel, Alcatel, and Sycamore Networks of
Chelmsford could over time become anxious that their vendor is
becoming a foe.
</P>
<P>
   But Loose said: ``We do not compete with any of our customers. I
hear that speculation, but at the highest levels of those
companies, I think they're comfortable that we're not going to move
into their space'' and will leave the market for developing systems
and network software to existing players.
</P>
<P>
   Corning now has five main units involved in optical
communications: fiber and cable factories; modules for amplifiers
to move traffic over continental networks; ``passive components''
like NetOptix filters that divide light into colors; ``active
components'' that transmit light, such as Lasertron's lasers; and a
new division working to switch light pulses in purely optical
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Corning Lasertron's Bedford plant, technicians dressed in
gowns, gloves, smocks, and masks from head to foot use
vacuum-sealed equipment to grow cookie-size chips of laser material
that are built literally molecule layer by molecule layer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a process comparable to scraping the canvas off a
painting to leave only the painted image, the metal plate
supporting a laser material is carefully etched off, producing up
to 4,000 source lasers from a wafer barely the size of an
Eisenhower dollar coin.

WEB SITES YIELD NO CLAIMS ON LOOTED ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been two months since four major American art museums
posted information on their Web sites about works in their
collections whose provenance, or history of ownership, may
implicate them in the widespread looting of art in Europe during
the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, as evidence has mounted that tens
of thousands of paintings, sculptures, and decorative objects owned
by Jewish families and collectors were systematically pillaged
during World War II, Jewish organizations have pressured museums to
document and publicize ``spoliated'' paintings and objects that
have gaps in provenance and, because they were in Europe during the
Third Reich, might rightfully belong to the heirs of Holocaust
victims.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no claimants have come forward to identify and seek
restitution for objects on the Web sites put up by the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of
Modern Art, or the Art Institute of Chicago. Nor have the sites
yielded significant evidence that could lead to the recovery of
stolen objects.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the queries and communiques the MFA has received have
been from members of ``the press, people interested in the issue of
Holocaust-era art, and people with inquiries about the provenance
of paintings that are not in our collection,'' said museum
spokeswoman Dawn Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum's web site list ``has generated an
incredible amount of visitorship, but absolutely no claims,
challenges, or inquiries,'' according to spokesman Harold Holzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Institute of Chicago has received ``no claims
whatsoever, and the overall reponse has been very slim,'' said
spokeswoman Eileen Herakel. ``We've also had a ton of queries from
people like a woman who said: `I have a piano. Can you tell me how
much it's worth?' ''
</P>
<P>
   MOMA ``has received some information that has helped fill in
some provenance gaps'' for paintings on its Web site, though none
have yielded the definitive histories of the paintings, according
to a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA and the Art Institute have been negotiating with
families seeking possession of what were identified as spoliated
objects before the Web sites went up. According to Museum of Fine
Arts director Malcolm Rogers, the museum is negotiating with a
party identified as the owner of a painting in the European
collection that was stolen and sold in France during the Nazi
occupation. ``The claimant wishes to keep the painting at the MFA,
and we are working toward that end,'' Rogers said early this
spring. ``The family has asked that the MFA not to reveal personal
information or details of the painting and negotiations to the
press.''
</P>
<P>
   The MFA is also involved in ongoing discussions with Christine
Koenigs of Amsterdam and the Dutch government, both of whom want to
take possession of a 16th-century Flemish painting, ``Landscape
with Burning City,'' by Herri met de Bles, which the Boston museum
acquired in 1948. In 1998, Koenigs filed a claim for the painting,
one of many owned by her grandfather until 1940. Following her
filing and reports in The Boston Globe about the de Bles and other
possible spoliated art at the MFA, the museum sought arbitration
among the parties, saying it wanted to return the painting. The
Netherlands, which has set up its own organization to review
Holocaust art claims, rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigs and the heirs of two other victims of Nazi plunder
recently asked the World Jewish Congress to pressure the Dutch
government, which Koenigs holds accountable for the delay in
returning her family property.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Institute this week announced the settlement of a claim
to a 17th-century Italian sculpture by heirs of a prominent Jewish
art collector. The amount of the settlement was not disclosed, nor
was the name of the family involved.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the North Carolina Museum of Art announced
that a 16th-century painting identified last year as stolen and
returned to a pair of elderly sisters living in Vienna, is now
coming back to the Raleigh museum. The sisters agreed to resell the
painting at a fraction of its appraised price.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish organizations and local media have criticized the
MFA for not being comprehensive or expansive enough in posting its
collection. But the MFA's site provides a digital image,
provenance, and an explanation of why gaps in the paintings'
histories raised researchers' suspicions. The Met and The Art
Institute have posted long, unannotated lists of paintings and
owners that do not indicate how likely or unlikely it is that they
were part of Nazi plunder. MOMA's roster, like the MFA's, is small
and includes digital images, though not the sort of detail provided
by the Boston museum.
</P>
<P>
   Jehuda Reinharz, president of Brandeis University and a member
of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the
United States, has said that the MFA is ``is absolutely in the
forefront of museums that are doing the right thing in posting
suspicious art on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Klothen, executive director of the commission, isn't
``surprised there haven't been more claims,'' he said Thursday.
``It's very early. And as good a step as (the museums posting of
information) is, from a claimant's perspective, it doesn't do much.
People don't know where to look for these paintings, or what museum
they may have ended up in, or whether that museum has a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's needed is a broad-based comprehensive, accessible
database. What's been done is enormously significant, but it's not
enough.''

ARRESTING IMAGES MARK SCI-FI `TITAN' LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
TITAN A.E. 
Animation directed by: Don Bluth and Gary Goldman 
Screenplay by: Ben Edlund, John August, Josh Whedon 
With the voices of: Matt Damon, Bill Pullman, John Leguizamo,
Nathan Lane, Janeane Garofalo, Drew Barrymore, Ron Perlman, Alex D.
Linz, Tone-Loc, Jim Breuer 
Running time: 95 minutes 
Rated: PG (action violence, brief sensuality and brief language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of leaving full-length animated sci-fi to Japanese
anime, Hollywood fields a good-looking entry in ``Titan A.E.'' In
fact, it's been years since Don Bluth and his forces have turned
out anything this snazzy. Its young protagonist's heroics, pitched
at preteens, are pretty standard. But the visuals are terrific in
this story of humanity fighting for a second chance after a
malevolent super-race known as the Drej wipes Earth out, but not
before a scientist blasts off in the globe-shaped spaceship that
gives the film its name, having already dispatched his young son in
a different escape craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' echoes ``Star Wars'' in more than a few respects,
from its spaceships disappearing into warp drive to its Luke
Skywalker-like hero, Cale, grown into young manhood, working a
lowly job on a salvage station, not realizing that he holds the key
to humankind's survival. A few zaps later, he's hurtling across
space with an older space veteran, Korso, in a crate piloted by a
hot-rodding young woman, Akima, right out of the world of anime.
Matt Damon voices Cale with just the right mix of surliness,
idealism, and naivete, while Drew Barrymore is a persuasively
spirited and autonomous character who gives teen girls someone with
whom to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pullman's Korso is the most interestingly layered character
(John Leguizamo, Nathan Lane, and Janeane Garofalo voice the crew
members), but the film is too busy maintaining forward motion to
spend much time probing anyone's dark side. The three earthlings
have their differences, but the smartly paced film doesn't get
bogged down in them. It pushes on, trying to beat the Drej to the
hidden Titan, the location of which is contained in a genetically
encoded map that Cale never knew he harbored. There's treachery,
and a galaxy full of narrow escapes and dogfights with Drej probe
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the insect-like title-roleist from ``Alien,'' looking
like a blue gas flame. That's the Drej, pure energy, all focused.
They give ``Titan A.E.'' visual punch, but where the film really
comes into its computer-generated own is in the various worlds the
human underdogs visit. ``Titan A.E.'' peaks when the space
guerrillas touch down on one planet with trees that release
hydrogen bubbles that amount to floating bombs, and especially in
another planet of giant ice crystals. Their slow motion and
zero-gravity shattering when something hits them is hypnotic, and
their highly reflective surfaces add a hall-of-mirrors tension to
the showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, Pullman, and Barrymore impart tanginess to their
literally and figuratively two-dimensional characters. The 2-D
rendering is a stylistic tie to anime, but the computer-generated
3-D environments through which Bluth and his collaborators propel
them are original and first-rate. Although the rock soundtrack
seems mostly like insipid pandering to the teen demographic, the
soundtrack becomes arrestingly interesting and creative in its use
of Tuvan throat singers to supply the voices of the Drej and,
later, in the sounds of the ice crystals straining and cracking. On
balance, the delivery system here feels fresh, the content rather
less so. Still, ``Titan A.E.'' is a space shot worth taking.

JOCELIN RARING FOR A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She answers to only one handle now. It's Jocelin, just Jocelin.
Born in Waterville, Maine, as Jocelin Joy Veilleux, she grew tired
of the way her last name (it is pronounced VILLE-yew) was
constantly being mangled by public address announcers on the racing
circuit. So last October, she legally dropped her middle and last
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for racing, to make it easier, just to be
different,'' explained the 29-year-old rookie on the American
Motorcycle Association Pro Series. ``It's nothing against my family
name at all. I love my family. It's a French name, very French. But
legally, it's just Jocelin now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on my driver's license, my birth certificate, my credit
cards, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   If it works for Cher and Madonna, why not Jocelin?
</P>
<P>
   When Jocelin arrives at New Hampshire International Speedway to
compete in the MBNA 250cc Grand Prix at the 77th annual Loudon
Classic, she hopes everyone will remember her name. NHIS, after
all, is where she was first exposed to motorcyle racing as a
devotee of the Loudon Classic. One trip in particular, to the 75th
running, prompted her to pursue her dream by enrolling in the
Penguin Racing School at NHIS, where she earned her AMA Pro License
after finishing a three-step course last October in just one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my hands wrapped around the fence, watching bikes go by
on the track and saying, `I can do that! I can do that!' just like
any street squirt would do,'' she said. ``I talked about it so much
that I knew it was what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An independent businesswoman who for the last five years has
operated her own sign company in Maine, Tri-Signs Inc., Jocelin has
tried to juggle her business with her thrill-seeking addiction to
motorcycle road racing. She says nothing _ not even polar bear
swimming in frozen ponds, bungee jumping, sky diving, or motorcycle
drag racing _ has matched the sheer adrenaline rush she gets from
straddling a high-performance motorcycle and throwing it around a
road course at top speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always had an interest in motorcycles, and I'm not
really sure where that stemmed from, because we didn't ever have
motorcycles in the family,'' said Jocelin, who, against her
parents' wishes, bought her first dirt bike at age 12 with money
she earned from a paper route. ``Actually, they all detested
motorcycles. Maybe that's why I liked them, because I was always a
little rebellious, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to the purchase of a Kawasaki Ninja 250 and later a
Ninja 750, which she raced on local drag strips for about five
years. But drag racing provided only a short-term fix for Jocelin's
growing need for speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it, but I didn't like that the race was all over in a
few seconds,'' she said. ``Or if you raced and lost the first one,
then you wouldn't race for the rest of the day. You get there all
excited, and in one minute _ boom _ it's over, and your weekend is
done. So it wasn't quite doing it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the Penguin Racing School as a licensed
expert, Jocelin gained valuable experience in the Loudon Road
Racing Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a female in a male-dominated sport has its advantages
and disadvantages,'' said Jocelin, who holds a degree in
criminology from the University of Maine at Augusta and briefly
pursued a career as a policewoman before giving it up to follow her
dream of racing motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disadvantages are when I really try to blend in at the
track, because it is so male-dominated,'' she said. ``I just wish I
could be one of the guys. Everything would be so cool. But when you
go ask someone for a part, their wife is glaring at you, or
whatever. Or when a guy comes over and wants to talk about how you
passed him in a turn, his girlfriend is there glaring at you. Or
when you do beat a guy, he hears it in the pits: `Oh you got beat
by a girl!' So that's the disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   One advantage, on the other hand, is that Jocelin garners more
attention from the media, fans, and potential sponsors. Another
advantage is purely physical. Her 105-pound frame gives her an edge
in the thrust-to-weight ratio of her bike, which can translate into
greater acceleration into and out of the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelin's petite build provided no buffer, however, when she
took a terrible spill in her AMA Pro debut at Daytona in March. Her
bike's motor seized as she was attempting to negotiate a high-speed
turn, causing the front wheel to bite into the asphalt and
catapulting her over the handlebars. She suffered serious injuries
to her right ankle, left arm, and shoulder as well as short-term
memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelin returned to Maine and, to her dismay, was lectured by
her doctors about the risks involved in motorcycle racing. ``I was
frustrated because there was not one doctor who was concerned about
getting me back on the bike,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one encouraging voice among the chorus of
dissenters. It belonged to fellow competitor Rich Oliver, a
four-time AMA 250cc champion.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver flew to Maine from his home in California to visit her
during her recovery, and he offered to help her fix her badly
damaged bike. Soon a romance blossomed, and now the two are a
couple. Jocelin, who is planning to sell her business in Maine and
move to California with Oliver, admits there has been serious talk
between the two about cementing their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see, but we've talked about it,'' Jocelin said.
``That would be interesting, to be the first (married) couple on
the grid. That would be a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so fortunate that he came along when he did,'' she
added, ``because I was overwhelmed with trying to hang on to the
business, trying to deal with these doctors who were lecturing me
and saying things like, `Well, you shouldn't be out there on
motorcycles, and I hope you learned your lesson.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so devastated, but then Rich would call up and say,
`Hey, I'm thinking about flying up and working on your bike a
little bit.' It was like, cool. He gave me . . . that little bit of
hope that, yeah, I can come back.''
</P>
<P>
   While she has yet to fully recover from her Daytona injuries,
Jocelin is confident and back in the saddle of her two-wheeled
mount. NHIS will be her third race of the season after making her
initial comeback at Road Atlanta a few weeks ago. She realizes the
winding road course at NHIS will present its own set of challenges,
but after all she's been through, she believes she will have a
better handle on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really just glad that I was able to be back out there
(at Road Atlanta) and throw the bike around the track,'' she said.
``But now I'm just so psyched to be ready to for Loudon.''

A $2 HANGOVER FOR US GUZZLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I'm Alan Greenspan, I'm shedding my sleek worsted suits of
businessman's blue and donning gas station coveralls to spy on gas
prices.
</P>
<P>
   As our designated First Mechanic of Inflation Fighting, the
place for Big Al's proboscis to sniff out the faintest whiffs of
inflation is at the pump. General Motors economists estimate that
American drivers are paying $40 more per month for gas than last
year _ about the price of one large coffee per day.
</P>
<P>
   But multiplied by more than 100 million drivers, that's a large
enough number to register on Big Al's Geiger counter of inflation.
People who used to fill 'er up and get change back from a 20 now
have to hit the ATM before driving to work. Gas prices again lurch
toward the $2-a-gallon level nationally and in the Midwest have
spiked higher than the dreaded deuce.
</P>
<P>
   For Guzzler Nation, this is an unwelcome development at the
onset of summer vacation drive time. Have a nice drive. Like, over
a cliff if you need to wheel the old DeSoto a long way to work and
back. There's nothing like a rocket ride in price-at-the-pump to
angrify up the blood of your basic motorist/voter.
Two-dollar-a-gallon gas could cook Al Gore's campaign. People don't
pay attention to a lot of what we put in the newspaper daily. But
the price of fuel is as accurate a barometer of voter blood
pressure as there is.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last flurry of gasoline price rises, that became the
news that most concerned the public. More Americans (58 percent)
paid attention to OPEC's chokehold on our gas station tab than any
other current news. The only comparable news interest in the Pew
Research Center tallies going back to last year were the Columbine
shootings (68 percent) and the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. (54).
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, a gallon of regular unleaded could be had for
95 cents _ cheaper than bottled water. Oil tripled by the barrel,
and gasoline, diesel, and home heating oil ratcheted up. Jawboning
by the Clinton administration against OPEC was aimed at heading off
gas at two bucks by election day. But like a boozer coming off a
bender, we gas guzzlers wake up to a hostile environment with
another king-size energy hangover. Wha' happened?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is that the price of a barrel of crude went
from $11 to $30-plus in 15 months, as tracked by a brilliant
detective job in The Wall Street Journal. The roller-coaster ride
began late in 1997, when the oil-producing countries met in
Indonesia and agreed to increase production to meet predictions of
higher demand. Wrong. Asian economies slowed down, oil consumption
dropped, and suddenly there were oceans of surplus crude.
</P>
<P>
   Things like oil, wheat, and precious metals are bought and sold
in a very complicated fashion. To smooth out huge swings in prices,
the futures market exists. But futures traders, seeing rising
production and falling demand, drove the price down, down, down.
The 11 OPEC nations need higher prices to fund their governments.
Usually they cheat one another by lying about how close they stick
to their agreed-upon quotas.
</P>
<P>
   But last year they began living up to their production cuts, and
the futures traders started driving the price up. A newly elected
president in Venezuela halted his country's traditional quota
fudging. The Y2K deadline apparently derailed some oil forecasting.
Iraq pulled the plug on its production for a time, further skewing
forecasts, the Journal found.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics about inventories, notoriously inaccurate, varied so
wildly as to be unreliable. By the middle of winter, crude oil
prices were rocketing up faster than prices at the gas pump.
Result? Refiners slowed their production, using the classic market
rationale: If it costs me more to make and I can't sell it for as
much, why don't I slow down till the situation gets closer to
normal?
</P>
<P>
   We are now in a wait-and-see mode. The US refineries are
supposed to be hitting on all cylinders now, but if one of them
breaks, as seems to happen every summer at just the wrong time, we
may see $2 a gallon. Sure, we still pay much less for gas than just
about every other modern country. And the administration claim that
the US inflation index is less energy-dependent is accurate but
rather futile. People vote on perception, not reality.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer price index rose only one-10th of 1 percent in May
_ but it is up 3.1 percent over 12 months for the country as a
whole and 4.2 percent in New England. It may be time to jog OPEC
and our own oil barons by flooding the market with government-owned
stored oil. Goosing the market with controlled release of
government oil stocks will catch some speculators short and restore
market pressures, say some oil traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense not to sell oil to this market,'' said one
options trader. ``Even the threat would drive down the price. I
find it kind of laughable that people buy the claim that nothing
can be done about it.''

&HT;     GARAGES: A HOME AWAY FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, June 18)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   What would most homeowners do without a garage? This boxy
structure not only provides shelter for cars, but extra storage
space for bicycles, the barbecue grill, lawnmower, snowblower, ski
gear, sleds, trash and recycling barrels and, in some cases, a
workbench, snowmobile, seasonal clothing and the omnipresent
basketball backstop.
</P>
<P>
   A garage may look like just another room from the outside but,
for decades they have featured a bare-bones type of interior, with
unpainted walls and humble slab concrete floors. The most exciting
feature was the labor-saving automatic garage door.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, garages have been customized and are
going high tech. Not only are they getting bigger to accommodate
vans and sport utility vehicles, but accessories like a custom tile
dog bath area with a shower hose and hair dryer and track lighting
for various tasks make them more useful.
</P>
<P>
   Garages today are a far cry from the 18th century, when owners
drove their carriages under the porte-cochere, a decorative
extension of the porch, with a roof that provided shelter from the
elements. Carports sheltered automobiles in the mid-20th century.
In many cases, they featured an additional wall. Although not as
grand an architectural statement as the porte-cochere, it served as
the forerunner of the modern garage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most homes have garage of some sort. And they are getting
bigger: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 16 percent of all
single family homes completed last year featured three- (or more)
car garages.
</P>
<P>
   Architects are designing new ways to make garages more
attractive, like splitting them up to eliminate a long line of
bays, and adding amenities.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unusual features is a turntable that revolves
the car in the garage so that it exits facing out. The driver
doesn't need to back out into heavy traffic, down a steep driveway
or from a blind entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Turntables are of most interest to people who have several cars
and don't want to move them all around to get to any particular
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``One car buff has a circular garage, and the car is driven onto
the turntable and revolved to point to its parking stall,'' said
Jeff Engelberger, product manager for the Macton Corp. in Oxford,
Conn. ``When he wants a car, he drives it out of the stall and onto
the turntable, which revolves to the garage door and exits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done several of these for private residences,''
Engelberger said. ``The deck is made from poured concrete, or a
client can inlay their own imported tiles or hardwood floor. You
can also get a diamond plate steel top, which offers excellent
grip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Macton Corp., a 50-year-old company, began installing train
turntables for switching tracks and then moved into other
applications, such as revolving restaurants for the Hyatt and
Mariott chains, the Canadian National Tower in Toronto and a
restaurant in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting a garage turntable, Engelberger said to get one
that's larger than the overall dimensions of your vehicle. This
will prevent your car from coming in contact with anything that may
be stored around the garage.
</P>
<P>
   The cost ranges from $25,000 to $40,000 for a garage turntable,
depending on the size and flooring surface. A remote control
operates the turntable from inside the car.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberger said that these turntables can also be installed
outside the garage, to keep the fumes out. The steel members are
galvanized to protect them from the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Freihofer of Menands, N.Y., placed his garages on
different levels.
</P>
<P>
   He put in a two-story garage to park extra cars _ it can hold up
to 10. A driveway leads to the lower level.
</P>
<P>
   Freihofer likes the hands-on approach and had a pit installed on
the lower level for changing oil. The building also has two exhaust
ventilation systems: one for the air and the other for the exhaust
pipe on the car; compressed air for tires and tools and floor
drains, so that the cars can be washed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Other safety features in Freihofer's garage include fume
detectors for gas and carbon monoxide. Both levels are air
conditioned and heated and have a painted interior and security
system.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular garage in the country would have to be the
one built by Microsoft tycoon Bill Gates near Seattle, according to
architect Jim Cohen, of the architectural firm Mesick Cohen Wilson
&AMP; Baker in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' 50-car concrete garage is underground on the compound of
his $53 million-plus house, covering some 66,000 square feet
overlooking Lake Washington with views of Seattle, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daylight comes from light tubes that go up through the ground.
When not in use, it becomes a basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   Even homeowners without Gates' billions can add interest to
their garages by putting in do-it-yourself features such as a
storage room or a half-bathroom.

TESTING FEVER OUT OF CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historian John Hope Franklin does not think very much of the
testing craze in American public schools, a frenzy fueled in part
by the high-stakes exams in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tests should not be the sole basis on which to base a child's
academic ability,'' he said over the phone from his home in Durham,
N.C. ``I would think you would need some measures of knowledge.
Yes, you want to know if a student can add or subtract or read in
certain way, but the nation has been carried away and students are
being swept away by all this testing.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's words should always be considered. The 85-year-old
scholar will be honored at the Museum of Fine Arts by Primary
Source, a nonprofit education resource center that promotes a more
inclusive and accurate social studies curriculum in schools
throughout New England schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Coonly of Primary Source said it is honoring Franklin
because, ``All of the work he has done is so parallel to our
efforts to uncover histories that are not taught in mainstream
history classes.'' Franklin, who has seen everything from the Great
Depression to the Internet and has over 100 honorary degrees, also
does not want to see history repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true for education. He vividly remembers
the day in the spring of 1935 where he walked from Fisk University
across town to white Vanderbilt University to take a test to
qualify for graduate studies at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professor at Vanderbilt literally threw the SAT at me,''
Franklin said. ``He was such a poor, crude critter. When I walked
out of the building, I passed a black janitor who told me that I
was the first black person he ever saw even being allowed to sit in
that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five years later, Franklin warns that too much reliance on
tests, particularly when schools receive vastly different
resources, is less about education than erecting new barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is much more important to know than a test score is a
student's family life, personal life, their socialization and so
forth to help you determine what their abilities are and might
be,'' Franklin said. ``I think the tests are stacked against any
group that has disadvantages. The tests come out of these
laboratories where people have had certain kinds of experiences,
say at prep schools and elite colleges and have had various kinds
of activities and social groups that are not part of an
underprivileged student's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not altogether racial, it's class. The message being
sent is if you don't get it, you don't get in. It will continue to
exclude people who are not only deserving but qualified in ways you
cannot tell from a single test.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, author of ``From Slavery to Freedom: A History of
Negro America,'' and winner of the 1995 Presidential Medal of
Freedom, took on what often seemed to be a thankless job in running
President Clinton's advisory panel on Clinton's race initiative.
Franklin said he thought the series of town halls elevated the
discussion of race, but much of the efforts went unheralded amid
what he said was the media's focus on controversies surrounding the
panel, such as the participation of black conservatives or how
central black/white frictions should be to the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   He remains deeply disappointed that at a plenary speech at a
massive American Society of Newspaper Editors convention, only
about 100 people showed up. ``The most permanent impression I have
of that year, the one that affected me the most, was how the media
operates,'' Franklin said. ``What I got from it was that the only
free press is the one you own yourself. They had their way of
dealing with race. What they were saying was they didn't need me or
the president to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin also praised Clinton, despite his failure to produce
his book on the initiative. This was understandable since Franklin
took the long view. A decade ago, when I interviewed Franklin, he
was so disgusted with the White House's attempts to roll back
affirmative action that he said President Reagan's ``abysmal''
leadership had ``given racism and racial aggression respectability
at the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Clinton, Franklin said that at least this president ``tried
to set a tone,'' by appointing more African-Americans to the
Cabinet than any prior president. He said the way that Mike Espy,
the late Ron Brown, and Alexis Herman were scrutinized, to the
degree of formal investigations, told him how resistant the nation
remains to high-level promotions of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reason he said affirmative action is necessary. It is a
reason that high-stakes tests should be carefully considered, less
the underprivileged be left behind. ``That hostility (toward
Clinton's black appointees) tells you a lot about what other people
(outside the administration) were really willing to accept,''
Franklin said. ``I wrote in one of my books that the legacy of the
color line would be alive and thrive well into the 21st century.
I'm sorry to say, it's true.''

`SURVIVOR': AS PHONY AS IT IS REPELLENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An associate of mine, a producer of documentaries and a jaded
New Yorker to boot, called the other day to admit an infatuation
with ``Survivor,'' the part-game show, part-reality program,
part-experiment in public back-stabbing that is now cruising into
its fourth week on CBS. Surely you've heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say that this appreciation unnerved him, but judging
from the suddenly lower tone of his voice, it was clear that such
an affinity was surprising and slightly embarrassing, if not a wee
bit disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   He is, by his own admission, a man of intellectual girth and
artistic substance, and he's supposed to see right through what
producer Mark Burnett and the network are doing, which is creating
video voyeurism disguised as a game show disguised as realism,
hence the name, as one writer termed it, ``televoyeurism.'' (Try
finding that in Webster's, pal.)
</P>
<P>
   But something is tugging at his senses and pushing his emotional
buttons, and his attempts at justifying these, well, feelings, as
though he's pondering an affair outside marriage or considering a
sex change will more than likely run his already high blood
pressure to dangerous levels.
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you what I told him: Chill, bro. ``Survivor'' is among
us, folks, and there's more coming, just in different clothing and
walking with a slightly altered limp, so brace yourself for this
latest, innovative way they've come up with to sell soap and
cookware and those menacing, road-hogging sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me while I watch the ``Survivor'' SUV zoom by and don't
attempt to leap on.
</P>
<P>
   All the talk of this series capturing the imagination of
television viewers aching for something different is the silliest
thing I've heard and the most audacious form of marketing since
Paramount's promise that its upcoming Dr. Laura TV show will lay
off gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is destined to be a much-discussed program through
the summer, now that it has shown an ability to lure viewers and
thus give television and newspapers like this one the excuse to run
the thing even further into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 castaways, or participants, who are ``competing'' for a
$1 million prize in this 13-episode series set on a remote island
describe ``Survivor'' as good dramatic TV because it's real people
doing real things. No actors, no scripts, no manipulation. But in
the stuff I've seen thus far, what's so real about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is melodrama so calculated it's as if it were
coming from a scriptwriter holed up at a roadside motel, and if you
look closely at the edits and the highly selected dialogue and
images (nice, quick, cropped shots of the womenfolk in their
bikinis and short-shorts, or of anyone showing some sign of
disapproval or disgust with someone else), it's actually quite easy
to see beyond the charade. The whole mud-orgy thing, the talk of
Him having a crush on Her, is a mixture of an after-school special
and the who-can-diss-who-de-most kind of TV we've come to know and
love from Jerry Springer and his ilk.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be careful not to label ``Survivor'' a creative or
cultural phenomenon, which is what CBS would have you believe,
since it is, at least, a financial phenomenon. The series, like
ABC's ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire,'' is doing quite well in
this era of niche audiences, when every fractionalized demographic
in the nation is pandered to by its own cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has managed to attract those young adults with low
attention spans at a far greater clip than ``Millionaire,'' yet it
still manages to gather those Americans (age 50 or so) who have
their TV speed dials set to CBS. Ah, a G-rated value the whole
family can veg out on.
</P>
<P>
   And what's the whole family wallowing in? Greed, actually, and
lessons in harsh politicized socialization, although we all seem to
forget this as we discuss in our offices and living rooms whether
``we'' would eat a rat, whether the older woman should have been
booted in the first episode, and, by the way, how could someone so
annoying be a corporate trainer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is based on the premise of winning at someone
else's expense, and we don't seem to mind, since we're only the
spectators here. Is it that, or because that's how we govern our
lives, anyway, in our own offices, among our social peers?
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure as a talk host, Arsenio Hall once told me of
being burdened by the notion that since he had a late-night talk
show, no other African-American could. As if he had to be pushed
off a cliff in order for someone else to get a shot.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the thinking behind ``Survivor,'' which, as my
associate pointed out, we see as fun and games although we'd be
sick to our stomachs if our colleagues went behind our backs to
sabotage our lives in order to lift their own.
</P>
<P>
   The scene that defines ``Survivor'' best occurred in the second
episode when two female contestants were discussing ``strategy'' of
staying on the island. They were pinpointing whom to kick off, and
suggesting that siding with another female participant who felt the
same way would only solidify this new united front.
</P>
<P>
   But the women, as ``individuals'' salivating over a $1 million
payday, bragging rights and appearances on every talk show in the
land, had to also be plotting how they could rid themselves of the
other two partners making up this alliance within an alliance. It's
a working relationship at its most insincere.
</P>
<P>
   A reader e-mailed me recently, saying she likes this sort of
thing, that ``Survivor'' can actually serve as education in how we
deal with the real cutthroats of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I had to ask: ``Are you a corporate trainer?''

MOSLEY HOMES IN ON TITLE SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the biggest disappointment of his life but
so many other things were out of kilter at the time Shane Mosley
hardly noticed he had blown the biggest chance of his life back in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Right up until he failed to make the US Olympic team, Mosley was
considered America's best amateur boxer and a lock to win a medal
in Barcelona. Although a kid who grew up near him in southern
California named Oscar De La Hoya was getting more publicity, the
people who understood boxing knew who the best amateur was back
then. It was the Mosley kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an amateur I was always the No. 1 guy in town,'' Mosley
recalled recently. ``I was the No. 1 amateur from 1989 to 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was.
</P>
<P>
   And then he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   And he's suffered for it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Something went wrong for Mosley during the Olympic trials that
year but so many other things were going wrong he took the losses
to Vernon Forrest as if they were meaningless. Then he sat home in
Pomona, Calif, 40 miles from the East Los Angeles neighborhood
where De La Hoya had grown up, and watched De La Hoya turn those
Games into his personal coronation as Crown Prince of Pugilism.
</P>
<P>
   He watched and read and ever since Mosley has been chasing De La
Hoya the same way they used to chase each other as amateurs whose
paths kept crossing in gyms around southern California. Saturday
night, he'll finally catch him. Then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``After those Olympics, all of a sudden it was like he shot past
me,'' Mosley recalled this week while relaxing in his hotel suite
in downtown L.A., less than a mile from the Staples Center where he
and De La Hoya will square off for the World Boxing Council
welterweight title in what is expected to be one of the highest
grossing non-heavyweight pay-per-view shows in history. ``I just
never got the same kind of recognition he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, at least, until this week. Not until a week in which
Mosley, now an undefeated former International Boxing Federation
lightweight champion with 34 straight victories (32 of which ended
in early siestas for his opponent), has promised he will take
boxing's Golden Boy ``soul searching.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley has shown not a hint of nervousness all week. His
confident smile and amiable disposition have been unchanged from
all the other days and nights he has visited with the press or his
friends in the past. He has spoken respectfully of De La Hoya yet
always made clear what he believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a better fighter than he is,'' Mosley says. He says it in
words and in every action he takes. Despite the fact De La Hoya has
become one of the biggest draws in boxing and a national Latino
phenomenon, nothing has changed since 1992 for Mosley. To him, at
least, there is no question who is the best fighter in southern
California and the world. De La Hoya may be good, Mosley says, but
I was always better.
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, for those few weeks eight years ago when
everything fell apart for Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, I had so many things in my life going wrong
that not going to the Olympics was not a shock at all,'' he said.
``It was just, `Oh, I didn't go.' I was going through some trying
times. There were a lot of pressures on me. Too many for a kid to
handle at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not taking anything away from Vernon. The better man
won that night. Next time, though, it won't be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time Mosley's young son had just been born and he was in
a nasty custody battle with the child's mother. He also was still
mourning the death of his 16-year-old nephew, who died in a car
accident and Mosley was unable to accept that sad reality.
</P>
<P>
   He was spending nearly as much time in custody fights as he was
in real fights and surrounding all that was the mounting pressure
that comes with being your country's leading amateur boxer in an
Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about going to the Olympics,'' Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya faced many of the same pressures because America
adopted his story of fighting to win the gold medal in the memory
of his dead mother as their own and he triumphed over it. Mosley, a
year older but buffeted by too many ill winds, did not and lost to
Forrest and then became lost in the forest of professional prize
fighting for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Small at 139 pounds and without the special entree of being an
Olympic champion, Mosley kicked around southern California for
nearly a year before he got his first professional fight. His
father was training him then, as he does today, but the kid had
lousy promoters and spent more time sparring with pros like Zack
Padilla, Paul Gonzalez, Genaro Hernandez, and Hector Lopez in
Pomona than he did fighting for money. In his first professional
bout on Feb. 11, 1993 he stopped former California champion Greg
Puente in five rounds at the Hollywood Palladium.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley made about $600 that night. De La Hoya had already made
his pro debut by then, knocking out Lamar Williams on Nov. 23, 1992
after signing a promotional deal worth more than a million dollars.
The gap between the two rivals couldn't be much wider and it has
stayed that way through the years, even after Mosley hooked up with
promoter Cedric Kushner and eventually landed a shot at the IBF
lightweight title.
</P>
<P>
   It took Mosley 23 victories to get into the ring with Philip
Holiday for short money and a shot at the IBF championship, which
he won by taking a unanimous decision. De La Hoya, in contrast, won
his first world title in his 12th fight and was already on HBO.
Mosley's first title defense was on USA Network.
</P>
<P>
   That is how it has gone since 1992. Both fighters winning but De
La Hoya always winning bigger. Much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   For this fight Mosley will earn $4.5 million, by far the biggest
payday of his career. De La Hoya will earn more than twice as much
and it will be a paycut from his last big fight, the night he
tasted defeat for the only time in his career when he lost a
controversial decision to Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone on different roads,'' Mosley said of De la Hoya.
``My first couple of years (as a pro) were difficult but they
helped me become stronger as a person and as a fighter. I had to
stay disciplined. I was out for a year and had to go through going
to the gym every day without any fights and sparring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked as a sparring partner in those hard times. I moved
back in my father's house. You can say I've been in Oscar's shadow
a long time. That's why it's important to be the best I can against
him, to define who I am as a fighter. God works in mysterious ways.
Maybe if I beat Vernon Forrest I'd be in a different place today.''
</P>
<P>
   The gamblers who have made De La Hoya a 2 1/2-to-1 favorite
believe Mosley will be wishing he was in a different place because
they believe De La Hoya is the Jolly Green Giant while Mosley has
sprouted from the land of the Lilliputians.
</P>
<P>
   While economically it could be argued that is true, physically
there is far less difference between the fighters than people
think. Because De La Hoya has been fighting as a welterweight for
more than three years while Mosley made his name as lightweight
(135 pounds) champion, there is the tendency to believe this is a
small man against a big man. Fact is, for six of the eight years
they have been professionals, Mosley has fought at the same or in a
bigger weight class because De La Hoya began his career fighting at
130 pounds and won his first title at that weight while Mosley has
always been 135 or bigger.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, while De La Hoya is probably four inches
taller than Mosley, the shorter man (who claims to be 5 feet,
inches but looks 5-7) actually has a 2-inch reach advantage at 74
inches. At 11 1/2 inches, Mosley's fist is 2 1/2 inches bigger than
De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is of little significance but the reach advantage may
be because although Mosley fights like a perpetual motion machine,
he has the speed and skills to box on the outside or fight to the
body on the inside and he knows it. Now all he has to do is
convince De La Hoya and the world of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``De La Hoya's people keep saying I may be overwhelmed by the
moment,'' Mosley said. ``Why? I can't be afraid of something I
want. There's no need to be afraid of what I want _ greatness. This
is my opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he pressures me like he says he's going to . . . the people
will get a great fight.''
</P>
<P>
   After he says those last words, Mosley smiles like a man who
knows a secret. He had seemed to want to say something different
about the consequences of De La Hoya attacking him but thought
better of it. But only for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can know the future, but I believe in my heart I can
knock out Oscar,'' he said. ``I believe this is a fight for who's
the best pound for pound fighter in the world. Bragging rights in
L.A. come along with that but this is about who's the best fighter
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't go into this with any concerns. I feel I'm the
stronger, faster, better man. I don't have any doubts. I have no
concerns about walking down that aisle to the ring . . . This fight
is for honor. It's for who's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is, the kid from Pomona who has been chasing De La
Hoya for so many years has already promised to do the honorable
thing. Four days before he was to box De La Hoya for the first time
since they were teenagers, Mosley promised him a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I'm counting on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he flashed his trademark smile and nodded as if to make one
last point clear: ``This ain't going to be like 1992.''

RASHAD ANSWERS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By most accounts, Ahmad Rashad shouldn't be anywhere near the
word journalism. Critics say he is too soft, too chummy with
players, too friendly to ask tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   However Rashad has one of the most recognizable faces on
television and people have liked him for a long time. More
importantly, NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol likes him, and Rashad
won't be leaving NBC anytime soon. In fact, once the NBA Finals are
over, Rashad is boning up for the Summer Olympics in Sydney, where
he will report nightly features with Bob Costas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is getting through all of this while continuing to
smile,'' Rashad said. ``There's a lot of jealousy out there. But my
critics tend to forget that this is a business of relationships.
This is sports entertainment. It's about relationships; it's about
contacts. My relationships are my strength. One of my best friends
is Michael Jordan, who just happened to be the best basketball
player on the planet. My access was unlimited, and there was a lot
of jealousy over that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashad doesn't apologize for being friendly with the athletes he
covers. ``Hey, if my boss wants to know the status of Kobe Bryant's
ankle problem, I'll call Kobe at home or on his cell phone. Put it
this way: If I need any top athlete, I can get him or her.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashad is not simply talking trash. He plays golf with Tiger
Woods; he hangs out with Ed Bradley, Bill Cosby, and Sidney
Poitier. As executive producer of ``Inside Stuff,'' an NBA program
aimed at kids that celebrated its 10th anniversary this year,
Rashad is the only black executive producer of any weekly network
show. He has talked with everybody in the NBA for the last decade
and remembers little things about each one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He first talked with Shaquille O'Neal about two weeks after he
left LSU. ``He tried to be funny,'' Rashad said. ``He came up to me
and said, `Aren't you Phylicia Rashad's husband?' '' Rashad
answered with some crack about O'Neal's highwater pants. ``A lot of
people think Shaq is a difficult interview,'' Rashad said. ``But he
is like the kid when you are growing up that has a younger brother
that everybody just beats on from time to time. It just so happens
this particular kid grew up huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashad is cool, old-school cool. But the playa-haters always
have something negative to say.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard the stuff about softball questions before. He said
he asked Jordan about his gambling problem. He asked Jordan about
his father. ``Those were very pointed questions that generated
poignant answers,'' Rashad said. ``I can't help it if I didn't ask
those questions with a scowl on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, not bad at all for the former All-Pro wide receiver who
knew that one day his playing days would end. His father taught him
to have options and so he did, working at a local television
station while he played for the Minnesota Vikings. He covered a
little bit of everything, paying his dues at tractor pulls, girls'
basketball games and boys' hockey. When he retired in 1983, Rashad
joined NBC as a football analyst, working in studio on NFL pregame
shows, then as a game color commentator. Football had served him
well, but he never wanted to limit himself to one sport. He is
still not the smoothest television personality, but he has worked
hard at his skills and knows his limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Rashad is now better known for basketball than the sport he
played, but he knows football. When he played at the University of
Oregon, he learned from assistant coaches George Seifert and John
Robinson. The quarterback was Dan Fouts. Rashad also wrote a book
about his NFL playing days. ``Rashad: Vikes, Mikes, and Something
on the Backside'' didn't go over too well with Vikings management.
Rashad wrote about drug use, excessive drinking, and players
hitting the field on Sunday afternoons with hangovers. Rashad has a
history of being unafraid, starting in his freshman year when he
was kicked off the basketball team for refusing to trim his afro.
He converted to Islam in the early 1970s and lost his previous
name, Bobby Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Rashad is softer now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an entertainer,'' he said. ``I'm not on the nightly news.
Most of the people watch sports for entertainment, not breaking
news, and I'm very comfortable with my role as an entertainer. My
goal was to be like Howard Cosell or Brent Musburger back in the
day _ when you saw those guys at an event, it must have been a big
event. That is what I aspired to.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the record, very few people criticized Cosell for his
relationship with Ali. What astounded Rashad about some of his
critics is that they would trash him publicly, then turn around and
ask him for a favor, usually involving Jordan. The worst was the
silence.
</P>
<P>
   When Jim Gray badgered Pete Rose, Rashad's name was often
dropped as the opposite extreme of Gray. Rashad said that he
doesn't want to be the star, but would rather be the one to get the
star to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about me,'' Rashad said. ``It's about the other guy,
and if people think that I'm too friendly, then that's their
problem. It doesn't change things.''

BOSTON UNIVERSITY SEEKS PROFIT FROM FRAMINGHAM HEART STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG AND LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patient data from the world-famous Framingham Heart Study _ the
pioneering research into heart attacks and strokes that has been
available free of charge for 50 years _ for the first time will be
sold for a profit under a new venture started by the study's
sponsor, Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   The university has struck a deal with a group of venture
capitalists, who have committed $21 million to form Framingham
Genomic Medicine Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company will use the heart study's vast collection of
genetic, clinical, and behavioral data from the 10,000
participants, all families from Framingham, Mass., to create a huge
electronic database. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are
expected to pay annual fees to access the treasure trove of medical
information.
</P>
<P>
   The university, which owns 20 percent of the new company, said
that researchers worldwide will still have access to heart study
data cost-free and that patient privacy will be protected.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the government
agency that has paid for much of the study, said the protections so
far are inadequate and will send its director to Boston this month
to try to negotiate an agreement with the nonprofit university and
its for-profit spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham deal is not unprecedented _ drug companies racing
to create the next generation of genetically developed drugs and
diagnostic exams routinely purchase patient databases from
hospitals, health insurance companies, and pharmacy chains. And the
idea of assembling a comprehensive genetic database was launched by
DeCode Genetics, which has the rights to the genetic, medical, and
genealogical information of Iceland's 270,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   But Framingham Genomic would be the first US company to gain
broad access to such a large multigenerational patient group.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is sure to reignite the debate over private profit
through use of government-funded data, an issue that flared on the
international stage in March when President Bill Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement saying that
all raw data from the government-funded Human Genome Project should
be made public quickly. The statement inadvertently devastated
biotechnology stocks, when it was misinterpreted by the markets as
meaning the two governments would oppose patenting human genomic
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one Framingham study in the whole wide world,''
said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the institute that has
contributed more than $40 million to the heart study. ``The
language could be interpreted as such that they would have
exclusive access to the data. We would never accept that. This data
was obtained with public money. Why should we give access to one
person or one company?''
</P>
<P>
   Boston University spokesman David Lampe said that the university
and the company are still trying to agree on the details, but that
they want to realize the full potential of the heart study data to
benefit the public _ something that can only be done with private
money from investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that this is an emerging area of medical ethics,''
Lampe said. ``And we want to make sure that everything is done
right. But there is no question that companies are playing a
central role in the drug-development process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham Heart Study, which has been collecting data from
families who live in its namesake city west of Boston for 52 years,
has accumulated vast amounts of information, including 500,0000
chest X-rays and electrocardiograms, 5,000 blood samples, and
truckloads of paper medical records that include diet diaries and
early studies of male balding patterns. The heart study also owns
160 computer databases.
</P>
<P>
   Data on the participants' habits such as smoking and red-meat
consumption is public, but researchers must submit a specific
proposal to gain access to genetic and family-history information _
including DNA samples from 5,000 Framingham residents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the Framingham residents' lives has led to the
publication of more then 1,000 studies and given the nation the
very concept of cardiovascular risk factors _ traits such as high
cholesterol and behaviors such as cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists sign a transfer agreement that prevents them from
redistributing the data for profit and requires them to return
``enhanced'' or new data they generate to the heart study, Lenfant
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the crux of the negotiations between Boston University
and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Lampe said all raw data will be available to researchers, as it
has always been, but that the company may want to own some new data
that it generates, such as genotyping _ looking for variations
among the participants' DNA that could explain disease or differing
reactions to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will cost the company $20 million to do that on all this
data, so naturally they want to own it,'' he said. ``But that's
still under negotiation. Should that go back to the government?
Exactly who owns what is the critical question.''
</P>
<P>
   Framingham Genomic also wants the heart study's research
committee to approve proposed projects from companies more quickly
than it's done for researchers in the past, and to free companies
from having to provide detailed descriptions of competitive
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Along with concerns about these areas, Lenfant said he wants
strict guarantees to protect participants' confidentiality and
assurances that Boston University researchers who have a financial
interest in Framingham Genomic won't be involved in oversight of
the company. Lampe said none do.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University has sent letters to the study's 6,000
surviving participants and said only two people have requested that
their medical records be excluded from the company's database.
</P>
<P>
   Lenfant said that agency lawyers are reviewing the institute's
agreement with Boston University and sorting out who owns which
portion of the heart study data. Ownership depends on how a
particular research contract was funded, through a broad contract
or a very specific grant.
</P>
<P>
   He said the institute could try to kill the deal if negotiations
with Boston University fail, but he doesn't believe such a dramatic
step will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any process that is going to speed up bringing medical
benefits to patients, I'm all for that. So much of research ends up
in libraries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the forthcoming release of the first draft of the human
genome, the mapping of more than 100,000 genes, Framingham Genomics
chief scientific officer Dr. Fred Ledley expects the heart study
database to be a resource for studies by pharmaceutical researchers
looking to identify the connection between specific genes and
health and disease outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're excited about the additional resources because
we can now use the heart study data to pursue new research areas
such as dementia, how high blood presssure affects loss of
cognitive function plus access to all the company's data,'' said
Dr. Philip A. Wolf principal investigator of the Framingham Heart
Study and a professor of neurology at the Boston University School
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Ledley said stock in Framingham Genomic will be put in a
charitable trust for the benefit of the city of Framingham. The
company will also contribute cash to fund an ethics advisory board
and science education in the city's schools, Lampe said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fair, 54, a middle school teacher in Millis and a second
generation study member, whose late father and elderly mother were
among the original Framingham Heart Study participants, said he
does not object to the for-profit deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the Framingham Heart Study gets a new source of
revenue and continues to protect our privacy, it's OK with me,
because the information from the study has helped my family,'' said
Fair, 54, whose late father benefited from the study's results on
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Ledley also consulted with George J. Annas, a medical ethicist
and chairman of the Health Law Department of Boston University's
School of public health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some issues to work out between Boston
University, the study and the company, but Fred Ledley understands
the need to deal with ethical issues before he begins,'' he said.

THAT FINAL COAT `NEVER' COMES OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June   18, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband sandblasted the first two coats of paint from our
fireplace. The third coat will not budge; 5F5 (a potent paint
stripper) did nothing. Now what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   THERESA FLYNN, Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's an old story, the bane of a homeowner's existence and a
mystery as to why that third coat doesn't come off.
</P>
<P>
   But try this: Apply a coat of the 5F5, wait 15 minutes, and
apply a second coat. Then scrape, and scrub with very coarse steel
wool. No dice? That third coat (the first that went on) may be milk
paint, which will not yield to standard strippers. Try a milk paint
stripper; Yankee Powder Paint Stripper is one, made by Viking Mfg.
Co. of West Bridgewater, Mass., 508-580-5888.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick: Continue sandblasting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I noticed that Brosco (a large distributor of building items,
windows, and other goods in New England) has a window balance
system called Tilt and Clean. Can I use that system on my Andersen
windows?
</P>
<P>
   BILL MULCAHY, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I am pretty sure you cannot. With windows, you need
brand-for-brand parts. So, call Andersen, at 612-439-5150.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to put brick on top of my concrete patio. A
friend suggested I rent a Bobcat instead and break up and tear out
the old concrete. Isn't there an easier way?
</P>
<P>
   VINCENT CAIANI, Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There sure is, and do not break up the concrete; breaking it
up is one thing, disposing of it is another. You cannot leave those
concrete chunks for the street collection.
</P>
<P>
   So, here is what to do: Drill holes in the concrete every 12
inches in both directions for proper drainage. You can rent an
impact drill at a rental store. Put a border around the concrete so
that the bricks will not spread; the bricks must be held in
position. Large pressure-treated timbers or 2 x 12 boards will do.
Now to the nitty-gritty: If the patio surface is even, you can put
bricks directly on the concrete. If the concrete is not even, you
may have to put in an inch or two of stonedust or sand to allow
bricks to line up properly and be at the proper plane.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the bricks touch each other; then sprinkle sand or
stonedust in the joints. I prefer sand.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to raise the patio too much, as a full-sized
brick will do, you can install half-thick bricks. Strangely, they
are more expensive than the full-sized bricks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The maple bed set in my bedroom is very nice. The bureau is
good, but the chest has handles hinged at the top and are
free-standing. They shake and make a racket when I walk on the
floor. How can I prevent that?
</P>
<P>
   HELEN YOUNG, Weston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, the old shaking handle syndrome, brought on by a bouncing
floor. When you walk, the floor bounces up and down; then the chest
bounces and finally the handles.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest way to fix this is to reinforce the beams holding up
the floor, or add more beams, to stop the bouncing. That is
difficult if the beams cannot be seen from below. You can imagine
it is a thankless job.
</P>
<P>
   But, how about the easy way? Buy small rubber bumpers of the
type used to keep a glass slab off a deck top. Glue one on the
plate of the handle sysem, so that the handle when it is down will
touch that rubber bumper. If there is no plate, you can glue or
nail the bumber to the front of the chest. If that doesn't work,
wrap the handle with duct tape. Not pretty, but like a lot of
unpretty things, it works.
</P>
<P>
   ufqWhen I had a new roof installed last October, the gutters
were removed and some vinyl replaced. Last winter I got a lot of
icicles; they were all over, hanging from the eaves, the fascia and
the gutters. What is wrong and how can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   SUE McDERMOTT, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If what you call vinyl replaced was a vinyl gutter, the
icicles formed because the water is not dripping into the middle of
the new gutter, the gutters are overflowing and the overflow is
turning to ice. You might be able to adjust the gutters up or down,
or nearer to the fascia, but the water must drip into the middle of
the gutter. If the water drips too close to the back or the front
of the gutter, the gutter will overflow.
</P>
<P>
   If the gutters were removed and new ones were not put up, the
dripping water will turn to ice in winter and there is nothing you
can do about it, except put up new gutters.
</P>
<P>
   If the icicles don't get too big and become a hazard when they
fall, you can live with them. The handyman has no gutters on most
of his house, and the icicles never get more than 6 inches long.
</P>

POLITICS OF OIL ARE SLIPPERY IN CAR-LOVING US: YERGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is deja vu all over again in the oil market.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a barrel of oil is hovering around $33, and
gasoline is expensive. In some Midwestern cities, the price has
topped the politically sensitive $2 a gallon mark.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what's going on and what lies ahead, we called up
Daniel Yergin. For 20 years, in books like ``Energy Future'' and
``The Prize,'' Yergin has chronicled the history and politics of
the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   Yergin is also chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates,
a consulting firm that recently put out a report entitled
``Gasoline and The American People.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to
pump more oil in March. Why are gas prices still so high?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a combination of things. The world economy has been
strong, US gasoline inventories have remained very low, and you
have some new environmental regulations that have Balkanized the
gasoline market and made it difficult to move supplies around. We
think of gasoline as a commodity, but today you can't move it 20
miles without violating federal rules. The result has been not
quite panic, but a very high-strung psychology in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Q. One thing comes through loud and clear in your report:
Americans love to drive and use gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's right. One thing we found that amazed me was that in
1980 the average licensed driver traveled 9,700 miles. In 1998,
that figure was up to 13,000 miles, an increase of 34 percent.
There are now over 185 million drivers in this country and 203
million light vehicles. About one out of every nine barrels of oil
used in the world every day is consumed by the American motorist.
</P>
<P>
   Q. OPEC is meeting next week. Will they agree to pump more oil?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think they will. Their target band for prices is $22 to $28
a barrel, and they are way over that now. Countries like Saudi
Arabia and Mexico know it is not in their interest to have prices
so high. The Mexican finance minister said recently that the number
one risk to the Mexican economy was a slowdown in the American
economy. I also don't think OPEC wants oil to be an issue in the US
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Once upon a time, the OPEC countries had lots of spare
capacity. Now we read that many countries couldn't pump any more
oil if they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   A. Supplies are not quite as tight as people think. There is
probably four to five million barrels a day of spare capacity in
the world, but half of that is in Saudi Arabia. Many countries like
Iran and Nigeria are pumping as much as they can. When oil prices
collapsed in 1997 and 1998, investment fell off. Some of the oil
producers lost 40 percent of their national revenue. They didn't
have the ability to maintain investment.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So the current rise in prices is a result of the fall in
prices we had a few years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A. One thing I learned while writing ``The Prize'' was that each
boom plants the seed for the next bust, and each bust plants the
seed for the next boom.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have we moved into a period where prices are going to stay
high?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think we are in a period where the floor on oil prices will
be $20 to $22 a barrel. And the ceiling? It's hard to say. When you
have a system that is this tight, any number of things could cause
prices to spike. You could have a pipeline accident in a local
market. On an international scale, a political crisis in Nigeria or
Iraq could create a risk of much higher prices. Still, it is
important to say that the key oil producers don't want to see
prices as high as they are now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. People may not appreciate it, but in your report you say that
by historical standards today's prices are not all that high.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's right. At $1.50 a gallon, Americans are spending about
3 percent of their household incomes on gasoline, which is just
about the historical average. Adjusted for inflation, prices were
higher in the 1960s and much higher in 1980. When gasoline prices
fell below $1 a gallon in 1999, they were even lower than they were
during the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But that is not how the public thinks about gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   A. People don't think in an inflation-adjusted way. If gas
prices get closer to $2 a barrel, you can bet they will be a big
political issue. Gas prices are the most visible prices we have.

A NEW MAGIC ANIMATES DISNEY `FANTASIA/2000'

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes size does matter at the movies, and seeing ``Fantasia
2000'' in a regular theater, and not IMAX, where it was unveiled,
does make a difference. The difference is magnified by the fact
that the best sequence in the new Disney blend of animation and
classical music is one involving whales, and size is part of what
whales are about. It could be worse. On TV, they'd look like
mackerel. Still, the pod of whales rising out of the sea to float
like zeppelins in the clouds when they aren't gliding among ice
floes makes this new ``Fantasia'' mandatory viewing. Those whales
are the stars of this new ``Fantasia,'' and they're still pretty
impressive. If the sequence's cool greens and blues don't get you,
the trancy mystery of it all surely will.
</P>
<P>
   Set to Respighi's ``Pines of Rome,'' the whale number is an
instant classic that reminds us that it's much easier to set a
riveting ballet to a piece of second-rate music than to a towering
masterpiece. Still, the whales would arguably be even more
impressive against silence. As for the figurative big picture,
``Fantasia/2000'' consists of seven new segments and a reprised
Mickey Mouse in ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' In part, it's a
demonstration of what Disney's artists can do with their new
computerized toys. It's impressive, but, like the original
``Fantasia,'' a bit undersupplied. In baseball terms, it's a solid
two-bagger, not a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Disney intended to update his 1940 ``Fantasia'' every few years.
But World War II intervened, ``Fantasia'' was a flop that didn't
move into the black until its abstract patternings turned it into a
money-making head movie in 1969, and music education itself took a
big leap forward in the intervening years _ partly due to
``Fantasia.'' Its signature frame is the one in which conductor
Leopold Stokowski is shown shaking hands with Mickey Mouse before
conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. ``Fantasia'' was kitsch from
the start. And the music was truncated. But Stokowski fulfilled a
function few conductors could have. He was the most unabashedly
hammy of conductors, whose flamboyance earned him armies of
detractors. Yet he possessed artistic credentials that meant he had
to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when America was still climbing out from under its
inferiority complex about Europe, he bridged a gap. James Levine,
who mostly conducts the Metropolitan Opera, but who has a history
with the Chicago Symphony, brings ease and poise to his
intermediary role here, reflecting the rollback in stiffness
between Americans and classical music. Disney has had the good
sense to divide the hosting among a handful of savvy, engaging
pros, ranging from Steve Martin to Bette Midler to Quincy Jones to
Angela Lansbury to Penn and Teller, who drolly reintroduce what
today looks like a very grainy Mickey Mouse, in his borrowed pointy
hat with the stars and the moons, trying to turn the magic off
before the brooms flood the sorcerer's lair with the pails of water
Mickey can't make them stop carrying in.
</P>
<P>
   If the grainy ``Sorcerer's Apprentice'' was included to show off
today's technical dazzle, provide continuity, and repeat
science-fiction's curiously reactionary warning to avoid
venturesomeness, the new episodes more than once genuflect to it
stylistically. In fact, they spend more time looking back than
forward. The geometric shapes that morph into butterfllies and bats
in the opening section (to Beethoven's Fifth) seem perfunctory,
less inspired than the corresponding abstractions accompanying
Stokowski's Bach in the original. The flamingos dancing to
Saint-Saens's ``Carnival of the Animals,'' if no less inspired than
the hippos twinkle-toeing their way through Ponchieli's ``Dance of
the Hours,'' are certainly no more inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The whale segment makes the best use of the computer's ability
to convey an almost lunar stillness, but the same director, Hendel
Butoy, is also behind the very different but certain to be the most
beloved new segment, the one that most potently feeds off the
vitality of its music. Setting Hans Christian Anderson's ``The
Steadfast Tin Soldier'' to the Allegro from Shostakovich's Piano
Concerto No. 2 freshens the film's traditional spirit with a
classy, affecting interplay, dark when it has to be, among a
ballerina, a menacing jack-in-the-box, and the brave one-legged toy
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The kinetic, propulsive sequence set to Stravinsky's 1919
``Firebird'' Suite (second _ and leanest _ of the three he
extracted from the full score), depicting a pagan goddess
regenerating the earth after a volcanic demon consumes it in
flames, seems to owe more to the demon rising up out of
Mussorgsky's ``Night on Bald Mountain'' than to, say, the more
recent and more innovative take on nature in ``Princess Mononoke.''
It works as spectacle, whooshing through its motions as slickly as
``Tarzan.'' Yet it typifies much in the new ``Fantasia/2000'' in
that it seems more intent on establishing a firm link to the
traditional Disney house style than to pushing into challengingly
innovative territory.
</P>
<P>
   The episode in which Donald Duck acts as a gatekeeper for Noah,
ushering animals into the Ark to Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance
Marches, while nearly losing Daisy in the process, is attractive
enough, but it's just there, never really leaping off the screen in
a way that surprises and delights. The chapter played out to
Gershwin's `Rhapsody in Blue'' by characters from the pen of
Broadway's legendary Line King, Al Hirschfeld, is, surprisingly, a
bit of a letdown, too. New York never rides higher than on
Gershwin's music, while Hirschfeld's drawings, with their elegant
panache, are in themesleves a logo for Manhattan glamor. But these
modest Jazz Age vignettes are underwhelming. Too bad they couldn't
have included a few period celebs. The closest we get is a rich
woman's henpecked husband, who suggests Alexander Woollcott doing a
Walter Mitty number. See it for the whales and the tin soldier, but
``Fantasia/2000'' won't retire the first ``Fantasia.''

ANNUAL VAN CLIBURN COMPETITION CELEBRATES THE JOYS OF AMATEURISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rangy Van Cliburn strode to the podium and
spoke to the audience that eagerly awaited the results of the
second annual International Piano Competition For Outstanding
Amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the 75 incredibly talented people who took
part in this competition,'' Cliburn said. ``They are wonderful
musicians, and they are all pianists, which is the most thrilling
thing in the world to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn, who emerges from semiretirement to play the Tchaikovsky
Concerto at Tanglewood Aug. 4 and a Fleet Celebrity Series recital
in Symphony Hall March 4, went on. ``I always found the stage to be
the loneliest place in the world. It's a strange kind of
loneliness, when you try to take something which exists only as ink
on paper and make it come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The marquee on the movie theater in downtown Fort Worth last
weekend told the whole story of this competition _ ``Dinosaur,''
``Gladiator,'' ``Mission Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The piano no longer occupies the central position in musical
culture and family life that it held for at least a century. Those
who learn to play the instrument well are dinosaurs; those who
enter competitions are gladiators; those who hope to make society
recognize and respect the place the piano and its literature
occupies in their lives and imaginations have embarked on a mission
that is probably really impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But they do it anyway _ these doctors, lawyers, scientists,
computer whizzes, and homemakers, not to mention the TV anchor, the
blackjack dealer, the astrologer, and the assistant manager of a
Starbucks at Second and Ninth in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn was right to find this second amateur competition
inspiring. There was a lot of wonderful playing, and the collective
spirit felt incomparably better than it did last year, when I also
served on the press jury. Last year some veterans of the
professional competition circuit let nothing get in their way as
they played to win. Even in the second edition, there were several
pianists of professional caliber with impressive professional
credentials who are ``amateurs'' only because they have other
interests or face economic imperatives. Out of the corner of my
mouth I wondered if the next competition should institute a new
award for ``the best real amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   (Jury and press jury again worked for the love of it, like
amateurs, although the Cliburn Foundation did pick up the tab for
travel expenses and lodging, and the incomparable Fort Worth
hostesses vied with each other to produce the most sumptuous lunch.
A restaurant offered pie a la mode at breakfastime, and I had me
some; chicken-fried chicken came with two vegetables, which turned
out to be red beans and french fries _ my idea of vegetables.)
</P>
<P>
   Inspiring as the competition was, it was also profoundly
depressing. It represented a celebration of the piano and the
discipline of playing the instrument; it was a celebration of
music, and of the people who have to make music, no matter what.
But it was also an indictment of a society that has so little place
for people with musical gifts to exercise them, especially if they
want to live the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   The winner this year was the guy from Starbucks, Christopher
Basso, 41. He is a wonderful pianist and musician with a boyishly
engaging platform presence. He played a Scarlatti Sonata with
polish and dash; a poised and poetic Chopin Nocturne; some
elegantly voiced Rachmaninoff. Lots of people this year rushed in
where party animals fear to tread and offered ``L'Isle Joyeuse''
(known as ``Pleasure Island'' within the piano community), but
Basso was the only one who could actually play the notes and
transmute them into orgiastic delight. In the final round Basso
offered only one work, Prokofiev's Sonata No. 8, one of his war
sonatas. Basso used his corruscating virtuosity, his flexible
rhythmic spine, and his chameleon colors to communicate the sorrow,
the irony, the rage, and the compassion of this great score. He was
the unanimous first choice of the jury, the press jury, and the
audience (which was polled).
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation afterward, Basso said he had been at Starbucks
for six years. He works the early-morning shift, and counts that as
his social life, so he can spend the rest of the day with music.
``I've had a long series of odd jobs,'' he said. ``I've been a
bartender and waited tables like an actor between auditions. I
guess I'm afraid I never thought I was good enough to make a career
in music.''
</P>
<P>
   Basso did not study at one of the major East Coast
conservatories or work with teachers plugged into power-networking.
Although his bio says he won a ``top prize'' in a previous piano
competition in Cincinnati, he seems to have slipped through the net
_ which represents a damning criticism of the net. One hopes
Basso's victory in Fort Worth will produce something more
substantial than an amateur-size prize ($2,000, a recital in
Washington, D.C., and some CD goodies) and the opportunity to
become a poster boy for Starbucks. Basso is an artist, and there
are never enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the other pianists were interesting. There were three
contestants from New England. Gertrude Jonas, a retired string
teacher who is in her 80s and taking piano lessons at the New
England Conservatory, didn't make it past the first round, so I
didn't hear her, but she certainly embodied the spirit of the event
by remaining for the rest of the competition to hear and applaud
all the others. Robert Finley, an electrical engineer who lives
near Worcester, played straightforwardly and strongly in works by
Chopin and Brahms, but ran into some trouble with Ravel. He played
very late at night, and sheepishly came forward the next day to
explain that he was not used to playing ``Ondine'' after bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hawley, a professor of media technology at MIT and
onetime Duncan yo-yo champion, returned this year for a second try
at the gold. Hawley certainly deserves an honorable place on
Boston's incredible roster of significant, skilled, and exploratory
pianists. He was at his best in the semifinal round, playing a
group of nocturnal pieces. He opened with Faure, the gorgeous,
demanding, and rarely played 13th Nocturne. Then he doffed his
blazer, folded it on the floor, and offered lilting rags by William
Bolcom and a swinging virtuoso performance of Art Tatum's ``Sweet
Lorraine.'' It's no wonder he won the award for the most
adventurous programming.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley might have come in higher than fourth if the competition
had stopped at this point. In the Liszt Sonata during the final
round, the pianist offered was big, enthusiastic, and generously
detailed, but he did not succeed in pulling the work together and
hurling it like a bolt of lightning.
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed court reporter and travel guide Michael Moore's
uncompromising performance of the Griffes Sonata, which he preceded
by Gottschalk's sentimental ``The Last Hope.'' There were some
flustered moments in Mozart's F-Major Sonata played by Allan
Fuller, director of casino games, but some very lovely ones too.
Flight attendant Charles Chien played Schumann's ``Waldszenen''
with haunting gradations of tonal color before nerves destroyed his
control in the Liszt Sonata.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual pianist was Debra Saylor from Iowa. She is a
private voice teacher who did not bother to mention that she is
blind on her application. Like most of the other contestants,
Saylor is not a world-class virtuoso; what set her apart was that
she didn't pretend to be, and played well within her limits. She
has big enough chops to play Chopin's ``Fantaisie-Impromptu'' and
the finale of Beethoven's ``Moonlight'' Sonata, but she also
offered little bon-bons like Dvorak's ``Humoreske,'' played with
infectious zest, reminding us that what made this piece familiar
was how surprising it once was _ it never goes anywhere you expect
it to. You could tell Saylor is a singer from the size, beauty, and
warmth of her tone, and the breathing legato of her phrasing. Best
of all, every note means something to her, and she made it
meaningful to the rest of us. She plays straight from the heart,
and if more people did that, the recital business wouldn't be on
the skids. Saylor made us believe that being a pianist is the most
thrilling thing in the world.

Nagako spent her life insulated deep inside a Japan that no longer
exists. Indeed, she was one of the last Japanese who could remember
life inside the aristocracy early in the 20th century or in the
palace during the time when people spoke an archaic, imperial form
of Japanese that has largely disappeared. By Nicholas D. Kristof.

THERE'S A GROOVE IN THIS DUO'S FUNKY HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name couldn't be more perfect. Outfitted with a fleet of
funk-drenched samples and narcotic loops, British electronica duo
Groove Armada has scored the first full-bore dance hit of the
millennium _ and for good reason. Fatboy Slim's epic remix of ``I
See You Baby,'' along with the rest of Groove Armada's sophomore
disc ``Vertigo,'' is like manna from heaven for house music fans
who've had it with recycled disco snippets. Andy Cato and Tom
Findlay, both 27, ventured far beyond the beat-heavy confines of
the usual DJ fare, cobbling a collection of blissed-out club tomes
with such eclectic components as a 1957 Patti Page vocal, jazz
horns, endless references to doo-wop, and a deep and abiding
reverence for soul titans Sly Stone and Al Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see as our heritage people like Sly, and Stevie Wonder, and
funk bands,'' says Cato, on the phone from a hotel room in Chicago.
``We're trying to combine the brilliance of those grooves with
technology. We want to play modern music but keep that human
element.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Groove Armada has launched a US tour that inverts
the fundamental notion of contemporary dance music, bravely going
where no DJ has gone before. When Cato and Findlay take the stage
it isn't be behind a bank of turntables and DAT machines. Rather,
Groove Armada plays the music live, on instruments, with a
nine-piece band.
</P>
<P>
   The fleshed-out Groove Armada has played shows in LA, New York,
Denver, Dallas, and Chicago, and ``so far it's been amazing,'' says
Cato _ who grew up in Leeds, England, playing bass, keyboards, and
trombone. ``We'd done DJ trips to these cities, but a club show is
very, very different, and it kind of confirms what we expected.
Dallas is a good example. For the first couple of songs it was
really bizarre. People were just staring at the band. Nobody was
dancing. They were just watching. But then at the end of the song
they just exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Explains Findlay, a native of Cambridge in England and veteran
of countless jazz and brass bands: ``We tried, even as we were
recording the album, to write musical phrases that sound human. We
didn't have the idea then that we would tour with a live band. With
us, you know, it's one hour at a time. But it makes the music feel
so personal. It's really rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   What many people don't realize is that many of the samples and
loops on ``Vertigo'' weren't lifted from other records, but were
recorded by Cato and Findlay, both of whom are
multi-instrumentalists. In that light, the leap to live performance
isn't as great as it might seem. ``The album was done in a
technology-based studio setting, but a lot of the grooves were
played live,'' says Cato, who adds that the impetus for this tour
came in part from industry biases against Groove Armada's style of
music. ``There's this perception in rock that dance music is a bit
of a fad, or a sham. Time and time again at festivals it's the rock
bands up front, and the dance music kind of stuck in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Groove Armada's music is being hailed as a bridge
between the underground club scene and mainstream pop. ``It's
accurate insofar as we can DJ the smallest, dingiest clubs playing
the weirdest dance music and we also have songs that your mom and
grandma like.'' The band has in fact amassed quite a collection of
fans, among them Elton John _ who reportedly bought 200 copies of
``Vertigo'' to pass out to his friends, and who insisted that Cato
and Findlay be flown in to play at an Interview magazine party he
was headlining at New York's Kit Kat Club. Madonna, another devoted
follower, put ``Vertigo'' on her top five list of albums for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is, Groove Armada just sounds different.
Likewise, Cato and Findlay neither look nor act much like what one
would imagine the DJs du jour would. They don't sport designer
labels, trendy haircuts, or Teflon gear. Both laugh heartily and
often. They're hardly career club crawlers; Findlay studied history
at Oxford, while Cato received a degree in American Studies at
Manchester University and worked as a soccer journalist and PR
person for Nike. The two were introduced through Cato's girlfriend
and soon after launched the Groove Armada nightclub in London in
1996, where they spun the hypnotic disco-funk that would eventually
wind up on their 1998 debut, ``Northern Star.''
</P>
<P>
   To make ``Vertigo,'' they retreated to a cottage in England's
bucolic Lake District _ once again skewering the conventional image
of gritty urban chic that's historically defined dance music. ``We
feel completely at home there,'' says Cato. ``It's a lovely
routine. There's no phone, for a start, and there's usually no cell
phone reception. All there is to do is get up in the morning, check
the tune you did late the night before, and go into the village to
get logs for the fire and some food.'' It's also where they found
``Back to the Fifties'' in a basket of 50-pence CDs _ the source
for Patti Page's sweet refrain of ``if you're fond of sand dunes
and salty air'' that forms the melancholic backbone of Groove
Armada's single ``To The River.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato and Findlay have begun work on the follow-up to
``Vertigo,'' this time in a rustic house in Wales. Groove Armada's
touring band (which includes a guitarist they met doing
door-to-door radio surveys and an MC who is on Tom's soccer team)
holed up for a week of non-stop improvisation, all of which was
captured on tape. ``We've got about 20 15-minute-long jams that
will be our starting point,'' says Cato. ``Next, we'll sample to
give it a contemporary feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the record will have to happen in piecemeal fashion,
though, says Cato, who hopes to complete it during downtime between
European festival dates this summer. In the meantime, Groove Armada
is busy mastering the translation of flawless, machine-made music
into the very imperfect setting of live instrumentation. ``It's a
technical challenge,'' says Cato. ``Playing this stuff on big PA
systems, you have to thin out the sound, keep it simple, give it
space. We're trying to combine that looped, hypnotic feel and not
restrict these amazing players.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Findlay is grooving mightily on the mere idea of
getting out from behind his turntable, and in turn upending the
whole idea of what it is to be a DJ playing dance music. ``You know
some people in the UK think it's a bit tacky that we get up on
stage and jump around. There's this overwhelming sense of cool that
surrounds dance music, and we're just up there enjoying ourselves.
And we're not ashamed.''

`BOYS AND GIRLS' GETS IT TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BOYS AND GIRLS 
Directed by: Robert Iscove 
Screenplay by: The Drews: Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller 
Starring: Freddie Prinze, Jr., Claire Fiorlani, Jason Biggs, Amanda
Detmer, Heather Donahue 
Running time: 
Rated: PG-13 (sexual content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing that isn't a delight about ``Boys and Girls'' is
its generic title. Otherwise, it's a screenful of nonstop charm and
credibility with smart, hip dialogue and a radical determination to
allow its young couple to take their time before the inevitable
get-together. When Freddie Prinze Jr.'s Ryan and Claire Forlani's
Jennifer finally kiss, there's really something behind it,
including that rarest of ingredients in a campus romance _ a shared
history and a few years of friendship before the big clinch.
</P>
<P>
   Forlani was one of the few bright spots in that black hole of
moviegoing, ``Meet Joe Black.'' At the time, you wondered what she
could do in a movie that didn't have a death wish. Here's where we
find out. Forlani's Jennifer is that rarest of romantic comedy
heroines, a commitmentphobe whose neuroses never rain on her
appeal. She's the big reason ``Boys and Girls'' plays like a
college version of ``When Harry Met Sally.'' She's needy, but
Jennifer's brains and empathy make her adorable, and Forlani has
the chops to stay with her zigs and zags.
</P>
<P>
   Prinze's Ryan, who looks like a blend of Robert Downey Jr. and a
young Tim Robbins, is believable as a cautious, plan-ahead type who
would know enough to wait for Jennifer's inevitable retreat once
the first few steps beyond friendship had been taken. His charm is
not the kind that has to break through a muted exterior; he's
charming precisely because he comes on softly, insofar as he comes
on at all. Screenwriters Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller _
economically known as The Drews _ give them lots of bright,
sentient lines to volley while their fears recede.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Jennifer and Ryan live in states of near-perpetual
retreat demand a pair of zany sidekicks. These are provided by
Jason Biggs and Amanda Detmer, who find ways to snatch just enough
individuality and verve from their stereotypes to put a fresh gloss
on them. For once, you can believe these kids could actually hold
their own academically in a good college, in this case the
University of California's Berkeley campus, which, ever since ``The
Graduate,'' has imparted a built-in advantage to romantic comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls'' knows how to use its seductive settings _
Berkeley, San Francisco, and the Marin foothills, with their
terrific view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the city behind it.
Audiences accustomed to the usual brainless boy-girl stuff may find
themselves fighting impatience with the time it takes until this
couple couples. But they're such engaging company that it's worth
the wait. ``Boys and Girls'' is a comedy with a keen awareness of
everything that can go wrong in a relationship. That's one of the
things that makes it go so right.

A HIGH-VOLTAGE, 21ST-CENTURY `SHAFT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SHAFT 
Directed by: John Singleton 
Screenplay by: Richard Price (novel: Ernest Tidyman) 
Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey Wright,
Christian Bale, Dan Hedaya, Busta Rhymes, Toni Collette, Richard
Roundtree 
Running time: 94 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, someone has remembered how to remake a slick, bang-bang
action movie. We're talking about ``Shaft,'' as in John Shaft, the
private eye invented by a cherubic newspaperman from Ohio. Shaft
was a big screenful of flamboyant fun when Richard Roundtree played
him in 1971 and became the king of blaxploitation. At least half
the reason the new ``Shaft'' is cooler, grittier, and more
explosive than the original is the casting of Samuel L. Jackson in
the title role. Jackson is today's undisputed king of cool. Wearing
Shaft's long black leather overcoat as if he was born to it, he's
both righteous and believably dangerous as the new Shaft, a cop
with a short fuse, running a vicious racist killer to ground.
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson in command of the Harlem streets, maintaining a
tension and an edge, director John Singleton charges the air around
the new Shaft with equivalent electricity and involvement. As a
boy, Singleton fell in love with the original ``Shaft,'' has wanted
to remake it for years, and has successfully rejiggered it for the
new century as a smart screenful of copz 'n' crookz 'n' the hood.
The new ``Shaft'' isn't so much a remake of the original as a
reinvention of it. It's as different in its tone, in its details,
in its world, as 2000 is from 1971. Still, it reminds us that while
the original ``Shaft'' may have been a landmark of black
empowerment, there's still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   The new film is dominated by seething racist simmer. Much of it
takes place in bleak daylight and the virus of racism is much more
upfront. The original arose from the kidnapping of a Harlem gang
kingpin's daughter. This new one pushes off from a racist taunt in
a Manhattan bar that results in the vicious bludgeoning to death of
a black man. The problem lies not in identifying the murderer _ an
arrogant narcissist played by Christian Bale as a sort of extension
of his ``American Psycho'' character _ but in bringing him to
justice. In large part because the killer is the son of an
immensely wealthy real estate mogul, it isn't easy, but Shaft is
not one to shrug his shoulders and walk away.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Jackson's impact is his economy. Although he isn't
stingy with bullets in the shootouts, he mostly scores by standing
there and doing just enough to look both dangerous and unflappable.
Not easy when you've also got to float the wiseguy lingo of the
private eye genre, and make a definite fashion statement in that
long, swirling trademark coat _ all that's left of the fly clothes
of the original. But Jackson does it all by never overdoing. He
leaves the flapping to Bale's nasty brat and to his unlikely ally,
a Harlem neighborhood drug dealer who isn't afraid to think big,
or, in Jeffrey Wright's juicy performance, act big. Jackson and
Bale are simply too high-profile to be eclipsed here, but Wright
comes out of left field to go toe-to-toe with them.
</P>
<P>
   Roundtree climbs aboard, too, providing validating presence.
Looking amazingly fit considering that he originated the role 29
years ago, Roundtree low-keys it as uncle Shaft, who wants his
nephew to stop trying to fight crime from the inside as a cop and
join his detective agency instead. Roundtree even low-keys Shaft's
babe-on-each-arm-exit from a bar, but then one of the smart things
about this new ``Shaft'' is that it knows when to low-key things.
Vanessa Williams's police officer reminds us with presence that the
race gulf has been narrowed. Toni Collette, as an eyewitness on the
run because she's afraid to testify, says almost nothing, which
makes her seem all the more convincingly traumatized. The new
``Shaft,'' driven by Richard Price's gritty screenplay, is as
naturalistic as it it cartoony. Maybe a bit more so. With Jackson
leading the way, ``Shaft'' has style, punch, and street cred. It's
a hot cool update.

LOU REED TALKS UP `ECSTASY,' PLAYS DOWN CHARITABLE SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crusty and cynical are words often used to describe street poet,
punk-rock survivor Lou Reed. Caring and charitable are not words
that jump to mind, yet Reed has somehow been at many of the benefit
shows of magnitude in the past 15 years, from Farm Aid to a
performance for the Pope in Rome last year to dramatize the cause
of allowing Third World countries to be released from their debt to
industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing to talk about, really,'' Reed says, downplaying
the socially conscious side of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always done these things,'' he finally adds. ``It's an
easy, fun thing to do and it's one of the few uses of celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The thick-skinned Reed has also been part of the Rock Against
Racism movement and Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a zillion worthwhile charities,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't expect to lure Reed into an elaborate discussion
of these issues in an interview. ``I don't want to pontificate,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   He's also often quick to make light of his involvement. Asked,
for example, what it was like to play for the Pope, Reed says, ``I
tell people we got together and played checkers and I let him
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side of Reed, of course, is the unflinching street
observer who, since his '60s involvement with the Velvet
Underground, has written songs about mean streets and misfits that
are unsurpassed. His latest album, ``Ecstasy,'' is more of the same
_ a rough-hewn, rock 'n' roll manual on the highs and lows of city
life, with scarifying, sometimes profanity-laced, looks at everyone
from troubled couples to crack dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very physical album,'' he says in an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   And a very uncensored one, which is Reed's stock in trade. The
lyrics aren't about to land him on Top 40 radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they would. That wasn't the intent. The intent
was to make a great record,'' Reed says.
</P>
<P>
   The album rocks hard right away with a Reed gem, ``Paranoia Key
of E.'' The lyrics say: ``Let's play a game the next time we meet/
I'll be the hands and you be the feet/ And together we will keep
the beat/ To paranoia key of E/ Now you know mania's in the key of
B/ Psychosis in the key of C/ Let's hope that we're not meant to be
in paranoia key of E.'' He adds: ``Let's have a coda in the key of
K _ something only we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clever, insightful, and unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song `Paranoia Key of E' is about one of my favorite
subjects _ paranoia,'' he says. Lovers of his lyrics should also
know that he just issued a complete book of lyrics, ``Pass Thru
Fire,'' put out by Hyperion Books. It spans his career from the
Velvet Underground through today.
</P>
<P>
   Reed is rocking again on the new album, but, in recent years, he
has also developed an instinct for theater that has kept him busy.
He and His friend, Robert Wilson, finished ``Poetry,'' a play about
Edgar Allan Poe that is being performed in Germany and will have a
10-day run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in November of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he's hitting the road with a band that he has
proudly kept together for some time. ``This is the band I record
with, too,'' he says. ``We're a real band. It's not me and backup
musicians. It's a real band.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Reed's tour will be opening act Victoria Williams. She
has multiple sclerosis, yet Reed is one of the musicians who
appeared on the benefit album for her, titled ``Sweet Relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Is she going to join his set?
</P>

UMASS MAY BRING EDUCATION TO THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a bid to become the state's premier online campus,
the University of Massachusetts may soon launch a
multimillion-dollar campuswide Internet education program.
</P>
<P>
   A new report commissioned by the university supports a push
toward electronic learning by President William M. Bulger's office
and concludes that UMass would enjoy ``explosive growth'' by
enrolling thousands of students in online classes.
</P>
<P>
   UMass, primarily the Amherst and Lowell campuses, already
provides Internet classes to more than 1,750 students. But the lack
of a coordinated plan, the report says, has taken a toll. UMass
trails many public university systems, including the University of
Illinois, which enrolls 4,500 students; the University of Nebraska,
with 15,000 students; and the University of Maryland, which has
30,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Potential online students include government workers, corporate
employees, grade school teachers, and high school students
interested in college-level classes. The report by
PricewaterhouseCoopers found nearly 1.5 million Massachusetts
residents ``somewhat-to-very-likely'' to pursue education or
training within two years. Of those, an estimated 45,000 said they
would be interested in taking classes exclusively over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the increasing competition in the field, and the need
for UMass to establish an identity as an online information
provider, the report cautions that a crucial element of success is
speed. The report, which cost UMass $300,000, starts out by quoting
Bulger's call to action:
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks and opportunities . . . preclude the option of
waiting for the market to mature and provide greater clarity,''
Bulger said late last year in a letter to the board of trustees.
``Waiting, or complacency, will give competitors an advantage in
the market and erode our competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between letting the status quo run its course and
following the consultants' plan could amount to a loss of almost
$60 million in potential profits, according to the report. After
losing $20 million the first two years, UMass would earn $93.3 in
annual gross revenue by the fourth year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tuition, the online plan provides for other forms
of revenue. The report suggests advertising on the Web site,
revenue-sharing deals with online book companies such as Amazon.com
and BarnesandNobles.com, and the resale of everything from class
notes to exams provided over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The key to beating the increasing field of competitors _ which
include Harvard, MIT, Boston University, Northeastern, and Babson
College _ is the price. The cost of current UMass courses
($520-$650 for undergraduate) is significantly less than other
schools, the consultants say.
</P>
<P>
   And to reduce the current redundancies between campuses and
increase efficiency, the report suggests the university create a
separate administrative body that would be controlled by the
president instead of any one campus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many professors are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Some view the proposal as an attack on academic integrity, fear
the plan would dilute profits they already earn from the individual
campus's online education programs, and believe the investment
would be too risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to be the `Big Dig' of public higher
education in Massachusetts,'' said Joe Larson, professor of natural
resources and leader of the faculty senate at UMass-Amherst. ``So
much money would be put at risk, it would be devastating for us to
lose it. Given our lean budget, it would have a major negative
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report says, the potential long-term profits of
providing classes over the Internet are enormous. In 1998, 710,000
students across the country enrolled in such distance-education
programs, which generated more than $1 billion in revenue, the
consultants say. By 2002, they say, more than 2.2 billion students
will be taking Internet-based classes, with annual revenues rising
above $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the report, however, sounds like a nightmare to some
professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts the standard rules of academic governance on its
head,'' said Robert Parkin, a mechanical engineering professor and
president of the faculty senate at UMass-Lowell. ``The faculty has
primary responsibility over academic matters. The report takes that
away from the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Parkin and six other UMass-Lowell professors on the
faculty senate sent this week to Bulger's office, they outlined
their dismay over the report's corporate focus. Parkin said the
consultants forgot they were reviewing the future of a university.
And he said he is outraged they would advise Bulger to consider
advertising or selling professors' class notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the system afford such a high risk, potentially
budget-busting activity that would seriously damage the reputation
of UMass if and when it fails?'' Parkin writes.
</P>
<P>
   A professor on the faculty senate at UMass-Boston, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, also questioned the online program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really concerned about this because there hasn't been
any real discussion about this,'' the professor said. ``And I think
there is some suspicion that (Bulger) is trying to amass power in
himself. This campus might have no control over the program.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials, however, emphasized that the
PricewaterCoopers report is only a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost of their concerns, they say, is ensuring
academic integrity and faculty involvement. And while enhancing
revenue is a significant perk, they said they believe that, more
importantly, the university will further its mission by increasing
students' access to public education.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Connolly, a spokesman for Bulger, said the president
would consult the faculty and hopes to have a plan ready by
September. He said that while he understands professors'
uneasiness, he believes central coordination can make the online
program work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an arena that the university has to be in,'' he said.
``We're now in the process of how the university should go about
it. Either way, I believe this will go forward.''

 &HT;    FLAWED CAMPAIGN MAY HURT VOTER TRUST IN 'CLEAN' PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION, MEXICAN OFFICIALS SAY
 &HT;    (1200&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., June 17 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It hasn't taken place yet, but Mexico's July 2
presidential election is already being called the cleanest and most
competitive in this country's tarnished electoral history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some top election officials here complain that the campaign
leading up to election day has been tainted by reports of pressure
tactics, vote-buying and ongoing government propaganda in the media
that boosts Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our position of responsibility as electoral authorities,
any vote that is manipulated, coerced or bought undermines the
integrity of the election,'' said Emilio Zebadua, one of nine
counselors at Mexico's Federal Elections Institute (IFE), an
autonomous government agency that will supervise a presidential
election for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much can it affect the outcome of the election? We don't
know. It might depend on how close the election is,'' said Zebadua,
who, along with three other counselors, spoke to a group of foreign
correspondents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The election is indeed expected to be tight. This is the first
race since 1929 that Mexico's long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, faces the real possibility of losing
the presidency. Recent polls indicate the PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa is slightly ahead or even with challenger Vicente
Fox Quesada of the National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   As election day approaches, the PRI and the government have been
accused of stockpiling gifts _ bicycles and washing machines in
Yucatan and bags of cement in Mexico state _ to dole out to
supporters around or on election day.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the watchdog group Civic Alliance _ which is under
contract to Mexico's Congress to report irregularities _ presented
a list of more than 80 examples of alleged unlawful pressure
tactics or vote-buying. The group announced a ``crusade'' for
democracy and said it will join forces with other citizens'
organizations to dispatch 10,000 people throughout the country to
promote free voting.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a high-ranking manager at the government-owned
Mexican Petroleum company in Tabasco state held a news conference
to denounce an alleged campaign to force public workers to pressure
their subordinates to vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bosses can threaten you with losing your job, but don't
let them make you commit (electoral) crimes,'' Ramiro Berron,
technical coordinator for oil exploration in Mexico's southern
region, said in an appeal to fellow workers published in Reforma
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts of food, building supplies and other materials that have
been doled out already in some areas are not necessarily illegal.
But it is forbidden to tie handouts to votes, or for public
officials to use their position or government resources to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has challenged anyone who is complaining to come forward
with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The IFE, which has devised a sophisticated balloting system for
Mexico, is investigating 12 complaints of coercion or vote-buying _
10 against the PRI and two against other parties.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he has faith in the electoral system, candidate
Fox has said, ``I fully trust the Federal Elections Institute. It
is in good hands. But it is not in control of the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   A special section of the Mexican attorney general's office is
responsible for prosecuting cases of electoral fraud or pressure.
Mexico's Ministry of Social Development, which administers welfare
programs, said Tuesday it has investigated four complaints of
pressure campaigns using social programs as bait and has discounted
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Zebadua said reports of irregularities ``contaminates the
(election) environment. In spite of this, the Federal Elections
Institute is trying to march in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   After an investment of about $1.7 billion since 1998 on
technology, staffing and public funding for parties, election
officials believe that the actual balloting on July 2 will be free
of wholesale fraud if nearly 800,000 trained supervisors show up as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The country's 113,000 polling places are the ``neurological
center'' of the election, said election counselor Jesus Cantu. Only
voters with a photo credential matched to their name, photo and
number on registration lists at polling places will be allowed to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   A limited number of ballots will be available at each station.
The teams that will supervise the balloting are citizens who were
selected by lottery and trained by the IFE.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the legitimacy of the voting are representatives of the
political parties, who are allowed to observe the balloting and
help count votes at each station before ballot boxes are delivered
to regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about irregularities will be investigated by a
tribunal, which has reportedly added extra lawyers for the
election. Only the tribunal has the power to annul ballots.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The PAN says it has assigned representatives to about 88 percent
of polling stations and is working toward 100-percent coverage,
according to Robert Pastor of the Atlanta-based Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor and others from the Carter Center, which has observed 28
elections in 20 countries, have been invited to spend election day
at each party's headquarters to assess complaints or observations
that come in from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely because the parties have the most at stake,'' Pastor
said, ``they will be the best eyes and ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most competitive election in Mexican history,'' he
added. ``There is no important issue that is not being debated
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To address the perception of campaign inequity, election
officials here have been waging a battle against the federal
government _ including President Ernesto Zedillo _ over alleged
abuse of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Last month election officials asked Zedillo to suspend a series
of pro-government television and radio commercials at least 30 days
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has been credited with opening up Mexican democracy
during his six-year term, but election officials say that the
publicly funded commercials Zedillo refuses to pull from the
airwaves constitute extra publicity for Labastida and the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   Zebadua called the ads ``the most extensive publicity campaign
in the history of the six-year administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads cast the government in a positive light, showing sunny
public workers dedicated to their jobs or details about recent
government achievements. In a letter defending the ads, Zedillo
spokesman Marco Provencio denied the commercials were
``propaganda'' and said ``the federal government is obligated to
inform citizens'' about its activities.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law requiring the ads to be suspended, but officials
said that before the 1994 presidential election the federal
government agreed to take similar spots off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension of publicity and public works and government
propaganda (prior to voting day) contributed to the legitimacy of
then-candidate Zedillo's election,'' said election counselor Juan
Molinar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today as (President Zedillo) doesn't answer our letter and he
continues propaganda on behalf of his party,'' Molinar said. ``That
seems like a bad example to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials were also upset by a two-month gap prior to
May when television stations refused to air hard-hitting public
service ads advising Mexicans not to be ``puppets'' and to ignore
attempts to buy or coerce votes.
</P>
<P>
   Stations argued that the IFE was not eligible for free
government time since it was autonomous. Mexico's Ministry of
Internal Affairs dragged its feet in coming to the institute's
defense, Zebadua said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent public appearances, Zedillo has tried to blunt
criticism that the PRI has an unfair advantage in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government no longer interferes in the organization of
elections,'' Zedillo said Wednesday in a speech before Mexican
architects. ``The Mexican electoral system is one of the best and
most complete in the world.''

 &HT;    BASHAR ASSAD FACES SYRIAN PUBLIC UNCOMPROMISING ON ISRAEL, PEACE
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., June 18 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   QARDAHA, Syria _ As Syria's likely next president, Bashar Assad
took condolences here in his family's hometown last week amid the
forces that had ensured his father's 30-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal troops lined the streets. Businessmen, farmers and
religious leaders filed past to show their sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   At the stone mosque Hafez Assad built in memory of his own
mother, Imam Ghassan Hamdam glowed about what the Assads meant to
Qardaha.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also had a warning to any president who compromises too
much with Israel: ``He would be a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad died just over a week ago after leaving a legacy of
stiff resistance to Israel. His son Bashar is expected to replace
him in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perhaps the biggest issue facing the 34-year-old son is how
he will handle peace talks his father started but never finished.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow Syrians have set a high standard that could be summed
up as, ``Stay firm, or else.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard line comes from a self-perception among Syrians that
they carry the burden of protecting Arab honor. The view is
reinforced by a deep-seeded feeling of grievance against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And, it's backed up by a reputation that Syrians, who originated
the word ``assassin'' 800 years ago, don't mess around.
</P>
<P>
   When foreign visitors used to come to Assad's palace and ask him
to be more flexible in peace talks, he would point to the servant
bringing their tea.
</P>
<P>
   That servant, he would say, could kill me if I gave up any of
Syria's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be right to kill me,'' Assad would add.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, deep in the narrow streets of Damascus' walled old
city, Abu Hassan agreed. The 39-year-old father of four has been
serving tea for 12 years. He hears enough talk to know the pulse of
the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Assad's comments, he concurred. He made a pistol with
his index finger and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any president who gives up one inch of land, he will be
dead,'' he said. ``If it is not poison, something else will happen
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel captured the Golan Heights, on the border of the two
countries, in 1967. Israelis say Syrian gunners used to fire down
from the strategic high ground at citizens below.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians deny that charge. They say Israel took the Golan Heights
so it could have more room to settle Jewish immigrants from Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the loss, more than 80,000 Syrians fled the land where they
had lived for generations. With family growth, they now number
several hundred thousand refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians feel like they should not have to deal, or even ask, to
receive land that was theirs. They also believe that they should
get land according to borders that would take Syria right to the
shore of the Sea of Galilee. Israelis want to keep the lake's(CQ)
edge, citing an older set of borders.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than give in, Syrians commonly say that they will
continue to pay the price that their opposition to peace with
Israel has helped bring. Most analysts agree that Syria's hard line
has helped isolate it from the West and hindered its economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land is more important to us than our suffering,'' said
Monsour Ajak, a 37-year-old accountant watching Assad's funeral
last week.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Syria is, after all, where Salah Ed-Din and Mamluke Sultan
Beybars, who trounced the European Crusaders, are entombed. They
are heroes here like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was sometimes compared to Salah Ed-Din.
</P>
<P>
   He ruled three decades. Though he often crushed dissent with
prison terms or executions, Syrian public opinion still mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Arab leaders, Assad would use his hard line against
Israel to build popular support. He felt that it was his firm
stance that gave him credibility with Syrians and Arabs throughout
the region.
</P>
<P>
   That credibility helped keep him in power while he fought other
internal challenges, such as insurrections from Islamic
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped reinforce the intransigence. The Syrian press,
controlled by the government, is notoriously anti-Israel and has
even engaged in Holocaust denial to build its case.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean a deal is impossible. The Syrian public today
might not be any more anti-Israel than Egyptians were in the early
1980s, when then-President Anwar Sadat signed a treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He made a bold move, but paid the price for it when he was
assassinated in 1982. Assad was among the Arab leaders who refused
to attend his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan also faced stiff local opposition for his
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Egyptian and Jordanian deals just make Syrians feel
that their resistance is even more needed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bashar Assad is young and untested. He was originally
trained to be an eye doctor, not a president.
</P>
<P>
   He has built his reputation on fighting corruption and seeking
to reform Syria's economy. He may still face rivals for his job and
most expect him to set aside tough foreign policy issues until his
power is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright seemed to be trying to give Bashar Assad a nudge
onto the peace path.
</P>
<P>
   They did it by adapting his father's legacy to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Hafez Assad had entered peace talks, they said he
had made a ``strategic decision'' that Syria needed peace. They
appeared to hope that would help Bashar Assad make the same
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But, Syrians may read Assad's legacy differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was steadfast from the very beginning of his life,'' said
Ajak, the accountant. ``He never signed any agreement that did not
guarantee the rights of the Arabs. He died and never signed.''

 &HT;    FLAWED CAMPAIGN MAY HURT VOTER TRUST IN 'CLEAN' PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION, MEXICAN OFFICIALS SAY

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It hasn't taken place yet, but Mexico's July 2
presidential election is already being called the cleanest and most
competitive in this country's tarnished electoral history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some top election officials here complain that the campaign
leading up to election day has been tainted by reports of pressure
tactics, vote-buying and ongoing government propaganda in the media
that boosts Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our position of responsibility as electoral authorities,
any vote that is manipulated, coerced or bought undermines the
integrity of the election,'' said Emilio Zebadua, one of nine
counselors at Mexico's Federal Elections Institute (IFE), an
autonomous government agency that will supervise a presidential
election for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much can it affect the outcome of the election? We don't
know. It might depend on how close the election is,'' said Zebadua,
who, along with three other counselors, spoke to a group of foreign
correspondents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The election is indeed expected to be tight. This is the first
race since 1929 that Mexico's long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, faces the real possibility of losing
the presidency. Recent polls indicate the PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida Ochoa is slightly ahead or even with challenger Vicente
Fox Quesada of the National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   As election day approaches, the PRI and the government have been
accused of stockpiling gifts _ bicycles and washing machines in
Yucatan and bags of cement in Mexico state _ to dole out to
supporters around or on election day.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the watchdog group Civic Alliance _ which is under
contract to Mexico's Congress to report irregularities _ presented
a list of more than 80 examples of alleged unlawful pressure
tactics or vote-buying. The group announced a ``crusade'' for
democracy and said it will join forces with other citizens'
organizations to dispatch 10,000 people throughout the country to
promote free voting.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a high-ranking manager at the government-owned
Mexican Petroleum company in Tabasco state held a news conference
to denounce an alleged campaign to force public workers to pressure
their subordinates to vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bosses can threaten you with losing your job, but don't
let them make you commit (electoral) crimes,'' Ramiro Berron,
technical coordinator for oil exploration in Mexico's southern
region, said in an appeal to fellow workers published in Reforma
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts of food, building supplies and other materials that have
been doled out already in some areas are not necessarily illegal.
But it is forbidden to tie handouts to votes, or for public
officials to use their position or government resources to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has challenged anyone who is complaining to come forward
with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The IFE, which has devised a sophisticated balloting system for
Mexico, is investigating 12 complaints of coercion or vote-buying _
10 against the PRI and two against other parties.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he has faith in the electoral system, candidate
Fox has said, ``I fully trust the Federal Elections Institute. It
is in good hands. But it is not in control of the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   A special section of the Mexican attorney general's office is
responsible for prosecuting cases of electoral fraud or pressure.
Mexico's Ministry of Social Development, which administers welfare
programs, said Tuesday it has investigated four complaints of
pressure campaigns using social programs as bait and has discounted
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Zebadua said reports of irregularities ``contaminates the
(election) environment. In spite of this, the Federal Elections
Institute is trying to march in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   After an investment of about $1.7 billion since 1998 on
technology, staffing and public funding for parties, election
officials believe that the actual balloting on July 2 will be free
of wholesale fraud if nearly 800,000 trained supervisors show up as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The country's 113,000 polling places are the ``neurological
center'' of the election, said election counselor Jesus Cantu. Only
voters with a photo credential matched to their name, photo and
number on registration lists at polling places will be allowed to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   A limited number of ballots will be available at each station.
The teams that will supervise the balloting are citizens who were
selected by lottery and trained by the IFE.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the legitimacy of the voting are representatives of the
political parties, who are allowed to observe the balloting and
help count votes at each station before ballot boxes are delivered
to regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about irregularities will be investigated by a
tribunal, which has reportedly added extra lawyers for the
election. Only the tribunal has the power to annul ballots.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The PAN says it has assigned representatives to about 88 percent
of polling stations and is working toward 100-percent coverage,
according to Robert Pastor of the Atlanta-based Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor and others from the Carter Center, which has observed 28
elections in 20 countries, have been invited to spend election day
at each party's headquarters to assess complaints or observations
that come in from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely because the parties have the most at stake,'' Pastor
said, ``they will be the best eyes and ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most competitive election in Mexican history,'' he
added. ``There is no important issue that is not being debated
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To address the perception of campaign inequity, election
officials here have been waging a battle against the federal
government _ including President Ernesto Zedillo _ over alleged
abuse of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Last month election officials asked Zedillo to suspend a series
of pro-government television and radio commercials at least 30 days
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has been credited with opening up Mexican democracy
during his six-year term, but election officials say that the
publicly funded commercials Zedillo refuses to pull from the
airwaves constitute extra publicity for Labastida and the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   Zebadua called the ads ``the most extensive publicity campaign
in the history of the six-year administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads cast the government in a positive light, showing sunny
public workers dedicated to their jobs or details about recent
government achievements. In a letter defending the ads, Zedillo
spokesman Marco Provencio denied the commercials were
``propaganda'' and said ``the federal government is obligated to
inform citizens'' about its activities.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law requiring the ads to be suspended, but officials
said that before the 1994 presidential election the federal
government agreed to take similar spots off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspension of publicity and public works and government
propaganda (prior to voting day) contributed to the legitimacy of
then-candidate Zedillo's election,'' said election counselor Juan
Molinar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today as (President Zedillo) doesn't answer our letter and he
continues propaganda on behalf of his party,'' Molinar said. ``That
seems like a bad example to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Election officials were also upset by a two-month gap prior to
May when television stations refused to air hard-hitting public
service ads advising Mexicans not to be ``puppets'' and to ignore
attempts to buy or coerce votes.
</P>
<P>
   Stations argued that the IFE was not eligible for free
government time since it was autonomous. Mexico's Ministry of
Internal Affairs dragged its feet in coming to the institute's
defense, Zebadua said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent public appearances, Zedillo has tried to blunt
criticism that the PRI has an unfair advantage in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government no longer interferes in the organization of
elections,'' Zedillo said Wednesday in a speech before Mexican
architects. ``The Mexican electoral system is one of the best and
most complete in the world.''

 &HT;    BASHAR ASSAD FACES SYRIAN PUBLIC UNCOMPROMISING ON ISRAEL, PEACE

<P>
   QARDAHA, Syria _ As Syria's likely next president, Bashar Assad
took condolences here in his family's hometown last week amid the
forces that had ensured his father's 30-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal troops lined the streets. Businessmen, farmers and rent,
he would say, could kill me if I gave up any of Syria's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be right to kill me,'' Assad would add.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, deep in the narrow streets of Damascus' walled old
city, Abu Hassan agreed. The 39-year-old father of four has been
serving tea for 12 years. He hears enough talk to know the pulse of
the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Assad's comments, he concurred. He made a pistol with
his index finger and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any president who gives up one inch of land, he will be
dead,'' he said. ``If it is not poison, something else will happen
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel captured the Golan Heights, on the border of the two
countries, in 1967. Israelis say Syrian gunners used to fire down
from the strategic high ground at citizens below.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians deny that charge. They say Israel took the Golan Heights
so it could have more room to settle Jewish immigrants from Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the loss, more than 80,000 Syrians fled the land where they
had lived for generations. With family growth, they now number
several hundred thousand refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians feel like they should not have to deal, or even ask, to
receive land that was theirs. They also believe that they should
get land according to borders that would take Syria right to the
shore of the Sea of Galilee. Israelis want to keep the lake's(CQ)
edge, citing an older set of borders.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than give in, Syrians commonly say that they will
continue to pay the price that their opposition to peace with
Israel has helped bring. Most analysts agree that Syria's hard line
has helped isolate it from the West and hindered its economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land is more important to us than our suffering,'' said
Monsour Ajak, a 37-year-old accountant watching Assad's funeral
last week.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Syria is, after all, where Salah Ed-Din and Mamluke Sultan
Beybars, who trounced the European Crusaders, are entombed. They
are heroes here like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was sometimes compared to Salah Ed-Din.
</P>
<P>
   He ruled three decades. Though he often crushed dissent with
prison terms or executions, Syrian public opinion still mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Arab leaders, Assad would use his hard line against
Israel to build popular support. He felt that it was his firm
stance that gave him credibility with Syrians and Arabs throughout
the region.
</P>
<P>
   That credibility helped keep him in power while he fought other
internal challenges, such as insurrections from Islamic
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped reinforce the intransigence. The Syrian press,
controlled by the government, is notoriously anti-Israel and has
even engaged in Holocaust denial to build its case.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean a deal is impossible. The Syrian public today
might not be any more anti-Israel than Egyptians were in the early
1980s, when then-President Anwar Sadat signed a treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He made a bold move, but paid the price for it when he was
assassinated in 1982. Assad was among the Arab leaders who refused
to attend his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan also faced stiff local opposition for his
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Egyptian and Jordanian deals just make Syrians feel
that their resistance is even more needed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bashar Assad is young and untested. He was originally
trained to be an eye doctor, not a president.
</P>
<P>
   He has built his reputation on fighting corruption and seeking
to reform Syria's economy. He may still face rivals for his job and
most expect him to set aside tough foreign policy issues until his
power is secure.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright seemed to be trying to give Bashar Assad a nudge
onto the peace path.
</P>
<P>
   They did it by adapting his father's legacy to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Hafez Assad had entered peace talks, they said he
had made a ``strategic decision'' that Syria needed peace. They
appeared to hope that would help Bashar Assad make the same
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But, Syrians may read Assad's legacy differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was steadfast from the very beginning of his life,'' said
Ajak, the accountant. ``He never signed any agreement that did not
guarantee the rights of the Arabs. He died and never signed.''

   QARDAHA, Syria _ As Syria's likely next president, Bashar Assad
took condolences here in his family's hometown last week amid the
forces that had ensured his father's 30-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal troops lined the streets. Businessmen, farmers and
religious leaders filed past to show their sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   At the stone mosque Hafez Assad built in memory of his own
mother, Imam Ghassan Hamdam glowed about what the Assads meant to
Qardaha.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also had a warning to any president who compromises too
much with Israel: ``He would be a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad died just over a week ago after leaving a legacy of
stiff resistance to Israel. His son Bashar is expected to replace
him in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perhaps the biggest issue facing the 34-year-old son is how
he will handle peace talks his father started but never finished.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow Syrians have set a high standard that could be summed
up as, ``Stay firm, or else.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard line comes from a self-perception among Syrians that
they carry the burden of protecting Arab honor. The view is
reinforced by a deep-seeded feeling of grievance against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And, it's backed up by a reputation that Syrians, who originated
the word ``assassin'' 800 years ago, don't mess around.
</P>
<P>
   When foreign visitors used to come to Assad's palace and ask him
to be more flexible in peace talks, he would point to the servant
bringing their tea.
</P>
<P>
   That servant, he would say, could kill me if I gave up any of
Syria's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be right to kill me,'' Assad would add.

   USCAN-MAIN_ ATLANTA _ Robert Sunday never imagined he'd be a
grocery check-out clerk. But he gladly does the job for free at his
neighborhood Kroger. Sunday, 29, uses the express self check-out
line, where he scans and bags his own groceries, then feeds money
into a machine. ``I've used it ever since the service started,''
Sunday said during a recent shopping run. The machines, called
U-Scan Express, have been limited to lines for shoppers checking
out 15 items or less, and only some stores have them. But they are
showing up in growing numbers as Kroger and other retailers use
self checkout technology to solve labor shortages and cut costs.
There are questions as to how far the trend can go, such as whether
people are competent enough to do this without creating logjams.

apparently they're still snapping up expensive appliances. General
Electric has ramped up production at a plant in Lafayette to meet
demand for its new high-end Spectra range. Home Depot's entry into
appliance sales has sparked some of the demand. GE added 150 jobs
and $5 million to support a third assembly line. Checking with

THE OTHER FATHER WHOM I KNEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a tall, quiet-spoken Dane with blue eyes, an aquiline
nose and a distinctive blond flat-top that he wore habitually until
the day he died _ except for that brief experimental phase when he
let it grow out, along with a goatee that came in red. He took so
much ribbing from us kids _ stuff about Eric the Red and his Viking
roots showing _ that it was back to the barber and the burr.
</P>
<P>
   He was an aerospace engineer by training, a graduate of the
University of Arkansas who was inwardly disappointed that none of
his kids decided to attend his alma mater when they reached college
age. It didn't take much goading to get him to call the hogs, and
the usually reticent speaker would go on and on about his
experiences at the Fayetteville boarding house where he lived while
at school.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny the things you remember about a parent years after he
is gone. When Daddy Warren wore shorts, you could see that his
ankles to about mid-shin were as hairless and smooth as a woman's.
In his Chicago youth, he was a competitive speed skater, and the
repeated application and removal of the tape used to bind his
ankles left him permanently plucked.
</P>
<P>
   He never ate anything with his fingers, not even a sandwich.
Using a knife and fork, that man could clean a fried chicken bone
slicker than any two-fisted diner ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Details about everyday life would often escape him, which was
intriguing to my brother, sister and me because his highly
technical mind earned him super-classified status at the aerospace
company where he worked. He traveled a lot with his job, overseeing
manufacturing and facilities development for General Dynamics
around the globe. Mom tried to mess with him when he returned home
after extended leaves _ she'd change her hair color and see how
long it took for him to notice. She invariably had to tell him what
was different because it just didn't register with him.
</P>
<P>
   The family has wonderful high school graduation pictures of my
twin brother and the gal standing in line ahead of him _ instead of
Jack and me, who was in line behind him. Daddy had the camera
focused on the long blond hair nearest my brother. I had shorn my
locks weeks before graduation; Daddy just hadn't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't an openly demonstrative man, but we knew he adored his
pre-assembled family. It couldn't have been easy for him at first,
to marry the widow with three young children and then almost
immediately move them from Fort Worth to San Diego, where he had
been transferred. But he worshipped his new bride, whose
personality was so opposite of _ yet so compatible with _ his, and
her little ones.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rotating duty every Christmas Eve for one of us kids to
accompany Daddy on his shopping trip for Mom, which always included
a fabulous piece of jewelry. He waited until the last day because,
he said, that's when you captured the true holiday spirit. (It must
have been his latent Viking thirst for adventure).
</P>
<P>
   My sister and I spent late into the night wrapping boxes, and he
spent late into the night writing limericks and verses to go on
each tag, hinting at the contents of the package. Hearing Mom read
those aloud on Christmas Day was as much fun as watching her face
when she'd open the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   He offered one piece of career advice as I was about to begin my
post-college life. He had worked for the same company for 39 years.
As a child of the Depression who watched his own father scramble to
take care of his family, Daddy Warren was bound and determined to
provide stability for his own family, even if it meant passing up
on opportunities to change companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had it to do all over, I'd take more risks,'' he said.
``You'll never know how far you can go unless you try.''
</P>
<P>
   Like my biological father, who died too soon in a test flight at
Edwards Air Force Base, my stepfather died too soon of a massive
heart attack shortly after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He had built a beautiful life for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Not every child is blessed to have one wonderful father. I was
blessed to have two.

SHARING SECRETS ABOUT OURSELVES LEADS TO HEALING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's always something that compels some readers to write.
</P>
<P>
   Others keep putting it off and eventually make a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   I understand. I do the same thing myself.
</P>
<P>
   I've been looking at a card from a reader for three weeks now,
telling myself over and over that only a personal note in response
will be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of you write on your personal stationery, preferring to
communicate via e-mail, in which case I can respond right away. Or
rather, I try.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you are like old friends now. Sue Williams, DH and
Deborah Evans-Young come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   When I wrote about my mother recently, Deborah Evans-Young
responded with this: ``Beautiful! I am so sorry you lost your
mother at an early age. Happy Mother's Day!''
</P>
<P>
   She was among dozens who wrote to comfort me. Others who also
lost their mothers simply wanted to thank me for saying what they
hadn't found the words to express.
</P>
<P>
   You tell me I do that a lot. And so I'm reminded daily how much
of humanity is the same, and wouldn't it be wonderful if we cared
for each other that way all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading your article was like reading about myself and six
siblings,'' one mother wrote. ``I learned to appreciate Mother's
Day and to share it with second moms that God brought into my life.
... This year, I celebrated my first Mother's Day with my husband
and 8 1/2-month-old son. Thank you for reminding me of that truth
and for once again sharing your heart so beautifully. Keep touching
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   I liked that note, recognizing that we all have the opportunity
to touch one another. Often, though, that means revealing something
of who we are, being willing to share even those things that
another person might use to hurt us.
</P>
<P>
   I've hesitated invoking my religious beliefs, for instance, more
than once. Not because I'm ashamed of my Christianity, but because
I recognize I am not perfect, and for many people, being Christian
means never making wrong decisions.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, I thought I might use this space today to
thank those of you who share shameful and painful events in your
life with me, especially those who allow me to tell your stories in
this space.
</P>
<P>
   You're touching lives as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen _ the woman who was sexually abused by her brother,
step-grandfather and a neighbor when she was a girl _ comes to
mind. Like my Mother's Day story, hers was at once singular and
universal.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Carmen, others found the courage to share their
painful stories about abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Perkins, executive director of the Women's Center of
Tarrant County, says that part of the problem in dealing with
victims of sexual abuse is that many of them are still in denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to look beyond our door and admit people are
hurting,'' she says. ``But they are, and this is one of the last
horrible secrets we still haven't confronted in this society.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mind in Sacramento had this to say: ``Just read your
column about Carmen and abused women. Really powerful and
insightful.''
</P>
<P>
   And a local reader wrote: ``Sunday's column on sexual abuse
really hit home. ... DON'T leave this subject alone _ for so long
no one would talk about it. Sexual abuse is something that affects
your whole life FOREVER.''
</P>
<P>
   There might be others who still can't speak about their pain.
The Women's Center can help. So can other social service agencies.
If you need help, PLEASE call.

AN ENERGETIC CELEBRATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after Sun., June 18, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If watching Kobe Bryant go through his airborne acrobatics makes
the average spectator want to grab a basketball, head to the
nearest court and dust off some choice moves, it stands to reason a
few hours spent gazing on the efforts of the ``Fosse'' dancers
might provoke a similar inspiration: Honey, have you seen my tap
shoes and bowler?
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think about it. The director/choreographer who
inspired ``Fosse'' dropped dead of a heart attack at age 60. He may
not have been dancing at that fateful moment, but after seeing,
say, the very fit Terace Jones maneuver his way through Fosse's
difficult ``Percussion 4'' from the 1978 musical, ``Dancin','' you
can imagine how somebody could literally expire in mid-stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say Jones or any of the 20 expert dancers in
``Fosse'' _ the celebratory revue of Bob Fosse's work now on stage
at the Shubert Theatre through July 9 _ appear to be in any danger.
In this energetic and highly entertaining musical, the company
makes very difficult choreography look all but effortless. Quite
simply, they and the show are a pleasure to watch. And with Don
York holding the baton, there figures to be steam heat aplenty for
the next few weeks in Century City.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a ``let's get up and dance'' kind of pleasure? Only
sporadically. The selections, which span four decades of Fosse's
work in film, television and stage, are dark, moody, and even a
little deranged as often as they are joyous. For every ``I Wanna Be
a Dancin' Man'' _ the straw hat, white pin- stripe-suited ode to
Fred Astaire _ there's a sneering number like ``Razzle Dazzle''
from ``Chicago.'' Once again, no knock on the man or his product:
Fosse lived hard and his work _ selected for ``Fosse'' by director
Richard Maltby Jr., Chet Walker and Ann Reinking _ reflects the
edginess of his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the chorus of taxi girls in ``Big Spender'' (from
``Sweet Charity''), slinking and cajoling their way up to a
railing, trying to entice customers. Watch the aggression with
which they seem to attach themselves to a railing at the front of
the stage, starring down the audience. Equally angry is ``Big
Spender's'' counterpoint number which finds the Kit Kat dancers
chair-dancing a kiss-off through ``Cabaret's'' ``Mein Herr.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexuality, in case you hadn't guessed, plays a fairly explicit
role in much of Fosse's work, although the ``Fosse'' selections
don't include a lot of partner or couple dances. (The silhouetted
male-female and same sex ballet, ``Take Off With Us,'' is the most
notable exception). Instead, we get group numbers, trios and an
occasional solo. Reva Rice, the smooth as velvet headliner, handles
most of the torch songs including two renditions of ``Life is Just
a Bowl of Cherries.''
</P>
<P>
   With the inclusion of a set from Fosse's autobiographical 1979
movie ``All That Jazz,'' Maltby and Reinking give us dance trying
to beat back death in ``There'll Be Some Changes Made.''
Immediately following that number is the less desperate but equally
sad version ``Mr. Bojangles'' where we watch a legendary dancer
(Cassel Miles) reaching the end of his reign.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Fosse II'' might opt to display some of the choreographer's
more playful work, but the current selection has more than enough
white gloves, thigh patting and sheer verve to please both Fosse
devotees and those simply looking for a good show. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
What: ``Fosse.''

THE TAMING OF JIM CARREY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after Mon., June 18, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Settling down doesn't work quite the same way for Jim Carrey as
it does for most guys.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the manic, raunchy, Canadian comedian who became a
superstar by seemingly never outgrowing puberty is starring once
again in the grossest comedy of the summer, ``Me, Myself and
Irene.'' Next up, he'll be seen as the most alarming holiday party
pooper since Ebenezer Scrooge in the ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas'' feature film. Meanwhile, the media is all abuzz, as it
has been before, about Carrey's new, high-profile romance.
</P>
<P>
   And, asked to offer parenting tips for Father's Day, the first
suggestion that pops out of his mouth is, ``Just make sure that
they don't end up on a building with a 'scope.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is, nonetheless, a Jim Carrey at peace with himself.
Speaking confidently and thoughtfully in a New York hotel room,
looking understatedly sharp in a Navy suit and finely woven, coral
blue t-shirt, the box office superstar shows no signs of the mental
unease evident late last year, when he was infamously still
possessed by the spirit of Andy Kaufman, whom he so fiercely
impersonated in his last, atypically unsuccessful feature, ``Man on
the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey is polite, self-revealing, effortlessly witty without
ever begging for a laugh. He is the picture of hard-won
contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Getting paid to go psychotic, obviously, has a therapeutic
value. &QL; 
He's a gentle, wacky character
</P>
<P>
   In ``Irene,'' Carrey plays a gentle-to-a-fault, Rhode Island
state trooper, Charlie Baileygates, whose suppressed rage comes out
in another personality that calls itself Hank, a sleazy, abusive,
gratification-hungry sociopath. When both personae fall in love
with Renee Zellweger's title straightwoman, the physical and vulgar
humor that's made Carrey famous in ``Liar, Liar,'' ``Dumb &AMP;
Dumber,'' ``The Mask'' and the ``Ace Ventura'' movies kicks into
gear like never before.
</P>
<P>
   And we do mean like never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what's happening is that a little more realism is
coming into the characters that I play,'' Carrey says. ``Now, it's
becoming a mix between the dramas and the comedies; in a sense, a
little bit more believable.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Charlie and Hank may be extreme types _ the film is,
after all, written and directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly of
``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' notoriety _
Carrey shades each one, and the area between them, with an
unexpected range of subtle, convincing touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came internally, actually, and that was the weird thing
about creating these characters,'' he explains. ``It wasn't just
about making a face, it was more like where the guy's coming from,
and the rest creates itself. I can't say I didn't think at all
about the physicality of it, because the two guys had to be
different, but the thing was, you wanted a little of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be funny, first of all,'' he acknowledges. ``But
you've got to know the psychology of both characters, what's
missing from the one guy _ which I recognize completely, because I
come from a long line of people who'd rather just keep the smile on
their face and take the shot in the chops to avoid confrontation _
and make Hank the embodiment of everything that Charlie's missing,
but too much so.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's not afraid to get `physical'
</P>
<P>
   According to his co-star, watching Carrey put all that and more
together for any given scene was a marvel to behold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking, God, I wish everybody had the opportunity to
see this,'' Zellweger says. ``It's very easy to underestimate the
skill that's required to pull that stuff off. He makes it look so
easy, he's so good at it and he's so unique in his physical ability
to animate those comedic moments, that you don't think about all
the work that's behind it. I guess that's the point. But at the
same time, watching him create it makes you appreciate the vast
range of ability that he had to apply.''
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of pain tolerance, too. Carrey puts himself
through as many physical contortions in ``Irene'' as he did in
``The Mask,'' but without the aid of reality-warping computer
graphics. He's beaten, bonked, bowled over and defiled in a
kaleidoscope of torment not seen since his days as Fire Marshal
Bill on the ``In Living Color'' skitcom. And, as was the case with
that defining character, his worst tormentor is himself, as Hank
and Charlie fight over control of the tortured Baileygates body.
</P>
<P>
   All in a well-paid day's work, the actor reckons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably one of the most physical things that I've
ever done,'' says Carrey, who suffered a sprained ankle during
rehearsals and admits being hurt just about every day during the
shooting of ``Irene.'' ``I don't like the stuntman to do it unless
it's, like, life-threatening in some way. If it means a bruise or a
bang if you do it wrong, than I'd rather do it myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Buster Keaton comedy tradition, y'know? The
audience wants to know that it's you doing the bit. A lot of these
things won't look the same with somebody else's physicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, beating myself up comes easy,'' Carrey jokes, sort
of. ``I love to beat the hell out of myself, I've done it
emotionally for years, so I just physically manifested it.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Really.
</P>
<P>
   There is, not unusually, a sad child at the core of the crazy
clown. Although he was born into a middle class home in the Toronto
suburbs, Carrey's father suffered job setbacks that forced the
family to live out of a van. The teen-age Jim had to quit school to
pitch in with the janitorial business that was the only thing that
kept the family going.
</P>
<P>
   Years of struggle on the comedy club circuit and the lower rungs
of the Hollywood casting ladder followed. There was a marriage, to
actress Melissa Womer, that produced a daughter, Jane, before
coming apart just as film stardom finally hit big, in 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's finding happiness in his real life
</P>
<P>
   Whatever damage these and other traumas have done to Carrey's
psyche, they apparently haven't destroyed the fundamental sweetness
that's made even his darkest, most offensive comic gambits
palatable (well, except for maybe ``The Cable Guy'').
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, when Zellweger was promoting her previous movie ``The
Bachelor,'' she spent the better part of a weekend denying reports
that she and Carrey were an item.
</P>
<P>
   ``For days I was telling everybody, 'Yeah, he's wonderful and I
really like him and we had a great time and he's warm and generous
and really kind and I've never had so much fun working with
somebody and it was one of the greatest summers of my life . . .
But we're not dating.' And then I went home and started thinking,
wow, I really miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Carrey tends to use the word gem a lot when
speaking about Zellweger, whom he started seeing publicly early
this year. For a star who has developed something of a reputation
for hitting on leading ladies (Carrey was briefly married to ``Dumb
&AMP; Dumber'' co-star Lauren Holly and was reported to have had an
affair with Courtney Love when they made ``Man on the Moon''), the
drawn-out courtship was, by all evidence, a euphoric experience for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renee is a great person, and she is what she seems to be, very
straightforward,'' Carrey says of the remarkably sweet-natured,
bright and unpretentious Texan. ``I don't go into these things
hoping, `I'm gonna get this one,' that's not how I operate. Why I
wanted Renee in the movie in the first place was not to go after
her, but to be supported by somebody who I could learn something
from and trust to stand on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly think that she's one of the most incredible
actresses out there,'' he continues to gush before letting a little
Hank take over. ``She makes me envious, frankly, and insecure about
myself and what I've done. It's only a matter of time before she
wins the Oscar, and I'll have to sit there and smile and applaud.
It's really going to be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny. But like Carrey's best gags, also loaded with multiple
levels of sarcastic, satiric meaning. He's riffing here on the
widely held belief that he made his last two movies, the Media Age
existential drama ``The Truman Show'' and ``Man on the Moon,'' in
pursuit of Academy Awards he was not even nominated for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hardest thing about all that is people's
perception that I would be destroyed by it in some way,'' Carrey
says of Oscar's indifference. ``I appreciate that people are
pulling for me, for sure. But anything that happens like that, that
might not be exactly what you want it to be, just makes you
stronger and better at what you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I had made I don't know how many films in that
total, whacko comedy mode. I do two dramas and I'm not expecting to
be recognized critically at all for them, but I got good critiques
in droves and I was very happy and surprised by that. But I don't
expect (academy voters) to give in so soon. They still remember Ace
Ventura talking through his butt _ and they'll remember it again
because I've gone back to `Irene,' and I don't ever want to lose
that part of myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact is that I'm allowed to do `The Truman Show' and
`Man on the Moon' and this very heavy film called `Phone Booth'
next, which is basically a two-week shoot that takes place entirely
in a phone booth and is a tremendous challenge that would probably
scare the best of actors. Plus, I have a great life. I have a
beautiful daughter and a wonderful girlfriend, amazing things. You
know, what do I need? I don't need a statue. But I would appreciate
it if I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   We've heard about the girlfriend. Carrey's daughter, now 12,
reportedly enjoys an involved father who, to her classmates'
delight, attends school functions and the whole bit.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, Carrey's second, real bit of Father's Day advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just love your kids, period. Make them feel like they're the
most important thing in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   So you see, Jim Carrey really is a mature, stable, gentle
fellow. Those things he does to the neighbors, that cow and the
nursing mother in ``Me, Myself and Irene''? Hey, just think how
much fun it would be to have a dad like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this streak which is, like, `Where can I go that is two
steps beyond where they would expect me ever to go,' '' he
explains, ``and still, somehow, be funny, and somehow within that,
have there be a sweetness to it.''

&HT;     INJURIES CAN LEAVE MUSICIANS PLAYING THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, June 18)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Violin in her left hand, bow in her
right, Jill Levy glanced up at the soaring maple arc of United
Methodist Church in Saratoga Springs. She looked around at the
chairs, the cool green carpet, the knotty pine ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I was here it was in February, and I couldn't play
at all,'' she said, preparing to rehearse on a sunny Thursday
afternoon for a recital three days later with pianist Jacinthe
Couture. ``And now I can play, and it's still strange.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been six months, just about, since Levy cut her left hand
in a mundane kitchen accident at her home in Stony Creek, six
months of surgery and splinting and therapy and more therapy and,
later, therapy. The injury to her ring finger _ violinists call it
the third finger; doctors call it the fourth _ occurred while she
was washing dishes late one night and grabbed at a falling glass.
The glass broke and sliced into her hand, severing tendon and
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, for 18 hours, just devastated, thinking I might never
be able to play again in the same way,'' she said. When the Glens
Falls surgeon who sewed up her hand reassured her that ``most''
people regain ``most'' flexibility following such a procedure, Levy
``was horrified. ... I said, `Most? I need all.'''
</P>
<P>
   Levy's tale has a happy ending: The Albany Symphony Orchestra
concertmaster is back performing, her left hand holding up
reasonably well to the digital rigors of the violin. But her story
is hardly unique. Like athletes and dancers, musicians train their
bodies to perform extraordinary tasks. They devote hours a day and
years of their lives to that end. In many cases they start their
training as small children, crafting not just careers out of music
but often whole identities: Simply put, music becomes their lives.
</P>
<P>
   And when an kitchen flub or a stress injury threatens to end the
music, those lives are thrown into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Pianists Gary Graffman and Leon Fleischer, two of the more
prominent examples, both lost the use of their right hands _ and
both found ways to adjust, mining the repertoire for left hand
alone or, in Fleischer's case, conducting. Cellist Lynn Harrell
suffered carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands and needed surgery to
correct it.
</P>
<P>
   Others have coped with even more dramatic injuries: a Maryland
violinist mangled her left hand in a lawn mower and retooled her
technique as well as her fiddle until she could finger with her
right hand and bow with her left. And an Irish pianist who slashed
his hand in a bagel mishap shortly before a concert went on stage
anyway, bleeding profusely on the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   For many, giving up music is unfathomable. It's an
impossibility, a notion so appalling that they'll pursue any
curative method to keep on playing. Harrell told the Baltimore Sun
he was terrified at the prospect of a surgeon cutting open both
hands, ``but the thought that I'd lose all feeling in my hands and
never be able to play again frightened me even more.'' So under the
knife he went.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with an injury, musicians ``panic and they get depressed,
whether it's a home accident or a musical accident _ particularly,
I think, among string players and keyboard players, who tend to
have started so early,'' said Alice Brandfonbrener, who directs the
Medical Program for Performing Artists at the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago and is widely regarded as the ``grandmother''
of performing-arts medicine. Many such early starters ``have really
little other self-identity. You know, you lose being a musician,
and you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandfonbrener, who literally wrote the book on artists'
injuries (``The Textbook of Performing Arts Medicine,'' with Robert
Sataloff and Richard Lederman), has treated ailing instrumentalists
for more than 20 years. Some, like Levy or Taylor, are trying to
bounce back from a nonmusical injury _ be it a wayward bread knife
or a devastating crash. Others are coping with debilitating pain or
numbness caused by years of repetitive stress and the ergonomic
contortions of music-making. In either case, recovery can demand a
combination of surgery, therapy and time. And, sometimes, a
willingness to change.
</P>
<P>
   Rachelle Taylor was a young pianist with a burgeoning career
when she broke her neck in a car accident. Paralyzed in all four
limbs and informed by doctors that she wouldn't sit up again, she
never once doubted that she would still, somehow, make music. ``I
never, ever let that enter my mind,'' said Taylor from her home in
Montreal. ``I did not hear them. I would not hear them because I
couldn't. And I could only attribute that to grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Music is so crucial to her being, she said, that ``I can't even
sort of articulate it. It was just such a fundamental thing, as
though my whole being was participating in that. ... I don't have a
choice: I'm a musician.'' People become musicians ``because that's
what they're meant to do. It's almost, You Are Music.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Taylor was right: She did make music again.
Though she never regained use of her legs _ crucial for pedalwork
on the piano _ she did recover her arms and hands and embarked,
following a long recovery, on a successful, global career as a
harpsichordist and early-music specialist. Her dark night of the
soul (``quite mystical in that vein'') clarified her priorities and
led _ unexpectedly, paradoxically _ to new hope.
</P>
<P>
   A life-changing accident ``is just a horrible thing, but on the
other hand it's such an opportunity,'' she said, ``and once you get
through finding out what it is about yourself that wants to
survive, it becomes an incredible joy to do that because it becomes
so clear what to do.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all stories are as extraordinary. Among the injuries
Brandfonbrener sees most frequently, the broadest and most common
``garbage pail category'' is muscular-skeletal pain. In other
words, problems relating to the muscle-tendon units.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of all the Chicago program's patients complain
of sore muscles. There are joint problems as well, and nerve
troubles, including the less common carpal tunnel syndrome, and,
for brass players, chronic mouth and lip difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   At the Texas Center for Music and Medicine in Fort Worth, where
the biomechanics of music-making is the subject of continuing
research, a new study on clarinetists outlines the intense,
repetitive pressure put on the musician's hand. It amounts to this:
A clarinetist uses all nine fingers to press down on the 10th _ the
right thumb, which supports the instrument via a curved metal rest.
Pressure against the thumb is increased when the musician blows air
into the clarinet, yielding a sustained compressive force that can
damage the muscles and ligaments. These injuries are more prevalent
among women, who have, on average, smaller hands and weaker grips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've experimented with the use of an elastic neck strap,
which is marketed and sold to clarinetists'' and would relieve
pressure on the thumb, said Kris Chesky, co-director of the center.
``But it's nontraditional and doesn't look good, and musicians
don't want to wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.: x x x to wear it.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such resistance points to the need, he said, to raise awareness
among instrumentalists and encourage them to change habits that
could turn painful _ and professionally traumatic _ down the line.
``Our idea is not only how best to treat somebody, but how best to
prevent it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Francine Schutzman, an oboist and English horn player with the
National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, learned firsthand about
the biomechanics of music-making. About three years ago, she
started to prepare an English horn concerto for an upcoming
performance. ``I found that I couldn't practice more than 45
minutes at a time _ after 45 minutes, my thumb would simply give
out. It would collapse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she dismissed it as nothing serious. She was getting
older, she figured, she'd been playing the oboe for more than 40
years, she felt fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   But after a while the pain became so severe _ along with a
numbness in her hands and recurring neck and shoulder troubles _
that she had to quit playing altogether. She dropped out of the
orchestra. Then a former student suggested she try an oboe support
called the Finger and Hand Retraining Ergonomic Device, or FHRED
for short _ basically, a small pole that connects the instrument's
thumb rest to the musician's chair. She tried it. The results
renewed her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes all the weight off. All of it, which is why it's so
much better than the neck strap, which then puts pressure on the
neck,'' said Schutzman, who returned to the orchestra after a mere
week. Asked to describe the impact of FHRED on her professional
life, she replied: ``Um, I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   FHREDs are also used by a handful of musicians at State
University of New York at Potsdam's Crane School of Music, where 15
or so of the school's 600 music majors struggle with tendinitis,
carpal tunnel syndrome and the like in any given year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor training in the early stage sets them up for problems,
and poor technique,'' said Glenn Guiles, professor of oboe and
chair of the music performance department at Crane. Although some
students attend a nearby sports-medicine clinic, he said, the staff
there ``are not music people, so it's difficult.'' Guiles himself
has experienced carpal tunnel problems and numbness in his right
arm but has relieved them with a series of exercises prescribed by
an orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, he said, more students are more aware of such
ailments _ and are less willing to live with them. ``Instead of
students just suffering in silence, thinking something's just wrong
with them, they realize there are things they can do,'' Guiles
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, musicians have had a lot of problems, but they
kind of were in the `no pain, no gain' theory _ the idea that it
just goes with the territory, so you plow through it,'' said
Brandfonbrener, who started seeing ``the same kinds of things in
the same kind of players'' when she signed on as festival physician
for the Aspen Music Festival in 1978. The realization that certain
types of musicians suffer certain types of injuries led to the
formation of a physicians association devoted to the subject and
the founding of a journal, Medical Problems of Performing Artists.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the masses today are more cognizant of musicians'
injuries, whether instrument-specific or incurred in the kitchen,
and the profound personal and professional ramifications that
result. Still, Brandfonbrener said, physicians who don't specialize
in the field have a few things to learn about sensitivity. Using
Levy's problem as an example, she said one of the problems faced by
musicians with injured fingers ``is that they get handled lightly,
because there's no fracture, but there's a lot of soft tissue
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy knows about soft tissue damage. Though her repaired tendon
is almost good as new, the nerve has been a long time coming
(nerves regenerate slowly, and Levy's finger is still partially
numb.) She can't always feel the string beneath her finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, when I'm doing certain things,
occasionally my finger doesn't land on the string the way I think
it has, and I'll get a squawk instead of a good sound,'' she said.
``It's happening less now, but it was a big problem at first. I'd
go to play a chord and get these funny sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Methodist Church that recent Thursday, Levy easily
navigated the angular turns and sneaky tonalities in Prokoviev's
``Five Melodies.'' She handled tricky fingerings high on the E
string. She hit double-stops without a squawk. But when she took a
break to chat about her injury, she clenched her hand, relaxed it,
clenched her hand, relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me is when I flex it, it does ache a
bit, and when I play I feel (like there's) this clothespin closing
on it. I feel this pressure holding me back when I play,'' Levy
said. She held up her left hand: a thin white scar curled around
the tip of her ring finger and wormed downward toward the palm.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve is coming back, she knows. Nerves take time. The
tendon has healed better than anyone expected _ particularly her
surgeon, who, she later learned, didn't actually believe she'd
regain so much movement in her finger. And while Levy had some
black moments in those hours after her accident, it didn't take
long for hope to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember driving home from the emergency room at 4 in the
morning. My 11-year-old daughter was in the car, and she said,
`Well, one good thing about this is you're gonna have lots of time
to spend with me,''' Levy recalled. ``And she was right. So, you
know, it hasn't been all bad.''

   KEERAN RANCH, Texas _ Rings, musket balls and charms to ward off
the evil eye are gingerly pried from the dark clay here, as
investigators piece together the rugged lives and deaths of the
inhabitants of the first European settlement in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The hills and scrub brush of this remote, mosquito-plagued
stretch of the Coastal Bend are all that guard the remains of an
ill-fated fort set up in 1685 by the French explorer Robert
Cavelier de La Salle as he searched for the mouth of the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times since a ranch worker armed with a metal
detector found eight buried iron cannons in 1996 _ confirming the
location of the legendary Fort St. Louis _ state officials
permitted outsiders Thursday to view its remains.
</P>
<P>
   About 180 French men, women and children settled the fort, which
was built in April 1685 from timbers salvaged from a shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of King Louis XIV, they were expected to have
set up a permanent colony at the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Inaccurate maps led to a landfall in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers slowly succumbed to Indian attacks, disease,
rattlesnakes and alligators that thrived in the brackish waters
that flow toward the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty dismal for those people,'' said James Bruseth,
head of the archaeology division of the Texas Historical
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Salle and his men were constantly fighting during their
stay here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve 1688, Karankawa Indians attacked the fort and
killed everyone who remained there except three children.
</P>
<P>
   La Salle, the famed explorer, had been away on an expedition and
later was killed by his own men.
</P>
<P>
   His nude body was dumped in the brush, according to a journal
from the time.
</P>
<P>
   La Salle's fort is seen as particularly significant because it
was the focus of a battle against time.
</P>
<P>
   The French sought to control a massive stretch of land later
known as the Louisiana Purchase, and the Spanish sought to defend
silver mines in northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are gaining insight into Fort St. Louis and a
Spanish presidio that later took its place, as about 20,000
artifacts, from the cannons to shards of pottery, have been
unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most common are gunflints, glass beads, religious
medallions and arrow points.
</P>
<P>
   The structures are long gone, but investigators have unearthed
portions of walls and foundations within the 32.5-acre compound.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists still are hunting for a graveyard where as many
as 50 French are believed to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators face a financial battle, as the project's
budget is expected to run out before autumn, project director Mike
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is running,'' he said. ``We would regret if finances
forced us to shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature approved $250,000 for the excavation, and
private donors kicked in about $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   About $250,000 more is needed to wrap up the excavation and keep
the project running until the end of the year, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The site, located on a private ranch, had been kept largely
secret since the discovery of the cannons, which are on display in
nearby Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the ranch have shunned publicity to deter looters
and limited the number of archaeologists that can work the site at
any given time.
</P>
<P>
   But archaeologists wanted the public to know more about the
significance of the project.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, they permitted a few reporters and photographers to
visit the site.
</P>
<P>
   Drenched in sweat, University of North Texas archaeology student
Robyn Pry said she feels the long dead settlers tugged at her soul
as she digs through the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me goose bumps,'' she said. ``They must have been
hearty, brave people. I cannot imagine the mosquitoes with no
(insect repellant) and the sun with no sunscreen.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologist Mike Fulghum said aching muscles are soothed by
the passion of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find a big old piece of French (pottery) and you are the
first person to see or hold that in your hand in 313 years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Texas Historical Commission office in Victoria, volunteers,
young and old, help catalogue artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is history,'' said Benjamin Gossett, 11, ``everything you
find is important in some way or another.''

 &HT;    QUIETLY, CHRISTOPHER WEEDS GORE'S VICE-PRESIDENTIAL GARDEN
 &HT;    560&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
for release Sunday, June 18.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, after wrapping up the
Democratic presidential nomination this spring, turned to a man
whose judgment he trusts to help him choose a running mate _ Warren
Christopher, who also ran the selection process that put Gore on
the ticket with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job last time, don't you think so?'' Gore
recently quipped to reporters on Air Force Two as he fended off
questions about Christopher's search, which began in early April.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the process is a little more complicated than
Christopher just coming up with a name for Gore. And if
Christopher's current efforts are anything like those for Clinton
in 1992, Christopher won't even offer a specific recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren Christopher acts as an honest broker,'' said Frank
Greer, who was part of Clinton's campaign brain trust in 1992. ``He
vets the candidates in order to identify their liabilities, but
leaves the recommendations to the political types in the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Christopher, Gore can be confident that the process
will remain confidential. To date, Christopher has declined all
comment about the prospects and the process.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher is notoriously gracious.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1998 book, ``In the Stream of History,'' about his
service for Clinton, there was not a whisper of criticism of the
president or any member of the administration. In fact, the
harshest thing Christopher had to say about anyone was his
assessment of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. ``Our positions on matters
of substance were at such variance that it placed severe
limitations on our relationship,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The way Christopher works in his vice presidential head-hunting
is to ask a large number of prospective running mates for a
dizzying amount of documents _ tax returns, personal financial
statements, medical records and, if they are politicians, campaign
finance reports. He then interviews the candidates, often asking
them to recommend someone other than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he made a round of visits to a half-dozen
Democratic senators' offices last month, touching off a spate of
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, one of the senators Christopher
visited, said that ``95 percent of the conversation (was) prefaced
(by Christopher) with, 'Take yourself out of this conversation and
talk about who would be a good running mate for Al.' ``
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Christopher had as many as 40 names on his initial list
of possible running mates for Clinton. But for Gore, the list is
not expected to be as long, although Gore spokesman Chris Lehane
said, ``There is no long list. There is no short list.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, 74, is the senior partner in the international law
firm of O'Melveny and Myers, which is based in Los Angeles. He
co-chaired the transition team when Clinton was elected in 1992 and
served as Clinton's secretary of state from 1993 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most critics view Christopher's term as rather lackluster,
especially in contrast to the larger-than-life figures who have
often held the job of secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   A slight, gray man who seldom smiles in public, Christopher is
known among his friends as ``Mr. Neat'' for his meticulous grooming
and wardrobe. Clinton, remarking on Christopher's formality, once
joked that he was ``the only person who ate Peanut M&AMP;M's on Air
Force One with a knife and fork.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Christopher served as deputy secretary of state during the
Carter administration and was the chief negotiator in the release
of the 52 Americans who had been held hostage for two years in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Scranton, N.D., the son of a banker, Christopher
graduated from Stanford Law School in 1949 and clerked for Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas, one of the most liberal justices
ever to serve on the high court.
</P>
<P>
   After practicing law in California for 17 years, he joined the
Justice Department during the Johnson administration, working for
Attorney General Ramsey Clark, another political liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he has been actively involved in human
rights issues, both at the local and international level. In Los
Angeles, he headed the commission that investigated the police
beating of Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Marie, have four children.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ For 17-year-old Anna Jin, the five-member boy
band that gets her feet racing and her heart thumping is not 'N
Sync or the Backstreet Boys. It's H.O.T.
</P>
<P>
   Never heard of them? Relax, you haven't slept through the latest
teen fad sweeping the nation. The Korean hip hop group H.O.T. (High
Five of Teenager) and its musical brethren have grown in popularity
here to the point where they compete with American stars for the
hearts of Korean American youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm really Koreanized,'' said Jin, who lives in
Piedmont, Calif. ``I would choose the Korean group over the
American group because of who I am and how I think.''
</P>
<P>
   While Korean popular entertainment has grown in favor over the
last decade, the phenomenon masks a chasm between Korean Americans
and the homeland of their parents. The rift is evidenced by the
general lack of knowledge and interest among second-generation
Korean Americans about the historic summit talks between the
leaders of North and South Korea that concluded this week.
</P>
<P>
   The summit could be the first tentative step toward
reunification of the countries, which have remained technically at
war since the end of the Korean conflict in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   But while many older Korean American immigrants watched the
meetings closely, the proceedings and their significance haven't
registered with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lee, a 28-year-old campus minister at the University of
California at Berkeley, said that when people ``talk about what's
happening in Korea, it's almost like they're talking about another
country. There's just no sense of how the unification of Korea
would affect me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Many younger Korean Americans said that while growing up, they
rarely engaged in conversations about Korean history, news and
culture with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Time with parents, often a scarce commodity in Korean culture,
was and continues to be devoted to more immediate issues, said Sue
Kim, 28, an advertising account executive in San Francisco. ``You
talk about a certain script of things: finances, grad school, when
are you going to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the pressures of immigrant life have helped shape
the cultural chasm that exists between second-generation Korean
Americans and their ancestral motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lee's father, Kae Hwan Lee, a contractor, struggled over
the years to provide for his wife and two children. He had little
time to share his personal history with them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're over here struggling to make ends meet, you really
don't have that much time to think about teaching your children the
way things were back in Korea,'' said Lee, 65, of Daly City, Calif.
``You just barely have time to check on their current existence and
schooling.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming to the United States also afforded many immigrants a
chance to forget a bleak, tragic period. ``It was so rough, we were
anxious to get out of there and just forget about it,'' Kae Hwan
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with traditional Korean culture, which values
patience and silence, many older Koreans have kept their memories
of the war to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents don't share their experiences with their kids
because it's too painful. They don't want their kids to go through
the same experience,'' said Youn-Cha Shin Chey, executive director
and president of Korean Center Inc. and the Intercultural Institute
of California in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But for a number of younger Korean Americans, assimilation has
left them in search of a deeper identity. Many, even those with
limited Korean language skills, have turned to Korean music and
television to channel a heritage that has eluded them.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the media provide a reaffirming tool for Korean
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in America, you don't always feel like you belong. You
don't have a clear identity, especially being Asian,'' said Lewis
Choi, a 22-year-old information and technology consultant. ``But
when you hear the Korean songs that sound pretty good with good
beats, you're proud of it and you identify with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Choi, who lives in Berkeley, recalled his introduction to Korean
music 10 years ago during a trip to Korea. He came away with
several tapes of popular artists and a taste for the sound.
``Korean music gives you a feeling of belonging to something,''
Choi said.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Korean pop music lacked the pizazz and production
values needed to lure Korean Americans entrenched in the States.
Earlier Korean singers belted out warbly traditional tunes that
suited older audiences but did little for youths.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last decade, Korean music has made huge strides, to
the point where it mimics the best of American hip hop, techno, pop
and hard rock. While the lyrics are in Korean, the sound is
undeniably Western.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like listening to any teenage music,'' said 15-year-old
Joyce So, of San Bruno, Calif. ``It's catchy and it's not
old-fogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Korean television also has evolved, and has spawned a following
of Korean Americans, who pick up the shows on videos and on
Korean-language channels in the United States. The most popular
shows are dramas, similar to an extended miniseries. Often they are
love stories.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lee, a Korean American former history lecturer at
UC-Berkeley, said Korean pop culture is much more readily available
today and serves as a validating force for Korean Americans, who
may be American but still long for some link to Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Korean Americans that flock to these things
to authenticate their Korean-ness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee expresses some disappointment, however, when her Korean
American students know the latest Korean pop star but not the
president of South Korea. But she said that's a phenomenon not
limited to Korean Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a level of historical amnesia`` and general lack of
interest in what happens outside the States, said Lee, 32. ``It's
part of a larger trend of American ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Jin, try to keep up with events in Korea. But staying
abreast of the latest news overseas is not as easy as picking up
the latest Korean CD or following a popular drama.
</P>
<P>
   Jin, who owns almost 100 Korean CDs, said she might not be
listening to teen idols H.O.T. years from now. But she doesn't
envision abandoning Korean music or TV. ``I want to keep my culture
and I don't want to ever lose that,'' said Jin.

&HT;     NATIONAL PARK MURDER TRIAL MAY BE MOVED TO SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. _ The trial of a former motel handyman who is
charged with killing and beheading a Yosemite National Park
naturalist is likely to be moved to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with an agreement by prosecution and defense lawyers
to transfer the case out of Fresno because of extensive news
coverage, U.S. District Judge Anthony Ishii said Thursday he would
approve a change of venue if submitted in writing by both sides and
signed by murder suspect Cary Stayner.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing lawyers also agreed that the best location would be
Seattle, where news coverage has been less extensive and where a
courtroom is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle does appear to be as neutral a place as can be
found,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Dawrence Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Ishii said he would continue to preside over the trial wherever
it is held.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, 38, has pleaded not guilty to the murder, but he has
confessed to authorities and in a news interview to killing
naturalist Joie Armstrong last July and three others in the
Yosemite area in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected most of the challenges by Stayner's lawyers
to the death penalty, but deferred a final ruling whether it can be
sought in his case. Ishii also ruled that prosecutors could present
evidence of the killings of three Yosemite sightseers if Stayner's
trial reaches a penalty phase.
</P>
<P>
   The federal trial was scheduled to start Oct. 17, but defense
lawyer Robert Rainwater told Ishii that it probably would have to
be delayed because evidence still is being gathered and reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said if Rainwater wanted to delay the trial, to let
him know as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner, who is being held pending the trial, did not attend the
75-minute hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 26, was an environmental educator with the Yosemite
National Institutes who lived in a cabin in the park and taught
visitors about its natural wonders. Her headless body was found in
a creek near the cabin last July 21.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest three days later, Stayner admitted stabbing
Armstrong to death and killing the three tourists: Carole Sund, 42,
of Eureka; her daughter Juli, 15; and their Argentine friend,
Silvina Pelosso, 16.
</P>
<P>
   They disappeared in February 1999 from Cedar Lodge, just outside
the park, where Stayner worked as a handyman. Their bodies were
found in remote areas. The police said the two girls had been
sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is prosecuting Stayner for Armstrong's
murder because it occurred on U.S. property. He is charged in
Mariposa County with killing the three tourists, also a potential
death-penalty case.

UPDATE: TWA SOARS AFTER AIRTRAN MERGER REPORT

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors are playing the airline takeover game
again, this time with Trans World Airlines. Shares in TWA were up
3/8, or 15 percent, to 2 15/16 following a Wall Street Journal
report Friday that the airline was in talks to either merge or be
bought out by AirTran Holdings, the Orlando, Fla-based cheap-fare
airline formerly known as Valujet.
</P>
<P>
   Talks began a month ago, sources told the Journal. The talks
center around either a full merger or an AirTran buyout of St.
Louis-based TWA, but both airlines, at least initially, would be
operated independently.
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the report, Julia Bishop-Cross, spokeswoman for
TWA, said: ``There are lots of rumors flying around. TWA is aware
of what is happening in the industry. All airlines participate in
talks with other airlines about various business transactions from
time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cautioned that a deal is not imminent and would face
numerous hurdles. The article pointed out that any TWA-AirTran
hook-up would not be in response to the merger frenzy that has
gripped the airline industry lately, but a response to the shaky
financial ground on which the two airlines stand.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, UAL, the parent of United Airlines, announced
plans to buy US Airways, and AMR's American Airlines has made
overtures to Delta Airlines and Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran was up 1/16, or 1 percent, to 4 3/8 Friday.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, fresh out of college and living in Rome, I
was often invited to eat Sunday dinner with a working-class Italian
family. The conversations, almost all of which were about politics,
invariably escalated from ``Ciao'' to an invective-filled uproar in
about 60 seconds, with eye-popping epithets hurled across the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Typically American, I experienced a visceral unease at such
displays of anger and yet also a voyeuristic fascination. That same
complex emotional response has begun to set in during the current
political season. Anger is already a leitmotif in this year's
presidential campaign. In April, George W. Bush vowed to ``end the
arms race of anger'' in American politics and called for a return
to comity in the public conversation. Al Gore's handlers,
meanwhile, have been trying to make him more huggable. In New York,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has molted his cutworm skin and emerged as
the Love Bug.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what comity gets you: that picture of Hillary Clinton
and Rep. Rick Lazio stiffly shaking each other's hands with
transparently insincere smiles as brittle as frost.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have long been uncomfortable with displays of anger
from their public servants. Senior journalists still tend to
referee politics according to what might be called the Smithereens
Infraction. Presidential candidates in particular dare not betray
the slightest hint of being short-tempered, lest this pique be
perceived as the kind of hotheaded instability that might bring the
world to the brink of nuclear annihilation _ or, nowadays, Nasdaq
to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure that the reflexive distrust of anger serves
politics well now. The Republicans are talking about making their
convention a vitriol-free zone this summer, even trotting out a
rehabilitated Sen. John McCain. But his participation will serve
only as a reminder of the kind of healthy political anger that
Bush's victory managed to quell.
</P>
<P>
   Back in February, conceding to Bush after the South Carolina
primary, McCain was mad. With barely contained indignation, he
condemned Bush's winning strategy _ the below-the-belt questioning
of his military valor, the relentless attack ads, the courtship of
the religious right. On CNN, Jeff Greenfield and Judy Woodruf
wagged their fingers at McCain's outburst _ and his temper, not
what prompted it, became the story. Bush wiped the mud off his
hands and, his party's nomination safely in possession, suddenly
became the king of comity.
</P>
<P>
   We could use more anger, not less, in the campaign. Not the kind
of anger recently forsworn by Giuliani _ the aggressive,
mean-spirited, egocentric kind fired by self-interest _ but the
kind that cuts through the Muzak of politics-by-focus-group and
causes voters to believe that a candidate might actually believe in
something larger than the latest in-house poll.
</P>
<P>
   High-minded anger can be a great rhetorical tool, precisely
because it is genuine, passionate and often unscripted. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech is one of the
masterpieces of 20th-century oratory because of the smoldering
indignation that warms every word.
</P>
<P>
   The defining failure of Bill Clinton's presidency is that his
most public expression of anger in nearly eight years in office did
not serve to galvanize public sentiment on poverty or health care
or racial injustice. The full-throated fury of the man's political
soul was directed at ``that woman.'' His rage got our attention,
but it did so in the service not of an idea but of his own
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem. In these self-absorbed times, no one in
politics gets publicly angry about anything larger than his or her
ambitions. Oh, there's plenty of anger afoot in the culture at
large. Each of us boils over in response to insults of breathtaking
triviality: being put on hold, getting cut off by a motorist,
waiting for a table at a restaurant. Little incivilities produce
enormous hemorrhages of bile, which may explain our simultaneous
horror and fascination on those rare occasions when a politician
does let loose.
</P>
<P>
   Our sense of outrage has become so self-centered, so
circumscribed, so small that our collective social anger has itself
become small-minded, and we've lost the ability to hear righteous
anger for what it can be _ a principled recalibration of society's
moral compass. In learning to distrust and discourage political
anger, we have delegitimized the things that should make us angry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is no righteous anger, only self-righteous anger,
which is always easy to dismiss. Hence, our current politics of
small-minded vitriol, with its undermining negativity, its huge
economies of energy devoted to stalemate and sinecure.
</P>
<P>
   When I lived in Italy, it was commonplace (as it still is) to
make fun of the operatic parade of dysfunctional Italian
governments. The truth is, we have effectively adopted all the
salient principles of Italian politics _ the art of obstruction,
the rhetoric of obfuscation, the elevation of self-interest above
public interest, all with the oily, insincere veneer of comity.
</P>
<P>
   The coming anger-free election season promises more of the same,
and if recent trends are any predictor, voters will stay away in
droves.

SPRINT PCS PRESIDENT RESIGNS

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sprint PCS announced Friday that Andrew Sukawaty was
stepping down as president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless telephone company said Sukawaty, 44, was leaving to
pursue ``a new opportunity,'' but it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation was unexpected, Tom Murphy, a Sprint PCS
spokesman, said. Murphy said the company did not yet have a
replacement for Sukawaty.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald T. LeMay, president and chief operating officer of the
wireless company's parent, Sprint, will replace Sukawaty for an
interim period, Murphy said. Sukawaty will act as a consultant to
LeMay during the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sprint PCS were trading down 1 1/2, or 2 percent, at
60 15/16 around midday Friday. Sprint's stock was flat at 58 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sukawaty said in a statement that his decision to leave the
fourth start-up venture in which he has been involved had been a
difficult one. He said he would provide more information about his
next position at a later date. The departure comes as the
long-distance company WorldCom is trying to get regulatory approval
to buy Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Sukawaty joined Sprint PCS as chief executive officer in 1996
and became president and chief operating officer in December 1998
when Sprint acquired financial and management control of the joint
venture between Sprint, TeleCommunications, Comcast and Cox
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   LeMay was chief executive of Sprint Spectrum from 1995 to 1996
before the company became Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement LeMay said of Sukawaty that Sprint PCS ``has
grown from a few thousand customers to 7 million and has become the
fastest-growing wireless personal communications services provider
in United States history. That is testimony to his contribution.''

HOUSING STARTS FALL 3.9 PERCENT TO LOWEST LEVEL IN NEARLY A YEAR

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Housing construction slowed considerably in May, as
higher mortgage rates dampened the demand for new single-family
homes, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Housing starts dropped 3.9 percent in May to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.592 million units, the lowest rate since
June of last year. May's decline was bigger than the 1.8 percent
drop that economists had been expecting. Meanwhile, the April rate
of housing starts was revised downward to 1.656 million units, a
1.6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   New building permits, a forecaster of future home construction,
fell 4.3 percent in May to a 1.49 million annual rate, following a
decline of 2.4 percent to 1.56 million in April.
</P>
<P>
   The solid pullback in home building is yet another sign that
certain areas of the U.S. economy have begun to show convincingly
slower activity in response to the Federal Reserve's yearlong
efforts to reduce the threat of inflation by raising interest
rates. Higher rates, which affect everything from credit cards to
business loans to mortgages, make it more costly for consumers and
businesses to borrow and spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report gives us more confidence in saying that the
housing market is past its peak and higher mortgage rates are
having an effect on home buying and new construction,'' said
economists at the Dismal Scientist, an economics Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The housing market in particular is one of the most
interest-rate-sensitive portions of the economy, because the vast
majority of home sales are financed. As the Fed raised its target
for short-term interest rates six times over the past year, the
interest rate for an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to
8.52 percent in May, vs. 8.15 percent in April and 7.15 percent in
May 1999, according to the mortgage giant Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe that the recent signs of slower home
sales and home building, along with slipping levels of retail sales
and benign inflation readings, will be enough to convince the Fed's
policymakers to leave interest rates unchanged when they meet on
June 27 and 28.
</P>
<P>
   A separate report Friday also showed that consumers, who account
for about two-thirds of U.S. economic growth, are growing less
confident, in a sign that higher interest rates and a pullback in
technology stocks may cause them to curb their spending in months
to come. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for
the first two weeks of June dropped sharply, to 106.8 from 110.7 in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs that the economy is slowing, however, many
economists warn that the Fed might not be finished raising rates
for the year. While measures of the housing market are slowing,
they remain near historically high levels. Meanwhile, other parts
of the economy, such as the labor market and the nation's
factories, continue to show signs of strength despite higher
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that new construction of
single-family homes fell a sharp 5.4 percent, the fourth drop in
single-family housing starts in the past five months. In contrast,
builders began work on 3.9 percent more multi-family buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The disproportionate drop in single-family housing starts
indicates that consumers are having a rougher time with higher
mortgage rates than commercial builders of apartment buildings. But
analysts said starts of all types of housing are likely to start
falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although apartment building is less sensitive to interest
rates, builders are also likely to become more cautious during the
spring,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist and senior market
strategist for the Bank of America Asset Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, the slowest construction activity was in the Midwest
and the West, where housing starts fell by 13.6 percent and 8.9
percent, respectively. Housing starts rose 5.6 percent in the
Northeast, and they rose 2.8 percent in the South.

 &HT;    VIOLENT 'HOOLIGANISM' THREATENING CIVILITY OF EUROPEAN SOCCER
MATCHES
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   LONDON _ European authorities will be on high alert
Saturday(6/17) against bands of determined and well-organized young
men bent on violence.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists?
</P>
<P>
   No. Soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   With England scheduled to play Germany in Belgium in a crucial
Euro 2000 match, police are bracing for an onslaught of perhaps
thousands of beer-guzzling toughs who use soccer matches as a
pretext for brutish street warfare. An estimated 40,000 English
fans are expected in Charleroi, the industrial city southeast of
Brussels hosting the match. Many are going without tickets.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, police and customs officials in the Belgian port of
Ostend were stopping all cars with British license plates coming
off the ferries. The authorities matched passports against a list
of 1,000 known hooligans provided by the British government. At
least three young men were sent back to England.
</P>
<P>
   Police, politicians and soccer officials dread the prospect of a
repeat of the near riot that exploded in central Copenhagen last
month when hundreds of English and Turkish fans launched into
street battle using cafe chairs and beer bottles as their primary
weapons. Dozens were injured, and 64 were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The melee was fueled by anger over the fatal stabbings in April
of two English soccer fans attending a match in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The antics of the crass, beer-swilling hordes are a source of
profound embarrassment among England's gentler folk, who view
civility as fundamental to the national identity.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Straw, the British home secretary, has called for zero
tolerance of thuggish behavior. ``They bring disgrace to all of
us,'' he said. ``They have no part in the Britain I want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   An obviously frustrated Straw also pleaded with the wives and
girlfriends of hooligans to blow the whistle on their men if they
hinted that they planned to cross the Channel to attend Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind almost every football hooligan setting off for Europe
is a wife or girlfriend or employer who knows the score,'' Straw
said this week. ``They have to let the thugs know that such
violence is unacceptable. And they have to help the police and the
courts to bring them to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's National Criminal Intelligence Service, which monitors
football violence in England and Wales, maintains files on 5,000
hooligans, of which 500 are rated as hard-core organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-hooligan laws passed by Parliament last year allow judges
to prevent troublemakers from traveling to international matches.
However, only about two dozen have been subjected to the
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the peace, about 3,000 Belgian police will take to the
streets Saturday with another 70,000 on standby. The anti-hooligan
defense has been boosted with mounted police units, 13 water
cannons and two helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the hooligans seem to bask in the attention.
``Everybody hates us,'' according to a posting on a hooligan
Internet message board. ``But we don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooligans seem to get a kick from the campaign to control them.
Hooligan Websites, sponsored by such groups as the ``Chelsea Head
Hunters'' offer advice _ such as posing as businessmen _ to elude
police.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears, violence was at a minimum at Monday's match
between England and Portugal. Some police officials believe English
hooligans were keeping a low profile so as to minimize the risk
that they would be prevented from going to Charleroi for the more
important confrontation with Germany. England's team hasn't
defeated Germany since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials attributed the good behavior to the fact that
marijuana is legal in Holland, and many hooligans were rendered
docile after smoking it in the city's pot shops.
</P>
<P>
   Even in their stupor, the mob managed to be ugly. After England
lost to Portugal, English soccer star David Beckham became outraged
as he left the field amid taunts and shouted threats to kill his
new baby. His wife is a member of the girl-power band, Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the peaceful respite seemed to be coming to an end.
Hooligans across the continent were on line swapping obscenity-rich
insults and promising a show of force in Belgium. ``Kill them all,
white power,'' one hooligan chatter said referring with insulting
racial slurs to Belgium's large population of Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Police and journalists in Britain have found links between
hard-core hooligans and the assortment of white supremacy groups
that have cells across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   One BBC television reporter who produced an undercover expose on
hooligans that explored these connections was moved by the
state-owned broadcaster to a safe house after he and his family
received death threats. However, Sean Perkins of the Leicester
University Centre for Football Research, argues that most hooligans
are relatively normal people who are swept away in a river of beer
and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of them it's the buzz, the adrenaline rush,'' Perkins
said. ``'They want their 15 minutes of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though hooliganism most often is associated with English
soccer fans, the phenomenon has become common across Europe,
particularly in Germany and Holland. The German government has a
list of 2,600 registered hooligans, and authorities confiscate
their passports during
</P>
<P>
   international matches.
</P>
<P>
   As the match between England and Germany _ dubbed the battle of
Charleroi _ neared this week, hooligan stories have dominated media
coverage of Euro 2000, which is the European equivalent of the NCAA
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For average soccer fans, this has taken away from the pleasure
of watching a long-loved sport.
</P>
<P>
   Martin O'Hara, a husband and father of two boys, believes the
media have exaggerated the problem. ``I have been to many games
with on my own and with my son, and we never see anything,'' O'Hara
said.
</P>
<P>
   He worries that hooligans could permanently damage the image of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these people aren't fans, not really,'' he lamented.
``They're just thugs who have nothing to do with sport.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif _ There are a lot of people who dismiss the
Dixie Chicks as a
</P>
<P>
   trio of bubble-headed bleached blondes who have been riding a
wave of good looks and hoedown music to a truckload of music
awards, destined to soon fade into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of people are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they're not all blondes anymore, with banjo and
dobro player Emily Robison showing off a more natural brunette
hairstyle the other night at the Arco Arena here.
</P>
<P>
   But hair color doesn't really get to the heart of the Chicks'
appeal. Sure, they're all babes. More power to them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing shallow about these women who are willing
to risk the
</P>
<P>
   massive popularity gained through selling nearly 10 million
copies of their
</P>
<P>
   debut release, ``Wide Open Spaces,'' by including a song on
their second
</P>
<P>
   record about murdering someone.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't even a hardball, Johnny Cash,
``I-shot-a-man-in-Reno-just-to-watch-him-die,'' kind of thing. It's
actually better _ at least as far as having a legitimate
justification for taking a life.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Goodbye, Earl,'' from ``Fly,'' the Chicks get you tapping
your feet to a story about a real loser. That would be Earl, as you
likely gathered, who spends a lot of time whupping on his wife,
Wanda.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda gets tired of being a punching bag and enlists her best
friend, Marianne, to launch Earl into the afterlife. They poison
him (absolutely a womanly preference; check the stats) and have a
little song:
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye, Earl/ We need a break/ Let's go out to the lake,
Earl/ We'll pack a lunch/ And stuff you in the trunk, Earl/ Well,
is that all right?/ Good, let's go for a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   You want to hear some cheering going on for a song, just listen
to the crowd eating up every juicy second of Wanda's payback. As
for Marianne _ well, hey, what are friends for? Sisterhood is
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   But trust me, these aren't a bunch of humorless feminists who
would slap a guy silly if he opened a door for them. Or maybe they
would but they are certainly not humorless.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their show includes a self-deprecating slide show of
what they called ``ugly'' pictures from their younger days (none of
which was ugly, save for maybe one picture of a mother's special
home permanent).
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, their brand of music includes a lot of up-tempo,
foot-tapping tunes, featuring not only Robison's excellent dobro
work, but fiddler Martie Seidel's seemingly effortless playing and
the powerful lead singing of Natalie Maines.
</P>
<P>
   When the trio lend their voices to harmony, it is pure country
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The women are backed by a six-piece band that includes a pedal
steel guitar player as well as a second guitarist and the usual
array of bass, drums, keyboards and percussion. But one of the
great things about the Dixie Chicks is that, having sold a
gazillion records and now capable of hiring the best backup players
money can buy, none of them needs to hide behind a semi-anonymous
male when it comes time to cut loose. The guys have their moments
to shine, but it's the Chicks who carry the tunes.
</P>
<P>
   They opened with ``Ready to Run,'' closed with ``Wide Open
Spaces'' and, seeing as how they only have two albums, played just
about everything else they knew. One highlight was a rollicking
version of Bonnie Raitt's ``Give It Up Or Let Me Go.'' It sounded
like a little bit Jerry Lee Lewis, a bit Scotty Moore, some Bonnie
of course and _ like every song that features a fiddle, even if it
is the national anthem _ a bit ``Turkey in the Straw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks themselves may say they didn't deserve to be named
the Country Music Association's Group of the Year last year _ and
they're probably right _ but they certainly deserved their
nomination.

&HT;     GOLDEN AGE OF THE NBA RETURNS, FOR A NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   There. That's it. That's the way the NBA used to be. That's the
way the NBA can be again. That's the way the NBA has to be if it
wants to recapture its status as a hip, hot, happening sport.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't stay up past midnight Wednesday on the off
chance that the NBA and NBC would collaborate on a playoff
production and have actual entertainment break out, Game 4 of the
Finals was a sight for sore and sleepy eyes. Basketball fans have
the Los Angeles Lakers and Indiana Pacers to thank for providing
some must-see-to-believe TV. It truly was a game for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   The golden ages of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   If you're too young to have seen Magic Johnson and Larry Bird
lift the NBA out of its late-1970s doldrums, this is what happens
when coaches and referees provide an environment that allows great
players to flourish. There was ebb. There was flow. There was show.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the Lakers and Pacers made 90-of-175 shots from
the field (51.4 percent) and committed only 25 turnovers in 53
minutes. The losers made half their field-goal attempts, buried
24-of-28 free throws and connected on 10-of-19 shots from behind
the three-point line.
</P>
<P>
   The winners lost their center, the league's Most Valuable
Player, halfway into overtime. At that point, they had no choice
but to put all their hopes in the hands of a 21-year-old guard with
a gimpy ankle. And he delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers 120, Pacers 118. From start to frenetic finish, the two
teams brought out the best in each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost played a picture-perfect game,'' Lakers coach Phil
Jackson said. Still, Jackson had to hold his breath like everyone
else in Conseco Field House when Pacers guard Reggie Miller
launched a three-pointer just before the buzzer in overtime. The
ball kissed off the front of the rim, just short of tying the
series at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was an all-time great game,'' said Hall-of-Fame
coach Jack Ramsay, who guided the Portland Trail Blazers to the
1977 title. ``Not just in recent years, but over the history of the
NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers got 50 minutes and 35 points from their shooting
star, Miller. Kobe Bryant, who sat out Game 3 with a sprained
ankle, answered with 28 points and five assists in 47 minutes. The
Pacers got 24 points (on 11-of-14 shooting) from the heretofore
useless Rik Smits. Shaquille O'Neal answered with 36 points and 21
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments we'd score, they'd come back and score,
we'd score, they'd come back and score,'' Bryant said. ``You could
get mad because our defense was lacking, but at the same time, it
was fun. Because this is the type of thing that you watch growing
up, these types of games where the competition is just the
ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a throwback to a time when the best offense was an
offense. During the golden '80s, the winning team in the Finals
averaged 112.9 points per game. The winning team's scoring average
for the '90s plummeted to 98.6. That may be a fine body
temperature, but it's the NBA equivalent of a
three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust offense.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Lakers met Bird's Celtics in the '84, '85 and '87
Finals. The winning team scored at least 120 points 10 times in
those 19 games. Of course, the Lakers and Celtics had an
embarrassment of talent riches.
</P>
<P>
   The best of those Celtics teams, the '86 edition, had perhaps
the best frontline of all time (Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert
Parish) to go with a starting backcourt of Dennis Johnson and Danny
Ainge. A former league MVP, Bill Walton, and a former All-Star,
Scott Wedman, came off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The '85 Lakers had the star power of Johnson, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy. A former league MVP, Bob McAdoo, and
a member of the all-defensive team, Michael Cooper, came off the
bench. Suffice it to say, expansion has watered down the talent
considerably since those days.
</P>
<P>
   The league took another turn for the worse at the end of the
'80s when the Detroit Pistons' Bad Boys style of play became the
prevalent style. Lost in the splendor of Jordan leading the Bulls
to six championships in the '90s on his own was an infestation of
control-freak coaches. The micro-managing of almost every
possession sucked the spontaneity out of the game. Not once during
the Bulls' last three championship runs did they score 100 points
in a Finals game.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the Lakers and Pacers, turning back the clock to
a better time. O'Neal fouled out with 2:33 left in overtime, with
the Lakers leading by three.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought was, `This game just became a lot more interesting
than it was a couple of seconds ago,''' Bryant said. He proceeded
to score eight of the Lakers' 16 points in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure? ``Pressure makes coal,'' Lakers forward Robert Horry
said. ``Pressure makes diamonds. Pressure bursts pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure revealed Kobe Bryant to be a polished diamond. For one
glorious night, it was a glimpse of the NBA the way it used to be.
It's the way the NBA can and will be again, if we're lucky, and the
coaches and referees allow the great players to shine.

&HT;     BRANAGH MELDS SHAKESPEARE WITH OLD-STYLE HOLLYWOOD MUSICALS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh seems to have the maniacal need _ like that of a
circus barker selling the uniqueness of the dog-faced boy _ to show
the world how wonderful his favorite guy, William Shakespeare, is.
For the last dozen years, since ``Henry V'' in 1989, Branagh has
been executing his master plan of popularizing the Bard.
</P>
<P>
   From an uncut ``Hamlet'' to the odd romping of ``Much Ado About
Nothing,'' he seems to feel the need to connect with a mass
audience rather than an art house crowd. And my theory is he's
willing to sacrifice a ``unified'' feel to his productions _
perhaps a little quality even _ for the sake of accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   So now from Branagh comes the first attempt to meld Shakespeare
with old-style Hollywood musicals. ``Love's Labour's Lost,'' the
play, is considered lesser Shakespeare, a rare romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Branagh's adaptation isn't a masterpiece either, but the
writer-director has come up with a sumptuous, happy piece of fluff.
</P>
<P>
   It uneasily throws together people like Alicia Silverstone and
Nathan Lane, Matthew Lillard and dancer Adrian Lester, Natascha
McElhone and Timothy Spall and, of course, Branagh himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1939 and the kingdom of Navarre, situated between France
and Spain, is isolationist. While tension is building in pre-World
War II Europe (there are several newsreel sequences in this film),
the King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) has publicly announced his
intention to devote three years exclusively to study. He'll swear
off women, fast once a week and sleep only three hours a night.
</P>
<P>
   The king gets three of his most trusted nobleman to take this
vow with him. They are Berowne (Branagh), Longaville (Lillard) and
Dumaine (Lester). Only Berowne initially has resistance. ``The mind
shall banquet while the body pine,'' he points out.
</P>
<P>
   Or try this line at a party sometime: ``Abstinence engenders
maladies.'' One last task awaits the king and his court before
abstinence takes the upper hand, and that is a diplomatic visit
from the Princess of France (Silverstone) and her court _ Katherine
(Emily Mortimer), Maria (Carmen Ejogo) and Rosaline (McElhone).
</P>
<P>
   Love is in the air already, thanks to the arrival of Spanish
nobleman Don Armado (Spall), who chases the local girl, Jacquanetta
(Stefania Rocca). Costard Lane), a vaudeville clown, is around for
entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
   The king and his court face a dilemma: Because of their vow,
they must keep silent about their feelings of love. So silent, no
one will be the first to admit what they are all thinking _ that
the vow should be deep-sixed.
</P>
<P>
   During this pining, there are secret meetings, love letters, and
yes, musical numbers. Standards like ``The Way You Look Tonight,''
``I Get a Kick Out of You'' and ``There's No Business Like Show
Business,'' are dressed up with dancing, tuxedos, sumptuous set
design and lush cinematography (by Alex Thomson).
</P>
<P>
   ``Love's Labour's Lost'' almost collapses from its own
featherweight. We
</P>
<P>
   know from the first 10 minutes that these mates will trash their
oath and match up with the four French women; so there's no
dramatic tension. The musical numbers are inconsistent _ sometimes
winning and inventive and other times rather weak. And the
slapstick comedy doesn't mesh well with either
</P>
<P>
   Shakespearean dialogue or today's movie audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something infectious about this movie. Its cheery
countenance is impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love's Labour's Lost'' isn't high-minded culture or a film
that will bring back the musical. Instead, it achieves its own
ethereal brand of colorful escapism.

 &HT;    Mission accomplished
 &HT;    By Khalid Moss

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ After 50 years of distinguished ministry, the
Rev. D.D. Chestang, pastor of Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist
Church, is going home.
</P>
<P>
   The energetic Alabama preacher, who has been a spiritual
divining rod for scores of faithful throughout southern Ohio, will
deliver his farewell sermon June 25 in the sanctuary of his
Jefferson Twp. church. Soon after, Chestang _ his wife Mary at his
side _ will return to his hometown, completing a mission that began
decades before when he received his first call to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew at age 9 on a Sunday at 2 o'clock that I was being
called to preach,'' the 81 year-old minister said as he fiddled
with a jar of candy in his Mount Carmel office. ``Fact is, it was a
dramatic situation because I even had a vision of the first church
I would pastor and I had never even been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The urge to preach, for me is a thousand times more powerful
than the bonding and love a man would have for a woman he wants to
be his wife. It has always been an unavoidable, irresistible,
dynamic influence in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Born March 28, 1919, in Mobile, Ala., Chestang did his
undergraduate work at Selma University and earned a doctor of
theology degree from Faith Bible College in Ashland, N.C. For 14
years, the father of one daughter served as principal of Cedar
Grove Academy in Pritchard, Ala. In 1977, he founded Northwestern
Bible College in Lima, Ohio. He is a retired trustee of Selma
University, which awarded him an honorary law degree in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Chestang, who speaks with the measured, nuanced diction of a
preacher who has delivered his share of fire-breathing sermons,
pastored at Moffattsville Missionary Baptist Church in Wilmer,
Ala., and Delaware Street M.B. Church in Mobile for 30 years before
being selected to take over the reins at Mount Carmel in 1972. At
the time, the church was on North Jefferson street in downtown
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chestang's guidance, Mount Carmel began to flourish. In
1987, the church purchased property and began construction on a
$2.5 million spiritual home. The modern, one-story structure _
which Chestang notes is entirely paid for _ sits on 32 heavily
wooded acres. After Chestang leaves, church officials say a
successor won't be chosen to take his place until at least 60 days
after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Chestang says one of the most rewarding aspects of his ministry
has been observing how the Holy Spirit can bring about profound
changes in individual's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely gratified when I see people change for the
better spiritually, morally and economically,'' he said. ``I've
seen tremendous changes in people. I've seen them change in such a
dramatic way that it's almost unbelievable. Hopefully, I have
played some part in their growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his frustrations during a half-century of saving
souls, Chestang's eyes narrowed as he leaned forward in his chair
to drive home a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any,'' he insisted. ``When I came to Ohio, there
wasn't one Baptist Bible school for blacks in the whole state. I
founded the first one. Over the years, I might not have been able
to do everything I wanted to do, but I've been too busy with God's
work to have any frustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to Mobile, Chestang plans to set up a new
institution for Christian education called Creekside Bible College.
Not only will it mark the return to his Alabama roots, but, for
him, it also represents a rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know anything about salmon?'' he asked. ``They always
return to their spawning ground. That's what I feel like I'm doing,
only I'm going to start a new generation down there. I'm not going
home to sit, I just need to get out of the ocean.''

&HT;     PC MAKERS ARE THINKING OUTSIDE THE BIG BOX STORE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The choices shoppers have for buying computers in retail stores
are rapidly dwindling. Tiny profits and scarce shelf space have
driven many PC makers out of stores and onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some very familiar names are missing from store shelves _
including IBM, Packard Bell and Acer. In fact, there are now only
three national brands available at retail: Compaq, Hewlett-Packard
and eMachines.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have moved to the Web are trying new approaches to
selling and design to make their products stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at two PCs, one from a PC maker that sells in
stores, and one from a manufacturer that used to:
</P>
<P>
   eMonster 600 _ $974, eMachines. You have to hand it to eMachines
_ this relatively young PC maker has probably done more to drive
down the cost of PCs sold at retail than anyone else. While it may
cut some tight corners to do it, its computers usually are a good
value.
</P>
<P>
   The company usually scrimps in two areas _ processor speed and
memory.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't offer the priciest, fastest, top-of-the-line chips,
correctly assuming that the average home computer user doesn't need
them.
</P>
<P>
   With this model, however, eMachines is making some interesting
claims.
</P>
<P>
   It's touted as the PC for those who like to play games or who
have, according to promotional materials, ``demanding computing
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The eMonster 600 comes with a 600-megahertz Intel Pentium III
chip, 64 megabytes of memory, a 20-gigabyte hard drive, an 8X
DVD-ROM drive, an nVidia TNT2 Vanta graphics card with 8 MB of
memory, a 56K fax modem, stereo sound and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The processor falls into the midrange of offerings from Intel _
it's not the slowest, but it certainly can't match the company's
1-gigahertz chip, either. The memory is generally what I would
consider the minimum to run Windows 98 comfortably, but twice what
eMachines offers on its lowest-priced models.
</P>
<P>
   The video card has potential _ the TNT2 graphics chip is
relatively fast and gives a good, clean look, but here it's
hamstrung by having only 8 MB of memory.
</P>
<P>
   The audio card is decent, though it doesn't support the latest
3-D audio standards from Creative Labs or Aureal. However, the
tiny, tinny speakers that eMachines ships with all its computers
don't do the card justice.
</P>
<P>
   Of the components, only the hard drive stands out as a
``monster'' part.
</P>
<P>
   It's fast and roomy.
</P>
<P>
   So how does this package come together? For many games, it does
quite well. For example, Ultima Online and The Sims ran quite
smoothly and without problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, higher-end titles, such as Quake III Arena or Flight
Simulator 2000, required that graphics settings be ratcheted way
down before they were comfortable to play.
</P>
<P>
   The eMonster handled everyday applications just fine, including
e-mail, America Online, word processing and home finance software.
</P>
<P>
   While I can't really recommend the eMonster for ``demanding
computing needs,'' I am comfortable saying that it's an excellent
computer for everyday needs. With a better graphics card, more
powerful speakers and additional memory, the eMonster would deserve
its name.
</P>
<P>
   Veriton FP 550 _ $2,150, Acer America Corp. Acer's computers
used to be easy to find in stores, but the company got out of the
retail consumer business last year. Now it sells its consumer PCs
online, but also sells computers to businesses via resellers and
independent Web vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The Veriton FP 550 is one of its business machines, but it would
make an excellent general-use PC at home _ particularly in a home
with minimal space. This is a one-piece computer with a flat-panel
display, and it's nifty.
</P>
<P>
   The Veriton comes with a 550-MHz Pentium III chip, 128 MB of
memory, a 12-GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive, stereo sound and
built-in speakers, an ATI Technologies Rage LT Pro graphics chip
with 8 MB of memory, a built-in Ethernet port and a 15-inch
active-matrix LCD monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many one-piece systems, the Veriton is not legacy-free,
or even legacy-light. It has a full complement of older style
ports, including serial and parallel ports. The keyboard and mouse
use PS/2 connections, instead of Universal Serial Bus ports.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is not a gamer's PC, it does the job with
entertainment titles. The Rage LT Pro chip works fairly well with
games that use Microsoft's DirectX 3-D graphics system. Its
performance with games that use OpenGL, another 3-D scheme, is not
quite as good as the eMachines' nVidia chip.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about the Veriton that might hinder it as a home PC is
its lack of a built-in modem. You can connect an external model via
either the serial or USB ports, of course. But the inclusion of an
Ethernet port makes it an excellent choice for use on a home
network, or with a cable or DSL modem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this would be an excellent PC for anyone who wants a
fast, broadband connection and a no-hassles, plug-and-go computer.

ASSESSING INTERNET-BASED INVESTMENT NEWSLETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(For release Sunday, June 18)  By MARK HULBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do Internet-based newsletters have better investment records
than those of the stamp-and-post variety?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why investors would want an advisory service
that can deliver advice to them instantly over the Internet.
Newsletters that travel through the regular mail seem old-fashioned
and ill-equipped to deal with modern, whipsawing markets.
</P>
<P>
   My response: Don't worry whether a service delivers advice via
the Web. It has no discernible relationship to performance.
</P>
<P>
   I reached this conclusion after separating into two categories
all the advisory services I monitor _ those that use the Internet
to communicate with their subscribers and those that don't. To
include performance history for years before e-mail and the Web, I
also included in the first camp services that rely on faxes, phone
hot lines, and other means of quick communication.
</P>
<P>
   For the nearly 20 years from mid-1980, when I started monitoring
the newsletter industry, through April 30 this year, services in
the quick-communication group produced a 10.9 percent annualized
return, versus 10.5 percent for the regular-mail group. The
difference is small enough that the results could be called a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   My study took into account the fact that some advisers have
switched in recent years from an exclusive reliance on the mail to
quicker communication mediums _ their performance before the switch
was credited to the second group, their performance after the
switch to the first. Such services make particularly good
illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Consider BI Research, edited by Tom Bishop, who inaugurated a
telephone hotline at the beginning of 1996 and more recently began
communicating with subscribers via e-mail. I calculate that for the
12 years through 1995, during which Bishop relied solely on regular
mail, his advice produced a 14.2 percent annualized return _ half a
percentage point behind the Wilshire 5000. For the four-plus years
since then, his advice has produced a 15.2 percent annualized
return, 7.1 points behind the Wilshire.
</P>
<P>
   So while BI Research has had a slightly greater return after
shifting to quick access, relative to the broad market, its
performance has been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't a newsletter's ability to communicate quickly with
subscribers improve performance? My guess is that the advisers'
ability to make virtually instantaneous modifications to their
model portfolios can tempt them into self-destructive actions.
</P>
<P>
   An example of such behavior would be selling winning securities
too soon. All investors, of course, are vulnerable to this
tendency, known among behavioral researchers as the disposition
effect. But being able to communicate instantly with subscribers is
likely to heighten the temptation, which can have especially
damaging results in a bull market. I suspect that one intraday
price spike in a solid, long-term holding is more likely to
influence a sale if an adviser relies on the Web to reach clients.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Web-based letters may also be likely to exit
the market too soon. Researchers have found that advisers tend to
become more risk-averse as their perspective becomes shorter-term _
a tendency called ``myopic risk aversion'' by Richard Thaler, an
economics professor at the University of Chicago and Shlomo
Benartzi, an accounting professor at the University of California
at Los Angeles. An example of the effect: Investors who are
restricted from changing the asset allocation in their retirement
plans more than a few times a year tend to be more heavily invested
in equities than those who can alter it daily.
</P>
<P>
   Myopic risk aversion probably helped those advisers who used
quick communication during the spring correction in stocks. But
because the market should outperform other asset classes over time,
the tendency should eventually cause their returns to be lower than
they would be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors shouldn't automatically dismiss a service
because it is Web-based. Rather, the lesson here is that one's odds
of success are not much influenced by Web sites, fax services and
hot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Internet revolution or not, the key to picking an adviser is a
good long-term record.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Leslie Wiesenfelder and his wife, Phyllis, are not what you
would call big donors to political campaigns _ certainly not the
kind of fat cats singled out by reformers for contributing to a
debasement of the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   But this Maryland pair, who joke about canceling each other's
votes, are a political odd couple that still typify a growing
phenomenon: families that give money to opposing sides. Though the
Wiesenfelders appear to manage it harmoniously, such cross-giving
in other households sometimes jeopardizes domestic tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's far more liberal than I am,'' said Wiesenfelder, a
lawyer and registered Republican who, according to the Federal
Election Commission, sent $286 last year to Sen. John McCain, the
former presidential candidate. Wiesenfelder, a Democrat, is listed
as a $500 donor to another former contender, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The Wiesenfelders, who live just outside Washington in Chevy
Chase, even write checks for their dueling contributions from a
joint account. ``It's not a consultation and it's not a tradeoff,''
Wiesenfelder said of their less-than-fully-collegial method. But
it's also ``not personal, not an affront'' to the other, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some politically opposed couples find contributions a somewhat
greater threat to harmony. ``There's a higher risk you run when
money is involved,'' said John Buckley, a former top official in
Republican presidential campaigns and now a senior vice president
at Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home-financing corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, who is married to Anna Bennett, a consultant to
Democratic candidates, said he recently contributed from their
joint account to George W. Bush and received in return a mail
solicitation for more money _ addressed to both him and his wife.
On an earlier occasion, he had to move quickly to intercept a
letter thanking both for a contribution he made to Sen. Christopher
Bond, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been quite embarrassing if it had gotten
noticed'' by his wife or, perhaps worse, by her clients, Buckley
said. ``I think it's probably time for separate accounts, given the
fact that many of the people she most supports are running against
those I'm most supportive of.''
</P>
<P>
   Combing through the 1999 records of the Federal Election
Commission, the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington found
scores of politically contrary contributions, a figure that may be
rising with economic prosperity, which affords more people the
resources to indulge political passions.
</P>
<P>
   And while political giving was long dominated by men ``there's
absolutely more women giving now,'' especially at the presidential
level, said Clyde Wilcox, a government professor at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-known unmatched pair is James Carville, a chief
troubleshooter for President Clinton, and Mary Matalin, a top
campaign aide for former President George Bush who now appears on
CNN's ``Crossfire'' and advises George W. Bush's presidential
campaign. Then there is Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire
businessman who splashes money around to an assortment of mendicant
parties and politicians, and Patricia Duff, a major fund-raiser for
Democrats. The pair had a loud confrontation at the Democrats' 1996
convention in Chicago, just before the breakup of their stormy
marriage of less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, politically mixed marriages remain a distinct
minority. ``Most folks marry people who share their values,
including their partisanship,'' said Paul Herrnson, a political
scientist at the University of Maryland and author of a book on
congressional elections. ``And in cases where they disagree, they
probably don't have much animosity about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Kramer of Shaker Heights, Ohio, for example, gave
$1,000 to McCain, while Vice President Al Gore got $1,000 from her
husband, Leonard Schwartz. ``His leanings are more Democratic,''
said Kramer, who administers a charitable foundation. ``I'm sort of
a Ripon Republican,'' referring to the centrist organization. Even
so, the ``discussion'' rarely escalates into argument, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudi Lee, an Atlanta homemaker and periodic contributor to
Republican candidates, is more than a little discreet about it with
her husband, Michael, a paper-company manager. He is also a
Republican, but they disagree on various issues, including abortion
and whether there is a glass ceiling for female executives. But the
subject of donations ``just doesn't come up,'' said Lee, who draws
such checks on her account. ``He probably doesn't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   In households where parents are politically engaged, there is a
good chance the children are, too. The 1999 records of the Federal
Elections Commission include one extended family in Missouri whose
members gave to the campaigns of Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican
seeking re-election, and his Democratic opponent, Gov. Mel
Carnahan, in the most expensive Senate race outside New York. The
records show that 16 people with the same family name and
small-town address made donations _ more than two dozen to the
Ashcroft campaign and more than one dozen to Carnahan's.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say cross-purpose donations within families appear
especially common in primaries, when disagreement often centers on
which candidate is most electable, rather than on fundamental
principles.
</P>
<P>
   And in some cases donations are spread among opposing candidates
or parties for business, not personal, reasons. According to the
records, Stephen K. Lambright, general counsel for the
Anheuser-Busch Companies, gave $1,000 to George W. Bush, $1,000 to
Al Gore and $2,000 to the Democratic Leaders' Victory Fund 2000
last year, while his wife, Gail, gave $1,000 each to Bush and Gore.
``You could look at any given election and probably find us both on
both sides,'' Lambright said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes campaigns ask a donor to let it reallocate, say, a
$500 donation, assigning half to the original donor and half to the
spouse so that more of the total qualifies for matching funds; the
federal government matches the first $250 an individual gives to a
presidential primary candidate. The strategy sometimes extends to
children.
</P>
<P>
   But ideology remains a prime motivator in generating campaign
cash. Consider Bruce Teitelbaum and his wife, Suri Kasirer. He is a
former campaign manager for Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican mayor
of New York; she is a prominent Democratic consultant and activist
and a delegate to the party's national convention in Los Angeles
this August.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is a loyal Democrat, right to the core,'' Teitelbaum
said. ``Our house is flooded with solicitations, and she never
fails to contribute. Sometimes I ask her why in the world she gives
to people she doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasirer, who acknowledges that her husband is not ``as
ideological as I am,'' bristles when he wonders out loud whether
she ought to discuss contributions with him _ the couple make their
donations from separate accounts. ``We each do our own political
giving,'' she said, her voice suggesting that their marriage
benefits from the fact that travel and work commitments often
separate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not together enough to argue about it,'' Teitelbaum said
with a smile.

 &HT;    Pokemon starting to show age
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Barchas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Keep your eyes peeled for an obituary like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pikachu and his fellow friends in the Pokemon universe, age 2
in America, died today of natural toy fad causes.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon began as a hand-held video game and expanded across the
globe into a veritable phenomenon with trading cards, game leagues
and paraphernalia from bandages to ice pops. Pokemon will be
greatly missed by those who enjoy little animated monsters,
although parents probably aren't too sorry to see it go.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon was preceded in death by Transformers, Cabbage Patch
Dolls and Garbage Pail Kids.
</P>
<P>
   The game is survived by Digimon, Gundam Wing and DragonBall Z.
</P>
<P>
   No memorial contributions are necessary, as corporate America
has already claimed billions in sales during the height of the
Pokemon phenomenon. (Plus, toy stores can discount Pokemon products
and unload them before too long.)''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be too soon yet to ring the death knell for
Pokemon, many stores report that the fad is fading as children move
on to newer games. ``Basically, we're seeing Pokemon slip a bit,''
said Greg D'Andrea, store director at Toys ``R'' Us in Austin.
``Right now, Pokemon is starting to fall. They're not as hot as
they once were.''
</P>
<P>
   Pokemaniacs, devoted solely to selling Pokemon and anime
products, reports a similar decline in sales. ``We're getting more
and more kids nowadays who just want to trade their cards in for
cash,'' said manager Danny Butler. ``I mean, the game itself was
pretty good when it came out, but eventually it just turned into a
fad. There are other things out there nowadays. Some kids just get
into sports or other video games.''
</P>
<P>
   This decreased interest in Pokemon products is simply a product
of time, according to D'Andrea. ``The toy business is a fad
business,'' he said. ``Kids slowly switch to the newest product.''
</P>
<P>
   But that may disappoint the business world as companies continue
to funnel money into new Pokemon products. Warner Bros. will be
releasing a summer follow-up to its original smash hit ``Pokemon:
The First Movie.'' Nintendo plans to introduce dozens of different
characters this fall in new games Pokemon Gold and Silver. Even
Welch's has jumped on the bandwagon by featuring nine Pokemon
characters on its 25th series of collectible jelly jars.
</P>
<P>
   But this hype might not be enough to resurrect Pokemon.
KidGenius owner Jeff Hunt, who generally avoids handling
collectible items unless there's such a demand it will hurt overall
business not to carry a toy, says his store will likely stop
selling Pokemon this year. ``I think that toward the end of the
year I'll not be carrying them, largely because I don't believe
there will be as much of a demand,'' Hunt said. ``I think they'll
become primarily a collector's item because I don't think there's a
tremendous amount of intrinsic play value in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents shouldn't be breathing sighs of relief about Pokemon's
demise yet, though. New games are already waiting to take its
place. Digimon is eerily similar to Pokemon, combining a trading
card game with a television show, and Gundam Wing, a space
adventure series also originating in Japan, has already gained a
solid fan base.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew Kaminski, assistant manager at K B Toys, says that
even with these other fads on the horizon, no one should be saying
the Pokemon craze is over yet. ``It's not as popular as ever, but
it's not declining any time soon,'' he said. Kaminski said the
newest set of Pokemon trading cards, Team Rocket, offers something
for everyone. ``It's an entirely new set with all different
drawings,'' he said. ``It's the same Pokemon with a different
twist. People who are collectors will like the art work. For people
who actually play the game, they're overall better cards, and it
gives you an edge while you are playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And although they don't release exact numbers, Wizards of the
Coast, the Washington company that manufactures Pokemon trading
cards, says sales are still high. ``I think that some retailers
have seen a slowdown, and with others, it's still being snatched
off the shelf, so it depends on the retailer and the location,''
said Carol Rogalski, director of corporate communications. ``I
think that what's happening for us is that it's leveling off a bit,
and there's not as steep of an increase in sales. But people are
still very interested in Pokemon. It certainly isn't going
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Llewelyn, public relations manager at Nintendo, predicts
that Pokemon sales will reach $3 billion this year. She says she
isn't sure why people think Pokemon is losing popularity. ``It
could be that one kid decided to trade in his cards, and it rippled
off from that,'' Llewelyn said. ``From what we've seen and heard,
it's still going very, very strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, be on the lookout for this: May Pokemon rest
in peace.

WHAT'S NEW AND FAST ON 2 WHEELS FOR THE SUMMER OF 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By JIM McCRAW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are heady times for motorcycle enthusiasts. Not only has
the weather turned perfect for riding, but the thriving industry is
serving up a host of new models.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, there is more advanced technology, extra power, better
brakes (even antilock brakes, like those in cars), longer
warranties and emergency road service.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a roundup of some highlights of the motorcycle market
this season:
</P>
<P>
   APRILIA _ This maker of high-style, high-tech Italian
motorcycles has been in the American market for only a year or so.
It offers three distinct models, the RSV Mille, a V-twin
1000-cubic-centimeter superbike ($13,799), the SL 1000 Falco V-twin
1000 cc sportbike ($11,299) and the Pegaso 650 cc single-cylinder
street bike ($7,877) with the dual-purpose on- and off-road look so
popular in Europe. Aprilia already has about 70 dealerships in the
United States, and it recently signed an agreement to acquire
another Italian motorcycle giant, Moto Guzzi, which makes large
V-twin shaft-drive cruiser, touring and sport bikes.
</P>
<P>
   BUELL _ The Buell sport bike division of Harley-Davidson has
produced its first single-cylinder ``starter'' bike, a low-priced,
no-frills model called the Blast, a 500 cc high-style street bike
that sells for only $4,395 and is aimed at novice riders. In
addition, Buell offers the Cyclone ($8,599), the Lightning
($10,599), and the Thunderbolt ($11,999), all using Harley engines
of 91 or 101 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   BMW _ After a record sales year, BMW has more models than ever,
including the new 2001 F 650 GS single-cylinder chain-drive machine
that won the Granada-Dakar rally. The F 650 ($8,110 to $8,600) has
optional antilock brakes, electronic engine management and a
catalytic converter in the exhaust system _ technologies found on
no other single-cylinder bike. Also new for 2000 is the R 1150 GS
on- and off-road bike ($14,190), a traditional BMW opposed-twin
machine with high-mounted front and rear fenders, two asymmetrical
headlamps and a three-way-adjustable windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   CAGIVA _ Cagiva owns the Cagiva and MV Agusta street bike brands
and the Swedish Husqvarna dirt-bike line. Cagiva's Grand Canyon
($8,995) uses a 904 cc V-twin Ducati engine _ the company used to
own Ducati _ and electronic fuel injection in a half-fairing body
that's part off-road bike, part street bike and part pack mule. The
limited-production MV Agusta 750 F4 Strada ($18,895) is the
company's technological tour de force, a four-cylinder race bike
for the street with a passel of patented technologies from its dual
polyellipsoidal headlamps to its Ferrari-designed radial-valve
engine.
</P>
<P>
   DUCATI _ The vaunted Italian company tried something new on Jan.
1, an Internet sale of some special machines, the MH900e 900 cc,
Mike Hailwood Evolution. Designed to look like the bike that the
world champion rode in his heyday, it was sold only online,
starting at one second after midnight. All 500 were sold in a few
minutes. The Ducati product line continues unchanged for 2000: the
Monster 750 ($6,995) and 900 ($10,495); the Supersport 750 ($8,295)
and 900 ($10,995); the ST2 and ST4 touring bikes ($12,495 and
$14,695); the 748 ($12,495) and the new 996, replacing the
legendary 916, at $16,495 for the standard and $20,995 for the S
version.
</P>
<P>
   EXCELSIOR-HENDERSON _ Excelsior-Henderson, of Belle Plaine,
Minn., started and finished in 1999, declaring Chapter 11
bankruptcy late in the year. The company has been rescued by new
investors who formed a new company, E-H Partners. Production is
restarting, and a new model of the Super X V-twin cruiser, with a
new front suspension, has already been shown.
</P>
<P>
   HARLEY-DAVIDSON _ Harley's most significant news for 2000 is
that it has passed Honda as the leading seller of motorcycles in
the United States (based on sales for the 1999 calendar year). Then
there's the new 88 cubic-inch ``Fathead'' engine that, with its
internal balancing system, has virtually eliminated the
characteristic rolling vibrations inherent in Harley's big-engined
bikes. The new engine was introduced late in the last riding season
to rave reviews. Among the new models for 2000 is the Softail Deuce
($15,995) with stacked exhaust pipes, a stretched fuel tank, new
fender designs, bigger brakes and a chromed front suspension.
</P>
<P>
   HONDA _ For 2000, Honda has introduced two high-performance
motorcycles, the CBR929RR and the RC51, each with completely
different designs. The CBR929RR ($9,999) is a 150-horsepower
in-line four-cylinder sport bike that weighs only 379 pounds. The
RC51 (also $9,999) is a 125-horsepower 999 cc V-twin that, while
completely street-legal, is made for AMA Superbike racing. On the
touring/cruising side of the house, Honda has a new Shadow Sabre,
an 1100 cc liquid-cooled V-twin cruiser bike starting at $8,199 for
basic black.
</P>
<P>
   INDIAN _ The 2000 Indian Chief ($23,995), a new motorcycle
design faithful to the original Indian last produced in 1953, has
fully valanced front and rear fenders, an Indian-head running lamp
on the front fender and retro logos. The design is wrapped around
an 88 cubic-inch S&AMP;S-modified Harley engine and transmission. Later
this year, a new Indian Scout model will be introduced, and shortly
after that, Indian expects to produce its own V-twin engines.
</P>
<P>
   KAWASAKI _ Kawasaki has just introduced the Ninja ZX-12R, the
quickest and fastest motorcycle it has ever built, limited to a top
speed of 185 mph. The 1,200 cc ZX-12R is joined by a new 900 cc
ZX-9R Ninja, a new 600 cc Ninja ZX-6R, and three new cruiser bikes.
Cruisers are led by a new Vulcan 1500 Nomad with electronic fuel
injection, saddle bags and a windshield; a Vulcan 1500 Classic,
also with fuel injection; and the Vulcan 800 Drifter, an 800 cc
version of Kawasaki's 1940s retro cruiser, also available with a
1500 cc engine.
</P>
<P>
   MOTO GUZZI _ Aside from its acquisition by Aprilia, Moto Guzzi
has a wider array of its transverse V-twin, shaft-drive bikes.
Built around a 1,064 cc engine and a five-speed transmission are
the California Jackal ($8,495), the California Special ($11,700),
packing a good deal more chrome, and the 90-horsepower V11 Sport
($11,900).
</P>
<P>
   MZ _ Germany's MZ makes a full line of lightweight bikes wrapped
around a monster Yamaha XTZ 660 cc single-cylinder engine, and an
unusual large-tubing frame. The line includes the on- and off-road
Black Panther ($6,195), the bare-bones Tour ($4,995), the Skorpion
full-bodied sportbike ($5,795) and the Skorpion Traveller touring
bike with saddle bags and windshield ($6,495).
</P>
<P>
   SUZUKI _ With several 1999 racing championships to its credit,
along with the the 1,300 cc Hayabusa _ the quickest and fastest
production motorcycle in the world _ Suzuki goes into the 2000
riding season with a wide array of machinery, including the all-new
GSX-R750 race bike replica and the bargain-priced ($5,749) SV650
fun bike, The Hayabusa ($10,799), perhaps the biggest
high-performance bargain on earth _ car or bike _ is available in
slightly less garish colors for 2000. It is not quite as quick or
as fast as the 1999 model, which was timed at 194 mph.
</P>
<P>
   TRIUMPH _ The last survivor of the once-dominant British
motorcycle manufacturers, Triumph has thrived in the American
market over the last five years. For 2000, there are two brand new
models. The first is the TT600, a lightweight, 600 cc 4-cylinder
machine in a stunning black and yellow livery aimed directly at the
Japanese 600s. It is joined by an all-new Sprint RS, using
Triumph's proven 955 cc three-cylinder engine in a lightweight
machine with a half fairing and exposed engine.
</P>
<P>
   VICTORY _ In only its third year as a motorcycle manufacturer,
Victory now has two 1,500 cc cruisers, the original V92C and the
new V92SC, distinguished by its bobbed fenders and very large
chrome muffler on the right side. (The original has twin pipes and

   YAMAHA _ After nearly 50 years of cooperation on engines and
research, Toyota bought 5 percent of Yamaha, Japan's second-largest
motorcycle manufacturer, earlier this year; in turn, Yamaha Corp.
and Yamaha Motors each bought 500,000 shares of Toyota. Yamaha's
2000 product line is led by the lighter, stronger, better handling
1,000 cc YZF-R1 performance bike, with a new chassis and a new 150
horsepower engine for $10,299. On the cruiser side, there's a new
Venture MM Limited 1,300 cc V-4 ($16,099), a loaded cruiser with
special cream paint and limited-edition dress.

CRUNCHING NUMBERS: HERE'S THE 411 ON TODAY'S HOT NEW
NUMERICALLY-NAMED BANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a recent phone interview, Matchbox Twenty singer Rob Thomas
explained why the band changed its name from 20 to, um, Twenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want people to get us confused with all those other
number bands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are indeed a ``number'' of alternative-rock bands that
use numerals in their names _ and, just as Thomas said, it's easy
to confuse them, they share so many likenesses.
</P>
<P>
   Like, say, their looks. There are two numeral-band looks. The
first one is alterna-hottie _ short spiked hair, handsome but
kind-of innocuous features, maybe an earring or a tattoo. They look
like they bathe in money.
</P>
<P>
   Look No. 2: bad-boy. Baggy clothes, mangy hair, lotsa tattoos
and body piercings. They look like they don't bathe at all.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the music _ which is either angry Korn-inspired
metal, or addictive but middle-of-the-road Third Eye Blind-inspired
rock-pop.
</P>
<P>
   And the names? They are: Project 86, Apartment 26, 3 Doors Down,
Blink-182, Stroke 9, 8Stops7 _ whew! So, between the similar names,
looks and music, how ``do'' you keep track of 'em?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how _ with our number-band breakdown:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blink-182
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 92101 (San Diego)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Melodic pop-punk trio, with a heaping of
juvenile humor.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: Several: ``What's My Age Again, All the Small
Things'' and, the trio's current chart-climber, ``Adam's Song,'' a
touching song about the suicide death of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Originally, they were simply called Blink,
but an Irish band with a similar name threatened to sue, forcing
them to tweak it. Thus, they added the 182. ``It's how many times
(a specific expletive) was said in `Scarface,''' says band
publicist Leona Megerdichian.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apartment 26
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: SW14XT (London)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Young electronic-rock quartet (think Nine Inch
Nails) whose lead singer, Biff Butler, is the son of Black Sabbath
bassist Geezer Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: Working on first one, ``Basic Breakdown,'' which is
currently getting airplay on hard-rock stations like Dallas'
KEGL/97.1 ``The Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Also derived from a movie. This one being
David Lynch's ultra-weird cult classic, ``Eraserhead.'' The movie's
main character, played by Jack Nance, lives in apartment No. 26.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Matchbox Twenty
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 32801 (Orlando)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Enormously popular, earnest pop-rock quintet
that, along with the also numerically named Third Eye Blind, opened
the floodgates for other modest pop bands.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: Just about half the songs on their 1996 debut,
``Yourself or Someone Like You,'' have been ingrained into our
subconscious. Chances are, same thing will happen with the group's
recently released second CD, ``Mad Season by Matchbox Twenty,''
which has already yielded the hit ``Bent.''
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Drummer Paul Doucette thought of it when he
was working in a restaurant. A patron came in wearing a softball
shirt with the No. 20 on it; a patch on the shirt said
``matchbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Doucette was going to use the name for a clothing
company he was hoping would take off. Instead, the band did.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Project 86
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 92801 (Orange County, Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Christian rap-core, a pro-God version of
Deftones and Rage Against the Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: Currently climbing metal charts with first single,
``One Armed Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Using ``86'' as slang for starting over or
starting fresh, band singer Andrew Schwab says Project 86
translates to ``new project.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3 Doors Down
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 39552 (Escatawpa, Miss.)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Guitar-fueled Matchbox Twenty sound-alike with
at least one interesting trait: drummer Brad Arnold is also the
lead singer.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: One, but it's a biggie _ ``Kryptonite,'' which has
been sitting in the No. 1 slot of ``Billboard's'' Mainstream Rock
Tracks charts for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: It was dreamed up while the band was on a
road trip. ``We came out of this building, and some of the letters
had fallen off the front. ... It said `doors down,''' Arnold says.
``At the time, there were just three of us, so we said, `3 Doors
Down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eiffel 65
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 10128 (Torino, Italy)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: The odd ones of the number bunch: they're a
dance-pop trio. No guitars or tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: The ridiculously annoying Top 10 single ``Blue (Da Ba
Dee).''
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Not able to think of anything on their own,
the band members let a computer randomly choose it. On the computer
printout that had the chosen word ``Eiffel'' on it, someone
inadvertently scribbled two digits of someone's phone number beside
it: 65. The name stuck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nine Days
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 11729 (Deer Park, Long Island)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Straightforward guitar-pop.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: One huge modern-rock single, ``Absolutely (Story of a
Girl)'' (Do we see a one-hit-wonder trend here?)
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Coined by singer/guitarist Brian Desveaux
when someone in the band asked him how long they had been in the
studio working on their debut, ``The Madding Crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8Stops7
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 93001 (Ventura, Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Headbanger quintet with mystic lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: They've had two Top 20 rock-radio tracks, ``My
Would-Be Savior'' and ``Satisfied.'' A third single, ``Question
Everything,'' is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Drummer Adam Powell came up with Eight
Stops Nowhere. Singer/guitarist Evan Fula-Goff tweaked it to
8Stops7 for ``artistic'' reasons. ``Seven is a symbol for something
you want to get away from and 8 is the door you go through to get
there,'' he states in the band's bio. We'll take his word for it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sevendust
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 30301 (Atlanta)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Rap-rock school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: A handful on modern rock radio, including ``Waffle''
and ``Denial,'' from their second disc, ``Home.''
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Originally called Crawlspace, the band was
forced to change its name when another band already claimed dibs on
it. Band bassist Vinnie Hornsby came up with Sevendust, the name of
a combustive chemical.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stroke 9
</P>
<P>
   ZIP code: 94101 (San Francisco)
</P>
<P>
   Band one-liner: Well-crafted pop quartet that's not afraid to
detour into reggae and ambient territory.
</P>
<P>
   Hit count: Two: The inescapable and hilarious ``Little Black
Backpack'' (about kicking the crud out of your ex-girlfriend's
backpack) and the far more poignant ``Letters.''
</P>
<P>
   The 411 on the name: Taken from a line in a T.S. Eliot poem,
``The Waste Land'' _ fitting, since the band's lyrics often border
on the poetic.

DON'T EXPECT THE HIGH ROAD TO BE CROWDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It says here that Hillary Clinton is taking off the gloves in
her U.S. Senate race against Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reports that Clinton has adopted a ``new,
aggressive approach'' designed to brand Lazio as a right-wing
extremist whose votes in Congress have hurt women, children and
families.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, this isn't a new strategy. When Lazio came
off the bench recently to replace New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani
as Clinton's opponent, the Clinton campaign's immediate reaction
was to attack the Republican congressman as a clone of ex-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   That was the ideological equivalent of declaring war, of course,
and Lazio fired back by raising the carpetbagger issue against
Clinton, a barely unpacked New York transplant whose motives are
highly suspect in the eyes of some Empire State residents.
</P>
<P>
   After that initial exchange of rhetorical warheads, both
candidates seemed to back off and begin focusing on their own
ideas. But now, says the Times, Clinton has launched a nuclear
attack by delivering a campaign speech in which she blasted Lazio
on gun control, abortion rights and education policy.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted the speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``On issue after issue, my opponent has been a follower, not a
leader. He voted to shut down the government. He voted for a
trillion-dollar budget that would have slashed so many services
that we need here in New York. He would squander the surplus and, I
believe, endanger the economy. And yet he says he agrees with me on
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Times offered some analysis as well:
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's speech underscored a shift in strategy by a
candidate who has, with the loss of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as an
opponent, seemed unsure how to proceed in an unexpectedly tight
race with his replacement, a little-known Republican representative
from Long Island. In taking on Lazio so directly _ the speech
sounded like the kind of attack candidates save for the final weeks
of a campaign _ Clinton was trying to shape New Yorkers' perception
of her new opponent before he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Giuliani dropped out of the race to deal with cancer and
other personal problems, Clinton's campaign strategy was
cut-and-dried: Attack, attack, attack.
</P>
<P>
   With Giuliani embroiled in controversy more or less constantly
in connection with his responsibilities as mayor, he was an
inviting target for criticism. He virtually had a bull's-eye
tattooed on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the mayor often hurt his own cause by
being defensive, insensitive and just plain jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio couldn't be more different. His early campaign appearances
were amiable, charming and relentlessly upbeat _ which might be why
Clinton put away the heavy artillery after that early assault on
Lazio's past association with Gingrich. The first lady might have
feared that hammering a nice guy too hard could prove
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   She might have figured that her unfavorable ratings were high
enough _ 31 percent in a recent poll cited by the Times _ without
alienating even more voters with overstated attacks on Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, when Lazio first jumped into the race, Clinton enjoyed
a colossal lead over him in most public-opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The lead evaporated quickly, however, once Lazio started
campaigning. That caused some of Clinton's supporters to worry that
her campaign had become ``overly placid,'' the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   So. Down with placid. Up with aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   But as quickly as Clinton tore into Lazio and his record in
Congress, Lazio tore into Clinton and her negative tactics. He
derided her criticism as ``mudslinging,'' according to the Times,
and accused her of distorting his ``mainstream record.''
</P>
<P>
   This could get very interesting. Not to mention very nasty,
considering that the election is nearly five months away.
</P>
<P>
   How long will Lazio keep traveling the campaign high road if
Clinton is determined to drag him into the gutter?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guess: Not long.

CRITIC PICKS THE BEST SHOWS OF THE YEAR; TOO BAD THE NETWORKS DON'T
AGREE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``La Femme Nikita'' has aired on USA for four years, but I don't
personally know a soul who watches it regularly. There are those
who peruse and sample, and return disoriented, disengaged and
disenchanted _ as if they'd stumbled into a maze with no form of
escape.
</P>
<P>
   How unfortunate, though certainly understandable. ``La Femme
Nikita,'' which extends Luc Besson's feature film about an
ambivalent female assassin working for a secret government
organization, is a thriller for the information and MTV age _
high-tech and high-brow in its somber mood and survivalist methods.
It could very well be the darkest, most complicated and most
humorless series ever made.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the most stylish, enigmatic, sensuous and savagely
engrossing series to air this season.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who have been in the ``La Femme Nikita'' camp since day
one, and those who came late but have stuck around long enough to
``get'' this drama, are in for life _ or at least until USA drops
the series, which, if reports are true, will be this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Femme Nikita'' is the best show on TV because it delivers
the standard goods _ cool gadgets and gizmos, illogical
predicaments, global menaces, massive explosions, shootouts,
oblique and enigmatic characters. But even more so because of the
ongoing battle by Nikita (Peta Wilson) to save a few vestiges of
humanity (not to mention that doomed romance with Michael, the
stone-faced operative) in a brutal, inhuman world. That is what
gives this series its complexity and gut-level entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
   When I tell people that ``La Femme Nikita'' is an hour as
dramatically satisfying as ``ER'' and ``The Sopranos,'' they often
dismiss me. Go right ahead, sneer. But the fact is, few shows can
balance corny and campy action without a trace of corniness or
campiness, and, let's face it: Even fewer manage to offer such a
tasty show of female empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   So which shows round out my top 10, you ask? Here you go:
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (WB) _ Fans who feared the Buff
would sour as the gang moved from high school to college (and as
creator Joss Whedon pulled a double shift with ``Angel''), have
been in a state of pleasant shock. Whedon has managed to make
``Buffy'' just as enticing as ever while changing almost everything
this past season. Willow's (Alyson Hannigan) love affair is the
most subtle and sensuous gay romance I've witnessed on TV _ or
film, for that matter. And Whedon has managed to keep the
fatalistic love affair between Buffy and Angel (David Boreanaz)
going with crossovers so seamlessly crafted they didn't feel like
the shamelessly calculated contraptions they really were.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Once and Again'' (ABC) _ This drama was among a batch of
new shows to actually deal with grown-ups and grown-up issues.
Created by writer-producers Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz,
the series proves to be as much about the pain of divorce and
parents struggling with their children's adolescent sexuality as it
is about the protagonists _ two newly single parents _ trying to
find a love life of their own.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Malcolm in the Middle'' (Fox) _ Shot with a single camera
and using a kid genius as narrator and guide, this energetic sitcom
bottled the mood of family life _ noisy, disorganized, loving _ and
poured it out in hilarious, sidesplitting dollops. Frankie Muniz is
a joy as the wide-eyed Malcolm, but it's the parents, the
cheerfully spaced-out dad (Bryan Cranston) and the all-seeing,
all-knowing warden of a mother (Jane Kaczmarek) who kept the series
fresh even after the initial you-gotta-see-this excitement wore
off.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' (NBC) _ Not since ``My So-Called Life''
has the mystification of adolescence appeared so real and
pronounced. That ``Freaks'' performed this trick with humor and a
cast chosen for ability and pragmatism, not looks, made it that
much more remarkable. Its cancellation was nothing short of a
cultural crime.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``GvsE'' (USA) _ USA canned this low-rated series, which
isn't as surprising as it is simply unfortunate, considering that
it was one of the most inventive, funny, ambitious and deliciously
unusual series in some time. Its premise, about a couple of dead
guys fighting demons for a secret organization, was outlandish,
perhaps even silly. But it worked gloriously ... well, it did for
me, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Sex and the City'' (HBO) _ This racy, profane and decidedly
insider look at the dating scene in New York blithely bulldozes the
conventional wisdom of half-hour comedies. ``Sex'''s four single
femmes navigating Manhattan nightlife and lust manage to really
``say'' something about female sexuality and the always strange,
mystifying dance of the sexes. That it's usually over raw oysters
and vodka stingers makes it all the better.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Wonderland'' (ABC) _ Engaging and engrossing and in trouble
from the moment it was scheduled, this drama set inside a mental
ward of a city hospital was yanked after just two episodes. I saw
four of them _ and, while I agree that the opening episode was a
downer and rather unfair in showing the mentally ill as violent,
future episodes presented more of a balance, and, therefore, a
prime opportunity to understand a world we fear.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Now and Again'' (CBS) _ You wonder if viewers knew what to
make of this pleasant, playful series, which would switch gears _
and genres, even _ several times in the course of an hour. ``Now
and Again,'' canceled by CBS, was also hurt by its ``Six Million
Dollar Man'' association. A shame. This Glenn Gordon Caron
(''Moonlighting'') series was hardly campy or lightweight, even
while breaking into a quick song-and-dance. It delivered as a
drama, comedy, thriller, sci-fi, romantic adventure, and, yeah,
musical. It'll be missed.
</P>
<P>
   10. Tie: ``The West Wing'' (NBC) and ``Judging Amy'' (CBS) _
Aaron Sorkin's fantasy tale about the doings of a White House
administration was smart and gooey and rarely boring. Its cast
members were first-rate and never for a moment forgot that they
were saving the world. ``Judging Amy'' was more understated and far
more effective. Where ``The West Wing'' appeared at times to be a
show doing a serious take on what's actually ripe for parody,
``Judging Amy'' used its drama to explain how the law is a living
thing evolving every day, every ``minute,'' and that change comes
so quickly that many rulings learned by law students are obsolete
by the time they pass the bar. But what doesn't change, it told us
even more powerfully, is the value of family.

BIRDS, BEES, `BOYS AND GIRLS' _ NOT MUCH NEW HERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Boys and Girls,'' which entered the youth-film sweepstakes
when it opened Friday, platonic buds Ryan and Jennifer (Freddie
Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlani) take in a double bill of John
Hughes' ``Sixteen Candles'' and ``The Breakfast Club'' in an
attempt to find answers to their romantic confusion. It's meant to
be a tribute to the youthful savvy of Hughes' mid-'80s movies, but
it's merely lip service, since ``Boys and Girls'' appears to be
completely out of touch with ``anything'' savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Ryan and Jennifer have never heard of ``When Harry
Met Sally,'' because if they had watched it instead, they would
have saved themselves _ and us _ a lot of time and grief. Like that
movie, ``Boys and Girls'' tells the story of friends who were
obviously meant to be together, and since everyone but them
recognizes this, we wait for more than an hour and a half for the
inevitable climactic scene in which they both wise up.
Unfortunately, unlike ``When Harry Met Sally,'' ``Boys and Girls''
doesn't have much warmth _ or wit _ to keep us entertained while we
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Like Harry and Sally, Jennifer and Ryan meet while traveling,
except that in this case they're 12-year-old seatmates on a plane
flight, and _ in what passes for the filmmakers' idea of charm _
she's candidly telling him that she just had her first menstrual
period and baiting him with sexual references. Jennifer is
free-spirited and spontaneous; Ryan is uptight and nerdy. They
immediately clash, and they clash again when they run into each
other a few years later at a high-school football game. But when
they meet again at college, they click, especially after they're
dumped by their respective significant others.
</P>
<P>
   Director Robert Iscove (''She's All That'') appears to have
stumbled on a cynical strategy for cliches and situations: If you
haven't seen it, it's new to you. So Iscove and screenwriters
Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller (billed, absurdly, as ``The
Drews'') shoplift from any number of sources that might not be
familiar to their target audience. We get earnest, wide-eyed and
idealistic conversations (name your favorite mid-'60s teen flick),
a Berkeley setting (''The Graduate''), a park scene in which Ryan
and Jennifer make up identities for the people they see (''Annie
Hall''), and, of course, the ``Harry Met Sally'' riffs. Iscove even
rips off himself, repeating the choreographed prom dance from his
``She's All That'' with a choreographed club sequence that seems to
have been inspired by Gap commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It's all just such a waste. Prinze and Forlani struggle to be
engaging, but often come off like high-school drama students doing
a series of scenes from ``Friends.'' Jason Biggs, so likable in
``American Pie,'' barely escapes being grating as Ryan's lecherous
roommate who doesn't know how to _ gasp _ ``be himself.'' Amanda
Detmer, as Jennifer's flaky roommate, is subject to the confused
whims of the screenwriters _ she shares a moment with Forlani that
could have been turned into a crucial and interesting plot twist
but is never pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Alyson Hannigan, who steals scenes on TV's ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' and had the ``money'' line in ``American Pie,'' is in the
movie so briefly, it's a wonder she accepted credit. ``The Blair
Witch Project's'' Heather Donahue shows hints of energy as Ryan's
no-nonsense girlfriend, but it's a minor role.
</P>
<P>
   The most stupefying thing about ``Boys and Girls,'' however,
comes at the end, in a closing-credit sequence involving Biggs,
four Victoria's Secret models and flatulence. It doesn't have a
thing to do with the rest of the movie, and its tone is so much
more crass than the irony-free story that preceded it, its
grossness is jarring. It's as if the filmmakers, having thought
they had already reached the lowest common denominator, discovered
an even ``lower'' one, and had to take advantage of it. Somebody
stop them before they find something even lower.

<P>
   Starts today, (Disney Channel, 4 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? A documentary/adventure series that offers an
up-close-and-personal look at young circus performers. Get a load
of those grueling rehearsals and stress-relieving pillow fights!
Think ``Making the Band''_ kiddie style.
</P>
<P>
   Will it fizzle or sizzle? We all know how miserably ``Making the
Band'' tanked.

places as London and Scotland. The catch? They're whisked away on
the spot. Mark Curry (''Hangin' with Mr. Cooper'') hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Will it sizzle or fizzle? Don't expect a ``Who Wants To Be A

   ``Don't Quote Me''

``Pop Up Video'' mold. Words from and about the artists are
superimposed while the videos play. Expect fun to be poked at
Cher's plastic surgery, Elton John's drama queen attitude and
Jennifer Lopez's legendary posterior.
</P>
<P>
   Will it sizzle or fizzle? Hey, we like making fun of Lopez's
rear, too. ``Don't Quote Me'' should amuse and delight. But don't
expect it to last much longer than your average music video.

   What's it about? An animated comedy that's loosely based on
David Spade's unusual relationship with his absentee, philandering
father.
</P>
<P>
   Will it sizzle or fizzle? ``Sammy'' has great comedic voice
talents in Spade, Andy Dick (''NewsRadio'') and Janeane Garofalo
(''The Larry Sanders Show''), but if NBC had high hopes for the
series, it wouldn't have dumped it in that network TV graveyard
called July.

(For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By ALEX WITCHEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By my watch, it took six minutes from the time I
entered Molly Jong-Fast's book party at the Harmonie Club for sour
grapes to sprout. A young man, bound for law school, announced that
he would rather publish a novel, too. ``If it were this easy for
me, I would write,'' he said churlishly, taking in the
photographers snapping shots of Jong-Fast with her mother, the
novelist Erica Jong, hovering and smiling nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Now, now, boys and girls, play nice. Having a famous mommy, a
famous daddy (novelist Jonathan Fast) and a famous grandpa
(novelist Howard Fast) doesn't mean it's always rosy for the
offspring. As Jong-Fast writes in her first novel, ``Normal Girl,''
(Villard), ``The children of famous people are a bit like
Communism, better in concept than in practice.'' But in our
celebrity worshiping culture, not to mention this
attention-grubbing city, envy is stuck on automatic pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Normal Girl'' has been published at the author's tender
age of 21. While that is a rather stunning achievement, it seems
somehow in keeping with the fact that Jong-Fast has lived much of
her brief life in fast forward. Her parents were divorced when she
was four, and she and her mother moved to Manhattan from
Connecticut. Jong-Fast went to the Dalton School until she was
asked to leave in the third grade, after testing dyslexic. She
transferred to the Day School where her academic life improved, but
by the time she was 13, she was close to 200 pounds and bulimic. At
16, she was drinking three vodka martinis at a clip, and after
graduating from the Riverdale School, she shot through stints at
Wesleyan, Barnard and New York University, supplementing her
cocktail of choice with cocaine and valium. By 19, she was at the
Hazelden drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
   Her novel, unsurprisingly, is about a seen-it-all girl who ends
up in rehab. ``It's such a cliche, it's gross,'' Jong-Fast groaned
a few days after the party. She was seated at an outside table at
the Barking Dog Luncheonette here, even though the temperature was
in the 90s. She wanted to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I weren't me, I would hate me, too,'' she went on
agreeably, lighting up. ``I know the perception is I'm this
princess who gets advantages and is so privileged. I had a really
hard time making the character in my book sympathetic. Children in
Sarajevo are sympathetic already. Rich Jewish kids from the Upper
East Side aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a coming-of-age story, ``Normal Girl'' is the
latest entry in the fast-lane, club-kids genre that has included
``Bright Lights, Big City,'' ``Story of My Life'' and ``Slaves of
New York.'' Jong-Fast sums up contemporary New York City when she
writes, ``Nothing ever really changes ... Maybe disco has become
techno, promiscuous sex has morphed into cautious promiscuous sex
and cell phones have replaced religion as the opiate of the masses,
but our relentless obsession with The Next Big Thing-ism (TNBT-ism)
remains the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony that Jong-Fast's book is being pushed as TNBT does not
escape her. Neither does the fact that people assume the novel's
heroine _ who takes heroin _ is the author herself. Her book's
title is satirical; ``Everybody thinks their reality is normal,''
she said, even teen-agers who call funerals ``the cotillions of the
'90s'' and wear Prada boots in summer. Sober and drug-free for
almost three years, she is looking to define a different
``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she is forsaking what she calls the ``Madison
Avenue Mafia,'' a group that she describes in her book as having
one guiding principle: ``No matter how large the nose or how bad
the birthmark, whatever it is, it'll look better waxed, tweezed,
trained, starved and squeezed into a miniskirt.''
</P>
<P>
   So, she continues to teeter between childhood and adulthood,
celebrity and privacy. For starters, this supposedly hard-partying
girl lives in the same Upper East Side high rise as her mother and
stepfather, Ken Burrows. ``The shtetl mentality,'' she said wryly.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of her many contradictions. Jong-Fast walks with a
confident stride while simultaneously ducking her head, almost in
apology, which turns the overall effect into something of a
reluctant lope. She approached the podium at her book party
muttering, ``I'm going to trip,'' but instead she took the mike,
dithered just enough to seem like a kid, then saved herself
gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   In her lunchtime conversation, she makes wise statements about
her feelings, then giggles and calls herself silly. She claims her
childhood ambition was to be a junkie. ``My yearbook quote was
``Dream: Coke. Reality: Diet Coke,'' she said. ``I grew up reading
`Less Than Zero,' and I thought taking drugs was so glamorous. It's
something the New York media still perpetuates, with all those
stories about clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she find it glamorous? ``It was expensive, and I was really
sick all the time and always in a bad mood,'' she said. ``And I had
nose bleeds 24 hours a day. I always felt I was missing things
before, a better party, some list, some club. Now, I want to miss
everything. I read about it in the Post and feel happy I wasn't
there. I think growing up here you get an inflated idea of how
important you are. When I was at Hazelden, no one knew anything
about me or who Erica Jong was. It wasn't important. I realized the
world is much bigger than New York City. All this stuff doesn't
mean anything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   A strong wind scattered cigarette ashes over the table. ``It's
going to be appealing to eat here,'' Jong-Fast said, suddenly
self-conscious, trying to brush them off. She made rapid small talk
about her dog, eager to be liked. Though her painstakingly made-up
face stayed composed, her chest stained pink with anxiety under her
V-neck dress.
</P>
<P>
   She left NYU when she started writing ``Normal Girl'' at 19,
which went through many revisions. ``My editor, Mollie Doyle, was
tough on me,'' she said. ``I needed someone to tell me to stop it.
I was so profound, writing about the meaning of life. She told me
to write like I speak. I'm happy with it now. It feels like me.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was well-received in London; early reviews here have
been mixed. ``None of the reviews were as bad as the ones I wrote
in my head,'' she said. ``The important thing was that I was able
to find my own voice and be my own person. I got to it by doing
what my parents had done, but I got to it. I'm very clear on the
fact that I'm not my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did grow up with a lot of pressure,'' she continued.
``In my family, the only way to get attention was to talk with them
about what they wanted to talk about. They were obsessed with
publishers, editors, agents. Everyone in my family was so
accomplished, I was sort of afraid to do anything. I'd lose by
default. I realize now it's OK to do something and not do it
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that she has not read her mother's books. ``I grew up
idolizing her,'' she said. ``She always seemed so exciting. She
would sweep into the house with duty-free presents wearing
good-looking clothing, speaking Italian, and she was so beautiful.
Last year, my stepfather had a heart aneurysm, and I got to see my
mother as a real human being with doubts and failures. It was
amazing. I realized she was weak and intrinsically flawed. I hadn't
wanted to see that before.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled tentatively, and you could suddenly see the oddity of
being the child of celebrity: All children grow up idolizing their
parents, but with a famous person, everyone else joins in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a choice of normal parents and a two-car garage, no,
I wouldn't have wanted it,'' she said. ``I wouldn't have been able
to suspend disbelief to write a novel, if I hadn't grown up this
way. It made me who I was. Yes, I did a lot of weird stuff. I was
impossible. But I got to live two lives in one lifetime. When I
wrote the book, I interviewed heroin and crack addicts, because I'm
not as brave as my character. I would be at an after hours club,
thinking I'm so cool with my emergency $20 in the bottom of my
handbag.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jong-Fast said she might go back to school, she is
currently writing a collection of satirical essays about dating in
New York. ``The best part of the whole book thing is my parents
being so blown away by me,'' she said happily.
</P>
<P>
   Jong, reached by phone, said she was impressed by her daughter's
willingness to compete in her world, because she had avoided a
similar situation herself. ``My mother and grandfather were both
painters,'' she said, ``and I ran away from it, because I didn't
want to compete with them and the family racket. I hadn't the guts
to take my mother on directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, apparently, learned different lessons. ``I know my
mom supports me,'' Jong-Fast said, smiling. ``And I know I can
always use her for material.''

NOW PLAYING AT A THEATER NEAR YOU: HOT SUMMER SOUNDTRACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 29 years old, it's got that great wah-wah guitar opening
and those women telling you to shut your mouth, and it's shaping up
as one of the summer's biggest hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theme From Shaft.'' Can you dig it?
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Hayes' 1971 song about private detective/superstud John
Shaft _ the guy who's a sex machine to all the chicks _ defined
hot-buttered soul, won Hayes an Oscar for Best Film Song, was later
sung by Bart Simpson, and linked soul music and film in a way that
had never been done before.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 edition of ``Shaft,'' which features the theme song
again as well as new music by soulsters R. Kelly and Angie Stone,
and rappers Big Gipp and Mystikal, looks to be one of the breakaway
soundtrack hits in a summer when they'll be as common as sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   From the hard-rock-stuffed ``M:I-2'' collection to the odd and
sometimes wonderful companion to the new Jim Carrey film ``Me,
Myself &AMP; Irene'' to an upcoming Elvis Presley package, soundtracks
are going to figure into the summer music landscape as much as, or
more than, ever.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five of the biggies, and whether they're worth your
time and money:
</P>
<P>
   ``Music From and Inspired by Shaft''_ Sometimes stirring,
sometimes downright awful, this collection is a deeply
schizophrenic stab at being all things to all R&AMP;B fans, from those
who are up on the latest hip-hop to veteran and newbie fans of
retro-soul. The remake of the theme song is virtually a remake of
the original, and Chicago's R. Kelly scores early with two more
throwback songs, the playa anthem ``Bad Man'' and the
I-miss-you-babyisms of ``Up and Outta Here.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, though, this is a mixed bag: Newcomers Carl Thomas
and Angie Stone do well with ``Summer Rain'' and ``My Lovin' Will
Give You Something,'' both of which reek of '70s production
touches.
</P>
<P>
   But the CD is also clogged with horrible _ and sometimes
horribly misogynistic _ rap by the likes of Too $hort and the
all-but-talentless Mystikal. Somehow I can't imagine John Shaft
(then or now) listening to this stuff; the way I figure it, he's a
Stevie Wonder/Donnie Hathaway/Al Green guy all the way. The
soundtrack has broad cross-generational appeal and will sell very
well _ look for the theme song and ``Bad Man'' to bust out.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas ``Shaft'' starts out strong, ``Music From and Inspired y
M:I-2'' almost implodes from the outset. Limp Bizkit's hard-rock
recasting of Lalo Schifrin's famous theme melody is horrible _ and
the Foo Fighters/Brian May butchering of Pink Floyd's ``Have a
Cigar'' is not much better.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's pro-forma ``I Disappear'' has already become an
across-the-board rock hit, and in this mediocre company it actually
impresses as one of the CD's better tracks, as does Rob Zombie's
barreling ``Scum of the Earth.'' And when Rob Zombie is among the
best things on a CD, you know there are problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Farrelly brothers' Jim Carrey vehicle ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene''
has gotten advance press as one of the summer's most interesting
blockbusters-to-be, and the soundtrack follows suit _ to a point.
</P>
<P>
   The film's musical consultants are Walter Becker and Donald
Fagen, which may well explain why eight of the CD's 15 tracks are
young bands covering Steely Dan chestnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Wilco lovingly and faithfully eases through ``Any Major Dude
Will Tell You,'' Brian Setzer adds some rockabilly guitar licks to
an otherwise faithful cover of ``Bodhisattva,'' Marvelous 3 adds
hard-rock punch to ``Reelin' in the Years'' (I was skeptical but
this works, trust me) and Ben Folds Five treats the wistful
``Barrytown'' with respect. Play these, and skip over Smash Mouth's
awful take on ``Do It Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Can any summer be complete without a new Elvis collection? On
July 21, RCA Records re-releases the soundtrack to his 1970s
concert film ``Elvis _ That's the Way It Is.'' The original
12-track LP fared poorly on the charts and with critics; this
version is 66 tracks spread across three CDs, all drawn from his
comeback period when he ruled Las Vegas and played to more than
80,000 people in Houston in 1970. The second CD is a complete Vegas
show in August 1970; only two of the tracks have been previously
released.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, we turn to television and the disco-friendly
soundtrack to ``Sex in the City.'' Tom Jones' ``Sexbomb'' and Bette
Midler's ``Love TKO'' are winners, as is Trisha Yearwood's spare,
pretty ballad ``For Only You,'' but there are also some
yawn-inducing dance tracks interspersed with the good stuff.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their names won't appear on the November ballot.
Their views on hot-button issues won't be grist for 30-second
campaign ads. And their visions for the future won't be the focus
of televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Supreme Court appointees are the focus of a
fierce battle between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The two don't agree on much these days. But they do agree that
the winner of their struggle may have a rare opportunity to appoint
as many as four new high court justices to replace those who are
expected to step down over the next four years because of age or
ill health.
</P>
<P>
   A first-term president has not been able to shape the Supreme
Court in such a way since Richard Nixon appointed four justices at
the outset of the 1970s and Herbert Hoover named three in the early
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes have rarely been greater, says Douglas Kmiec, a
constitutional law professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the Supreme Court is a major _ maybe the
most important _ prize in the presidential election,'' says Kmiec.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the court's nine justices were appointed by
Republicans. President Clinton named the other two _ Stephen Breyer
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first appointments by a Democrat since
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Except for William Henry Harrison, Andrew Johnson and Jimmy
Carter _ none of whom filled a high court vacancy _ the nation's 42
presidents have appointed 108 justices.
</P>
<P>
   In its next term, starting Oct. 2, the court is expected to
grapple with issues that could affect the daily lives of all
Americans _ school choice, prayer, affirmative action, sex
discrimination, police powers, abortion rights, the death penalty
and the legislative powers of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Court scholars speculate that one or more of the following could
retire fairly soon: John Paul Stevens, 80, appointed by Gerald
Ford; Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 75, nominated by Richard
Nixon and elevated by Ronald Reagan; Sandra Day O'Connor, 70, named
by Reagan, and Ginsburg, 67, appointed by Clinton. O'Connor and
Ginsburg are both cancer survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars say the new president could be dealing with far
more than the selection of individuals to fill those vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Bush could augment the narrow 5-to-4 conservative
majority that has coalesced around certain issues since Clarence
Thomas' appointment in 1991 and possibly create an iron-clad
conservative majority that could steer the court for decades.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore victory could give Democrats a chance to temper the
conservative bent of the high court. David Garrow, a law professor
at Emory University in Atlanta, says, ``With just one nominee, Gore
could immediately turn the court to the left.'' But he would need
more appointments to completely reverse the court's current
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins, his imprint on the Supreme Court could last for
years.
</P>
<P>
   High bench appointees often serve in their guaranteed-for-life
posts well beyond the term of the president who named them.
Stevens, for instance, has served through the terms of four
presidents since his 1975 appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The next president's influence could also endure longer thanks
to the languid pace of constitutional challenges that work their
way through other courts before reaching the so-called Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken more than 60 years, for example, for a 5-to-4
conservative majority to emerge on the court to reverse a number of
rulings of the 1930s that expanded Congress' authority to protect
civil rights and to regulate commerce-related activities within
states.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the high court's 1960s-era restrictions on police
powers, advanced by then-Chief Justice Earl Warren, are only now
coming before the current court for another look.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, each candidate or his surrogates are
raising the specter of his rival's prospective court appointments
to rally concerned voters to turn out for the November balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson warns that a Gore
victory would lead to the appointment of justices who would
``undermine the Constitution of our country and not defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore voices alarms that abortion rights could end under Bush,
who favors steps to outlaw the procedure with exceptions only for
rape, incest and saving the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court is at stake,'' Gore warned on March 7. Since
then he charged that many ``individual rights and civil rights are
going to be at risk if the Republican Party controls the majority
on the Supreme Court for the next 30 or 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the political fireworks, Bush and Gore are carefully
giving themselves leeway when they outline the types of justices
they would nominate for confirmation by two thirds of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates reject any ``litmus tests'' demanded by some
interest groups on abortion. Bush refuses to promise to appoint
only anti-abortion jurists despite pressure from conservatives such
as Gary Bauer, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will appoint judges who strictly interpret the Constitution
and who will not use the bench to legislate,'' is all Bush will
say, echoing campaign language that Reagan used successfully in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas governor, Bush has appointed 106 state judges including
four of the nine state Supreme Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is equally circumspect, saying, ``There are ways to find
out the kind of judgment somebody has without posing a specific
litmus test.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president says only that he will seek appointees who
``understand and reflect in their decisions the philosophy that our
Constitution is a living and breathing document.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The professed flexibility by both candidates follows tradition
among presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1988 presidential campaign, for example, then-Vice
President George Bush _ father of the Texas governor _ outlined
judicial criteria so inclusive that one of his subsequent
appointees, Thomas, turned out to be a staunch conservative, and
the other, David Souter, a pragmatic moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' addition to the court cemented a conservative majority
of himself, Rehnquist, O'Connor and Reagan appointees Anthony
Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, who have joined forces on certain
issues.
</P>
<P>
   They have been the five in 5-4 decisions that limited racial
preferences in federal contracting; ended the use of race as the
predominant factor in redrawing congressional districts; rejected
Congress' attempt to allow victims of gender-motivated crimes to
sue their attackers in federal courts, and allowed police to stop
and search citizens merely for running away when the officers
approached them.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Bush in 1988 decried what he called the ``excessive
judicial activism'' of the 1960s and 1970s, but he vowed merely to
``appoint moderate persons of conservative views.''
</P>
<P>
   Such vagueness appears to satisfy most Americans. A January poll
showed that 61 percent of 1,010 adults questioned said a
prospective Supreme Court nominee's views on abortion ought to be
just ``one of many considerations'' in the selection process. Only
8 percent said those views ought to be the ``single most important
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no matter what selection criteria a candidate touts
during the campaign, subsequent appointees rarely stick to the
expected script once they're on the court. Three Supreme Court
justices chosen by Republican presidents never publicly expressed
their views on abortion until they were confronted with an appeal
in 1992. In that case, all three _ O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter _
rejected a request to overturn the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade
decision that legalized the procedure.

&HT;     HOW TO USE ITALIAN FRYING PEPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As much as I hate to admit it, I didn't know what
``Italian frying peppers'' were when I moved to the Capital Region
a year and a half ago. I saw them listed as an ingredient in a
recipe sent to me by ``retired'' area chef Ken Linden and had to
claim ignorance. I couldn't find them on the Web, or in cookbooks
or even a book titled ``Peppers, Peppers, Peppers,'' by Marlena
Spieler (Firefly, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know an Italian frying pepper?'' e-mailed Linden in
reply. ``Yes, you do. In the produce department, you have probably
seen long, pointed, slim pale green peppers, that are usually more
expensive than the bull-nosed short and squat dark green bell
peppers. Those are known to me and usually signed in the produce
department as `Italian frying peppers.' They are wonderfully sweet,
much thinner skinned than the ordinary green peppers, and do `fry'
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was January and Linden's Italian frying peppers were not
to be found. ``They're a summer item around here,'' Anthony
Battaglia at California Produce told me. ``You'll know them when
you see them.''
</P>
<P>
   And just recently I started to see them, stacked in the produce
department of area supermarkets with the red and green bells, the
jalapenos and such. And I did know them -- as CUBANELLES.
</P>
<P>
   Not to take anything away from Italy, but part of the world
named these sweet pointed peppers after Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing: As with all peppers, look for those with firm, shiny
and smooth-skinned. Avoid wrinkly peppers. Peppers that are too
dark for their particular variety may be slightly immature, writes
Spieler.
</P>
<P>
   Storing: Peppers are one of the few vegetables that can be
frozen without being blanched, according to the ``Joy of Cooking.''
Simply stem and seed and cut to the desired size. Pack in freezer
bags and store.

 &HT;    Summer TV shows worth a look
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   ``Strip Mall''
</P>
<P>
   Starts Sunday,
</P>
<P>
   (Comedy Central, 10:30 p.m)
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? Lust! Greed! Porn! That about sums up what goes
on in a seedy San Fernando Valley strip mall and in this
delightfully dopey soap satire. Julie Brown (''Earth Girls Are
Easy'') stars as Tammi Tyler, a daffy former child star (she knifed
her Captain Kangaroo-like co-star to death after eating a cupcake
laced with PCP) who now works as a barmaid at a tacky bar. The
sight gags should make you scream. See an X-rated ``Titanic'' See a
still loopy Victoria Jackson! See a woman make love. . . to a taco!
</P>
<P>
   Will it sizzle or fizzle? Crude, crass, sexist and scathingly
funny. Could be Comedy Central's next ``South Park''-like hit.
</P>
<P>
   Our buzz rating: 4 suns
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul Food''
</P>
<P>
   Starts June 28,
</P>
<P>
   (Showtime, 10 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? If you saw the hit 1997 movie, you have a good
idea. The series follows the struggles and triumphs of a close-knit
black family in Chicago. You know, stuff like sick babies, house
leaks, nasty lawsuits, taboo romances. Oh, yeah, they also eat a
lot. And in ``Sex and the City'' fashion, they have a lot of sex,
too. Out are such big-name stars as Vivica A. Fox, Vanessa L.
Williams and Nia Long. In are such low-rent actors as Nicole Ari
Parker, Malinda Williams and the other Vanessa Williams _ the one
from ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it sizzle or fizzle? Hey, the film grossed an impressive
$43 million. I'd bet a month's paycheck that many of those same
people get Showtime. Black audiences should make this show a hit.
It's certainly several notches better than the dreadfully dull
``Linc's.''
</P>
<P>
   Our buzz rating: 3 1/2 suns
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother''
</P>
<P>
   Starts July 5 (WPEC-Channel 12, 9 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? Ten people who never met live together for 100
days in an 1,800-square-foot house rigged with 24 cameras, 60
microphones and, let's hope, zero rats.
</P>
<P>
   Will it sizzle or fizzle? Unfortunately, viewers' appetite for
in-your-face reality TV appears insatiable. ``Big Brother'' should
satisfy that ever-growing hunger. But something tells me this isn't
what George Orwell had in mind when he wrote ``1984.''
</P>
<P>
   Our buzz rating: Four suns
</P>
<P>
   ``Spy Groove''
</P>
<P>
   Starts June 26,
</P>
<P>
   (MTV, 10:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   What's it about? Two super-cool, designer-clad secret agents
travel the globe to rid the world of stylish villains, fashionable
impostors and vanity junkies. In other words, they fight bad style.
They prowl such hot spots as Miami Beach and Beverly Hills in a
lime green (!) convertible that sports ``We R Spies'' tags. The
``Dr. No''-type bad guys include Mr. Fish, who looks like a badly
drawn Don Knotts, and some guy named Rock Debris.
</P>
<P>
   Will it sizzle or fizzle? A visually arresting animated series
(bold technicolors, rapidly changing backdrops), but lacks true
comic punch.
</P>
<P>
   Our buzz rating: 2 suns

 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Former television director Robert Iscove is at
it again. The maker of ``She's All That'' returns with ``Boys and
Girls,'' and he's brought with him the redoubtable Freddie Prinze
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that if Iscove is going to go down in a whoosh of
flames he's determined to take Prinze with him, and after ``Wing
Commander,'' ``Down To You'' and now this, I think I speak for
thousands of Teen People subscribers when I say ``into the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, Prinze has an unfathomable capacity for humiliation
and the remarkable curse of never being believable as a happy
person. Sounds like a reason for a couch trip, not another
young-bucks-in-love romance. But here he is starring in ``Boys and
Girls'' anyway, as though he'd made a pact with Satan, or, even
better, Harvey and Bob Weinstein: ``Please get me that ALMA award
for Outstanding Actor in a Feature Film in a Crossover Role, and
I'll do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Boys and Girls,'' Prinze plays Ryan, a
structural-engineering major, harangued into friendship by a chatty
Latin major named Jennifer (Claire Forlani). Together they walk
around San Francisco and the campus of the University of California
at Berkeley saying things about love and relationships that stars
you respect couldn't make sound believable.
</P>
<P>
   They spend four years, and too much of our time, almost hooking
up. Once they do, we don't get Freddie-Forlani sex. We get a pan up
to the constellation glo-stars on her ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   There are episodes of ``Rugrats'' with stronger sexual suspense
_ and better ideas of what to do with carnality: Jennifer's
roommate Sarah (Amanda Detmer) plants one on her. It was nothing.
She's eventually paired off with ``American Pie's'' Jason Biggs,
who plays Ryan's roommate. He's having his own identity crisis
evinced by the ever-changing frosting in his hair that looks like a
variety pack of Pop Tarts died on his quills.
</P>
<P>
   As the film's overseer, Iscove desperately beats a horse so dead
he shuttles the film's two platonic lovers off to a John Hughes
double feature. It's the ``I could have had a V-8 instead'' moment
of the year.

SOUTH KOREA'S KIM SAYS DANGER OF WAR IS GONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., will be updated later if needed) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The propaganda war in the DMZ fell silent
on Friday for the first time at least 50 years and South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung declared that ``the danger of war on the
Korean peninsula has disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking move just a day after talks between North and
South Korea ended in Pyongyang, the South ordered an end to
anti-communist broadcasts that its military has transmitted for
decades from giant loudspeakers along the heavily fortified border
with North Korea. The move came in response to North Korea's
decision on Tuesday to switch off its loud speakers that had
blasted anti-South insults over the border through the years.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to end the broadcasts was just one of several
symbolic steps the two nations made on Friday intended to signal
that their half-century of hostilities were indeed coming to an end
and to dispel skeptics who question whether the summit meeting will
lead to peace on the divided Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, North Korea allowed a South Korean fishing boat
that had strayed across its heavily patrolled sea border to sail
back to its home port without incident on Friday. A year ago this
week, North and South Korean naval vessels exchanged gun fire over
fishing rights in the same area. One North Korean warship sank and
about 30 communist sailors were believed to have died.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's defense ministry also announced that it would
reconsider how to handle a $40-million program to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25,
1950. The agency had planned numerous parades, ceremonies, battle
re-enactments, and other events that were to be attended by
thousands of veterans and dignitaries, many from the United States.
``We are looking for ways to commemorate the anniversary in
compliance with the spirit of the agreement reached at the
summit,'' a ministry spokesman, Yoon Il-young, said.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim Dae-jung also told his cabinet on Friday that Kim
Jong Il had agreed to his suggestion to invite Pope John Paul II to
visit North Korea. The South Korean president, who is Catholic and
visited the pope in March, said he had instructed the foreign
ministry to convey the wishes of his North Korean counterpart to
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is widely considered to be the world's most
totalitarian society, and organized religion there has long been
suppressed in favor of leader-worship, first for the country's late
founder, Kim Il Sung, and now for his son, Kim Jong Il. Of a
population of 22 million, 4,000 are believed to be Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung instructed his cabinet to implement a wide variety
of reconciliation measures that grew out of the three-day talks,
which concluded in an agreement calling for the two Koreas to
pursue peace, economic and other exchanges. The South Korean
president said that he hoped the efforts would coax Stalinist North
Korea out of its self-imposed isolation and help rebuild its
faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials said they hoped that the two heads of
state could meet again in Seoul on or around the Aug. 15 holiday
that celebrates the anniversary of Koreas liberation from nearly 40
years of Japanese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim also said that he held a 20-minute
telephone conversation with President Clinton on Friday in which he
informed the American leader that he raised North Korea's nuclear
and missile programs in talks with Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that the missile and nuclear problems do not help
regional and world peace as well as inter-Korean cooperation,''
aides to the Korean president quoted him as having told Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of 37,000 American troops in South Korea was also
discussed, Kim Dae-jung told Clinton. The South Korean leader's
position is that the U.S. military presence is needed for regional
security even after the unification of the Korean peninsula. The
aides said that Clinton thanked Kim for raising the North's nuclear
and missile issues, saying that ``those issues are important for
all of us.''

 &HT;    Southern Baptist edict is sexism, not Scripture
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Southern Baptist Convention uses the
Bible to preserve power for men only.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus must weep at such apostasy. Lottie Moon, the equivalent of
a Baptist saint, may be spinning in her grave.
</P>
<P>
   The convention of the largest Protestant denomination in the
world met in Orlando this week for its two-day annual meeting. More
than 11,000 messengers, as delegates are called, adopted a revised
statement of belief that declared the office of pastor was
restricted to men.
</P>
<P>
   The statement insists that is what the Bible teaches, but the
decision seems to be based not so much on Scriptural warrant as on
a lust to keep the levers of power in the hands of men.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus deliberately became powerless to demonstrate the wonder of
God. That foolishness is the power of the Gospel, according to St.
Paul. He declared that weakness was strength for Christians.
Worldly power was an aphrodisiac of the Evil One.
</P>
<P>
   Still, men vigorously reserve to themselves all authority in
Southern Baptist life. They make the decisions. Women can do
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Women have gifts for service to the church, according to the
Baptist Faith and Message statement. But they cannot take a place
in the principal seat of authority in church life.
</P>
<P>
   That sexist conviction does not prevent the church's leadership
from using women to support and pay for their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   They make no apology for collecting from the faithful more than
$100 million a year for missionary work in the name of Lottie Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Moon became a foreign missionary for the Southern
Baptist Convention in 1873. She served in China for 40 years. She
founded a school, preached the Gospel, introduced Jesus to
countless Chinese and taught the Bible with such grace and
consistency that she became known as ``the Heavenly Book Visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   During a time of famine, she pleaded with the male hierarchy of
the church in the States to send relief. They sent excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, not unlike Jesus, embraced the lot of her starving flock
and stopped eating. She died shortly thereafter to become a Baptist
icon for raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions of the Convention are not binding on the 40,000 or
more Southern Baptist churches, but they set the tone for the
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson seems clear. Southern Baptist leaders are drawn
inexorably to the preservation and exercise of power for themselves
_ in defiance of the Gospel they claim to serve.

PUTIN'S VISIT TO GERMANY ENDS ON POSITIVE NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ ``What do you want us to say,'' President Vladimir
Putin of Russia asked Friday after his fourth meeting in three days
with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany, ``that we're in
love?''
</P>
<P>
   He was joking, of course. But there was no mistake that the
summit meeting that ended Friday produced a vigorous rapprochement
between Russia and Germany. Putin seemed entirely serious when he
added, ``Germany is Russia's leading partner in Europe and the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting led to agreements on German investments in Russia
worth $1.7 billion, cautious German backing for a Russian plan to
involve itself in the defense of Europe against missile attack, and
the establishment of an apparently excellent rapport between Putin
and Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two cool cookies and they took to each other,'' said
one Foreign Ministry official who attended several of the meetings.
``Theirs is not the old bear-hugging style'' of the former leaders
Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl, ``but they see eye-to-eye and they
get along.''
</P>
<P>
   This easy understanding is in marked contrast to the sometimes
awkward relationship between Schroeder and President Clinton. But
the official added: ``There is no equidistance in the
German-Russian and German-American relationships. We are intimate
with the United States; with Russia we are still trying to create a
benign and stable power to the east.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sudden closeness of Berlin and Moscow is certain to
cause some concern among Germany's European partners, which are
always worried that Europe's central power may again seek its
fortunes to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Schroeder,
insisted several times Friday that Germany was acting for Europe in
seeking a ``strategic partnership'' with Putin's Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said the Clinton administration favored
all efforts to draw Russia closer to the West, adding that he
doubted that room existed for Russia to drive a wedge between the
United States and its European allies.
</P>
<P>
   But in many respects, Germany appeared closer to Russia than to
the United States on the question of missile defense. Schroeder
said Friday that a proposal by Putin to place Russia at the heart
of a European missile defense system from the Atlantic to the Urals
``deserves thorough consideration and should be discussed both in
the NATO-Russia Council and through bilateral relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor has been much cooler on the U.S. proposal for a
national missile defense system. He has warned that it must not be
allowed to lead to a new arms race or undo existing agreements,
including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 that Clinton
wants Russia to agree to amend.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is proposing the use of ``theater'' anti-missile systems
allowed under the 1972 treaty to shoot down short- and medium-range
missiles that threaten Europe. The United States is deeply
skeptical of both the feasibility and the desirability of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder showed little such skepticism. ``We agree on the
necessity of political measures with regard to arms control in
order to preserve the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, German officials privately hope that Clinton will
avert a decision on the national missile defense system in the
remaining months of the presidency. They say such a decision would
only put Putin in a corner and provoke what one called an
``unnecessary crisis with the alliance partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who speaks good German as a result of his five years in
East Germany as a KGB spy, said Friday that a ``united Europe''
should join a body set up by Russia and the United States to
monitor missile launches around the world and so provide an early
warning system.
</P>
<P>
   Much time in the talks was devoted to economic issues. Germany
is Russia's largest creditor and Putin is looking to German
companies to invest heavily in his country and to provide access to
industrial technology. He spent much of his time here _ described
by one official as a ``charm offensive'' _ trying to convince
executives that Russia could prove a reliable marketplace governed
by the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The mission was partially successful. Wintershall, a German gas
company, agreed to invest about $1 billion in a joint development
of an offshore oil field in the arctic north with Russia's
state-controlled gas company, Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Other investments worth over $700 million were signed by three
other German companies with Gazprom, and Schroeder said about $500
million in new export credits should soon be available.
</P>
<P>
   But little progress was made on a debt-restructuring deal.
Russia has been looking for some forgiveness of its large debt, but
Germany has made clear that this is impossible. ``We have told them
we are not going to treat them like Angola,'' said one official.
``Russia is a potentially rich country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Differences over debt were not allowed to cloud the meeting. The
two leaders strolled together through the Brandenburg Gate to
symbolize the healing of history's wounds in a city that was
battered by Soviet troops when they took Berlin in 1945 and was
long divided after the eastern half fell into the former Soviet
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said that he and his wife Doris had accepted an
invitation to spend Christmas with the Putins in a Kremlin that is
to be equipped with a new hot line to the Berlin Chancellery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed to breathe new life into our relationship,''
the chancellor added. ``That should not be negative for anyone _
not for our European partners and certainly not for our American
friends. When relations are good with Russia, that is good for
Europe.''

 &HT;    MAINTENANCE DECISION ON ALASKA AIRLINES DUE NEXT WEEK
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration will announce
next week whether it will suspend Alaska Airlines' authority to do
heavy maintenance following the January crash of one of its planes,
administrator Jane Garvey said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Alaska Airlines were forced to contract out heavy
maintenance, it could result in service cutbacks and perhaps a
smaller airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety is the heart and soul of the FAA's mission,'' Garvey
said. ``Our first focus is to discover the cause of the Alaska
Airlines crash, and then make sure that this does not happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed into the ocean Jan. 31 about
20 miles northwest of Los Angeles International Airport after
reporting trouble with its stabilizer trim. The reason for the
crash is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said part of the investigation included an internal audit
of Alaska Airlines' flight and maintenance systems by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the facts are not yet in from the crash so there is not a
need to jump to any conclusions,'' Garvey said, ``But we have
serious questions to ask ourselves, and this internal audit may be
a basis for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said she received a full report on June 9 from Alaska
Airlines on why the FAA should not suspend its ability to do heavy
maintenance on their aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey added that the FAA should look at airlines' maintenance
systems for any ways to make improvements. She also said that the
audit of Alaska airlines could lead to audits of other airlines for
precautionary measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not opposed to the audit of airlines because I think it
is good to monitor ourselves as a precaution,'' Garvey said. ``With
these audits we can make improvements to our training, oversight
and maintenance systems, and we can make changes before a tragedy
like Alaska Airlines happens.''

NAGAKO, 97, JAPAN'S DOWAGER EMPRESS AND WIDOW OF HIROHITO 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dowager Empress Nagako of Japan, the 97-year-old widow of
Emperor Hirohito, died Friday after a life that saw the
transformation of her homeland several times over.
</P>
<P>
   ``She passed away because of old age despite strenuous
nursing,'' said Sadame Kamakura, the grand steward of the imperial
household, at a news conference in Tokyo. ``We feel unbearable
grief.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagako spent much of her life insulated deep inside a Japan that
no longer exists. Indeed, she was one of the last Japanese who
could remember life inside the aristocracy early in the 20th
century or in the palace during the time when people spoke an
archaic, imperial form of Japanese that has largely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Born on March 6, 1903, the eldest daughter of a prince, Nagako
was chosen at the age of 14 to be the consort of Hirohito, who was
then the crown prince. They were formally married in 1924 _ their
wedding delayed by the catastrophic Tokyo earthquake of 1923 _ and
just two years later the Emperor Taisho died and Hirohito succeeded
him.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Nagako became wife not just of the emperor but of a
``living god,'' a deity in the Shinto state religion that then
prevailed. It was not initially a love marriage at all, and they
seem to have lived their heavily scripted lives for duty and
responsibility more than for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako's main duty, as most Japanese then saw it, was producing
a son. Under Japanese law, then and now, only a son can inherit the
throne, and there was growing disquiet as she produced four
daughters in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials are said to have arranged elaborate temptations
for Hirohito, in the form of gorgeous young women who might produce
an heir. By the time Nagako became pregnant for the fifth time, in
1933, it was widely expected that Hirohito would formally take
another consort if Nagako's child was again a girl. But then
booming cannon proclaimed to an overjoyed nation that the child was
a boy, today's Emperor Akihito.
</P>
<P>
   For a deity, Emperor Hirohito had relatively little power. Even
day-to-day decisions were made by bossy court officials, and when
Akihito was 3 years old he was taken away from his parents and
raised by attendants who treated him with more veneration than
warmth. He seems to have had a painfully lonely childhood, but
Nagako never complained publicly about the separation.
</P>
<P>
   The emperor was used by Japan's military rulers as a rallying
symbol during World War II, and he periodically appeared in a
military uniform on a white horse, making comments like, ``Your
life is as light as a feather, but your loyalty is as heavy as a
mountain.'' There has been a debate about the degree to which he
bore responsibility for the war fought in his name, and even less
is known about Nagako's views of the war or of the militarism of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako once described the war years as ``the hardest time of my
life,'' and there was uncertainty afterward whether the Americans
would execute Hirohito or at least force him to abdicate. But
instead, the United States decided to pin the blame for the war on
Japan's other leaders, like Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, and
Hirohito was allowed to remain emperor as long as he repudiated his
divinity.
</P>
<P>
   Japan was changing, and Nagako tried to change as well. When the
Palace arranged for an American woman to teach Akihito English,
Nagako asked for lessons as well.
</P>
<P>
   But she often came across as a remnant of a different era.
Akihito fell in love with a brilliant and beautiful young college
woman, the present Empress Michiko, but traditionalists were
horrified because Michiko had entered a Catholic college (although
she was not Christian) and because it would be the first time a
crown prince had ever married a commoner. It is not clear whether
Nagako was among those who disapproved of the marriage, but it is
known that her relations with Michiko were strained.
</P>
<P>
   Michiko was criticized for carrying her babies in public, for
breastfeeding them and for trying to raise and shape her children
herself. It seems that Nagako took the traditional side in these
quarrels; a senior chamberlain recalls, in a published memoir,
Michiko plaintively asking why her mother-in-law disliked her.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Michiko regarded her chief lady-in-waiting as a spy
for Nagako, and together Akihito and Michiko tried to dismiss the
servant. The Imperial Household Agency did not allow this.
</P>
<P>
   These intrigues took an enormous toll on Michiko, who became
gaunt and possibly suffered nervous breakdowns in 1963 and again in
1993. Empress Michiko is still a beautiful and intelligent woman,
but she is said to be only a shadow of the confident young college
student she once was.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako was a talented artist, and three collections of her
paintings have been published. She was a good singer as well as
proficient in the piano, violin and Japanese harp, or koto.
</P>
<P>
   Hirohito died in 1989, but even then Nagako was regarded as too
feeble to attend his funeral. And since then she has remained out
of the public eye, living quietly in a modest home in the Imperial
Palace grounds in Tokyo. She has not been shown in public since a
1993 video that showed her in a wheelchair beside a window.
</P>
<P>
   The Imperial Household Agency, never known for its candor, said
Thursday that Nagako was suffering breathing problems but that her
illness was ``not serious.'' The next day, with Akihito and Michiko
at her side, she died.

A DAD WHO DOESN'T WANT TO LOOK HIS AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By DAVID EDDIE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it my imagination, or do the kids in the hip-hop shops and
skateboard stores look at me funny when I _ pushing 40 and
sometimes a stroller _ roll in?
</P>
<P>
   What does that geezer want?
</P>
<P>
   That's the look on the face of the youthful clerk as he sidles
up to where I'm poking through racks of rave wear and baggy rap
slacks, and says, ``Um, you realize those pants are quite full cut,
don't you, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes,'' I respond testily. ``All the Alien Workshop stuff
is like that, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   I like to think I win them over by my knowledgeability and
expertise. Then I'll try on the pants, twisting and turning in
front of the three-way mirror as my 3-year-old, Nicholas, stares
from the stroller, sucking on his pacifier, with an expression on
his face that says, ``Dad, don't you realize it's just not about
you anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm mutton dressed as lamb, I admit it. A man of a certain age
consciously and determinedly dressing like a much younger person. I
wear huge, baggy jeans. My question for a prospective pair of pants
is always, ``Would these look good running from the police in a DMX
video?'' I try never to leave the house with fewer than three
products in my (thinning, graying) hair, usually including Knotty
Boy Dread Wax, a mixture of beeswax and hemp oil designed to bestow
short-term dreads. (``If you like it nappy, Knotty Boy will make
you happy.'')
</P>
<P>
   My footwear ranges from the impractical to the improbable, and
when I die I want them not only to say, ``He died with his boots
on,'' but also, ``Wonder where he got them?''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be a rebel at 19, or 29. But at 39, it's a
challenge. Epictetus tells us, ``First decide who you are and adorn
yourself accordingly.'' Perhaps I'm a bit confused on that score.
I'm no longer the Raskolnikovian punk I once imagined myself,
living above a rattan furniture store in a sketchy part of town,
doomed to a lifetime of penury and outsider status. Born to rent.
</P>
<P>
   I styled myself an eternal, tragic bachelor _ until the right
woman came along and choppered me out of a life of mice-filled
sinks and rendered me a homeowner and a father. Now I stay at home
with my two kids. I look after them in the afternoons. I said
bonjour to the bourgeoisie some time ago, and I've been in that
milieu ever since. I recently surprised every acquaintance, and
myself, by actually getting involved in my community, going to
meetings, thumping my fist on the table on behalf of two beautiful
old Japanese maple trees in the park across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as much as I have embraced the joys of do-gooding dadhood,
there is a part of me that is doggedly in denial. Perhaps my life,
now, is more about errands than I'd like to admit. I wake up
thinking about what to make for dinner. I have found myself
screaming at my kids, ``Please, please, I beg you to let me finish
mopping the floor.'' The highlight of some days is the purchase of
broccoli (I can feel my pulse race just thinking about it).
</P>
<P>
   But does that mean I have to look like a guy who gets excited
about grocery shopping and housecleaning? Just because I'm a dad,
does that mean I have to wear pleated khaki shorts and a fanny
pack? I like to think something of the old flame, the old steel, is
there still. In my breast beats the heart of a punk and underground
man, although what kind I'm not so sure anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I have noticed that many punks in my neighborhood are associated
with some sort of transportation: we have car punks, bike punks.
I've even seen a couple of scooter punks tooling around. So that
makes me a stroller punk, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 5, with a goatee, army pants, skateboard shoes and
spiked, sometimes dyed hair, I'm nothing like the other parents at
the PTA meetings, in their urban-camper gear, baseball caps and
sensible shoes. Smoking, reading a hardback, wearing shades, I
stand out like a sick frog at the park among the mommies, nannies
and grannies, some of whom knit. When I was a teen-ager, adults
were suspicious of me. Now everyone is.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I went toe-to-toe with a girl, 17, in a vegetable
store. I'd left the stroller (in full view) just outside the door
when I went in to grab a couple of items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you read the papers?'' she screamed at me. ``I could
have snatched your kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She then offered a number of suggestions on how I could improve
my parenting techniques. Part of me was awash in respect for her
for taking on such a huge, unpredictable-looking character, a total
stranger, and pushing the hottest of hot buttons, the ``Bad Dad''
button. I had a suggestion for her, that she mind her business,
which she actually wound up taking.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not the only unconventional dad. My friend Daniel
Richler, for example, who is 43 and a well-respected writer,
television producer and television host, has not relinquished his
Goth style in the name of fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to express his inner vampire in his clothes _ black
T-shirts and leather jackets (not too brunchy) _ and in his house.
Up the sleepy striver's row from mine, he and his wife and daughter
live in an Addams Family mansion with dark purple walls, heavy
velvet curtains blocking out the sunlight, first editions,
devil-mouth ashtrays and old absinthe ads.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how all this will affect our kids. I think it will
be good for them to see their parents as free-thinking and
independent. In his otherwise excellent book, ``I'll Be the Parent,
You Be the Kid'' (Random House of Canada, 1998), Paul Kropp writes
that children want parents to be ``dull as dishwater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact they need us dull as dishwater,'' he writes. ``They
want us to drive them in the car, tell the appropriate corny jokes,
nag them about eating beans and otherwise behave like Ward and June
Cleaver. When parents become too interesting, we can overwhelm our
kids and really interfere with their growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   I must respectfully disagree. I had the sort of father Kropp
recommends, of the tweedy, professorial subvariety. We went on
interminable family rides in the car, sometimes straying onto the
gravel as he pointed out various sights of local interest. Other
Saturdays, we organized the basement together, and I fail to see
how any of this was good for me, unless, like Dunbar in
``Catch-22,'' you believe boredom is intrinsically good because it
makes life seem longer.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't see how it could hurt my kids to see me in army
surplus pants. I have to believe it will be good for them to see
that I'm a little unusual. And maybe even inspire them to stand out
from the crowd when they start shopping for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows what kind of Internet sunglasses kids will be
wearing then, or if I'll have the stamina to try to keep up.
Probably not. The truth is, teen-age fashions already change so
fast, it's nerve-racking to try to stay current without looking
ludicrous to our peers or, even worse, be objects of teen-age scorn
and pity. ``We can never hope to survive the basilisk stare of the
teen-ager,'' my friend Daniel says, referring to the mythological
beast that could kill with a single look.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, shopping for clothes is already becoming less fun. Kids
can turn a simple shirt purchase into a hail of negotiations,
tears, frayed nerves. But I guess I can't relinquish my youthful
dandyism yet. ``Elegance and fitness are our last line of defense
against the aging process,'' says my friend Andrew Livingston, who
recently trumped my entire wardrobe when his father-in-law died and
left him a beautiful collection of James Bond-style suits and
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not ready for the next sartorial phase _ the cardigans and
sweater vests, suits and little glasses. I think I'm still of the
age that when I wear these things, it's taken ironically. When the
time comes, I will make the switch suddenly and boldly. As St.
Augustine said, ``Lord, make me good, but not yet.''

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Even you, duffer that you are, might not
have done this before:
</P>
<P>
   Tee shot out of bounds. Tee shot into the water. Tee shot into
the water. Tee shot onto the fairway (at last). Lay up with an
iron, 115 yards short of the green. Pitch into the water. Drop in a
bunker. Flip the club over and hit left-handed, knocking the ball a
few feet. Blast out of the sand. Two-putt.
</P>
<P>
   That's 14, and yes, that was John Daly. Who else? Just a tidy
little 9-over par (what is that, a noctuple bogey?) on the 18th
hole in the first round of the U.S. Open, which also happened to be
the last round for the tumultuous Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Down goes Daly _ again _ yet another sudden implosion in a
career of them.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to last year's Open, when Daly made it through all
four days but let loose with a rip-roaring tirade after shooting a
final-round 83 that included an 11 on the eighth hole at Pinehurst,
Daly went quietly but quickly this time.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring the 14 on 18, he signed his scorecard and then
announced he was withdrawing from the tournament. He had nothing
else to say, marching off to the players' locker room, where he
spent about two minutes before bolting for parts unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Golf Association, which last year absorbed the
brunt of Daly's verbal wrath, released this muted statement: ``It
is always unfortunate when a contestant withdraws prior to
completion of his regulation rounds. We are very sorry that John's
struggles at the end of his round caused him to withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly showed no signs he was in the midst of a two-touchdown
scoring performance at 18, which only added to the torment of the
whole incident Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no temper or anything like that,'' rules official Ed
Gowan said of Daly's deportment during his demise. ``He was totally
in control. He tried all the way through. . . . He played very
well. He had some bad breaks, or he could have easily been under
par.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly was 3-over par as he came to the 18th, all seemingly
forgiven and forgotten from his 1999 U.S. Open melodrama. A year
ago, in a rant about pin placement among other things, Daly vowed
not to come to Pebble and ``watch the USGA ruin that golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   This was after his septuple bogey at the eighth hole, where he
watched not one but two putts roll up a hill and come back his way.
As the second putt made its agonizing trek back toward Daly, he
took a swat at it to earn a two-stroke penalty.
</P>
<P>
   He later implied it was a premeditated act of protest against
the USGA, of which he said, ``They love to embarrass people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, though, Daly wrote a letter of apology to USGA
executive director David Fay. And so there he was Thursday
afternoon _ as the fog began to lay thick over Pebble Beach _ on
the verge of logging a decent opening round. Instead, his first tee
shot sailed wide right and hit a cart path, which launched the ball
over a fence and into someone's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tee shot was very difficult, it was very misty, nobody
could see the fairway really,'' said Retief Goosen, who, along with
Rocco Mediate, was in a group with Daly. ``He got unlucky and hit
the cart path.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, though, Daly didn't know the ball had bounced out of
bounds, and so he made the walk toward where his initial drive was
headed. But he discovered the bad news and had to march all the way
back to the tee box, where he teed the ball back up and launched
his next drive into the water. And then a repeat left him lying
six, still sitting on the tee of the par-5, 543-yard hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't make anything out of it,'' Gowan said of Daly's
decision to quit. ``He's obviously very discouraged and what he's
done doesn't bother me in the least. I'm sure a lot of the fans
would like to see him come back (Friday) and do better, but with
all he's been through, I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Daly has been through a lot and more, from alcohol
rehab stints to a messy divorce, plus various other course blowups.
The Open, in particular, has not been kind to him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, at Congressional, Daly simply walked off the course
halfway through the second round. Then there was '99 and now this.
But this might have been Daly's last Open episode, for better or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's British Open victory in 1995 earned him a five-year
exemption into the U.S. Open _ meaning this was the final year of
his free ride. So to get into next year's field at Southern Hills
in Tulsa, Daly would either have to qualify through his play, or
get a special exemption from his good pals at the USGA.

 &HT;    Shift in public attitude toward death penaltyBy Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former President Bush had Willie Horton.
Soon-to-be-former President Clinton had Ricky Ray Rector.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Bush used the face of a convicted murderer to pummel
his rival, Michael Dukakis, whose anti-death penalty stance cost
him sorely with voters. Four years later, Clinton became the first
presidential candidate to preside over an execution when he flew to
Arkansas to make sure Rector, who was so mentally impaired that he
saved his last dessert ``for later,'' was put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from both major parties have long relied on
emotional images to score points with voters. Suddenly, all that's
changed. With murder rates down as much as 50 percent in big
cities, the death penalty debate has shifted from a morality play
to a scientific and legal lecture. Images of unrepentant killers
have been replaced with charts illustrating the nuances of DNA
testing, tales of incompetent lawyers and the names of wrongly
convicted men set free.
</P>
<P>
   Public support for the ultimate punishment has been softening
for more than a decade and while Americans are not ready to throw
out the death penalty, they are worried. New evidence of wrongful
convictions is intensifying that worry and leading to what the
folks at the Gallup Organization consider a substantial shift in
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe, looking at the data, that we have undergone a
shift from our peak in 1994,'' said Frank Newport, editor-in-chief
of the Gallup Poll. ``It's still high, 66 percent who approve of
the death penalty for murder, but that's down 14 points from 1980.
We study trends for a living and we do think this represents a
significant downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Newport believes that reports of DNA testing exonerating death
row inmates is contributing to the downturn. He offers Gov. George
W. Bush's first-ever decision to grant a 30-day reprieve as
evidence that politicians are aware of shifting public opinion.
Bush granted the reprieve, pending further DNA analysis, to Ricky
McGinn, who was convicted of raping and murdering his 12-year-old
stepdaughter. He also pardoned A.B. Butler _ who was serving two,
concurrent 99 year sentences for a kidnapping and rape _ after DNA
testing proved Butler did not commit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Still, executions have not slowed. Thursday, Paul Nuncio became
the third Texas inmate executed this week and the 22nd this year.
Next week, Gary Graham is scheduled to die by lethal injection in a
case that has drawn national attention because Graham's conviction
rests on the testimony of a sole eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, a death penalty supporter, has been
largely silent during the recent debate. He has said
post-conviction DNA testing should be available in some cases, but
a campaign spokesman said Gore is also concerned that a Senate bill
that would make the testing available to all death row inmates
would place limits on the government's ability to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said politicians can win even
when they disagree with the larger public on an issue as potent as
the death penalty. Cuomo never abandoned his opposition to capital
punishment. Gov. George Pataki beat him in 1994 and promptly signed
the death penalty into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got three terms so nobody could tell me that you couldn't
win,'' Cuomo said. ``The last time I got clobbered because they got
tired of me and so they wouldn't forgive me the death
penalty...Once you make the whole case to people, you can get them
off the death penalty. It's just that politicians don't want to
make the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent Gallup polls show that support for the death penalty
falls to around 52 percent when the possibility of life without
parole is also offered up. And 91 percent believe that an innocent
person has been sentenced to death in the last 20 years. The
question now is not whether Americans are ready to abolish the
death penalty, but how flawed a system they are willing to
tolerate, said Newport and death penalty researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations at Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism and The Chicago Tribune helped trigger the national
debate. The state has released 13 wrongly-convicted death-row
inmates and Republican Gov. George Ryan, who supports the death
penalty, has suspended executions in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   A Columbia University study released Monday found that
two-thirds of the death sentenche debate.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters at the Chicago Tribune raised serious questions about
the quality of legal representation and the use of jailhouse
informants in 106 of the 134 people executed while Bush has been in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, former Texas Court of Appeals Judge Charles Baird told
the Senate Judiciary Committee that the state is in,'' a
crisis....regarding representation in capital crimes.'' Wednesday,
Congressman Ciro D. Rodriguez (D-San Antonio), a death penalty
supporter, wrote to Gov. George W. Bush asking him to suspend
executions and to establish a commission to study DNA technology,
sentencing bias in capital cases and legal representation for
capital defendants.
</P>
<P>
   All the questioning isn't changing Bush's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is satisfied that everyone who has been executed
in Texas is guilty and had full access to the courts and to court
appeals,'' said campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office did not respondek, Gary Graham is scheduled to die

</P>
<P>
   A Columbia University study released Monday found that
two-thirds of the death sentences meted out in the past 23 years
have been overturned on appeal. Fifteen of the 38 states that have
the death penalty are now assessing its effectiveness. The New
Hampshire legislature voted to repeal its death penalty, but
Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen vetoed. The state has not executed
anyone since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the same problems Illinois has with its death
penalty statute, I would have taken the same step,'' Shaheen said
in response to questions e-mailed to her office.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which executes more people than any other state, has
become ground zero for the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters at the Chicago Tribune raised serious questions about
the quality of legal representation and the use of jailhouse
informants in 106 of the 134 people executed while Bush has been in

</P>
<P>
   Bush's office did not respond to e-mailed questions for the
governor regarding the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Whit Ayers, a Republican pollster from Atlanta, said Bush loses
nothing sticking to his position. He noted that a recent Newsweek
poll had support for the death penalty at 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do people want assurances that those who are executed are
actually guilty? Of course,'' Ayers said. ``But do they want people
who commit heinous to crimes to suffer the death penalty for those
crimes? You better believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why debate over perfecting the system could have ironic
consequences for death penalty foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of this new opposition is based on DNA evidence and
wanting to make sure we get it right,'' said Tim Floyd, a Texas
Tech University law professor. ``With improved science, it may be
more possible to choose the right people...and that would lead to
more support of the death penalty.''

Sunday's wild, uncontrolled mob attacks on women in Central Park

CHINESE PHONE COMPANY'S OFFERING SAID TO BODE WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Capitalizing on the recent popularity of
telecommunications stocks and the enduring appeal of the world's
most populous country, China Unicom Ltd. raised $4.92 billion on
Friday in the largest initial public offering in Asia outside
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The company, China's second-largest telephone carrier, priced
its shares at 15.58 Hong Kong dollars each, or about $2 U.S. That
is near the top of the range set by the company earlier this week.
Unicom had already raised the range by 10 percent because of the
buoyant demand.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Unicom said the institutional part of the
offer, which accounts for most of the 2.46 billion shares, was
subscribed three times over. Unicom priced its American depository
shares at $19.99 a share. The shares will begin trading in New York
on Wednesday and in Hong Kong the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unicom is going to be very successful,'' said Seton Lor, a
fund manager at Manulife Financial, an investment firm here.
``Telecom stocks are very much in vogue these days. The stock is
also priced at a lower multiple than China Telecom, because it has
businesses other than cellular.''
</P>
<P>
   China Telecom, the nation's largest telephone carrier, held the
record for the largest previous offering, raising $4.2 billion in
late 1997. Unicom, which was started by the Chinese government in
1994 to create competition for Telecom, has languished in the
shadow of its powerful rival.
</P>
<P>
   It has less than one-third the mobile-phone subscribers: 4.15
million vs. 15.6 million. It has had a revolving door of senior
managers. It has zigzagged confusingly on cellular technology. It
has been forced to unravel partnerships with foreign investors. And
it derives 63 percent of its revenue from paging _ a service that
many experts regard as the horse-and-buggy of the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that, China Unicom now has its own page in the
annals of China's corporate reform. Even people who faulted the
company agree that it has bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unicom has an enormous opportunity in front of it,'' said Hani
Abuali, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in Hong Kong.
``China is going to be the world's largest cellular market.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of cellular subscribers in China jumped from 13.7
million in 1997 to 43.2 million at the end of last year. That still
represents a penetration rate of only 3.4 percent. China Unicom's
executives note that the company's franchises, which extend up and
down the country's economically prosperous coast, cover 67 percent
of the total cellular subscribers in China.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics like that have made China Telecom a shooting star on
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Since May 24, its shares have risen
over 30 percent. That performance goaded Unicom's executives to
raise the price range of their offering. Analysts say the timing
was impeccable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``From my discussions with fund managers, people are looking for
alternative ways to invest in China,'' Abuali said. ``This is a
good alternative investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Unicom's success is also a good omen for other large Chinese
state-owned companies, which the government hopes to begin
privatizing in the coming months. These include China National
Offshore Oil Corp. and Sinopec, an oil and petrochemical giant.
</P>
<P>
   China Unicom's offering is managed by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and China International Capital Corp., a Beijing-based investment
bank partly owned by Morgan Stanley.

SINGLETON'S ROLE MODELS? STRONG FATHER, SWAGGERING MOVIE HERO NAMED
SHAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS PERRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he stepped into the crowded room, the inevitable happened: an
audible, lustful gasp.
</P>
<P>
   John Singleton, arriving late, wasn't surprised. He glanced up
at the sound, then raised his head high, and paused _ and in that
moment, as they watched a sly smile curl his lips and his
penetrating black eyes survey the scenery, every female present
knew exactly what Singleton was thinking. Namely, that any one of
them _ forget boyfriends, crushes or even husbands _ would go with
him right now if he so much as crooked a finger their way.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't even famous yet.
</P>
<P>
   John Singleton wouldn't admit to it now, but the moment was
unmistakable that first day of class at the University of Southern
California _ and finally, a dozen years after witnessing it, I know
how he mastered that magnetic presence: He watched ``Shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1971 MGM classic _ the first major studio film to show an
African-American as a swaggering, irresistible hero _ was the movie
of Singleton's childhood. Which might just be why the 32-year-old
director is bringing the ``sex machine to all the chicks,'' as
Isaac Hayes' famous theme song calls private eye John Shaft, back
to the big screen. Singleton, who stormed Hollywood nearly 10 years
ago with the realistic urban drama ``Boyz N the Hood,'' has the
charisma and the looks to star in the new film himself. But he's
staying behind the camera, and sometimes _ only sometimes, mind you
_ he worries about whether he has the touch to make his updated
Shaft, played by Samuel L. Jackson, the kind of role model for
today's urban kids that the original was for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most challenging aspect was to try to make it hip _ a
really cool, contemporary film,'' says Singleton from his Manhattan
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Because the original ``Shaft,'' directed by pioneering black
filmmaker Gordon Parks, was nothing if not cool and contemporary _
and revolutionary. To begin with, it was everything a detective
film should be. It had a tough, cynical private eye; a beautiful
dame-in-distress who can't wait to toss her undergarments for him;
trash-talking gangsters with names like Bumpy; and plenty of
over-the-top violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quality, funky movie,'' Singleton says, pointing out
that Hayes won an Oscar for the score and that the film's writer,
Ernest Tidyman, won a gold statuette the same year for ``The French
Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course what made ``Shaft'' really interesting _ and
unique _ wasn't that it was a good PI film. It was the way Parks
and Richard Roundtree, who starred in the title role, played with
and against the genre's conventions.
</P>
<P>
   For Roundtree, with his strutting sex appeal on full display, it
was his moment (however fleeting it turned out to be). To be sure,
he wasn't the first mainstream black movie star, but Sidney Poitier
wasn't Shaft _ couldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``While (the original) `Shaft' doesn't hold up these days as an
action film,'' Elvis Mitchell recently offered in The New York
Times, ``its detractors are probably too young to be aware of the
elation that charged movie houses of the '70s as cheering black
audiences saw a dark-skinned hero _ iconic and masculine in his
up-to-the-minute proto-fade haircut and collection of leathers _ in
total control of his destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the cheering moviegoers back then were Singleton and his
father. The director remembers clearly his dad taking him to see
``Shaft'' when Singleton was only 3 or 4 years old. ``My father
looks very much like Richard Roundtree _ tall, dark and really
good-looking,'' he says. ``When we came out of the movie, he was
walking 10 feet taller. He said: `You know, somebody saw me coming
up the street and went ahead and made that movie!'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the elation black audiences felt watching the
original isn't likely to greet Singleton's new version, which
opened Friday. ``You hadn't seen a black man do what (Shaft) did on
screen,'' Singleton notes of the first movie. Now we have, many
times over.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   But if Singleton can't re-create the same excitment among black
audiences, he can at least re-create the movie's signature
I-feel-good style _ complete with the famous Hayes theme _ that
seems so alien to today's rap and hip-hop stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a style that Singleton, who was born and raised in Los
Angeles' depressed South Central neighborhood, needed when he was
growing up. In the inner city, many kids found self-affirmation in
gangs. Singleton turned to movies instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies were my escape from the neighborhood,'' he says. ``I
really loved them. The only thing I was interested in was making
movies. I could have taken any other path. Where I lived, I had to
work at being a nice kid, teach myself discipline. I tried to do
well in school so I didn't end up like everybody else around me.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes much of that drive to be different to his father,
a mortgage broker. ``My father said: `If you go to jail, I ain't
coming after you!' and `Don't ever steal!' I did steal toys and
candy bars because I had no money to buy them _ but before we had
that conversation. My father was a strong black man. He wouldn't
let me make the mistake a lot of people were making. Whereas (other
kids) looked up to the cat on the corner who was the local hero
Crip, I looked up to my father.''
</P>
<P>
   His father's example led Singleton to the high school honor roll
and a place at USC's film school. It was while he was at USC that
he wrote ``Boyz N the Hood,'' which scored him a prominent student
award and brought about a studio deal. A month after graduation, he
had his own office at Columbia Pictures, with $6 million to make
``Boyz.'' It should have been a tremendous boost to his
self-confidence. Instead, it had the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent told me, `If (the daily footage) doesn't look good,
they can fire you,''' he recalls. ``I was nervous, but I never let
on. I thought that if I could survive the streets, I could survive
this. The first day, after the dailies came in, the head of
production said: `John Singleton is a director.'''
</P>
<P>
   Released in 1991, ``Boyz N the Hood'' was Singleton's
semi-autobiographical story of a young black man's coming of age in
a gang-infested neighborhood. The film received the kind of
critical plaudits an artist is lucky to get once in his lifetime.
At 24, Singleton was nominated for a Best Director Oscar _ the
youngest person and first African-American to win such recognition
_ and also received a nomination for Best Screenplay. ``Boyz'' went
on to become one of the highest-grossing films ever directed by an
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton followed his debut with ``Poetic Justice,'' ``Higher
Learning'' and ``Rosewood,'' none of which have reproduced
``Boyz'''s critical or box-office success. But ``Shaft'' seems
ready to change that _ not that kudos or big receipts are foremost
in the filmmaker's mind. Singleton says he takes pride in not
caving in to studio pressure to make the kind of films that have
teen-agers lining up around the block.
</P>
<P>
   He still gets ``flashes of where I'm from,'' he says. ``Like,
when I want to defend my art, I turn into a street kid and fight
for what I believe in. You don't get anywhere being a conformist.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Shaft,'' Singleton moves from a hyper-realistic
portrayal of the black urban experience to an impressionistic
portrayal, through which he projects a confident, ultra-cool image
for today's young audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Though he says his ``Shaft'' isn't an homage, he acknowledges
that Parks inspired him, and not just to be a sex machine _ or at
the very least a girl magnet _ like John Shaft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only cat I could look to and say: He did it. He was
the first African-American to direct a studio-financed picture. ...
He directed a great movie, ``Shaft.'' So I knew I could make
movies, too.''

A CENTRAL SOURCE FOR VARIED COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Comedy Central, the new season starts this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other cable networks, Comedy Central is taking
advantage of the sleepyheads at the broadcast networks, who
basically switch to auto pilot each summer with night after night
of reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, Comedy Central launches its season premiere
week, with fresh episodes of seven returning series and the debuts
of three new shows.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy on the network is a relative thing. Comedy Centrals
offerings range from the brilliant wit of ``League of Gentlemen''
to the crass, sexist humor of the returning ``The Man Show,'' the
network's least appealing series.
</P>
<P>
   The season premieres are scheduled at 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
Sunday through Thursday, beginning this weekend with ``The Man
Show,'' followed by the offbeat and slightly engaging ``Strip
Mall,'' set in a suburban Los Angeles strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Julie Brown stars as a former child star, Tammi Tyler,
who wants to regain the fame she lost years ago when she killed her
popular co-star. She's now working as a barmaid with the
delightfully daffy Victoria Jackson as her co-worker. The show
focuses on businesses in the mall, including a Chinese restaurant
run by a bizarre lesbian couple who spend more time taunting and
insulting each other than serving food and a video store that is a
front for porno films. Maxwell Caulfield plays one shop owner who
becomes a porn star.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesdays offer the return of ``Strangers With Candy,'' with Amy
Sedaris as a grown woman returning to high school, followed by the
network's best new show, ``The League of Gentlemen.'' This BBC
series recalls Monty Python's Flying Circus, with a British sketch
comedy troupe bringing to life the bizarre residents of the small
village of Royston Vasey. The troupe of four men _ three
performer-writers and one writer _ and a small group of guest
actors, play all the men and women in town, including murderous
shop owners who hate strangers and a transsexual taxi driver. It's
bizarre and often hilarious. Cast members are gifted at
transforming themselves so that you don't recognize them in some of
their characters.
</P>
<P>
   The network provided only a clip of the new game show ``Don't
Forget Your Toothbrush,'' which features former ``Hangin With Mr.
Cooper'' star Mark Curry as host. Contestants are put through
embarrassing tests, like ``What's Under My Kilt.'' A woman is
blindfolded and asked to reach under the kilts of four men and
guess what's hanging there. Items include a hammer and a lobster.
There's a last-minute twist with her boyfriend that might make you
groan more than laugh. The series will be paired with episodes of
the British version of ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   The outrageous, funny and offensive ``South Park'' returns at 10
p.m. Wednesdays, followed by ``Comedy Central Presents,'' a
half-hour stand-up comedy show.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is Ben Stein night, with new episodes of the quirky
game show ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' followed by the second season
of ``Turn Ben Stein On,'' featuring interviews with such guest
stars as Drew Carey, Charlie Sheen, Craig Kilborn and Carmen
Electra.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new shows, only ``League of Gentlemen'' will have me
tuning in for more. The others might be worth a look once in a
while when there's nothing else to watch, which could be pretty
much every night this summer.

&HT;     MAZDA UPDATES ITS MPV MINIVAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mazda, that underrated but outstanding little Japanese car
company controlled by Ford Motor Co., has gotten serious about the
minivan market this year with an all-new version of its
long-running MPV model.
</P>
<P>
   The MPV _ that stands for ``multipurpose vehicle,'' not ``mostly
plastic vehicle,'' by the way _ was introduced in 1989 as one of
the most practical and affordable of the Japanese vans on the
market. It has been a best seller during most of its lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as it was, it had become somewhat outdated, with no
major redesigns during its 11-year history. Until now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, Mazda has hit another home run with the MPV, which
easily competes against the best Japanese and domestic models
available.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, as popular as the new Honda Odyssey is _ the
company has a huge backlog of orders and is rushing to build a new
plant to help fill them _ the MPV takes the best features of the
Odyssey and makes them even better.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The middle row of seats, which can be either two
separate captain's chairs, or, when pushed together, a bench seat
for two. Honda's van does that, too, but the MPV's seats can be
moved forward or backward to create more leg room. The Odyssey's
can't.
</P>
<P>
   The new MPV has sliding doors on both sides, something that most
of the competition offers. But get this: The MPV has real windows
in those sliding doors so the rear passengers can finally get some
fresh air. These power rear windows are a first in the minivan
segment. I would not ride in the back of any car where I couldn't
roll down the window; I'm just one of those kinds of riders who has
to have fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   And the third seat is really cool. It can be turned over to face
to the rear to allow you to sit and watch the kids' soccer game in
comfort out the rear hatch, for a panoramic view. This is a nice
feature for tailgate parties, too.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo compartment offers another big advantage over the
MPV's competitors. It has a deep well for storage of groceries and
other cargo that keeps the stuff from sliding all over the place,
and with the third seat in place, there is still more than 17 cubic
feet of cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to create a larger cargo area, fold the third
seat flat into that deep well, and you have 54 cubic feet of space.
But there's more: Those two middle-row seats can be easily lifted
out of the van and stored to increase space to more than 127 cubic
feet, enough to load up tons of stuff for Saturday gardening or
home-improvement projects. The middle seats weigh just 37 pounds
each.
</P>
<P>
   The seating options alone make the MPV one of the most practical
minivans ever. But the van has a lot more going for it. For one
thing, it's very nice looking _ more stylish than most of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda used its design studio in Southern California to help make
this a beautiful vehicle. Even the interior styling is innovative
and refreshing, something unusual in a minivan. The V-shaped center
dash console, for instance, allows for more leg and foot room for
the front occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Cup holders abound. There are two in the dash for the front
occupants, and four more in the middle seating area, as well as
another four in the rear seat area. They will hold everything from
juice boxes to fountain cups, although they aren't quite deep and
wide enough for the 7-Eleven Big Gulp cups.
</P>
<P>
   Cubbyholes are plentiful for interior storage, too. There are
nine different places to stow things out of sight and out from
underfoot. One of my biggest gripes with most minivans is that when
you've got all the kiddies on board with all their stuff and your
stuff, that stuff is sliding all over the floor every time you turn
a corner or hit the brakes. You can tuck stuff out of the way and
avoid that with the MPV.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. It drives like a dream, too. In fact, there's nothing
boxy or van-like in the driving experience _ it seems more like
driving a sedan. It's powered by an adequate if not excessively
powerful 2.5-liter V-6 engine, supplied by Ford, that makes 170
horsepower and 165 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   This engine is perhaps the only slight drawback for the MPV; it
would be nice to have at least the option of a more powerful engine
if you're planning to tow a boat or if you live in the mountains
and need more torque on hills.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for most folks, the engine will be sufficient. It is
connected to a smooth-shifting Mazda four-speed automatic
transmission, and there are speed-sensitive power rack-and-pinion
steering and four-wheel antilock brakes to help with handling and
stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is just as roomy as a standard-length Dodge Caravan
inside, the MPV has a compact exterior, which makes it easier to
park and to maneuver in city traffic or on narrow, woodsy state
park roads. Mazda calls the van ``smart sized'' because of its
smaller exterior but extremely efficient interior design that
maximizes space for people and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Two major changes from the previous generation of the MPV are
the front-wheel-drive system (the old one had rear-wheel drive) and
the rear sliding doors. The old model had real rear doors, which
would swing open just like the front doors. I liked the old style
rear doors, as did a lot of MPV owners. But apparently Mazda had to
bow to consumer pressure and go with sliding doors to conform to
what all of the other minivan makers are using.
</P>
<P>
   Quality is truly job one with Mazda, and that's evident in the
MPV just as it is with all other Mazda products. Say what you will
about the quality of Toyota and Honda; they are very good. But
Mazda builds the best cars in the car business, period. I know that
from my own ownership experience over decades. You can beat a Mazda
up, but you'll have a hard time killing one. (I've tried).
</P>
<P>
   The MPV comes in three versions: the entry-level DX (base price
$19,995, plus $480 transportation), the midlevel LX (our test
vehicle, base price $22,050), and the top-of-the-line ES ($25,550).
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on the LX model includes the seven-passenger
seating arrangement I mentioned earlier, as well as velour seats,
AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with four speakers, power windows and
door locks, overhead console with map lights, under-seat storage
tray on the front passenger's side, privacy glass, rear
wiper/washer, air conditioning, 15-inch all-season tires with full
wheel covers, dual de-powered front air bags, tilt steering wheel,
halogen headlights and power heated outside mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Options on our test car included a rear-seat entertainment
system for the kids ($1,595), fog lamps ($250), roof rack ($200),
rear air-conditioning ($595), four-seasons package ($400), and the
LX touring package ($1,975), which added front side air bags,
remote keyless entry, wood-tone interior trim, carpeted floor mats,
nine-speaker super audio system with six-disc in-dash CD changer,
alarm system with immobilizer, 16-inch alloy wheels, and 16-inch
all-season radials.
</P>
<P>
   Total price for our vehicle was $27,545, including
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 18 miles per gallon in the city and
21 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 18.5 gallons of gasoline, and
unleaded regular is recommended.

 &HT;    Acura Type S coupe special
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Generally, manufacturers who put a ``Type''
designation on a car are up to something out of the ordinary, and
that's precisely the situation with the 2001 Acura 3.2CL Type S
coupe.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same pattern perceived rival BMW follows with its ``M''
versions and Ford with its SVT-tagged cars.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an Acura that's going to astonish folks who aren't
familiar with what parent company Honda has been doing of late with
its engines, which benefit from trickledown technology from Formula
One Grand Prix racing. The Type S is classified as a near-luxury
car, but there's nothing ``near'' about its sportiness.
</P>
<P>
   It's powered by an instantly responsive V-6 engine that delivers
260 horsepower at 6,100 rpm and 232 pounds-feet of torque at 3,500
rpm. Reach for maximum horsepower, and the Type S produces a
satisfying growl while getting there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the near-luxury aspect, this 3.2CL is so well-equipped
that the only option is a $2,000 navigation system. Some time spent
in a 3.2CL with the navigation system left the definite impression
that it's far better to invest the $29,980 that's the base price of
the non-S car and the money needed for the navigation system _ a
total of $30,435 _ toward a Type S and a good road map.
</P>
<P>
   The navigation system is difficult to operate, although its good
features do include zoom-in, zoom-out capability, and it will
recall frequently used routes and show how to get home from
wherever you happen to be.
</P>
<P>
   With its lengthy list of standard features _ including an
in-dash six-disc CD player, power everything and leather trim _ the
Type S shows that Honda is very serious about upgrading the Acura's
image. And its horsepower and torque numbers, along with a
zero-to-60 mph time of 6.6 seconds, indicate that the performance
is there, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's no fun getting in and out of the headroom-impaired rear
seat, but the ride, road-holding characteristics and soundproofing
of the Type S are all commendable. Fuel mileage is about what's
expected of V-6 engines with muscle, 19 mpg in the city and 29 mpg
on the highway, and so is the fuel recommendation (premium).
</P>
<P>
   The interior and instrumentation layout show both thought and
good workmanship. The far-reaching Xenon headlamps may aggravate
oncoming drivers, but they're a plus for whoever's behind the wheel
of the Type S (and other CLs).
</P>
<P>
   So never mind that the styling isn't as edgy or as appealing as
the mechanicals and creature comforts of Type S. Its performance
and utility _ yes, that too _ suggest that compared to some cars in
its class, it's a bargain.

 FIRST WORLD BOTANIC GARDENS CONGRESS TO MEET 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ At 14-years-old, the North Carolina Arboretum
is an infant compared with the great gardens of the world. But its
staff and a devoted corps of volunteers have scored a coup: landing
the first-ever World Botanic Gardens Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The June 25 to 30 meeting is expected to attract 800 to 1,000
delegates from 50 countries. It will bring together members of the
American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta, the Botanic
Gardens Conservation International and the Center for Plant
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Arboretum Director George Briggs described the
work leading to the World Congress' decision to meet in Asheville
as ``the proverbial dog chasing the car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Botanic Gardens Conservation International has never
before met in the United States, and the American group usually
meets in major cities _ Boston, Philadelphia, Denver,'' Briggs
said. ``For both these groups to come to Asheville is quite an
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the conference is ``Creating Partnerships Within
and Beyond the Garden.'' A key goal of the World Botanic Gardens
Congress is the development of a new and focused global plant
conservation strategy among botanic gardens.
</P>
<P>
   One strategy is to pull related disciplines into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of natural collaboration that zoological parks have
in conserving animals is the model we're exploring for botanic
gardens,'' Briggs said. ``Sharing resources and information _ and
rare or endangered species _ - to best conserve what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference features more than 85 presentations, workshops
and sessions covering topics of interest to public garden
professionals and scientists working in plant conservation. While
the sessions are not open to the public, tapes of proceedings will
later be available.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Arboretum covers 426 acres in the Blue Ridge
Mountains and is surrounded by the Pisgah National Forest.

   USCAN-MAIN_ ATLANTA _ Robert Sunday never imagined he'd be a
grocery check-out clerk. But he gladly does the job for free at his
neighborhood Kroger. Sunday, 29, uses the express self check-out
line, where he scans and bags his own groceries, then feeds money
into a machine. ``I've used it ever since the service started,''
Sunday said during a recent shopping run. The machines, called
U-Scan Express, have been limited to lines for shoppers checking
out 15 items or less, and only some stores have them. But they are
showing up in growing numbers as Kroger and other retailers use
self checkout technology to solve labor shortages and cut costs.
There are questions as to how far the trend can go, such as whether
people are competent enough to do this without creating logjams.

(For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By DANNY HAKIM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARENGO, Ill. _ It is just after 9 one June evening in this
rural town, an hour's drive from Chicago in light traffic. David
McCoy is sitting with his laptop in an office nook of his house,
tracing his finger along a curve on the screen, heading down, down,
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Monday,'' he says, as his finger stops at the bottom
of a stock chart that resembles a ski slope. The point under his
fingertip represents a day almost three months earlier _ Monday,
April 17. That was the day that McCoy stopped being a millionaire,
and that his younger brother, Douglas McCoy, realized that he would
have to sell his 1996 Honda Prelude to cover margin debts. And it
came during a month when many investors suffered bracing losses
that, overnight, erased fortunes built during the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   The elder brother is trying to be philosophical. The money he
had on paper for those brief shining moments, did not, for the most
part, have a tangible effect on his life. He likes to joke that his
``$2 million truck,'' a Chevrolet Tahoe he bought by borrowing
money from his brokerage account, is all he has to show for his
market bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the losses hurt. The McCoy brothers bet almost their
entire investment portfolios, as well as hundreds of thousands of
dollars borrowed from their brokerage firm, on just one stock: the
Wave Systems Corp., a tiny company based in Lee, Mass., that
designs semiconductors for use in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy might seem foolish, but Wave did go from $1 a
share in 1998 to $50.75 on March 1. By then, Dave McCoy, 36, a high
school teacher of economics and psychology, held $2.34 million
worth of the stock, after investing about $90,000 over three years.
Doug McCoy, 31, a community college administrator, had $507,500
worth at Wave's peak, on investments of $30,000 to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for two sons of a school principal who came from solidly
middle-class roots in the Chicago suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Odean, a professor at the University of California at
Davis who researches investor behavior, calls a strategy like the
McCoys' ``the correct formula to maximize the chance of a huge
windfall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also the correct formula to maximize the chance of losing
everything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   You could say the story of the McCoy brothers and others like
them makes a case for diversification. You could say it makes a
case against margin investing. You could say it, of course, but it
wouldn't matter, because the brothers' quest is as old as stock
markets themselves: to find the next Ma Bell or the next Microsoft
before anyone else does _ to pile in and get rich.
</P>
<P>
   But the quest also has a new and increasingly popular dimension:
the Internet, with its chat rooms. The McCoys and hundreds of
others who think Wave Systems is that holy grail are prominent
citizens of a thriving message board devoted to the company at
RagingBull.com.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Web's most popular financial chat subjects are tiny
stocks that most people have never heard about. Wave has attracted
more than 200,000 messages in less than two years, more than the
combined chatter on RagingBull.com devoted to Yahoo, eBay and
America Online. The followers of the stock are a close-knit
community; many of them socialize off line _ a kind of e-Kiwanis
Club devoted to what it sees as careful consideration of a stock
they intend to hold for the long term. They have even given
themselves a name, Wavoids, and often refer to the company by its
stock symbol, WAVX.
</P>
<P>
   The McCoys and other Wavoids _ many of whom had more than half
their portfolios in the company _ rejoiced together on the ride up
and then suffered together as technology stocks took a pummeling.
Wave fell 79.3 percent from its March peak to its April low. Pain,
and gallows humor, spread across the Wavoid community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well that was fun'' one chat-site Wavoid wrote during the
turmoil. ``Just like a dental visit!''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Doug McCoy, married and the father of an
11-month-old boy, Kyle, is resilient enough to chuckle as he
recalls his quandary.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you go home and tell your wife, `Honey, I just lost a
quarter-million dollars?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And how do you explain that you're not ready to change a
strategy best described as Wave-or-die?
</P>
<P>
   The McCoy brothers first heard about Wave Systems in 1997 from
another online investor. Dave McCoy had dabbled in some small
stocks, while Doug McCoy, an associate dean at Waubonsee Community
College, outside Chicago, had invested in mutual funds and
blue-chip stocks but had never bought into a small company.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were excited about Wave's blend of technologies and
its management. The company's main product is a semiconductor
intended to safeguard and ease e-commerce transactions. Wave is
also involved in a venture to develop technology that would allow
broadcasters to transmit television shows and Internet content to
home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Wave has ties to some luminaries. The chairman and founder,
Peter J. Sprague, was chairman of National Semiconductor, a big
chip maker, for three decades. Among Wave's board members are
George Gilder, the technology guru, and Nolan Bushnell, the founder
of Atari, the pioneering video game company.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the company, Doug McCoy said, was ``the modern
equivalent of finding gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Wave's financial history, however, was decidedly less glittery.
From its inception in 1988 through March 31 of this year, Wave has
had total revenue of just $284,676.
</P>
<P>
   The McCoys started buying Wave in small amounts in 1997, but
within a year the stock accounted for most of their portfolios.
Soon the McCoys got dozens of Chicago-area friends to invest,
convincing them that Wave, as Doug McCoy said in one posting, would
be ``the industry standard for metering and security on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   They corresponded on the chat board with other Wavoids: lawyers,
psychiatrists, a Coca-Cola bottler in Southern California, a
Massachusetts accountant who recently conceded that he had ``broken
every rule of investing'' and staked everything on Wave, and the
last beauty queen crowned Miss U.S.S.R., who posted a picture of
herself in a bikini when Wave met a price target of $10.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Wavoids turned out for the company's shareholder
meeting last November in New York, including people from
Massachusetts, New York and California with license plates bearing
the company's ticker symbol. One retired General Dynamics engineer
wore a 14-karat gold tie pin bearing Wave's logo.
</P>
<P>
   Wave was then trading around $16 a share. Many Wavoids had
become rich, at least on paper, and were understandably giddy about
a company that had, in some cases, brought returns of 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sprague, Wave's chief executive and the chairman's son,
has spent hours mingling and meeting with Wavoids at various
functions. In an interview, he said that he was concerned about
some of their investing practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it appropriate to diversify? Yes. We are not a sure
thing,'' he said. ``I tell my employees that having 99 percent in
Wave is not a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Wavoids were as zealous as Doug McCoy, who compiled a
600-page compendium of board postings and e-mail messages, called
WAVX 101, for fledgling investors. After the shareholder meeting,
the McCoys, more convinced than ever about the company's prospects,
began to invest on margin, using money borrowed from their broker,
Web Street Securities, to increase their position. By the end of
March, such purchases accounted for about a third of their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   For a short while, the strategy proved lucrative. Wave
skyrocketed in February, though there wasn't much company news
driving the stock. Then, in March, Wave hit its all-time high after
reporting that it had received $122 million in a round of private
financing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Dave McCoy was a millionaire twice over, and his
younger brother was a half-millionaire. Many other Wavoids were
also margin millionaires, and the mood on the Raging Bull board
turned euphoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I ask a stupid question?'' one chat board message asked.
``Why do some people refer to WAVX as `risky?' Am I missing
something?''
</P>
<P>
   Another Wavoid started a contest offering a 10-share prize for
the person who could guess when the stock would hit $187 a share.
Of the 276 contestants, Doug McCoy was the second-most bullish: he
guessed March 15, or in about two weeks. His brother said April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day it moved from $40 to $50, we made $500,000 in one
day,'' Dave McCoy said. He celebrated by going on a shopping spree
with his wife, Sharon, for some clothes for their two young
daughters. In late March, a co-worker and fellow Wavoid with a
small plane offered to fly him down to the Florida Keys for a
fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of our `Great Gatsby' trip,'' McCoy said. ``We had
our Roaring '20s experience, then came home and came back to
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the McCoys and some other Wavoids who bought on margin
had a sudden and rough landing.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, the brothers received e-mail messages from Web
Street, their online broker based in Deerfield, Ill. They were told
that U.S. Clearing, the New York-based intermediary that processes
Web Street's trades, needed cash to meet margin calls in the
McCoys' accounts. Unless they wired the money into the accounts by
April 5, the notes warned, shares might be liquidated for them.
</P>
<P>
   David McCoy needed to produce $221,778, and his brother $43,000.
Initially, the McCoys, not understanding why the money was needed
for a margin call, assumed that it was a mistake. They had little
reason to suspect trouble. The Nasdaq composite index was still up
14 percent for the year, and only the day before, Wave had again
topped $50.
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid in the e-mail messages was that U.S. Clearing, a
unit of FleetBoston, had raised the margin requirement on Wave
Systems from 50 percent to 75 percent. Clearing firms are allowed
wide discretion to raise margin requirements above the benchmarks
set by the Federal Reserve and market regulators, with little
notification. A spokesman for U.S. Clearing said the company
sometimes raises its margin requirements on speculative stocks that
have had sharp spikes in their prices, on the assumption that
declines could be just as pointed.
</P>
<P>
   But to the McCoys and many other investors in April, the sudden
changes were baffling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wave had just received $122 million in financing,'' Doug McCoy
recalled. ``Why would it change?''
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, Wave closed at $28.50, down 40.5 percent in just
over a week. ``TIMBER!!!!!!!'' exclaimed one chat board posting.
``WAVX margin investors ... Get ready for the margin call from your
broker ... Sorry guys, don't quit your day jobs just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Web Street granted the brothers a temporary extension, during
which they set about trying to transfer their accounts to a
different broker with a lower margin requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The overall slide in technology shares became severe, meanwhile,
spurred in part by higher-than-expected inflation numbers, interest
rate fears, Microsoft's antitrust woes and concerns about inflated
valuations. Investors of many types suffered, and the McCoys'
margin debt swelled. Their account transfers also stalled;
ultimately, they were unable to move their accounts until a couple
weeks after the Nasdaq, and Wave, hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The McCoys, along with two other Chicago-area Wave investors,
say they plan to file a claim against Web Street for arbitration by
the National Association of Securities Dealers. They contend that
Web Street misinformed them about the transfer process.
</P>
<P>
   Web Street executives say that such transfers often take weeks
and that they acted appropriately. ``We really bent over backwards
for these individuals,'' said D. Jonathan Rosenberg, chief
operating officer of Web Street. ``The market went against these
guys, and that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, April 14, when Wave was still dropping and after the
brothers realized that the transfer would not go through in time,
the McCoys received new e-mail messages warning that their stock
would be sold to cover margin debts at 11 a.m. on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend, the two families pondered what would happen if
Wave fell even further before the debts could be covered. The worst
possibility, they decided, was that they would all move in together
and make the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday morning, I got up, kissed my wife and said I hope we
have our house when I get home,'' Dave McCoy recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The day did not start auspiciously. Wave opened at $11 a share.
McCoy, who stayed home, had not slept for several days. Before the
market opened, he got a call through to Web Street's trading floor.
Hoping to avoid a fire sale of his stocks later in the day, he
began liquidating much of his position. For 45 minutes, he stayed
on the phone selling off blocks of shares into a seesawing market
as many individual investors unloaded their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, he called his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we made it,'' he told her. They had come out of the
frenzy with $64,000 left in their brokerage account. Sharon McCoy,
who says she never fully comprehended the stock gains in the first
place, comforted her husband, who had hoped to be able to retire
early. ``We have our health and we have our work,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Doug McCoy, meanwhile, got to his office at 6 a.m. and started
crunching numbers. He figured that if he could sell at $17 a share,
he could walk away with nothing, but also without any debt. ``If we
dropped back to $10 or $12,'' he said, ``I would have had to file
for bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the shades drawn in his glass-walled office, he started
selling as Wave fluctuated between $14 and $17. ``At the end of the
day, I owed them $14,000,'' he said. ``I had over $300,000 in
profit I had built in three years that I watched get flushed down
the toilet. I walked outside my office and sat in the quad of the
college, sat there just dazed. I'll never get that $300,000 back.''
To help pay for the shortfall, he sold his car.
</P>
<P>
   A month and a half later, Dave McCoy sits in his home office
nook, pondering his whirlwind tour of Internet fortune. On his desk
is a neat pile of seven banana-yellow Wave T-shirts, a ``Bob Seger:
Greatest Hits'' CD, a row of mystery novels and a copy of
``Parenting for Dummies.'' His 3-year-old daughter, Kelsey,
rummages through a basket of toys.
</P>
<P>
   While his brother is generally upbeat, Dave McCoy has taken the
loss harder. He has, after all, lost a lot more. Still, he says, it
helps that little about his lifestyle will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had it,'' he said of his paper millions. ``I never
used it. I looked at it. Has losing it changed the quality of my
life? Not a bit. Just my ability to realize some dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he consider diversifying?
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversification is more or less an excuse for not being able
to read the future,'' he said. ``If I had half in an index fund and
half in Wave, it would take me 10 years to get my capital back
instead of five.''
</P>
<P>
   Though each of the McCoy wives says she will pay more attention
to her husband's trading and use of margin, both seem less bothered
by the investment losses than their husbands are. But Patricia
McCoy, Doug's wife, did feel it when she lost something tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my car,'' her husband says, starting a thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your car?'' she asks, grinning at him as their son shifts in
her lap. Her husband reconsiders his comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your car,'' he acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Later, his wife is more pointed in her appraisal. ``WAVX was
like a drug for them,'' she said. `` `Oh, did you see it drop, did
you see it drop? Oh, did you see it go up? Did you see it go up?
Let's go to the auto show and pick out our Porsches.' The boys were
way too close to Wave.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers would come home from work, head directly for their
computers and field an endless stream of phone calls from other
Wavoids, usually at dinner time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it crashed, I was actually kind of relieved,'' McCoy
continues. ``We were living in a fantasy world. We'd had our big
blow, and now we could get back to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, true love can be hard to extinguish. Both brothers are
back in Wave.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McCoy is trading in and out of the stock with the $64,000
he salvaged, hoping to make quick gains that will enable him to
rebuild his position.
</P>
<P>
   Doug McCoy bought back in after receiving, he says, hundreds of
checks, gifts from other Wavoids looking to help one of their most
devoted and likable brethren. As of last week, he had purchased 500
shares at $17 to $18, waiting for Wave to begin a new climb. He
announced his return in a recent note posted on the Wave board.
``Let the healing begin,'' it proclaimed.

FIRE LOSS MAY COST WINERIES $36 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CALISTOGA, Calif. _ A devastating fire at the historic Kornell
Champagne Cellars site destroyed an estimated $36 million in
premium wine from around the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze Thursday inside a cavernous bottling and storage
facility at what's now called Frank-Rombauer Larkmead Cellars wiped
out approximately 90,000 cases of wine, including about 70,000
cases of Frank-Rombauer wine and 20,000 cases of high-end wine from
other vintners, winery owner Koerner Rombauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rombauer said some bottles were worth $100 each on the retail
market. Most were between $50 to $100, he said, making the loss an
estimated $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to the storage facility itself and equipment is likely to
push the loss total over $40 million, Rombauer said, easily making
this the costliest winery fire in Northern California history.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty firefighters from around Napa County battled the fire,
applying a steady stream of water to the top of the 120-foot
building in the hope of preventing the fire from spreading to other
buildings. A sea of runoff and wine that spilled onto the pavement
below was sucked up and carted away by trucks usually reserved for
septic tanks and portable toilets to ensure none of it reached the
Napa River some 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those individual wineries whose wines are stored there,
it's a devastating loss, and if they lose their inventory it takes
them out of the market for an entire year,'' said Eric Sims, an
industry economist at Motto, Kryla and Fisher wine business
consultants of St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers might also feel the pinch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only a limited amount of high-end Napa cabernet supply
and the demand's been pretty high, and to have the supply disappear
is only going to put more upward pressure on prices,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the losses, winery and fire officials were thrilled the
blaze spared the winery's 1906 stone building, a national landmark
shrouded in 125-year-old Dutch elm trees. ``Thank God we saved
this,'' said Rich Frank, co-owner of the winery with Rombauer.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials were uncertain of the cause of the blaze, which
was discovered about 7 a.m., when a worker arrived and found the
two-story steel and concrete bottling building flooded with smoke,
the floor soaked by fire sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, firefighters played hide-and-seek with
flames that kept popping up in different places after traveling
through the building's walls, and especially through a space
between the building's wooden ceiling and metal roof. Highly
combustible cardboard boxes encasing the wine and stacked three
deep on the second floor contributed to the difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Winery owners, meanwhile, attempted to assess the loss and look
to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make wine for a lot of people, and we only sell our wines
here, we don't do retail,'' Frank said. ``So 100 percent of our
stuff is sitting here. It's not scattered at the A&AMP;P's. So for us,
we won't have wines for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who bottle and store their wines at the
40,000-square-foot, 18-year-old structure are primarily vintners
with small, ``but really, really expensive wines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inventory included wines from Frank-Rombauer, Blair
Vineyards, Craig Bissonette, Cataculet Ranch, Club and Restaurant
Wines, Bacio Divino, D-Cubed, Dusinberre, Eklund, Elyse Wine
Cellars, G. Graham Wines, Queenfield Wine Co., Kathryn Hall,
Inniskillin Wines, Kuleto Ranch, Bravante, Mura Wines, Napa
Cellars, Parador Cellars, Leduco Vineyards, Pride Mountain Winery,
Perry, Point Reyes, Robert Foley, Rombauer Vineyards, Soda Canyon,
Shypoke Vineyards, Sparrow Lane Winery, Spellitch Cellars,
Salvestrin and Winston Hill Wines.
</P>
<P>
   The winery came into its own under Hanns Kornell, once known as
``America's champagne master,'' who for 30 years made sparkling
wines at the historic site, building a $14 million empire. Kornell
and his family, battling a downturn in the industry and heavy debt
due to expansion efforts, declared bankruptcy in 1991 and were
forced to sell the property.

SENATE PASSES BILL TO ALLOW ONLINE CONTRACT-SIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ore., Vt.)   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Without one disapproving vote, the Senate on Friday
passed a final bill that catapults electronic commerce to a new
level by allowing consumers and businesses to sign contracts online
with a click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to President Clinton, who said Friday he would
sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   By giving electronic signatures the legal weight of paper
signatures, the new law would give consumers the chance to buy
health insurance, complete bank loans or set up brokerage accounts
over the Internet, around the clock and with no delay.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Internet, consumers and businesses typically have to
wait days or weeks for documents to be written, mailed, signed and
then returned.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions and insurance companies are expected to
save billions of dollars by eliminating the cost of preparing
paperwork and mailing it. Most records would be kept
electronically, doing away with the need for giant warehouses to
store the material.
</P>
<P>
   The law goes into effect Oct. 1, and consumers could start
taking advantage of the new law soon afterward. Electronic commerce
companies, like e-loan, are all set to take advantage of the
legislation, and some of the larger banks, like Citibank, which
already do business online could easily make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill revolutionizes the way consumers, industry and
government conduct business over the Internet,'' said Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., who helped steer the bill through Congress. ``It
is a tremendous cost-cutting tool because people and businesses can
now enter contractual arrangements without having to drive across
town, fly thousands of miles for a meeting or mail reams of paper
back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a nod to Democrats and consumer rights organizations, the
bill also helps protect the millions of people who do not have
access to the Internet or who worry about being defrauded in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This landmark legislation will ensure that consumer
protections remain strong in the technology age,'' Clinton said
Friday. ``It will help create new rules of the road for America's
high-tech community.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would enable consumers to choose whether to do business
online or on paper. And banks would be required to verify that
consumers could receive documents and information online by
exchanging e-mail with them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, certain sensitive legal documents and procedures
would not be permitted to be done electronically. For example,
insurance and utility companies must still send cancellation and
termination notices through the mail, wills cannot be executed over
the Internet, and products may not be recalled online. Mortgages,
too, must be foreclosed on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mantra through this all was consumer rights can't be
virtual rights,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who helped draft the
bill and shepherd it through a difficult round of negotiations with
the House. ``They have to exist in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill made several serious stumbles during negotiations
between the House and the Senate versions. For months, banks,
insurance companies, securities firms and the high-technology
industry _ a powerful coalition _ lobbied House and Senate members
to permit the use of these so-called ``digital signatures.''
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation hit a snag when Democrats, prompted by
consumer rights groups, said it was lax in safeguarding the rights
of the average person. Then the Justice Department and the nation's
governors expressed serious reservations about the legislation,
saying it could prompt businesses to skirt state regulations on
Internet transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, industry representatives were warned against
even speaking with Democrats,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who
helped craft a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, businesses were concerned that states were hampering
interstate commerce by creating a tangle of laws on electronic
signatures and record-keeping. The bill created uniform standards
but it gives states some flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the logjam was broken _ a testament, in part, to
Congress' enthusiasm about the Internet and the economic boom it
has created. The Senate passed the measure Friday by a vote of
87-0. The House approved it on Wednesday, 426-4.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some concerns remain. Margo Saunders, a lawyer at the
National Consumer Law Center, said she worried that the bill would
serve to ``skyrocket'' fraud on the Internet. Computer hackers are
becoming more adept at stealing people's identities on the
Internet, and privacy concerns remain paramount among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't sat down to figure out how to protect consumers,''
she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill does not specify exactly what a digital signature will
look like, allowing companies, and ultimately the free market, to
decide what kind of technology works best.
</P>
<P>
   A signature could simply be strings of numeric code that is
encrypted _ scrambled and unscrambled _ or it could involve more
sophisticated devices, like thumb-print scanners. Since many
consumers remain nervous about conducting these kinds of
transactions online, it is likely that many institutions will try
to improve online security. Congress, too, has a role to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a lot more focus on watchdogging against
hackers,'' said Wyden. ``A hacker today is sort of like the guy who
goes around rattling all the windows and doors in a neighborhood,
and there is a pretty good chance he will find one open.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that develop this kind of security clearance online
are already scrambling to offer their services. One Utah company,
iLumin, plans to launch a ``digital handshake system'' next week
that would gather all parties involved in a cyber signing room to
help them securely complete their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is also expected to be a boon in so-called
business-to-business transactions. ``For instance, an automobile
manufacturer will be able to have complete contract negotiations
with parts suppliers online,'' said David Colton, a lobbyist for
the Information Technology Association of America. ``There are huge
cost savings associated with this, and the cost savings will
ultimately be passed on to the consumers.''

THIS YEAR'S FASHION AWARDS: SHORTER, BUT STILL LACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 18)  
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The big question that dominated the annual awards
dinner of the Council of Fashion Designers of America on Thursday
night at Lincoln Center was not who would win _ would Oscar prevail
over Helmut, thus winning one for Park Avenue, Swifty's and taupe
double-faced suits? _ but whether everyone would be home by 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know when it's going to be over?'' Carolina Herrera
kept asking people. ``Have you heard?''
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, dressed in a melange of cream couture silks, was
sitting next to Oscar's wife, Annette de la Renta, who had on a
long black dress with a diamond pin clasped to her shoulder. From
where they sat, in one of the conversation pits reserved for big
spenders under one of the two large tents set up for cocktails and
a buffet supper, they could see just about everyone. Anna Wintour,
the editor in chief of Vogue, was there in a white slip dress with
her date, Shelby Bryan, who was talking to Vera Wang's husband,
Arthur Becker, when Wang said: ``I have to be honest; it was
Kenneth Cole's and my idea not to have another sit-down dinner. We
thought the faster the better.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of urgency was understandable. The council's awards
dinner last year was possibly one of the longest, dullest, most
overwrought evenings in the history of New York: six and a half
hours of snafus, ballyhoo and inflated egos, all joyfully recounted
in the newspapers. Not wishing to take another tomahawk between the
eyes, Stan Herman and Fern Mallis, the council's principal
organizers and drumbeaters, evidently agreed that faster was indeed
better and saw to it that the night ended, shock, by 10:15.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people seemed relieved that the initial part of
the evening took place under open-sided tents next to Avery Fisher
Hall, and a few even remarked that the dusk and adjacent reflecting
pool made them think they were in Los Angeles, there was
nonetheless a sense that the evening, despite its supposed glamour,
had all the zing of another trade event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Save me, baby, save me,'' a well-connected publicist called
out, as if clinging to a life raft, in the middle of a sea of
all-too-familiar faces and people whose phone calls she wouldn't
have returned, but who were now advancing toward her with hopeful
glints in their eyes. ``Darling!''
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the tent, Richard Lambertson, who, with his
partner, John Truex, would win the top accessories award, was
sanguine about the fashion industry's chronic refusal to be
impressed by what, to the onlookers who had gathered near the
reflecting pool, would probably have seemed fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what industry is more critical than fashion?'' he
said. ``You're always thinking the clothes are bad, the food is
bad, the flowers are bad.'' Lambertson shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 p.m. _ an hour and fifteen minutes before the awards show
started inside Avery Fisher _ both tents were jammed. Two of the
blond Miller sisters, Pia Getty and Alexandra Von Furstenberg,
streamed past in the sort of slinky, glimmery dresses worn by women
in Hollywood who turn letters on game shows. But they looked sexy,
which seemed to be the idea. There was talk about who had read and
not read the new Jacques Barzun book, ``From Dawn to Decadence,''
summing up 500 years of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Then everyone trooped into the concert hall. Sandra Bernhard was
the host, and she did a brilliant job being snarky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to be nervous about me being here tonight,''
she said from under a fedora. ``We're not here to judge tonight'' _
that got a big laugh _ ``everyone's a winner.'' Later, Bernhard
came out in a red-beaded dress with kimono sleeves, followed by a
denim-blue sheath with a jean jacket studded with a Star of David.
``I hate you,'' she said at one point. ``I love you. Hold me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, acknowledging the presence of Valentino, who had brought
an entourage from Rome to accept the lifetime achievement award,
Bernhard said coyly, ``I've been one of Val's gals for many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners were Helmut Lang and John Varvatos in the
men's wear categories, Miguel Adrover as best new designer of
women's wear, Jean Paul Gaultier for international design and Issey
Miyake for his Pleats Please dot-com site. Ellen Barkin accepted a
glamour award on behalf of ``the Hollywood community,'' which
seemed a lot of behalves to accept on, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
presented a humanitarian award to Liz Claiborne for her
environmental work. Peter Som, a young designer, accepted a special
award for the retired Bill Blass, who has been ailing but who, had
he been there, no doubt would have had something deliciously tart
to say about the evening, which, at that point, seemed more
suffused with urgency than meaning or drama.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fashion designers' council may have overcompensated
a bit after last year's windy program. Each award was presented so
quickly, against a backdrop of whirling images, that the moment
seemed to vaporize instantly _ and then on to the next. One felt
for Valentino, whose 40 years of achievement flashed by in a few
minutes and who was then heckled by three fur protesters lodged in
the tiers just as he began to speak.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was Oscar de la Renta who received the top
women's wear award, winning over Donna Karan and Lang, who was a
no-show, even though he was a nominee in three categories. Lang,
who moved to New York from Vienna a couple of years ago, has a
tendency to do things his own way, but in this case his decision to
stay away seemed pretentious. When Ingrid Sischy, a friend and the
editor in chief of Interview, went up to accept his men's wear
award and remarked that the designer had ``changed the rules in
American fashion,'' there were definitely some raised eyebrows and
murmurs of dissent from the rows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changed American fashion?'' de la Renta said.

   Hot and humid weather will precede a cold front as it moves
toward the northeast coast from the eastern Ohio Valley. Hazy
sunshine will prevail for much of the day near the northeast and
middle Atlantic coasts. Farther inland, clouds and a band of
thunderstorms will accompany the front as it moves slowly across
the crest of the Appalachians in the middle of the day. By late
Saturday, thunderstorms with the front will approach the coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the front, much cooler air will cover a large
area from the northern Rockies to the Great Lakes states. Scattered
light showers will form in the cool air from the northern Rockies
to the Dakotas. Farther south, damp conditions will occur near the
eastern slopes of the central Rockies as moist winds ascend the
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be sultry with scattered thundershowers. A
stalled front in the southern Plains will be the focus for thunder
and heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SELF-DEFEATING HEAT
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, San Francisco tied its all-time record high, 103
degrees. One day later, the mercury hovered near 60. The reversal
was a direct result of the excessive heat. Hot air weighs less than
cold air, and air pressure is simply the weight of the air. During
the day of searing heat on Wednesday, the air pressure fell over
interior California. Since air flows from high pressure to low, the
air in contact with the cool Pacific Ocean was drawn inland,
bringing an end to the rare coastal heat.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 18, will move Saturday.

<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-SYRIA-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was pure coincidence that
presidential succession in Syria and the rapprochement between
North and South Korea took place the same day. But there were
profound similarities in what was happening. Both North Korea and
Syria are relics of another age _ dictatorships where power has
been based on internal terror and hostility to external neighbors,
threatening to explode at any time in new conflict. In both places,
power has passed from a dictator to his son, and the son shows
signs of a more modern, outward-looking approach to solving his
country's problems. Perhaps that can make the world more peaceful.
But there is also the disquieting feeling that it won't be easy;
terror and isolation remain hallmarks of the systems in which these
two sons rule. By Elaine Sciolono. (Moving in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   SCIENTISTS-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ As secrets on nuclear
terrorism and miniaturized warheads apparently slip out of Los
Alamos National Laboratory and other federal labs, the message here
would seem to be obvious: do not give dangerous secrets to
scientists. There is, of course, a flaw in this solution.
Governments need the scientists and their culture of openness to
produce weapons that are worth keeping secret in the first place.
That in a nutshell, is why science and secrecy have clashed. By
James Glanz. (Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   ECON-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ It has been more than nine
years since the nation emerged from its last recession, and nearly
two decades since the last extended period of economic bad times.
It would be understandable, if delusional, for Americans to
conclude that prosperity has been woven into the fabric of life.
Politics, however, is still catching up with prosperity. After
decades in which the two parties fought over how to slice up a
shrinking pie and maneuvered to claim credit for periodic good
news, they now operate in a climate in which economic strength
seems a given and the biggest issue is not a scarcity of money but
a surfeit. By Richard Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-PLATFORMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Conventional wisdom holds
that party platforms are archaic. But many experts say platforms
can be revealing documents _ not only of what an administration
will try to do once in office, but also of the power of various
constituency groups in the party and the extent to which the
nominee is willing to take them on. At a time when everything else
is so stage-managed, poll-driven and homogenized in politics,
platforms are where the activists often have their say. This, of
course, can be troublesome for the nominees. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   STUDENT-SORTING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Lusting after the academic
successes of European and Japanese schoolchildren, American
educators in recent years have imported the idea of a rigorous
system of tests, which other countries use to cull the elite from
the merely literate. But educators here insisted that America,
being the land of second chances, would instead use testing to snap
schools to attention, forcing them to raise standards for everyone.
They would lift up, not weed out. But the evidence so far suggests
that schools here are doing the very sort of gardening they
promised to avoid, employing tests to sort children, and at a far
earlier age than elsewhere. By Kate Zernike.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just a few years ago, lawmakers
were in full cry about the supposed dangers of immigration _ from
crime to welfare cheats to lost jobs. Yet now Congress is poised to
pass a bill that would grant visas to tens of thousands more

of business and immigrants rights groups is pushing to fling the

for Sunday, June 18, will move Saturday.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-SYRIA-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was pure coincidence that
presidential succession in Syria and the rapprochement between
North and South Korea took place the same day. But there were
profound similarities in what was happening. Both North Korea and
Syria are relics of another age _ dictatorships where power has
been based on internal terror and hostility to external neighbors,
threatening to explode at any time in new conflict. In both places,
power has passed from a dictator to his son, and the son shows
signs of a more modern, outward-looking approach to solving his
country's problems. Perhaps that can make the world more peaceful.
But there is also the disquieting feeling that it won't be easy;
terror and isolation remain hallmarks of the systems in which these
two sons rule. By Elaine Sciolono. (Moving in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   SCIENTISTS-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ As secrets on nuclear
terrorism and miniaturized warheads apparently slip out of Los
Alamos National Laboratory and other federal labs, the message here
would seem to be obvious: do not give dangerous secrets to
scientists. There is, of course, a flaw in this solution.
Governments need the scientists and their culture of openness to
produce weapons that are worth keeping secret in the first place.
That in a nutshell, is why science and secrecy have clashed. By
James Glanz. (Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   ECON-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ It has been more than nine
years since the nation emerged from its last recession, and nearly
two decades since the last extended period of economic bad times.
It would be understandable, if delusional, for Americans to
conclude that prosperity has been woven into the fabric of life.
Politics, however, is still catching up with prosperity. After
decades in which the two parties fought over how to slice up a
shrinking pie and maneuvered to claim credit for periodic good
news, they now operate in a climate in which economic strength
seems a given and the biggest issue is not a scarcity of money but
a surfeit. By Richard Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-PLATFORMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Conventional wisdom holds
that party platforms are archaic. But many experts say platforms
can be revealing documents _ not only of what an administration
will try to do once in office, but also of the power of various
constituency groups in the party and the extent to which the
nominee is willing to take them on. At a time when everything else
is so stage-managed, poll-driven and homogenized in politics,
platforms are where the activists often have their say. This, of
course, can be troublesome for the nominees. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   STUDENT-SORTING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Lusting after the academic
successes of European and Japanese schoolchildren, American
educators in recent years have imported the idea of a rigorous
system of tests, which other countries use to cull the elite from
the merely literate. But educators here insisted that America,
being the land of second chances, would instead use testing to snap
schools to attention, forcing them to raise standards for everyone.
They would lift up, not weed out. But the evidence so far suggests
that schools here are doing the very sort of gardening they
promised to avoid, employing tests to sort children, and at a far
earlier age than elsewhere. By Kate Zernike.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just a few years ago, lawmakers
were in full cry about the supposed dangers of immigration _ from
crime to welfare cheats to lost jobs. Yet now Congress is poised to
pass a bill that would grant visas to tens of thousands more
temporary high-tech workers from abroad. And an unlikely coalition
of business and immigrants rights groups is pushing to fling the
door open wider: to unskilled workers who could fill shortages in
hotels and on farms , and even to roll back an array of restrictive
measures passed with great fanfare in 1996. Clearly, the national
conversation about immigration has changed dramatically. By Somini
Sengupta.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; GEKAS ASSETS WORTH MORE THAN $685,000 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Melissa Vogt &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (June 15) - Evangeline Charas-Gekas holds about 60
percent of the assets that her husband, Rep. George Gekas,
R-Harrisburg, reported in his annual personal financial disclosure
report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Gekas' assets, including those held by his wife,
ranged from $685,000 to $1.62 million. Income from those assets
ranged from $15,200 to $36,800. The largest asset in Gekas' report
was Charas-Gekas' retirement fund valued at $250,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. representatives receive a $136,700 base salary per year but
must list other sources of income, assets, liabilities and
financial transactions in annual financial disclosure reports filed
with the House Clerk on May 15. Spouse's holdings must be included.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger candidates for congressional offices must file a
similar report within 30 days of filing their candidacy. The report
for Gekas' Democratic challenger Leslye Herrmann of Mechanicsburg
covered Jan. 1, 1998 to May 15 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann reported receiving $1,162 in consulting fees from Ohio
Insurance Co. in 1999. This year she received $10,013 from an early
withdrawal of a retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas, who served 14 years in the Pennsylvania legislature,
received $16,641 from the state employee pension plan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas' report showed he owes $50,000 to $100,000 for mortgages
on three Harrisburg properties, including his home and two houses
his wife inherited from her father Louis Charas' estate.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas reported no trips paid by anyone other than himself aside
from official business. Congressional challengers must report any
compensation valued at more than $5,000 within the last two years.
Herrmann did consulting and survey work for the state of
Pennsylvania. While more than $5,000, the exact amount she was
compensated was not contained in her report.
</P>
<P>
   She also held consultant positions for the Pennsylvania Senate,
the Center for Independent Living in Camp Hill and Pennsylvania
State University. Again information about the amount of
compensation and when she performed these services was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Calls made to the candidate were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Herrmann listed no liabilities. -30-

 &HT;    `Circus Fire' smolders
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Circus crowds basically consist of two types of people: those
who want to know how, exactly, so many clowns managed to fit inside
that tiny car, and those who couldn't care less about such niggling
details, just so long as the end result is entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying story is much more tragic in ``The Circus Fire,''
but the same principle applies.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for a precise, detail-rich account of the 1944
conflagration that killed 167 patrons of the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus in Hartford, Conn., doubtless will judge
Stewart O'Nan's book a resounding success. Yet as entertaining,
compelling reading goes, ``The Circus Fire'' is regrettably low on
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   To O'Nan's credit, he appears to have accomplished precisely
what he set out to do. Had such a tragedy occurred today, there
would be no escaping any aspect of the story, thanks to the 24-hour
cable news channels, the tell-all books and ``very special''
movies-of-the-week about survivors and heroes, not to mention the
inevitable lawsuits filed and congressional hearings called to
assess damages and blame.
</P>
<P>
   But 1944 was a different time. World War II was the national
preoccupation and TV still rare. O'Nan, the critically acclaimed
author of five novels, including last year's ``A Prayer for the
Dying,'' first learned about the circus fire from a Life magazine
article about a decade ago; sometime after that, he moved to
Hartford and was shocked to discover that no one had written a book
about the tragedy. In taking up the task himself, O'Nan resisted
suggestions that he consider turning the circus fire into a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it deserved only the most stringent, very best
intentions of nonfiction, the idea being to tell the truth about an
event that changed the lives of tens of thousands of people,''
O'Nan writes in the book's foreword. ``As a history, it hopes to
fix a time and a place long gone, to preserve it so readers can
visit it and try to understand what the people of Hartford went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``fix it'' he does. O'Nan the novelist perhaps would have
left a few things out. But in his admirable zeal to cover every
aspect of the Hartford tragedy backward and forward _ the book
begins with a confusingly long account of another circus fire two
years earlier and ends with a survivors' reunion in the late 1990s
_ O'Nan seemingly tells us everything he knows and even a few
things he doesn't know. Because the basic structure is
chronological, names and events sometimes seem to run together and
some intriguing stories drop off just when they seemed to be
getting going.
</P>
<P>
   On one page, for instance, O'Nan describes the out-of-control
flames racing toward diesel-fueled generators _ and one desperate
clown's attempt to stop them: ``In his Weary Willy costume _
complete with huge shoes _ Emmett Kelly came rushing over with a
wash bucket full of water, his painted frown a perfect exprTION

 &HT;    Together all alone: America, the land of social dropouts
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 18.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next month, on the Fourth of July, Americans will again take a
day off from work, watch parades and salute their right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It's the last one that's
elusive, and Robert Putnam thinks he knows why. We are a nation of
strangers, with fewer close friends than we once had, cut off from
neighbors, going our private way.
</P>
<P>
   We no longer belong to anything.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so. Alexis de Tocqueville, in ``Democracy in
America,'' defined the distinctive American trait. We were joiners,
forming associations private and public to advance common cause or
simply mutual enjoyment. Throughout most of the 20th century, they
flourished in every neighborhood, from PTAs to the NAACP to Rotary
to the menagerie of what Putnam amiably calls the animal clubs _
Lions and Elks, Moose and Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   It all peaked in the 1950s and 1960s, and then membership rolls
everywhere began dwindling _ in many cases, dramatically. From the
American Medical Association to the Jaycees, the Masons to the
Kiwanis, people began dropping out. The Odd Fellows will soon be as
dead as dodos. Even the Optimists _ their very name an affirmation
of faith _ are seeing less of one another.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just club rolls that are thinning. So, too, is the
social glue that brings together people of different backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of isolation, Putnam argues in ``Bowling Alone,''
are both public and personal. Putnam is a professor of public
policy at Harvard and a happy crusader for sociability of every
sort. When he took the stage recently at Georgia State University,
dressed in a blue Oxford cloth shirt, striped tie and a khaki suit,
his ruddy cheeks set off by Lincolnesque whiskers, he was the very
picture of good-fellow conviviality. How many, he asked his
audience of a hundred or so, had been to a picnic or a block party
lately? How many had been to a bar with friends? How many had
attended a public meeting?
</P>
<P>
   He didn't ask how many had gone bowling. More Americans bowl
today than ever before, he said, but the point is that they don't
belong to leagues in the numbers they once did. They might bowl
with restless kids, a spur-of-the-moment way to spend a rainy
Sunday afternoon. And some people, apparently, just hang out in
bowling alleys. It was at a bowling alley, Putnam tells us, that
Timothy McVeigh met his accomplices in the bombing of a federal
building in Oklahoma City. If only, someone would say later,
McVeigh had gone bowling alone. Hence Putnam's somewhat misleading
title.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's larger purposes are civic and social. He wants us to be
better citizens, better neighbors, happier people who trust one
another more than we do. It sounds so warm and fuzzy you resist
poking around in Putnam's argument. And the survey numbers he
presents speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, and yet. ...
</P>
<P>
   The notion of ``social capital,'' by which Putnam means the
connections among people, is _ to say the least _ more suggestive
than explanatory. One might agree that ``A society of many virtuous
but isolated individuals is not necessarily rich in social
capital,'' and one should certainly agree that a society in which
more people read daily newspapers and supported their public
schools was a more cohesive one. But how far does any of this take
us toward understanding what a well-functioning community might be?
There are, as Putnam acknowledges, communities and then there are
communities. The Bloods and the KKK are, by some measure,
communities, conferring on their members a validation they cannot
secure on their own. Membership sometimes implies both inclusion
and exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between privacy and belonging is scarcely new, and
Americans at different times want a little more of one, a little
less of the other. Putnam sees the obvious with the acuity of a
hawk: Television has anesthetized us, drawing us away from one
another. People driving 45 minutes _ and more _ to and from work
are going to be spending less time with friends. (But why? Because,
in most cases, they're spending that time with family.) And
two-income families are also going to have less time for clubs. If
careers compromise family life, they diminish social life still
more.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easy inferences from this should be that people in
suburbia are hermits in their cul-de-sacs. And yet anecdotal
experience _ which, admittedly, is personal _ suggests quite the
opposite. Community, if it exists anywhere today, exists in the
suburbs, where people are connected in ways not measured by the old
affiliations. The social glue, more often that not, is children.
People whose backgrounds are anything but homogeneous find in one
another common purpose. If it's not the baseball games every
spring, it's school functions, a neighborhood association, a swim
club or even something so unquantifiable as seeing familiar faces
on a nightly walk. And, whatever the survey data might show,
millions of people draw from this a mutual recognition that will be
remembered longer than all the Rotary meetings they ever attended.

 &HT;    Waynesville will celebrate area's work this weekend
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNESVILLE, N.C. _ A visit to this scenic mountain town named
for Revolutionary War hero ``Mad'' Anthony Wayne will likely
inspire art and crafts lovers to shop like mad in the many
storefront galleries lining its red-brick sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the town's art galleries and studios will host the
annual Art in the Mountains open house and walking tour, featuring
demonstrations and refreshments, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Galleries
will be freshly stocked, and artists will be on hand to discuss
their work.
</P>
<P>
   Most of downtown fits neatly into a three-block area, making it
as easy to see as it is to spend.
</P>
<P>
   At Burr Gallery and Studio, artist owners Dane and MaryEtta Burr
will be holding court in their new storefront on North Main.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been downstairs (on Wall Street),'' says MaryEtta, who
specializes in wheel-thrown pottery. ``We just came upstairs three
weeks ago. We still have the studio downstairs, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she was busy painting one of sculptor husband Dane's
2,000 limited-edition Santa Claus heads commissioned by the
Southern Highlands Craft Guild as its official 2000 Christmas
ornament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little low on my pieces right now,'' she says,
``because I've been working to get the gallery open.'' (Not to
mention painting Santas.)
</P>
<P>
   Down the street is Cross Currents Gallery: The Handcrafted Home,
which showcases Sheree White Sorrells' handwoven rugs, pillows and
wall hangings. Although the gallery has been open only seven
months, Sorrells is no newcomer. For 15 years, she has worked more
or less out of sight upstairs in her Whitewoven Handweaving Studio,
where she has three large looms, one of which can be used to make
rugs as wide as 11 feet.
</P>
<P>
   She set up shop in Waynesville after moving from Greensboro and
earning a fine arts degree in textile weaving from Western Carolina
University in nearby Cullowhee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more heritage here, more craftspeople, crafts
organizations and resources,'' says Sorrells.
</P>
<P>
   You'll likely find colored-pencil artist Teresa Pennington
working at a drawing board inside the front door of T. Pennington
Art Gallery. The self-taught artist, who grew up in nearby
Asheville, decided to open a gallery in Waynesville 15 years ago,
just as the town's revitalization program was gearing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful little town,'' she says. ``Asheville is so
spread out now that you don't have the same sense of community we
have here in Waynesville.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennington is president of the Downtown Waynesville Association,
which recognizes the arts' vital role in economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had a strong crafts tradition in Western North
Carolina,'' says Ron Huelster, executive director of the
association since its inception in 1986. ``Haywood Community
College here has one of the first production crafts programs in the
country with fiber, wood, metal and pottery. We wanted to focus on
our strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has been so successful in attracting artists to
downtown that the vacancy rate is less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have artists continually coming through looking for a
building,'' says Huelster, ``but we're pretty much completely
occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the art galleries, this town of about 9,000 _
which recently spent $312,000 on retro street lamps _ is
chockablock with shops that carry a wonderful mix of merchandise,
including antiques, collectibles, home and garden accessories,
apparel and gourmet food and wine.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cliche, but when Chamber of Commerce President David
Eberhard boasts there's ``something for everybody'' in Waynesville,
you tend to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Want the ambience of yesteryear? Visit the Mast General Store in
the former Belk location downtown. Got a kid's birthday coming up?
Drop into O.P. Taylor's. Want something out of the ordinary for the
cook in your house? Home-Tech has wonderful kitchen gadgets and
gear.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely not art, but if you need a chuckle, stop by
Eberhard's Angel Connection and ask to see Big Mouth Billy Bob, the
mounted bass that belts out ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' and ``Take Me
to the River.''
</P>
<P>
   For grumps who don't like to shop, gallery hop or be serenaded
by singing bass, there are benches strategically placed along the
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   As you stroll around town, pause to admire _ or malign _ the
large-scale environmental sculptures selected for this year's
StreetScapes. One work in particular, ``The Cowlifters'' by metal
artist Jon Dawes, has provoked much debate among the locals over
its artistic merit. Installed in front of an office building on
Church Street, it is crafted in part from steering gear boxes from
18-wheelers, and it has winglike protrusions taken from the frame
of a Chevrolet car hood.
</P>
<P>
   See what you think. It'll be a good conversation starter in the
galleries.

 &HT;    Along for a jazzy ride in the big easy
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 18.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Jazzland is everything that's frivolous and
family-friendly about the Big Easy _ the good times rolled into a
140-acre theme park not more than 20 minutes from Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   Think Louisiana lite: Mardi Gras without the sleaze. Bayous
without the alligators. A jazz hall without hard benches. Familiar
Cajun grub like red beans and rice, fried catfish and po-boys.
French Quarter treats powered-like sugar-dusted beignets and creole
pralines. Fruity frozen daiquiris in plastic souvenir ``Jazzhorns''
and icy Snoballs.
</P>
<P>
   The $110 million theme park has been enthusiastically welcomed
by area residents, who purchased more than 40,000 season passes
before the May 20 opening.
</P>
<P>
   Although its 30 rides put Jazzland in the league of sprawling
attractions such as Six Flags Over Georgia and Astroworld in
Houston, its size is not overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The park reverberates with musical entertainment, including a
jazz band that pops up here and there, Cajun and zydeco bands at
Cajun Dance Hall and the Broadway-style revue ``Jazz, Jazz, Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Six themed sections encircle a body of water, with a spraying
fountain, called the Crescent City Basin. The fanciful architecture
reflects the region: the lacy ironwork of the French Quarter
balconies in Jazz Plaza; the wood bayou cabins in Cajun Country;
and the silvery art deco facades in the Pontchartrain Beach area,
which evoke the amusement park of the same name that closed in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   The park's towering piece de resistance is the MegaZeph. The
4,000-foot-long steel-structured, wood-track coaster, located in
the Mardi Gras section, is a modern version of the Zephyr at the
old Pontchartrain park. The first drop is 110 feet _ and it's a
head-spinning, stomach-churning ride at speeds up to 65 mph from
there.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel so intoxicated, it might as well be Fat Tuesday.

 &HT;    At Jazzland, high-flying fun rules
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 18.
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The searing Louisiana sun was already cranking up
as we eagerly dashed through the gates of Jazzland theme park
shortly after 10 a.m., all crisp and fresh and ready to boogie.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hours later, we stumbled to the car, limp and wilted,
sweaty and sunburned, the soles of our feet on fire from pounding
the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   We were flat worn out, but we loved every minute (if you don't
count the excruciating 100 seconds _ an eternity _ I spent on the
MegaZeph roller coaster).
</P>
<P>
   Jazzland opened May 20 on the outskirts of the Crescent City
expecting to attract 1.5 million visitors during its 110-day
season.
</P>
<P>
   Five themed areas _ Jazz Plaza, Kids' Carnival, Mardi Gras,
Pontchartrain Beach and Cajun Country _ feature a gumbo of rides,
shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Before there was Jazzland, there were 140 acres of marshy,
lightly wooded land below sea level at the intersection of I-10 and
I-510. The soft soil is the reason the park is built on a 4-foot
raised concrete platform supported by pilings. The 13-acre lake and
a 3.5-acre basin in the park's center are both man-made as well.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't notice the clever feats of engineering. You just
see the color-splashed rides spinning, flipping and dropping, hear
the jubilant rhythms of a roving jazz band and smell the aroma of
pizza, fried fish and spicy Creole concoctions.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy begins in Jazz Plaza, where a sort of Disneyesque
Main Street leads from the front gate to the diamond-shaped ribbon
of concrete you follow through the park.
</P>
<P>
   My 12-year-old daughter and I got down to business in Mardi
Gras. We were variously spun, rocked and tilted on the Mad Rex and
King Chaos and fired yellow laser guns in Jocco's Mardi Gras
Madness, a ride-through fun house where the idea is to rack up
points by hitting lighted targets to ``save'' Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   Not inclined to make like bats, we passed on the Voodoo Volcano
and Krazy Krewe, both of which hang riders upside down.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, with the temperature flirting with 90 degrees,
the Spillway Splash-Out looked refreshing. Nobody comes out with a
dry thread after sliding into Crescent City Basin in a 20-passenger
boat.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly drenched (and much cooler), we sloshed toward the
MegaZeph roller coaster, a wood-and-steel behemoth that looms over
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in line for 35 minutes gave us a chance to work up
courage. When the moment of truth arrived, my daughter bolted, but
I sucked it up and hopped aboard with Laurie Trahan of Youngsville,
La.
</P>
<P>
   Up, up, up we creaked, 110 feet into the blue, then _ whoosh! _
down we went. Hanging on white-knuckled, eyes tight shut, I was
screaming bloody murder, praying it would soon be over. When we
finally came to a stop, my heart was pounding out of my chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was awesome, it really was!'' whooped my seatmate. ``It
was worth the wait in line for a two-minute ride. This is one of
the best (coasters) I've ridden in a while. I love the first
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, my daughter and I wandered into Pontchartrain Beach, where
we were disappointed to find that the Big Easy _ the park's 90-foot
Ferris wheel _ was still being tested. Ditto the Zydeco Scream, a
boomerang coaster that takes riders through inversions and loops,
then reverses and does it all again.
</P>
<P>
   Beach Bang Up, a bumper car ride, lured my daughter. I sat this
one out to catch my breath and regain my equilibrium. I
contemplated the ups and downs of the twin towers of terror _ the
Sonic Slam, which lifts riders up and launches them to the ground
at 4.5 G's, and the Bayou Blaster, which shoots riders skyward at 4
G's, then free-falls downward.
</P>
<P>
   I instead took my chances on the Dizzy Lizzy. Imagine a Frisbee
attached to a pendulum. You're sitting on the inside perimeter of
the disc, and then the pendulum begins to swing in greater and
greater arcs as the disc spins around. Tummy-tickling and dizzying
but fun.
</P>
<P>
   We waited 30 minutes in line to ride the Pontchartrain Flyer,
which features double-seated winged aircraft that you steer to do
stalls and dives in flight at 100 feet. But it was no great thrill.
</P>
<P>
   Around the bend was Cajun Country, where we lunched on chicken
tenders and french fries ($6), a Jazzburger ($3.50), an order of
red beans and rice ($2) and giant Cokes ($3) at the Cajun Dance
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 3 p.m. and we wanted to catch ``Jazz, Jazz, Jazz''
at Festival Hall (think Crystal Pistol at Six Flags) in Jazz Plaza.
The Broadway-style revue features seven fresh-faced young
singer-dancers who do a lively 30-minute tribute to jazz, blues,
Cajun and zydeco music. The featured performer is Tonya Boyd, whose
renditions of ``St. Louis Blues'' and ``Sweet Georgia Brown'' blew
us away.
</P>
<P>
   We backtracked to Cajun Country, where we happily found the
Zydeco Boneshakers band boogeying onstage at the dance hall
pavilion. A few hearty souls were dancing, but the heat had most
folks sitting at tables sipping cold beers or soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Daltons of Lafayette, La. _ Diane and Etienne and son Chad _
had driven over for the day to celebrate Chad's 10th birthday.
Chilling with them was a giant plush chihuahua Etienne had won in a
quarter-toss game at the arcade. ``Yo quiero, Jazzland?''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the dance hall is the Cajun Market and the Roux
Gallery, which features a fine collection of works for sale by
regional artists including handmade dolls, jewelry, paintings,
pottery and folk art.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun worked its way closer to the horizon, we noticed the
line at the Cajun Pirates Show theater was shorter than it had been
all day and took our place in the queue. This three-part
audiovisual presentation about the privateer Jean Lafitte ends with
a wild ride on the high seas _ actually the rocking and lurching of
the moving platform on which we were seated. This is another
don't-miss.
</P>
<P>
   A quick dinner of red beans and rice with andouille sausage and
jambalaya at Rita's Creole Cafe, and we hurried back to Festival
Hall to see ``Jazz, Jazz, Jazz'' again. After the show ended, Boyd
motioned for my daughter and asked her if we wanted to be in the
Mardi Gras parade that caps the evening. Channa Thiel, 9, and her
uncle, Dominick Pizzutl, from nearly Chalmette _ who had visited
the park 20 of the 21 days since opening day _ had already been
selected, and we'd complete the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   So, there we were, scrambling up on the lead float _ one of six
in the procession, led by a marching brass band _ and zipping into
white satin costumes with gold sequin trim and donning crowns.
Soon, as the parade wound its way through the park, we were tossing
purple, green and gold beads into outstretched hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to be in a Mardi Gras parade for one night,'' marveled
Pizzutl, caught up in the magic of the moment. ``Anything can
happen in New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Fly round trip to New Orleans for $122 on
AirTran or Delta with a seven-day advance purchase.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Park information: $31 a day for adults; $26 for children under
48 inches tall; $15.50 for senior citizens. Admission covers all
rides except the Skycoaster, which hoists riders 170 feet into the
air and lets them free-fall over Crescent City Basin ($25 for one;
$40 for two; $45 for three). Open daily through Aug. 20, then
weekends through Oct. 29. The park is east of New Orleans at I-10
and I-510, about 20 minutes from downtown. 504-253-8100.

 &HT;    When children enter a man's life, Father's Day and every day
take on deeper meaning, even a sense of awe
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is said that, at the moment of death, a person's
life flashes before him. Kenneth Neighbors experienced a similar
phenomenon at the opposite end of life.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his son's birth, Neighbors mentally watched
little Kenneth Joseph mature from child to teenager to adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 17 or 18 years, he'll be graduating from high school,''
Neighbors said of his 34-hour-old infant. ``I look at him and think
how my mom must have felt watching us grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, a 33-year-old lawyer from southwest Atlanta, was
among new fathers visiting the maternity unit at Crawford Long
Hospital of Emory University last week. In the minutes it had taken
for a doctor to remove the baby from the womb in a Caesarean
section, Neighbors acquired a brand-new identity.
</P>
<P>
   Father, dad, daddy, papa or pops, men here on this bustling
hospital hallway know their lives will never be the same. Most are
awed by the little people who have suddenly overwhelmed their
lives. They stare, full of wonder, at every feature, from the tops
of silk-covered heads to the tiniest plump, stubby toe.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many fathers are involved in every step of the pregnancy
and birth, said obstetrician Dr. Michael Randell, 35 and single.
``It's wonderful to see women bring their spouses to prenatal
visits, see dads touch their bellies and listen to the heart tones,
see their excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching families being made ``is a great feeling,'' said
Randell, who practices at Northside Hospital. ``It's why I chose
obstetrics and gynecology.''
</P>
<P>
   A birth, even though the child is not your own, is ``a
spiritually incredible experience,'' said Dr. Andrew Toledo, 44, an
Atlanta physician who specializes in reproductive problems. ``The
more I watch what couples go through, the more I am humbled by the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a father of three teenagers, Toledo also knows that the
challenges don't end in the delivery room. ``Parenthood is tough,''
he said. ``It's not for wimps, especially in today's age. You have
to be intellectually, physically and emotionally tough to take them
on and raise them right.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatherhood ``redefines your entire self,'' said the Rev. Bill
Reeves, 29, of Menlo, Ga., ``It redefines your work. It redefines
your marriage. It really makes you value the importance of family,
to make sure they're first priority in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' wife _ also a United Methodist minister, the Rev.
Melanie Reeves _ gave birth to their first child, daughter Kinsey,
on Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite mistakes, despite failures, out of God's abundant
grace, he gave us this child,'' said Reeves. Through Kinsey, Reeves
said, ``we have the opportunity to influence the world we live in.
It's just neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Neat, perhaps, but not always easy
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long-term challenge,'' said Harold Stiefel, 39, a
father of five. ``You don't just sprinkle water on them and watch
them grow. You become very aware of your own interactions. Children
do what they see, not what they're taught. What you want your child
to become, you have to be first.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiefel's family, Orthodox Jews, have a tradition that began
with their first daughter, now 12. On Friday evenings as they usher
in the Sabbath, parents and children gather in the living room to
sing traditional Jewish songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with one kid sitting on a lap and it just became
part of our weekly tradition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The togetherness helps each child, with his or her unique
personality, to develop a sense of family.
</P>
<P>
   A child, no matter how he or she arrived into the family, is a
uniting of past and future, of ancestors and possible generations
yet unborn.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Patrick, 52, became a father when 4-year-old Ivan arrived
from Russia last summer. Unlike the fathers in the maternity unit,
Patrick had to have the recommendations of ``doctors, friends and
bureaucrats'' before he could become Ivan's dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Ivan is a happy American kid of 5 who speaks almost no
Russian but is proud of his heritage,'' Patrick said. ``He starts
kindergarten in late summer.''
</P>

   LOS-ALAMOS-SCENE _ SANTA FE, N.M. _ First came the spy scandal.
Then the wildfire that almost swallowed them whole. Now, secret
nuclear files from Division ``X'' are missing. Over the past year,
event after event has dropped like bombs over America's Atomic
City, shaking up the isolated, orderly existence this northern New
Mexico town and its nuclear weapons laboratory have enjoyed for
more than half a century. Once the very center of the world's
scientific research, Los Alamos has become an embarrassment - and
once-proud town residents are taking it on the chin. (Guthrie,

   DEATHPENALTY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush is just one

the death penalty, prompting a dramatic rethinking of what has
become a political cliche: that Americans want the death penalty

   In what apparently was his first foray into high-risk options
trading in 1997, Rick Lazio bagged a profit of about 600 percent in
less that two weeks on a company controlled by some of his biggest
contributors. Newsday and the New York Times reported that Lazio
spent $2,300 on securities trades in the Quick &AMP; Reilly brokerage
just before it was purchased by Fleet Financial Group. Lazio
unloaded the options for nearly $16,000 on the day Quick &AMP; Reilly
announced it was being bought by Fleet Financial. The windfall
contains some echoes of the trading success of his New York Senate
opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the late 1970s.

   TURBULENCE IN POLITICAL BASE
</P>
<P>
   A new Los Angeles Times poll shows George W. Bush holding a
10-point lead over Al Gore. But the poll suggests Bush would face
some problems among conservatives if he chooses a running mate who
supports abortion rights. A significant number of religious
conservatives say they would be less likely to vote for Bush if he
made such a choice, while relatively few moderates say they'd be
more likely to support him. ``Bush in this election is not going to
be able to afford to alienate any of his base _ even 1 percent,''
said Colleen Parro of the Republican National Coalition for Life.
</P>
<P>
   TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, TOO WRONG?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush mocked his rival's revised tax-cut plan today,
suggesting Al Gore was merely responding to polls and was still on
the wrong track. ``Yet another change,'' said Bush. ``What he ought
to do is release the results from the focus group he ran.'' Bush
said of his own plan, ``I thought mine was very good when I laid it
out; I still think it's very good.'' Gore had promised $500 billion
in tax relief over 10 years to help middle-class Americans pay for
tuition, buy health insurance and save for retirement, double his
earlier estimate. Bush's proposed tax cut would total $1.3
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   THREE DAYS, FIVE STATES, $5 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   After five days at his family's compound in Maine, George W.
Bush embarked on a five-state fund-raising drive expected to bring
in nearly $5 million for Republicans to wage the fall campaign.
After raising an estimated $100,000 in Portland, Maine, and about
$1 million in Boston, Bush was expected to raise another $1.1
million for Republicans today in appearances in Ohio and Kentucky,
and $2.75 million more in Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   SURE, THEY PROBABLY GOT WHAT THEY DESERVED, RIGHT?
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a news conference held near the United Nations
to denounce the proposed creation of an international war crimes
tribunal, Pat Buchanan launched into an attack on Hillary Clinton,
saying that her ``liberal cop-bashing'' had encouraged the sexual
assault spree by a gang of men in Central Park on Sunday. He
suggested that the stripping, groping and robbing of several dozen
women with police allegedly failing to intervene was due, at least
in part, to declining police morale caused by criticism of police
tactics over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   BACK IN PLANTATION DAYS, THEY'D HAVE DUELED
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan lashed out at George W. Bush for removing Civil War
commemorative plaques from the lobby of the Texas Supreme Court in
Austin. ``Mr. Bush is kowtowing to the NAACP, quite frankly,''
Buchanan said in New York. ``Removal of plaques that respected and
honored Southern heritage is an act of political vandalism which
tells us that `compassionate conservatism' is but a synonym for
squishy Republicanism.'' The Reform Party candidate went on to
accuse Bush of ``sacrificing the honored heritage of the South to
the unappeasable gods of political correctness.'' The Bush campaign
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   LIDDY LOBBY PUSHES ITS MAGGIE
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole fans are putting George W. Bush on notice that
they want their woman on the Republican ticket this fall. ABC News
reports that a grassroots group of Dole supporters, Bush/Dole 2000,
is sending Bush more than 20,000 petition signatures to encourage
him to tap Dole, who endorsed Bush after dropping her own
presidential ambitions last year. Bush/Dole 2000 contends that
Dole's presence on the ticket would expand Bush's appeal to women.
Thomas Ratcliffe, the group's press secretary, called Dole a
``Southern belle Margaret Thatcher.''
</P>
<P>
   HE'S WAITING FOR THE BIG ONE
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican convention opened in Houston with Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry presiding, because the governor, George W. Bush, was out
of state. An estimated 16,000 people are in attendance.
Convention-goers will approve the state party's platform and select
124 delegates to the GOP national convention in Philadelphia before
adjourning Saturday. Texas first lady Laura Bush was one of the
speakers today.
</P>
<P>
   JUST ANOTHER KIND OF `GOING FOR THE GOLD'
</P>
<P>
   After months of touting this summer's Democratic National
Convention as a largely private venture that would not cost
taxpayers a cent of cash, backers of the effort now are preparing
to ask the city government for roughly $4 million _ on top of the
services Los Angeles already has agreed to provide. That represents
a significant about-face for the convention planners, who long have
compared it to the city's enormously successful, privately funded
1984 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   EMPLOYEE VS. BOSS
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Elliott should have been very happy about winning her way
into a Democratic runoff for Georgetown County clerk of court. The
only problem was the third-highest vote-getter was the current
clerk of court, Ruby Moore _ Elliott's boss. When Elliott, the
deputy clerk of court, returned to work after a leave of absence
since March 30, she was fired. ``She was waiting for me in the hall
with a letter,'' Elliott said. ``It said, `You are no longer
employed with the clerk of court's office.' '' Elliott, a four-year
employee who decided to run for the top post, beat Moore to the
runoff by 19 votes.
</P>
<P>
   HINSON VS. HINSON
</P>
<P>
   Former bedfellows make strange politics. In one of the more
dramatic Republican races of Tuesday's primary, South Carolina
state Rep. Shirley Hinson, 50, ended up in a runoff with her
estranged husband, Jimmy Hinson, 53, a high school teacher. She won
42 percent of the vote to his 32 percent. A third candidate got 26
percent. The couple's marital problems have been well-known and
include infidelity charges, alleged death threats and a restraining
order.
</P>
<P>
   10-POINT LEAD FOR CORZINE _ BUT IT'S SOFT
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Democratic Senate nominee Jon Corzine, who has spent
at least $34 million on his U.S. Senate bid so far, holds an early
10-point lead over his Republican rival, Rep. Bob Franks. The
ex-investment banker held a 43-33 percent lead in a
Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers survey. But more than 40 percent of
respondents said they might change their preference between now and
November, and only 23 percent said they were ``very sure'' about
Corzine, compared to 19 percent who were firmly behind Franks. The
poll had a 4 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   NOT ALL REPUBLICANS ARE CREATED EQUAL
</P>
<P>
   It would seem like an easy decision for George W. Bush to
endorse the Republican challenger to Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.).
But Bush knows how to step around a political minefield. Asked in
Boston about Jack E. Robinson, the only GOPer to collect enough
signatures for a ballot spot, Bush said, ``It's hard to endorse
somebody I've never heard of.'' After some uncomplimentary news
articles, Robinson, a 39-year-old businessman, released an 11-page
list of embarrassing incidents in his life, and Republican Gov.
Paul Cellucci, who had originally backed Robinson, dropped his
support.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA GOP AVOIDS DIVISIVE FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to avoid a divisive primary and protect their hold on
retiring Sen. Connie Mack's Senate seat, Florida Republican leaders
and Gov. Jeb Bush orchestrated a political shuffle that left Rep.
Bill McCollum as the party's likely Senate nominee and shifted his
chief opponent, state Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher, to the
race for his old job as insurance commissioner. The Democratic
candidate is Bill Nelson, the current insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   BULL FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
</P>
<P>
   Logan Walters, personal aide to George W. Bush, thought he had
it made on his 26th birthday when the boss attended his surprise
party in Kennebunkport, Maine, and flew Walters' girlfriend in from
Texas. But Bush had one more gift: a new bull, named Logan, that
his cow Ophelia gave birth to at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.
Walters' job is to follow Bush wherever he goes, collecting
business cards or gifts from well-wishers and snapping photos
whenever anyone has a camera. His day begins before Bush's first
meeting and ends after he's tucked into bed.

   LOS-ALAMOS-DATA (Washington) _ Missing computer hard drives from
Los Alamos National Laboratory containing nuclear secrets have been
found, officials said Friday afternoon. The two hard drives,
containing nuclear weapons data used by the government's Nuclear
Emergency Search Team, were found behind a duplicating machine,
according to one knowledgeable official. But while the
circumstances of the loss and discovery seemed, on the surface, to
be mundane rather than high-drama espionage, no one who has

DALEY COULD BE GOOD FOR THE DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June   8)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   Presidential campaigns are won in the fall, but lost in the
summer. The desuetude which has overtaken Vice President Al Gore's
effort since he clinched the Democrats' nomination three months ago
enabled George W. Bush to plow on ahead in the elemental categories
of money, momentum and morale.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected resignation of Tony Coelho from the
Nashville-based Gore effort makes room for the Democratic Party's
best organization man, Bill Daley of Chicago. As Secretary of
Commerce, Daley masterminded some of the Clinton administration's
most successful congressional battles over foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of important ways, he may be the closest thing the
Democrats have to Jim Baker, the lanky Texas operative who served
in the Bush and Reagan presidencies. Baker showed how much could be
accomplished by a shrewd, tough player with extensive political and
business contacts, so long as he was willing to play second banana
to the boss.
</P>
<P>
   Jesuit-educated and bearing the DNA of America's second-most
famous Democratic family, the ascension of ``Billy'' to the
manager's portfolio is a welcome development to Democratic
candidates arrayed on the ticket behind Gore. He elected his
brother Rich to the mayor's job in Chicago, he helped Clinton first
in Illinois, then in Washington, then in the business community,
and now in the Clinton drive to deny the White House to Bush the
Younger.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho cited health problems in resigning, which are undeniable.
``Tony's sick,'' said a Democratic insider. But so is Gore's
campaign. There are undeniable problems in the Gore operation,
which has not been as smooth-running as the heirarchal and
tightly-buttoned Bush campaign structure. As the insurgency
campaign of John McCain proved, the candidate is always more
important than the campaign. But in Gore's case, the candidate's
weaknesses require complementary support from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore effort ran into a slough of despond after the
Tenneseean dispatched Bill Bradley in the early round of primaries.
After turning back Bradley by a bare four percent in New Hampshire,
thanks to a furious finish, with Bostonian Michael Whouley applying
the whip, Gore cruised. And then snoozed. Gore ran out of money and
energy and ideas, it seemed, while Bush did a better job of
wiggling his way out of Hurricane McCain.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats still unconvinced that Gore has the talent to
replicate the twin Clinton triumphs, the Gore effort this summer
reminded them of nothing so much as the Dukakis campaign of 1988.
On the first day of the GOP convention in '88, Dukakis was 16
points ahead of Bush, a foundering No. 2 man around whom vast
doubts had coalesced within his own party.
</P>
<P>
   But a leisurely summer, a lackadaisical campaign structure and
confusion in his advertising message and campaign themes frittered
away Dukakis' early lead. Without the ferocity and rapaciousness
necessary to counter Bush's negative strategy led by the late Lee
Atwater, Dukakis lost by 40 states to ten. Bill Daley was around
for that experience, and has not forgotten it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Bush is much the more pro-business
candidate, as most Republicans are, Daley has good relations with
business lobbyists. Despite the fact Daley defeated the unions over
GATT, NAFTA and permanent status for China in the World Trade
Organization, Daley has excellent and long-standing ties to Big
Labor. Gore lucked out by obtaining the services of a politico who
understands you win by addition, not by subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   From his father, the prototypical big city mayor of the machine
era, Daley learned what you can do and can no longer do in ward
politics. From running his brother's campaigns, he learned the
significance of the Democats' essential ethnic coalitions and how
to bridge the gaps between various tribes and clans. After Rich
Daley lost his maiden mayoral race in Chicago in 1983, Bill crafted
the comeback which has kept Rich in City Hall ever since.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer, a banker, then a top-level federal bureaucrat,
Bill, the youngest of five siblings, honed his style and kept
raising his game to higher levels. At 51, he's poised to become the
man to see if Gore wins in November. Presidents develop an
understandable fondness for the associate who installs them in the
Oval Office. It is not much of a stretch to envision Daley as a
chief of staff, or installed on a higher cabinet rung than
Commerce. But there is a huge task that intervenes, bringing Gore
from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Campion, a Boston Democratic consultant who's known Daley
for two decades, said Friday, ``He's the right guy for the job.
He's a guy who likes to win. He has the campaign experience, as
well as the policy background. Bill is not a Washington insider.
His feet are still firmly planted in Chicago. He never lost touch
with what working families face today.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley's appointment will reassure Democratic captains and
colonels who did not warm to Coelho's California style. Coming out
of the Chicago school, Daley understands that politics is not
pattycake. His immediate tasks are to realign the campaign, sort
out a running mate, manage a convention that could get fractious
and rowdy in the streets, and install competent coordinators in the
key states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan and
Illinois. Gore may need three of those five to win. He is still the
horse who must run the race. But in Billy Daley, he's now under the
best jockey the Democrats have.

BUSINESS PROFILE: TED SAEKI, CHIEF OF NASDAQ JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ See this guy?'' asks Tatsuyuki Saeki, pointing to a
painting of a pastel-clad matador skewering a bull. ``That's me.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting hangs incongruously in his sleek mahogany and black
leather office. As for the bull _ his finger jabs it _ ``that's the
Japanese financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   A former senior executive at IBM Japan, the voluble Saeki, 59
and known as Ted, now finds himself on the attack as the president
and chief executive of Nasdaq Japan, which opens for trading on
June 19. It is the National Association of Securities Dealers'
biggest effort so far to go global, steering through one of the
most hidebound, idiosyncratic and bureaucratic financial systems in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, he will have radically overhauled the capital
markets here and, in the process, started nothing short of a
revolution in the way Japan Inc. functions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, business success depended as much on cultivating
bureaucrats and bankers as on competitive edge. Acting on
government orders, bankers funneled money to the enterprises deemed
crucial to Japan's recovery after World War II. Japan's leviathans
_ its Toyotas, Sonys and Hitachis _ thrived, but untold others
found it impossible to get financing.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq Japan is seeking to change that. Young companies will be
able to raise financing. Established companies that move from other
exchanges will be able to prove their mettle alongside the likes of
Microsoft and Starbucks. By the end of the year, Nasdaq Japan hopes
to allow such companies to apply for listings on a foreign section,
then let Japanese companies be traded on the American market.
``This is going to force the Japanese government, Japanese
industry, Japanese society to change,'' Saeki promised. ``This is
going to be one of those events that comes along only once or twice
every 100 or 200 years and fundamentally changes things.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less certain. ``It depends on how active the new
market will be,'' said Kenju Ikeda, general manager of the initial
public offering department at Daiwa Securities, which is
underwriting three of the eight companies that will be listed on
Nasdaq Japan. ``If it turns out to be very active, it will be a
stimulus for changes. But right now, the possibility of Nasdaq
Japan bringing big changes is small.''
</P>
<P>
   Saeki must overcome regulations limiting small companies to
floating only a thousand shares. He must convince companies to
adopt new disclosure standards. He must woo skeptical Japanese
brokerage firms that dominate initial public offerings. He must
learn to curb his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, clean up my language,'' he pleaded in a recent
interview, having thrown officials at Nasdaq headquarters in
Washington into a tizzy over a question-and-answer magazine
interview that included the four-letter words he uses when talking
about bureaucratic obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest test so far was hammering out an agreement with the
Osaka Securities Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's dream was to set up shop on its own, but a thicket of
regulatory requirements made that virtually impossible within the
one year its backers gave themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Osaka talks were torture, according to several people
involved. One hour before a March 15 news conference to announce
the formation of the market's board, the two sides were far apart
on five major issues. Saeki worked feverishly to resolve them,
wielding a hard-nosed analysis of the cost of failure. Ten minutes
before the conference began, all signatures were in place.
</P>
<P>
   Wrangling over complex partnership agreements was not on Saeki's
agenda a year ago when Masayoshi Son, the charismatic founder of
Softbank, rang him up and told him his future was with Nasdaq
Japan. At the time, Saeki was weighing the merits of various
ventures that would allow him to enjoy his planned retirement from
IBM Japan while leaving plenty of time for golf. (He has a handicap
of 9 and a wife, Junko, who can hold her own on the fairways.)
</P>
<P>
   But for every good retirement project that Saeki had, Softbank,
a huge backer of Internet ventures, got there first. ``All of a
sudden, I started seeing Son's shadow everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, he had dinner with Son. He had met Son 20
years earlier and dismissed him as a dreamer. Then, in 1995, Son
startled Saeki by buying Comdex, the big computer technology trade
show.
</P>
<P>
   Saeki played golf three or four times a year with Son, and at
the 1998 dinner, Son suggested that they start Nasdaq Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Saeki demurred, but Son persisted, calling each day. Then IBM
threatened to take away Saeki's stock options if he left before the
company's mandated retirement age of 60, and he got mad. He started
thinking about how the 35 years he spent at an American company
mirrored Japan's limited role on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever noticed in those pictures they take after summit
meetings,'' he said, ``the Japanese prime minister is always
standing at the end of the line of world leaders, appearing as a
small figure in the corner of your TV screen? We Japanese are not
accepted as leaders. I know this personally, unfortunately, because
I spent 35 years at IBM Japan, and yet a Japanese has never been
elected to a senior executive job in Armonk.'' In fact, IBM
promoted a Japanese executive last November to lead its
Asia-Pacific operations, and Minoru Makihara, the chairman of the
Mitsubishi Corp., is on IBM's board.
</P>
<P>
   Saeki, who relinquished his retirement benefits by leaving
early, says he believes that Nasdaq Japan will win Japan a larger
role in the global economy. The Japanese establishment is fighting
back. Last December, the Tokyo Stock Exchange established a market
to attract entrepreneurial companies. So far it has 10 listings.
</P>
<P>
   The mere existence of the exchange, some financiers say,
confirms the impact that Nasdaq Japan and Saeki will have here.
``The fact is that this was a direct response to the threat posed
by Nasdaq Japan,'' said Karl K. Fooks, a managing director at J.P.
Morgan. ``That response, in and of itself, is a huge victory.''

 &HT;    On-track design: Halston chief knows exactly what he likes
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 18.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good thing that the new honcho at Halston, 38-year-old
Craig Natiello, is so direct in his approach to designing simple,
slinky clothes in sensuous fabrications.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the born-and-bred New Yorker, who spent a decade
as Bill Blass' apprentice before taking the reins at Halston, gives
bafflingly indirect answers to questions about himself and his
work.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about his Fabio-length hair, for instance, and you'll
hear a circuitous soliloquy about it being ``the bane of (his)
parents'' existence,'' about it making him feel ``secure'' and how
its conspicuousness forces him to dress conservatively: ``There's
enough going on with the hair, and I guess with my voice and
personality as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he tries to keep his personal appearance in balance, so
does Natiello endeavor to keep his clothes on an even keel. If he
designs a dress in nubby tweed, he makes it strapless. If a gown's
slit high on the thigh, the rest of the body gets fuller coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eye can only go one place at a time,'' he explained
during a recent trunk show of his debut collection at Phipps
Plaza's Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   And if there's any designer with a singular vision, it's him.
Natiello says his ``my way'' mind-set stems from being raised an
only child and from the sort of advice he got from Blass to ``Be
yourself, and do what you like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And how do his designs differ from his mentor's?
</P>
<P>
   ``My day(wear) is a little sharper than Bill's. Bill is a
genius. But he loves mixing textures and fabrics; taking a real
man's jacket and putting it on a woman, and mixing tweeds and
checks. I can't. I'm better at shaping. My thing is creating
illusions. I can make anyone look 20 pounds thinner and 6 inches
taller. That's my thing.''

 &HT;    Internet is the place to find weird, wacky movie shorts or
full-length features
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 18.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dinner at the Tarantino Home.'' ``South Park Swing.'' ``George
Lucas in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular new movies aren't in theaters. They're
playing right now at a Web site near you.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen major Internet sites, such as www.dfilm.com,
www.mediatrip.com and www.thenewvenue.com, are virtual netplexes,
featuring independent movie shorts and sometimes full-length flicks
that film fans can watch for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like the nickelodeons'' of early cinema, says
Bruce Eisen, executive vice president of CinemaNow, the year-old
online studio offering roughly 500 features and 550 shorts, many of
them experimental independent films. In one recent week, Eisen
says, some 35,000 computer users watched movies on
www.cinemanow.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has become a new kind of film distributor, an emerging
player to challenge Hollywood's long-held movie industry dominance.
And many filmmakers, both across the country and in metro Atlanta,
are using the Internet to unclog conventional avenues in promotion
and fund-raising that have often kept their films off theater
screens.
</P>
<P>
   For Hollywood studios, ``there's an element of panic,'' says
Oscar-nominated director Mike Figgis (``Leaving Las Vegas,'' ``Time
Code''). ``They regard the technology and the people who come with
it like the rabble at the door of the castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very interesting scramble for Web-site territory.
It's like a gold rush. A lot of people don't know what they're
doing but know they have to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the innovative Web promotion for 1999's surprise
success story ``The Blair Witch Project,'' the studios have leapt
into Internet marketing, creating ever more elaborate Web sites to
plug upcoming films like this summer's ``The Perfect Storm'' and
``X-Men.'' That's just a part of what's happening in cyberworld.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., which
distributed ``American Psycho'' and ``The Big Kahuna,'' bought
Trimark Holdings, majority owner of the Internet's CinemaNow.
Blockbuster joined with the Web's AtomFilms to create Short Takes,
a section of www.blockbuster.com offering roughly 25 shorts, each
40 minutes or less, in animation, Claymation, documentaries and
live action drama and comedy. The Writers Guild of America-West
announced its first contract covering content made directly for the
Internet. Disney chief Michael Eisner formally urged Congress to
write a law requiring computer and Internet companies to include
technology to prevent content piracy off the Web. And Cisco Systems
completed the first transfer of a major Hollywood film _ ``Titan
A.E.,'' in a hefty 42-gigabyte file _ over the Internet to the
Woodruff Arts Center for a special digital projection presentation
as part of the Supercomm 2000 trade show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, our belief is you don't need to go to Hollywood to
make films anymore,'' says Franklin Lopez, 27, a free-lance
filmmaker in Atlanta and a member of Submedia, a confab of about
seven local filmmakers promoting and showing films via the Web site
www.submediatv.com.
</P>
<P>
   As Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert has warned
Hollywood: ``The next `Blair Witch' won't be promoted online. It
will be online.''

   HARVARD-BSCHOOL (Boston) _ The Harvard Business School, the West
Point of big business, has transformed itself to maintain its

   NKOREA-SYRIA-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was pure coincidence that
presidential succession in Syria and the rapprochement between
North and South Korea took place the same day. But there were
profound similarities in what was happening. North Korea and Syria
are relics of another age _ dictatorships where power has been
based on internal terror and hostility to external neighbors,
threatening to explode at any time in new conflict. In both places,
power has passed from a dictator to his son, and the son shows
signs of a more modern, outward-looking approach to solving his
country's problems. By Elaine Sciolono.

temporary high-tech workers from abroad. And an unlikely coalition
of business and immigrants rights groups is pushing to fling the

   MACBETH-THEATER (London) _ Antony Sher is the first to
acknowledge that the majority of ``Macbeth'' productions don't
work. Added to that was his first exposure to the text, as a
schoolboy, where, the actor said, ``It was taught appallingly, so I
had no real experience of it.'' It is easy, then, to imagine the
mixture of excitement and trepidation with which Sher and his

reality (Monicagate, the Anita Hill hearings) seems to trump
fiction at every turn? Or can savage mockery of our bottom-feeding

heroic-comic opera'' ``Der Stein der Weisen, oder Die Zauberinsel''
(``The Philosophers' Stone, or The Enchanted Island'') in 1790,
listed as author Emanuel Schikaneder, but no composer. The New
Grove Dictionary of Opera credited the score to Benedikt Schack and
Franz Xaver Gerl, noting that one comic duet was orchestrated ``and
perhaps partly composed'' by Mozart. The existence of the duet and
its attribution never sufficed to raise the opera from the
obscurity in which it had lain since its last known performance, in
1814. Yet fortune smiled in 1997. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday that
the United Nations has confirmed Israel's withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, opening the way to a more robust U.N. peacekeeping
presence along Lebanon's often troubled border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the long road toward peace in the
region, but I hope it will be seen as the beginning of the end,''
said Annan, who promptly departed on a weeklong trip to a
half-dozen countries in the Middle East to discuss ways for the
United Nations to build on the achievement.
</P>
<P>
   His confirmation of the Israeli pullout, announced first to the
Security Council and then to journalists here, is significant
because it fulfills a key condition of Resolution 425, which the
council passed in 1978. It demanded that Israeli troops pull out of
territory they had just occupied in southern Lebanon to create a
security buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old resolution next authorizes U.N. peacekeepers to
help the Lebanese government restore peace and security in southern
Lebanon, enabling Beirut to reassert its lost authority.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping mission, called by its acronym UNIFIL, had
until now been largely limited to looking on _ and ducking _ while
Islamic guerrillas in southern Lebanon fired artillery and rockets
into northern Israel and the Israelis retaliated with airstrikes
and cross-border raids. The peacekeepers will now occupy fixed
positions and conduct mobile patrols along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Annan confirmed that the peacekeepers' main task now would be to
help the Lebanese government and its armed forces assume their
responsibilities along the border and throughout the area that
Israel has vacated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a happy day for Lebanon, but also for Israel,'' Annan
said. ``And it is a day of pride for the United Nations. It shows
that U.N. resolutions, when fully implemented by all parties
working together, can be the building blocks of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's special representative in the region,
Terje Roed-Larsen, said that the peacekeeping mission would be
expanded to 5,600 troops, from the 4,400 now stationed in southern
Lebanon, in the first two weeks of July.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen, who was entrusted with handling the complex and
politically sensitive verification process, said that the Lebanese
government has already deployed 1,000 soldiers and internal
security troops in the border area.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement, the secretary-general said he hoped that
the international community would help Lebanon rebuild its economy
in the south and re-establish ties to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help move the whole country closer to peace and
stability,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed hope that the successful implementation of the
Security Council resolution on Lebanon would be seen by others in
the Middle East, ``especially Syrians, Palestinians and Israelis,
as well as Lebanese,'' as an incentive to move faster in
negotiating other peace treaties based on two earlier council
resolutions, which also called for Israel's complete withdrawal
from other occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal from southern Lebanon got underway after Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel set a self-imposed deadline of July 7
for Israeli troops to leave there. When the Israelis started
pulling out last month, their local Lebanese allies, the surrogate
Southern Lebanese Army, collapsed, accelerating the Israeli
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Some patches of land along the border have been contested,
principally by Lebanon. A potential last-minute hitch developed
when President Emile Lahoud warned Friday that Lebanon might not
recognize the United Nations' findings if they were based on a
``fictitious'' line at variance with the internationally recognized
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will consider the Israeli withdrawal to be incomplete if it
is confined to a fictitious nonexisting line that does not reach
the existing internationally recognized frontier,'' Lahoud said in
a statement released by his office.
</P>
<P>
   But after Annan telephoned Lahoud to allay his concerns, Annan
went ahead with his Friday announcement. He is scheduled to visit
Beirut in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen stressed that the United Nations is not demarcating
the border between Lebanon and Israel but merely identifying a line
of withdrawal. This has meant verifying Israel's pull-back across a
frontier imperfectly defined in 1923, with subsequent small
adjustments, according to contemporary maps.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. inspection teams in southern Lebanon visited all parts
of the 72-mile-long border to confirm that all Israeli forces had
departed. Because of the rugged terrain, the United Nations used
not only helicopter overflights by technical experts but also
ground surveys.

FCC APPROVES MERGER OF GTE AND BELL ATLANTIC INTO `VERIZON' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story may be updated later.) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission on Friday
approved the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, clearing the final
obstacle to the creation of the nation's largest telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which will be called Verizon, will control a
third of the nation's local telephone lines on top of 25 million
cell phone customers. The merger is the latest in a series of
mergers and acquisitions that has put the nation's telephone and
high-speed Internet system in the hands of a few huge corporations
that want to offer consumers a package of services from cable
television to cell phone and local and long distance calling.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC laid down 25 conditions for approval, designed to
promote competition and enhance local phone competition. One is
that the merged company transfer nearly all of GTE's Internet
business into a separate public corporation. Federal regulators
have approved the huge consolidation of the industry in the hopes
that a few telecommunications giants would have the capital and
expertise to roll out new technologies like high-speed Internet
service at a quicker pace. But consumer groups have raised concerns
that the domination of the industry by a handful of giants may
ultimately prove costly to consumers and discourage the kind of
innovations that accompany robust competition.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of the two-year-old deal had been expected for
months, but was delayed as regulators and lawyers for the companies
struggled over the difficult issue of permitting the consolidation
of a local telephone company, Bell Atlantic, with GTE, which has a
huge long-distance business, even though regulations now restrict
the local company from entering the long distance business.
</P>
<P>
   The problem results from GTE's Internet backbone unit, Genuity,
part of which the company is planning to sell. Under the FCC order,
Verizon would keep 9.5 percent of Genuity. But Verizon's interest
would later convert to 80 percent if Verizon ultimately won
approval to offer long distance service in the states other than
New York where it operates. (Bell Atlantic earlier this year was
given permission to offer long distance in New York, becoming the
first regional bell to win such approval, after regulators found
that the company had sufficiently opened its local market to
competition.)
</P>
<P>
   To encourage telephone competition, the FCC is requiring Verizon
to enter dozens of new markets on a tight time schedule, with
financial penalties if it fails to meet the deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals including AT&AMP;T and smaller competitors had sought through
months of lobbying to block the merger, and federal officials say
they expect a lawsuit to try to stop the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust officials at the Justice Department approved the
proposed merger more than a year ago, after the companies agreed to
sell one of their two interests in overlapping wireless telephone
systems in nine states. The divestitures included holdings in
Chicago, Houston, Richmond, Va., and Tampa, Fla.

RUSSIAN MEDIA BARON ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT IS FREED FROM JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky was released
from a Moscow jail Friday night, four days after an arrest that
raised alarms about the prospects for press freedom in Russia and
presented President Vladimir Putin with the first political
challenge of his young presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky, the 47-year-old head of a media empire that has at
times been harshly critical of the Kremlin, walked out of Moscow's
shabby Butyrka prison at about 10 p.m. Friday night after signing a
letter promising not to leave Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Looking both tired and agitated, Gusinsky arrived later at his
company headquarters in the center of Moscow, where after stopping
to greet reporters , he disappeared inside the building for a
meeting with his top managers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gusinsky was formally charged with ``large scale
embezzlement'' in connection with the 1996 privatizaton of a St.
Petersburg television station, in which Media-MOST subsequently
bought 70 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, now in its second year, has been widely seen
in Russia as a pretext for a final act in a long-running power
struggle between the Kremlin and Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have denied any political overtones to the
arrest but at a press conference Thursday in Germany, Putin said he
thought that Russia's prosecutor general had gone ``too far'' in
arresting and jailing Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   However, at another press conference Friday in Berlin, Putin
said he had no reason to believe that the prosecutor's office had
acted ``unlawfully.'' He also noted that Gusinsky would be eligible
for release under a recent amnesty that applies to people who have
been awarded special government honors. Putin, left Germany on
Friday for the former Soviet republic of Moldova, and returns to
Moscow on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday night, the prosecutor's office said that
it had accepted Gusinsky's request for release on the basis of an
Order of Friendship award, granted him by the Russian government in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Putin had stressed Thursday that he would not interfere in the
investigation which is being handled by Russia's prosecuting
authority, which is an independent office under the Russian
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gusinsky's lawyers had expected their client to be
released today. Appearing Friday night on NTV, the television
station that is the flagship of Gusinsky's company, Genri Reznik,
one of his attorneys, scoffed at the idea of an ``independent''
prosecutor general in Russia, recalling the role played by Putin,
then head of Russia's internal security agency, in the Kremlin's
clumsy efforts last year to dismiss Yuri I. Skuratov, a prosecutor
general who tried to investigate corruption in the Kremlin and was
later exposed on state television in a sexually-explicit video
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Reznik on Friday night described the charges against Gusinsky as
an absurdity, designed to ensnare him in a lengthy and pointless
legal process with the goal of ``breaking him psychologically and
liquidating his business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gusinsky case is expected to take on political dimensions on
Wednesday when the Russian Parliament reconvenes. Some political
leaders have already said that the controversy may affect support
for the president's legislative effort to tighten the Kremlin's
control over regional governors.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the arrest has aroused protests from politicians,
journalists and business leaders, both Russian and foreign.
American Jewish leaders and 52 members of Congress had appealed to
Putin to release Gusinsky, who is also the head of the Russian
Jewish Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Gusinsky case has proved to be an embarassment for Putin on
his trip abroad, where first in Spain, then in Germany, he has had
to face questions about why Gusinsky was singled out for
prosecution in a country where most business is practiced on the
edge of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Several people, including Boris A. Berezovsky, another one of
Russia's most prominent financiers and an arch rival of Gusinsky,
have noted that in the free-for-all that has passed for a free
market here, virtually all Russian business leaders have broken the
law at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Gusinsky is pinned to an investigation into
Russian Video, a television station in St. Petersburg that was
privatized by its general director Dmitri Rozhdestvensky, who has
been in jail for two years pending a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Media-MOST have insisted that Gusinsky and his
company were not involved in the privatization of the state-owned
station. But according to newspaper accounts, the investigation has
focused on the low price Media-MOST paid for its shares in the
company _ then the equivalent of $5,000 _ and on an alleged $1
million kickback paid to Rozhdestvensky. The prosecutor's office
has said that the alleged value of property embezzled from the
state is $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Gusinsky's lawyers, the charges presented today
were vague and broad. ``What they actually mean is that all
entrepreneurial structure including Media-MOST created by Gusinsky
were created with the criminal goal of robbing the state,'' said
Reznik in a television interview. ``What is remarkable now, is that
the very fact of turning a company into a joint-stock company is
considered a crime.''

&HT;     CIVILIANS, NOT SOLDIERS, ARE VICTIMS OF WARS, DIPLOMAT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Canada's top diplomat, who has helped broker
several international treaties, said Friday that most conflicts now
occur within nations, rather than between them, and that casualties
increasingly are civilians rather than soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilians are feeling the dark side of this post-Cold War
world,'' Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy told an audience
of diplomats at the Canadian Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, in World War I, 95 percent of the
casualties were in uniform, while in a recent civil war in the
African nation of Congo, formerly Zaire, the casualties were 95
percent civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, no country,
including the United States, can ensure its security alone,
Axworthy added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security is no longer so much about protecting the state or
increasing power now, security can only be achieved through
protecting civilians from massacres, stopping terrorism and
ensuring trade among nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this ``tectonic shift in world affairs,''
traditional diplomacy has been transformed from the aloof
maneuvering of leaders to protect national sovereignty to the
concerted efforts of individuals and organizations to care for
people, he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot fight terrorism or genocide or natural disasters
without bringing together many different elements including other
countries, international organizations such as the Red Cross and,
I'd also argue, international corporations and banks,'' Axworthy
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a coalition _ led by Axworthy, Nobel Prize winner
Jody Williams of Putney, Vt., and others _ that persuaded more than
120 nations to sign the 1997 treaty to ban land mines even though
the United States opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has offered to sign the treaty only if it is
amended to allow the continued use of land mines along the tense
border between North and South Korea for at least 19 more years and
to allow the use of anti-personnel mines in conjunction with
anti-tank mines. Currently, the United States has nearly a million
land mines that seed the border between the two Koreas along with
about 37,000 American soldiers standing guard.So far, Axworthy
said, more than 20 million mines elsewhere in the world have been
destroyed because of the treaty. He added that 18 of the 34
countries than manufactured land mines before the treaty have
ceased production.
</P>
<P>
   Canada and Axworthy also were at the center of a push in 1998 to
establish a permanent international criminal court, once more
against the wishes of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States objected to the court because there were no
controls to make sure that it would not be used maliciously against
American soldiers and officials involved in missions like the one
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But Axworthy said Friday that the United States has ``nothing to
fear'' from the international court. ``If the court fails to
receive support, what kind of message does that send to war
criminals, and, more importantly, what kind of message does that
send to the victims?'' he asked.Axworthy said Canada and other
nations can lend moral authority to help solve global problems, but
he acknowledged that the United States as the world's only
superpower plays a pivotal role. ``If the United States is a player
it makes it so much easier,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A native of Winnipeg, Axworthy, 60, studied urban affairs at
Princeton University in the early 1960s before returning to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He won a seat in the federal Parliament in 1979 as member of the
Liberal Party, where he staked out a leftist position in the
government of Pierre Trudeau.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Axworthy was mentioned as a possible candidate
for prime minister. But a few years later his hopes were derailed
when he led the opposition within the Liberal Party to Canada's
first free-trade treaty with the United States. The treaty passed,
and the business community exacted revenge by denying him funds he
needed to wage a campaign to win leadership of his party.After the
Liberals returned to power in 1993 behind Jean Chretien, Axworthy
was appointed human resources minister and three years later,
foreign minister.

 DEMS TRY TO AVOID MORTAL POLITICAL WOUND WITH DEATH TAX VOTE  
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ Southern Democrats
evidently believe that supporting inheritance taxes could mean
political death, making them a key group to watch if the
House-passed repeal of estate taxes draws a presidential veto.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative Democrats flocked to the GOP-sponsored plan to lift
estate taxes over 10 years despite complaints by President Clinton
and party leaders that the measure is mainly a windfall for the
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   The mutineers, many from rural areas, were more persuaded by
arguments that the tax was a hardship for farmers and small
business owners trying to pass their hard-earned holdings on to
their children or relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is outrageous that today it makes more sense to sell a
family-owned business before death rather than pass the business to
one's heirs,'' said Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few Southerners a little farther to the left backed the
repeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing what is prudent and right, we can ensure that the
lifeblood of many American families _ the small farm and the small
business _ will continue to survive,'' said Rep. Eva Clayton,
D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said while the proposal carries potent symbolism,
the GOP measure goes too far. They said present law already exempts
all but the largest estates and that a Democratic alternative to
cut estate taxes by 20 percent would assist people who need the
most help without an undue loss to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``A married couple with a farm or a small business would receive
a $4 million estate tax exclusion,'' said Rep. Karen Thurman,
D-Fla., estimating 98 percent of American farmers would get relief
under the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The 65 Democrats who backed the repeal gave Republicans a
sufficient margin to override a veto. The question is whether those
lawmakers will stick with the GOP if the measure comes back or side
with Clinton out of party loyalty. The jury is out, but some
Southerners indicated they would not support the override.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reserve the right to sustain the expected presidential veto
... unless needed changes are made,'' said Rep. Bobby Etheridge,
D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT TO KNOW
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Republican Jim DeMint believes taxpayers should
get what they pay for _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker introduced legislation that would allow members of
the public to more easily get their hands on reports from the
Congressional Research Service, a congressional agency that does
important studies. Access to some of the information is now
restricted and is available online only to members of Congress and
their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people, students, teachers, small businessmen,
farmers should be able to get this information and facts on which
we as Congress base our decisions,'' said DeMint. He introduced the
measure on behalf of the Citizen Legislators Caucus, a group
comprised of lawmakers who agreed to limit their own terms in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT NOT TO KNOW
</P>
<P>
   Another Southern lawmaker is trying to limit the circulation of
information of the classified variety.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who chairs the
Senate Intelligence Committee, is proposing legislation that would
make it a crime to disclose secret information to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   He and other panel members believe it will take criminal
prosecution if Washington is ever to lose its claim on being the
news leak capital of the world. The panel had a recent hearing on
the subject _ in secret of course.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the measure say it goes too far, particularly when
the government is inclined to put the top-secret stamp on documents
that don't qualify for such careful handling. The measure is
certain to run into a First Amendment fight though the bill does
not make publishing or receiving the material a crime.
</P>
<P>
   STAY IN SCHOOL
</P>
<P>
   Southern schools don't have the high dropout rates of a decade
or so ago but they show signs of slipping again, according to a new
report from the Southern Regional Education Board.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based group said that just two of 16 Southern states
_ South Carolina and Kentucky _ have dropout rates for teens 16-19
above those of 1986. But the overall regional rate crept back up to
13 percent in 1998 from 12 percent the year before. Twelve percent
is the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``States need to continue searching for ways to identify the
students who are most likely to quit school and need to provide
them with effective assistance and incentives to stay in school,''
the report said.

GENOCIDE SURVIVORS BITTER OVER ACQUITTAL OF BISHOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The acquittal of a prominent Roman Catholic
bishop on charges of genocide by a Rwandan court may help restore
relations between the church and the most Catholic state in Africa,
but it has also deepened bitter feelings among survivors still
waiting for justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican praised the exoneration Thursday of Augustin Misago,
the most senior Catholic official tried in connection with the 1994
slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans. The Holy See had
argued since Misago's arrest a year ago that indicting a bishop
meant indicting the church itself. Pope John Paul II took a
personal interest in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But as the news of Misago's release filtered through Rwandan
society Friday, reaction was divided. The decision comes at a
delicate time in the country's process of ethnic reconciliation.
Six years after the genocide, it is still in the early stages of
trying and punishing the murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Rwandans felt the church, which has given suspected Rwandan
clerics safe harbor across Europe and ignored pleas from
human-rights groups to apologize for failing to do more to halt the
bloodshed, would rather protect its image than promote healing.
Speculation spread Friday that the government, under the church's
influence, pressured the court to acquit Misago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mixed feelings everywhere now,'' said Tarsis
Karugarama, a justice of Rwanda's supreme court. Misago was tried
by a lower tribunal. ``Quite a lot of people are feeling downbeat,
as if the decision of the court was not correct. There is no
question that the Vatican was actively involved in Misago's case.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, 1994, during the height of the genocide, Misago
traveled to Kibeho in southern Rwanda, a town in his diocese that
was the site of gruesome ethnic slaughter. Barely a month earlier,
the Hutu-extremist government called on the Hutu majority to kill
all Tutsi, a minority group making up roughly 14 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Misago had gone to Kibeho to assure a group of 90 Tutsi
schoolchildren being held by Hutu extremists that they would be
safe. He brought policemen to provide for their security. Three
days later, the same police killed all but eight of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Across Rwanda, churches became killing fields. In two months,
according to most accounts, the Hutu killed at least 800,000 Tutsi
and moderate Hutu across the tiny central African state, which is
95 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Under assault from every direction, even from neighbors and next
of kin, Tutsi sought refuge in the shelter of the church. In many
instances, they were tragically mistaken in doing so. According to
scores of witnesses, pastors led, or left, their parishioners to
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Among the witnesses in Misago's trial were nuns and priests who
alleged that the bishop sat in on high-level meetings as provincial
politicians planned the genocide. Neither he, nor his lawyers,
denied those claims. ``If he had refused to go, he would've been
killed himself,'' said Alfred Pognon, one of Misago's lawyers,
after the acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has never responded to appeals from survivors, human
rights groups, and Rwandan government officials to apologize for
the alleged actions of its officials. Critics call that a striking
omission in an age when Pope John II's has apologized for sins
committed by members of the church, from the Crusades to the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican declined to comment on the issue of an apology.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1998 meeting of Catholic clergy in the city of Butare,
the papal nuncio reportedly said the Vatican would not apologize
for its role in or response to the genocide, but encouraged the
faithful to testify on behalf of accused clerics. The church has
actively pressured Rwanda to remove the death penalty from its
penal code.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter a month ago, as Misago faced the death penalty if
found guilty, the pope assured the bishop that he was praying daily
for the accused cleric.
</P>
<P>
   Aloysia Inyumba, the head of Rwanda's Unity and Reconciliation
Commission, said the church should not be singled out for its
response the genocide. The commission and the Council of Bishops in
Rwanda are now working jointly on programs to promote ethnic unity.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen more Catholic officials await trial. Two priests have
already been convicted. But others have fled prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The French Catholic church protected Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, a
Rwandan priest, for several years before he was finally brought to
trial in France. Late last year, another accused Rwandan cleric was
found ensconced in a church in Florence, giving Mass under a
pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based group African Rights has urged the Vatican to
act against nearly three dozen suspected church officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the pope in 1998, the organization wrote, ``There
is compelling evidence that a number of bishops, priests, nuns and
brothers were either complicit in genocide, or participated
directly in it. Given the scale and consistency of the accusations,
the reluctance of the Catholic church to act upon them is
regrettable. . . . The Catholic church cannot play a constructive
role in Rwanda for as long as it continues to provide sanctuary to
genocide suspects.''

<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It was about 88 degrees and muggy, and little
Ganesh was anxious to get into the pool, which hadn't opened for
the day yet.
</P>
<P>
   Several times when his mother wasn't watching too closely,
Ganesh sidled up to the barrier around the pool, stuck his head
underneath and tried to reach out and touch the water.
</P>
<P>
   If he couldn't get in the pool, at least he could feel how cool
the water was going to be when he got his chance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when you're a 2,200-pound 2-year-old, keeping cool on
a hot day is a major priority.
</P>
<P>
   Ganesh, his mother and two other Asian elephants are the
inhabitants and main attractions of the new Schott-Unnewehr
Vanishing Giants display at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical
Garden. And if Ganesh's reaction when he finally got to enter his
pool is any indication, the elephants love their expanded home.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanishing Giants habitat is built around the zoo's old
elephant house, where the elephants once trod day after day over
the hard-packed, nearly grassless clay soil around small enclosures
with all the charm of an abandoned gravel pit.
</P>
<P>
   Today the elephants have a half-acre compound including their
new 60,000-gallon outdoor swimming pool. With the new habitat for
giraffe and okapi, a species related to giraffe, Vanishing Giants
covers 4.3 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary reason for renovating the space was to give the
animals more room plus to simulate their native environment as much
as possible,'' said Dave Jenike, director of education for the
Cincinnati Zoo. ``The animals like it, and it lets us education
people about how the animals would live in the wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials said a contribution from Cincinnati Reds owner
Marge Schott helped make the $6 million Schott-Unnewehr Vanishing
Giants exhibit possible. The exhibit is named in honor of Schott
and her father and grandfather, Edward and Frank Unnewehr.
</P>
<P>
   The original elephant building was built in 1906 and is on the
National Register of Historic Places, so it was renovated rather
than replaced. The exterior of the building retained its original
shape, but its white walls were repainted and decorated with
ceramic tiles to mimic an Indian temple.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the building had a long center corridor with
animals displayed in cages along both sides. Now the building has
been reconfigured with small display areas just inside the
entrances for showing the animals during bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis is now on the outside areas surrounding the
building. The new outdoor display space was carved from areas that
were once walkways and parking lots, Jenike said.
</P>
<P>
   The top half of the elephant enclosure has a wide, grassy
plateau beside their swimming pool, and the lower end has shade
trees and a sand pit where the animals can toss sand on themselves
to discourage insects.
</P>
<P>
   For the Asian elephants as well as for the giraffe and okapi,
the zoo combined existing trees with new plants and some artificial
structures such as concrete termite mounds to give the displays an
authentic look.
</P>
<P>
   Jenike said, for example, that the okapi is a relative to the
giraffe that is native to the Ituri forest of the Congo, and the
okapi enclosure is built around a giant oak tree. ``The okapi's
native forests wouldn't have oak trees, but an oak has the same
kind of broad canopy you'd find there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we put some honey locust trees in with the Maasai
giraffes. Locusts aren't African, but they have the same leaf
structure as the African acacia. They even have thorns.''
</P>
<P>
   ALSO NEW AT THE ZOO
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Zoo is celebrating its 125th anniversary all this
year, and several new exhibits and special events are planned. In
addition to the Vanishing Giants exhibit, the zoo is opening the
Kroger Lords of the Arctic display for polar bears in July.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the zoo plans to add 125 animals to its collection in
2000 to commemorate its birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things to look for this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tide's Zoo Babies: The zoo's annual series of events
highlighted recent births at the zoo began last week and runs
through July 2. The young animals are spread throughout the zoo in
exhibits marked with 7-foot wooden storks. Among the featured
babies are a black rhino, a lowland gorilla, ruffed lemurs, Jacob's
sheep, black footed penguins, egrets, roseate spoonbills and
alligator snapping turtles. On weekends, the zoo holds special
meet-and-greet days during the Zoo Babies promotion to allow young
zoo visitors to meet characters such as Paddington Bear, Batman
Beyond, Arthur and the cast of the ``Big Comfy Couch.'' A contest
is also being held to name the zoo's four recently born
Indo-Chinese tigers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wonders from Down Under: Through July 11, the zoo is hosting a
pair of koalas on loan to Cincinnati from their home zoo. The zoo
is using the koala visit to focus on other examples of Australia's
unusual wildlife such as the kookaburra, Australian walking sticks
and other birds and reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kroger Lords of the Arctic: The display, scheduled to open
July 8, features a 12-foot-deep, 70,000-gallon pool with an
underwater viewing area that will allow zoo patrons to come face to
face with the swimming bears. The 21,000-square-foot exhibit is
about twice as large as the bears' old enclosure and has five
waterfalls and a replica of a polar bear den. A small adjoining
display will feature the Russian red tree squirrel. Lords of the
Arctic will have four polar bears, including a young brother and
sister pair that zoo patrons will name in a contest that begins
June 18.

THE BIGGEST GIFT

  When producer Jay Cohen needed a kidney, 
a total stranger just gave him one 
(For use after Mon., June 19, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You look good, Jay.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark is delivered with gusto, and maybe a little bit of
amazement by Suzi Landolphi, a former radio talk-show host, to Jay
Cohen, producer of the just-released movie ``Boys and Girls.'' In
another context, it could be a shmooze line _ something you're
expected to say to the person who you know has been through a bad
stretch, whether or not you actually believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But when Landolphi tells Cohen he's looking good, she's being
truthful. That Cohen, a hearty, bronzed 39-year-old, now seems the
picture of good health is, in large part, Landolphi's doing. Nearly
one year ago, she gave him a kidney, which has allowed Cohen to
reclaim his health and his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, he looked so (BEGIN ITAL)bad(END ITAL) when I first met
him,'' Landolphi says. ``I never realized how bad. Every time I see
him now, I go, `(expletive), he was really, really sick.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the transplant, Cohen, who suffered from a rare
kidney disease known as Alport syndrome, had lost 30 pounds and had
seen his skin turn several shades of green and yellow from the
poisons his kidneys weren't able to filter. His days and nights
were filled with nausea, blackouts, and itching and swollen skin.
And he was having a rough time on dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   That's when an unusual thing happened: Landolphi offered her
kidney to Cohen. The two are not related, nor were they friends.
They had met once for two minutes before Landolphi offered, nine
months later, to be a donor.
</P>
<P>
   Even more unusual was that Landolphi wasn't even a proper match.
A relatively new therapeutic technique pioneered by Dr. Stan
Jordan, a nephrologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, has reduced
the risk of rejection and allowed Cohen to receive a kidney from
Landolphi, a non- matching donor.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was given doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),
medication that has been used in past years to treat immune system
disorders. In this case, the medication would knock out a rare
antibody in Cohen's blood system that would likely reject a new
kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens up a big door in terms of donors,'' says Jordan,
adding that he is optimistic for Cohen's future. ``Suzi wasn't
related to Jay, and they didn't have a lot of compatibility, but
just being blood-group compatible was enough.'' As long as the two
of them were blood-group compatible.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as Landolphi was willing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was quite interesting,'' Jordan says. ``We discussed this
with her, the possibility that the kidney could be lost. It was a
big sacrifice, but she felt the most important thing was to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in chaises next to the pool of Cohen's Tarzana home,
Landolphi and Cohen talk about those difficult days that remind
them how they can help other people know what experiences to expect
while waiting for an organ donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people on dialysis, so many people waiting
for hearts and livers and kidneys,'' says Cohen. ``Less than 2
percent of the population is an organ donor. It's a joke. AIDS and
cancer get all the attention in the world. With kidney, heart,
liver and lungs, nobody does anything to get the research to make
transplants better or to figure out how to make the drugs better.''
</P>
<P>
   Landolphi and Cohen also banter and tease, make countless
off-color jokes, interrupt each other, occasionally disagree, but
never argue. They seem perfectly tuned in to each other's sense of
humor _ frequently of the gallows variety; and there appears to be
no boundary one or the other isn't allowed to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sharing a vital organ establishes that kind of bond
between donor and recipient. Never one to crave sugary foods in the
past, Cohen is convinced he now has Landolphi's sweet tooth. When
he beats her at racquetball, Landolphi jokingly sniffs that Cohen
``got the fast kidney.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such a bond wouldn't be easy to research. The number
of people who have been living organ donors is slim enough. Rarer
still is a donor who isn't a relative of the organ recipient
(immediate relatives have the best chance of being a genetic
match).
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year after the transplant, Cohen has weathered one
substantial rejection and is back to his pre-illness routines. A
combination of 30 pills a day _ down from 50 _ has his system on
the right track. The medication _ which includes three
immunosuppressive drugs, steroids and vitamins _ raises his blood
pressure and reduces muscle mass. So Cohen has to work out to
maintain his weight and strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't gain weight no matter what. I could sit and eat all
day long and not gain weight,'' said Cohen, who now tips the scales
at 178 pounds. ``The good news is I have a whole new diet plan to
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen knows that he may need dialysis and another transplant in
the future, and you get the idea that if Landolphi had an extra
kidney, she'd go through the entire process again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can donate is half my liver,'' says
Landolphi, ``and I'm saving that for my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Landolphi's generosity of spirit talking, but it's also
her practical nature. To hear Landolphi tell it, she was able to
help a person in need. The question isn't why would she choose to
give up a kidney, but why (BEGIN ITAL)wouldn't(END ITAL) she?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge, big deal. I just felt capable of doing it,''
said Landolphi, 50, whose husband, David, was also willing to give
Cohen a kidney. ``There's something about being a living donor.
There's probably a mindset that makes you able to do this easily.
It doesn't make me better. It's just a mindset I happened to
have.'' Landolphi's decision had nothing to do with any bond
between her and Cohen _ that came later. She and her husband met
Cohen once at a mutual friend's wedding _ an event that Cohen had
to leave after 45 minutes because it was his second day off
dialysis and he was feeling sick.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the Landolphis heard regular reports
about Cohen's condition. Later, upon learning Cohen had ended up in
the emergency room and had almost died, Landolphi started thinking
that she might be able to help. A week later, she told her husband
she was going to offer Cohen one of her kidneys. David Landolphi,
it turns out, had been thinking about making the same offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Landolphis called their doctor and then their daughter. Then
they called Cohen, who was prepared to nix the idea. Two earlier
donors had already backed out _ one two days before the transplant
was scheduled to take place _ and neither Cohen nor his wife,
Laura, was anxious to be disappointed a third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dead against it; the hospital didn't want to do it,''
said Cohen. ``There are liability issues, questions about, `Why is
she doing this?' 'What did he promise her?' For me, I just didn't
want the guilt. I didn't want that responsibility. It was my life,
and I was either going to deal with it or I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Replies Landolphi, ``That's such a wonderful, admirable value _
`I'll take care of my own problems and my own family,' but it's not
really realistic. We're put on this earth to take care of each
other. You can't do anything on your own today, and neither can I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our success has helped Cedars get over some of their
fear about using live donors,'' she adds. ``A live donor is
physically better than a cadaver.'' &QL;

TWA AND AIRTRAN ARE IN MERGER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of struggling Trans World Airlines Inc. and financially
strapped AirTran Holdings Inc. rose Friday after it was revealed
that the two airlines were engaged in merger discussions. But
people close to the talks said there was little chance of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AirTran is going to buy TWA, it is going to need money,''
said an investment banker who has talked to both companies. ``I
don't see how they are going to do that other than with junk bonds,
and the junk-bond market is very weak right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the United States' leading airlines, TWA has seen
its fortunes decline in recent years as it sold its international
routes and focused on its hub in St. Louis. The airline was in
bankruptcy twice during the 1990s, and it continues to lose money
while other airlines are profiting from the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has been searching for a buyer for some time, according to
industry insiders. But despite a young fleet of planes and
operational improvements that have the airline leading the industry
in on-time arrivals, there has been little interest from major
carriers, because TWA's financial and labor woes are seen as much
bigger than the strategic value of its route network.
</P>
<P>
   TWA would not say whether it was talking to AirTran. ``We have
had and continue to have conversations with many airlines about
possible business transactions,'' Mark Abels, TWA's spokesman, said
Friday. ``And we are always open to a transaction that makes sense
for our employees and shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   An AirTran spokesman also declined to confirm any talks, which
were reported Friday by the Atlanta Journal and Constitution and
The Wall Street Journal. However, Leslie Head, AirTran's vice
president was quoted in the Journal and Constitution as saying that
the talks were ``preliminary'' and that AirTran would be the
acquirer if there was a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers and analysts found that difficult to believe.
AirTran had only $100 million in cash at the end of the first
quarter. Last month Boeing Co. agreed to slow its delivery of 48
100-seat 717 jets to AirTran in order to give the carrier some
financial breathing room. AirTran also faces the challenge of
repaying $230 million in junk bonds due in April.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of TWA rose 31.25 cents, to $2.875, while AirTran shares
jumped 25 cents, to $4.5625.

WESTERN PROVINCES VOW DEFIANCE AS CANADA REGISTERS GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Earlier this year, Charlton Heston _ the actor turned
fire-breathing head of America's National Rifle Association _ made
an unusual appearance before a Canadian hunters group urging the
hard-pressed sports shooters to unite to fight ``anti-gun
madness.''
</P>
<P>
   The response was polite, with Heston's talk occasionally broken
by cries of, ``Hear! Hear!'' Still, the rally was hardly the
barn-burner it would have been in the United States. Even among gun
lovers, guns _ much less ``gun rights'' _ just don't provoke all
that much passion in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But that shows sign of changing as a sweeping new federal gun
law goes into effect, creating a mammoth National Firearms Registry
that is bitterly opposed by Canadian shooters, especially in
Western provinces and Arctic regions.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, mainstream gunowners are openly vowing to
defy the government and refuse to submit to the stringent new
federal registration requirements for all rifles and shotguns.
(Ownership of handguns has long been tightly restricted in Canada.)
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the provincial governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan
vowed to defy the federal law by refusing to bring charges against
citizens who fail to register their rifles or shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is an onerous burden with no social benefit,''
said Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. ``It is unworkable, extremely
expensive, and does not prevent or discourage gun crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, all Canadian gunowners must complete detailed
government forms to register their arms, pay a $60 fee and obtain a
special photo identification. Their names go onto a central data
base, and they may be monitored by federal law enforcement
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As of the end of this year, citizens who fail to cooperate will
face criminal penalties, including prison terms, and federal
confiscation of their firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But a most un-Canadian-like campaign of civil disobedience is
boiling up in the nation's vast rural realms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to jail before I comply,'' said Bruce Hutton of
Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, a former Royal Canadian Mounted
Police officer and owner of three firearms. ``I'm not a criminal,
and I refuse to have the government treat me like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Such rhetoric, commonplace among American gunowners, is seldom
heard in Canada, where there is no constitutional guarantee of a
right to bear arms and little tradition of opposition to gun
controls. Canada started strictly regulating handgun ownership back
in the 1930s, when Americans were still debating whether it was
okay for citizens to pack machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   But now the anger of law-abiding Canadian gunowners is booming
loud off the prairies, mountains, and icepacks of the far west and
great north, and even finding an echo among rural dwellers in the
Atlantic provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've used my rifle for naught but hunting for 30 years,'' said
Josef Gunderson, a wilderness guide in Newfoundland's Labrador
region. ``Now comes this gang of bureaucrats wanting to put my
picture on a plastic card and record every by-Jesus detail of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He added sarcastically: ``I'm sure the real stick-up men,
muggers, killers, and other villains will be rushing to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada, with 30 million people, is home to about 6 million
legally owned firearms, mostly hunting rifles and shotguns. By
contrast, Americans own more than 200 million firearms, including
60 million handguns. The rate of gun-related crimes committed in
Canada is about 20 percent that of the US.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that more than 70 percent of Canadians support strict
gun laws, a demographic reality that goes a long way toward
explaining why the country's pro-gun groups are so much more meek
and mild than American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, because mass murders and other especially spectacular
crimes involving guns are rare _ at least compared to the next door
neighbor _ Canadians tend to profoundly shocked by them. The new
law coming into effect represents Ottawa's response to the 1989
slaying of 14 women at a Montreal university by a rifle-wielding
madman, Marc Lepine.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the law creates a new federal bureaucracy charged
with registering every firearm in Canada as well licensing very
gunowner. The cost of creating the registry has already soared past
$300 million and is likely to eventually cost taxpayers $1.5
billion just to process existing gunowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Big Brother madly chasing after poor old Uncle
George's goose gun,'' said Jim Hinter, vice president of the
Alberta-based National Firearms Association. ``This is about
politicians clueless as to how to deal with real criminals, so
let's just hassle the heck out of legal gunowners.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the law were dealt a serious blow this week when
the Canadian Supreme Court threw out a legal challenge to the
registry brought by the governments of Alberta and five other
provinces along with the Yukon and Northwest Territories. In a
unanimous ruling, the country's nine justices declared that ``all
guns pose a risk to public safety'' and can therefore be regulated
under the criminal code.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is said that, at the moment of death, a person's
life flashes before him. Kenneth Neighbors experienced a similar
phenomenon at the opposite end of life.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his son's birth, Neighbors mentally watched
little Kenneth Joseph mature from child to teenager to adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 17 or 18 years, he'll be graduating from high school,''
Neighbors said of his 34-hour-old infant. ``I look at him and think
how my mom must have felt watching us grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, a 33-year-old lawyer from Atlanta, was among new
fathers visiting the maternity unit at Crawford Long Hospital of
Emory University last week. In the minutes it had taken for a
doctor to remove the baby from the womb in a Caesarean section,
Neighbors acquired a brand-new identity.
</P>
<P>
   Father, dad, daddy, papa or pops, men here on this bustling
hospital hallway know their lives will never be the same. Most are
awed by the little people who have suddenly overwhelmed their
lives. They stare, full of wonder, at every feature, from the tops
of silk-covered heads to the tiniest plump, stubby toe.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many fathers are involved in every step of the pregnancy
and birth, said obstetrician Dr. Michael Randell, 35 and single.
``It's wonderful to see women bring their spouses to prenatal
visits, see dads touch their bellies and listen to the heart tones,
see their excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching families being made ``is a great feeling,'' said
Randell. ``It's why I chose obstetrics and gynecology.''
</P>
<P>
   A birth, even though the child is not your own, is ``a
spiritually incredible experience,'' said Dr. Andrew Toledo, 44, an
Atlanta physician who specializes in reproductive problems. ``The
more I watch what couples go through, the more I am humbled by the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a father of three teenagers, Toledo also knows that the
challenges don't end in the delivery room. ``Parenthood is tough,''
he said. ``It's not for wimps, especially in today's age. You have
to be intellectually, physically and emotionally tough to take them
on and raise them right.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatherhood ``redefines your entire self,'' said the Rev. Bill
Reeves, 29. ``It redefines your work. It redefines your marriage.
It really makes you value the importance of family, to make sure
they're first priority in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' wife _ also a United Methodist minister, the Rev.
Melanie Reeves _ gave birth to their first child, daughter Kinsey,
on Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite mistakes, despite failures, out of God's abundant
grace, he gave us this child,'' said Reeves. Through Kinsey, Reeves
said, ``we have the opportunity to influence the world we live in.
It's just neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Neat, perhaps, but not always easy
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long-term challenge,'' said Harold Stiefel, 39, a
father of five. ``You don't just sprinkle water on them and watch
them grow. You become very aware of your own interactions. Children
do what they see, not what they're taught. What you want your child
to become, you have to be first.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiefel's family, Orthodox Jews, have a tradition that began
with their first daughter, now 12. On Friday evenings as they usher
in the Sabbath, parents and children gather in the living room to
sing traditional Jewish songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with one kid sitting on a lap and it just became
part of our weekly tradition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The togetherness helps each child, with his or her unique
personality, to develop a sense of family.
</P>
<P>
   A child, no matter how he or she arrived into the family, is a
uniting of past and future, of ancestors and possible generations
yet unborn.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Patrick, 52, became a father when 4-year-old Ivan arrived
from Russia last summer. Unlike the fathers in the maternity unit,
Patrick had to have the recommendations of ``doctors, friends and
bureaucrats'' before he could become Ivan's dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Ivan is a happy American kid of 5 who speaks almost no
Russian but is proud of his heritage,'' Patrick said. ``He starts
kindergarten in late summer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Patrick and other men celebrating their first Father's Day
as fathers this year, the day will be very special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say thanks to God and thanks to Ivan,'' Patrick said. ``I'm
glad to be a dad.''

   DIGITAL-SIGNATURES (Washington) _ Without one disapproving vote,
the Senate on Friday passed a final bill that catapults electronic
commerce to a new level by allowing consumers and businesses to
sign contracts online with the click of a mouse. By giving
electronic signatures the legal weight of paper signatures, the new
law would give consumers the chance to buy health insurance,
complete bank loans or set up brokerage accounts over the Internet,
around the clock and with no delay. By Lizette Alvarez and Jeri
Clausing.

   SINGER-HEIR _ The Mississippi Supreme Court on Friday ruled that
Claud Johnson, a 69-year-old retired gravel truck driver, is the
heir of the blues singer Robert Johnson and entitled to about $1
million in royalties. The court based its decision on the
videotaped testimony of Johnson's late mother and the testimony of
a friend of hers who said she saw her making love to the singer
nine months before Johnson was born in 1931. By Rick Bragg.

   BBA-KNOBLAUCH-PSYCHOLOGY (Undated) _ In baseball, the second
baseman stands about 50 or 60 feet from first base and is often
called on to throw the ball to first before the batter can get
there. It's not a particularly difficult play _ in fact, it might
be one of the easiest in baseball _ and yet Chuck Knoblauch, an
All-Star-caliber major leaguer, finds himself almost overwhelmed by
the task. The problem is clearly in his head, but why? By Erica

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once, snakeskin had the fashion cachet of a prison
tattoo. Urban cowboys and rockers wore it. So did creeps.
Snakeskin? Think Joey Buttafuoco's signature boots.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a little marketing makes. Designers satisfied
this year's cash-rich consumers by giving a makeover to python,
skin taken from Asian snakes laced with primeval, netlike designs.
Yves Saint Laurent sold out its line of $9,250 python trench coats.
Jimmy Choo offered $550 python slides in traffic-stopping bright
green. A pink python jacket from Chanel, with white chiffon trim
and matching skirt, retailed at $8,455. It sold out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Python did incredibly well,'' said Mariah Chase, a Jimmy Choo
spokeswoman. ``It was all about luxury and exoticism. It was a
maximalism kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For fashion houses, the metamorphosis of python from ruffian
chic to Park Avenue popularity has been an irrefutable hit. But
among conservationists, the snake's makeover has been ringing
alarms. Does it signal a new round of consumers wearing wildlife
products with light-headed nonchalance? If so, which animals will
be next? And what about those snakes? In an era of shrinking
habitat, are there really enough pythons out there to outfit every
acquisitive fashion princess?
</P>
<P>
   Having a python cellphone cover may be unmistakably hip, but it
is an image oddly disconnected from the product's origins. A world
away from the cubicles where fashion magazine pages are designed,
this year's python craze is supplied by an international industry
that snatches hundreds of thousands of wild pythons from jungles
each year, kills them and ships their skins to European and Asian
garment factories, all the while avoiding the notoriety that has
dogged other commercial wildlife harvests, from the seal hunters of
Newfoundland to the whalers of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The python hunt is legal, as is the export of the skins. But
conservationists say that no one is certain whether the most
heavily traded species, reticulated and blood pythons, both agents
of rat control in some of the world's poorest nations, can sustain
their numbers under the sort of hunting that keeps department
stores stocked.
</P>
<P>
   Pythons are creatures virtually without advocates. Many details
of their lives are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of these snakes, there is absolutely no information
on what is happening with the hunts or how the species are
faring,'' said Dr. John Thorbjarnarson, a herpetologist with the
Wildlife Conservation Society, headquartered at the Bronx Zoo.
``That is really a frightening thing.'' Pythons are nonvenomous
tropical predators that strike from hiding and then twist their
bodies around their prey, flexing their hold until the animal
suffocates. The dead victim is swallowed headfirst. Sated pythons
slither off to digest.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975, trade in these reptiles has been subject to
guidelines set by the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, or CITES, a wildlife
commerce treaty signed by 150 nations, which require each country
to establish and supervise a conservation policy. According to the
convention, more than 10 million pythons have been reported taken
from the wild in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The snakes are harvested from a long list of nations, including
Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. But the unequivocal export
leader is Indonesia, where harvesting pythons is a highly organized
business. From 1985 to 1998, the last year for which data are
available, Indonesia exported more than 4.5 million pythons, either
skinned or alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge industry, but it keeps to itself,'' said Kamuran
Tepedelen, who owns Bushmaster Reptiles, a Boulder, Colo.-based
company that employs Indonesian snake catchers for the pet trade.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for four fashion houses that use python said they
had no idea where the skins came from, a response evidently little
different from that of consumers. ``It's very rare, honestly, that
we think about where they come from, and what the ecological impact
might be,'' Chase of Jimmy Choo said.
</P>
<P>
   The most coveted species in the exotic leather trade is the
reticulated python, arguably the largest snake in the world.
Reticulated pythons are the anacondas of Asia, having been reported
at lengths of more than 30 feet, although 10- to 17-foot snakes are
typical. They feed on a variety of vertebrates, including rats,
ducks, chickens, porcupines, pigs and monkeys. In rare instances
the largest specimens have attacked humans.
</P>
<P>
   Each year from 1985 to 1998, between 305,000 and 834,000
reticulated pythons were reported harvested worldwide; a large
portion came from Indonesia. Actual trade is believed to be larger
because of smuggling. Much of the rest of the trade is in skins
from blood pythons, fat-bodied snakes that reach maximum lengths of
about 7 feet. Once considered uncommon, blood pythons have
benefited in recent years as vast tracts of rain forest have given
way to oil palm plantations. These new habitats _ replete with
brush piles and palm fruit _support an extraordinary density of
rats.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the rats' abundance has allowed blood pythons, which
feed on them, to colonize the plantations. And as their numbers
have increased, the snakes have attracted skin hunters. In 1985,
32,000 blood pythons were exported worldwide. In 1998, reported
shipments reached 127,000.
</P>
<P>
   To convert pythons into profits, Indonesia's snake-harvesting
industry relies on an army of catchers. Most are villagers who
simply encounter a snake and pounce on it, selling it later for
serendipitous cash. Others are more systematic and take regular
walks through the palm plantations, peering into brush piles and
plucking blood pythons from hiding places. A few ambitious hunters
work in groups, settings nets, traps and baited hooks for the
larger reticulated pythons. Captured snakes are stored in canvas
bags and sold to primitive skinning plants. What happens next is
unsightly, although industry representatives and scientists say it
is no more unsettling than what occurs in meat-packing houses
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The pythons are dumped from their bags and killed by suffocation
or mallet blows. The carcasses are hung by their heads and inflated
with water. A skinner then slits open the carcass, snips out the
guts and scrapes away the meat. Depending on the market, some of
the meat ends up being eaten, and some is used as livestock feed or
discarded. In some cases python gall bladders are sold for use in
traditional Chinese medicine. But the main product is the skin,
which is pegged, dried and sent to tanneries. Most tanned skins are
exported to Europe, where they are converted into all manner of
clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The industry employs about 174,200 people, including everyone
from skinners to international sales agents, according to the
Indonesian Reptile and Amphibian Trade Association, which
represents licensed tanneries and reptile-product exporters. About
150,000 of the workers are snake catchers, most of them in
persistently poor regions. They are paid a small sum for each
snake.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reality is that for these Indonesian villages, the
snakes are an important economic resource,'' said Dr. Richard
Shine, a University of Sydney (Australia) herpetologist who toured
Indonesian skinning plants for python studies.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has existed for decades, subject to the capricious
moods of the fashion industry and its equally capricious customers.
But some conservationists say the skins' recent appearance on the
runways is tied as much to the fine points of international trade
law as to the vagaries of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the endangered species convention adopted rules
requiring tags and permits for crocodilian products shipped across
international borders. These rules, which did not affect snakes
directly, complicated shipments for products from certain reptiles
_ crocodiles, alligators and caimans _ often causing border delays
or seizures, a potential catastrophe for retailers expecting
seasonal merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Since python skins are not covered by the tagging rules, they
cross borders with comparative ease. Experts say this
characteristic made them attractive when designers began seeking
exotic leather for consumers flush with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakeskins are not nearly as complicated to import and
export,'' said Craig Hoover, of Traffic-North America, the trade
monitoring arm of the World Wildlife Fund. ``They just don't run
into the same possibilities of delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, wildlife inspectors say they have noticed a
significant increase in the number of snakeskin products entering
the United States. ``From an industry's standpoint I guess I can
understand it,'' said Sheila Einsweiler, a senior inspector for the
Fish and Wildlife Service. ``It's a little easier to move
snakeskins around.''
</P>
<P>
   As more skins entered the country and began to bear brand-name
labels, pythons' sudden popularity invigorated a long-running
debate among scientists about the species' sustainability.
Herpetologists are particularly worried about reticulated pythons,
which do not seem to thrive in plantations, and whose skins bear
the netlike pattern most desired by designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reticulated pythons are giant snakes, remarkable creatures,
but they are not adequately protected, and their trade is barely
regulated,'' said Peter Brazaitis, a herpetologist and the former
curator of animals at the Central Park Wildlife Center. ``Five
years from now, if python fashion keeps going, how many of them
will be left?''
</P>
<P>
   The answers are not clear. Under endangered species trade rules,
exporting countries must base their hunts on scientific studies and
limit harvests ``to maintain the species throughout its range and
at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystem in which it
occurs.'' But little field research has been done on Asian pythons.
Wildlife experts say there is almost no way of knowing whether the
convention's standards are being met and whether the various
species, or their roles in the ecosystem, are being preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies are not encouraging. A 1990 report done for the
convention's secretariat noted that for reticulated pythons,
``there is reasonable evidence for a significant decline in
Bangladesh, and the species is reported to be depleted locally over
much of the remainder of the range, including Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   But since then, opinions on the hunt's impact have varied.
Tepedelen, of Bushmaster Reptiles, said harvests are sustainable
because catchers generally do not kill immature reptiles, meaning
most of those killed have already been allowed to lay clutches of
eggs and propagate the species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The species that are in trade are just booming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shine, the Australian herpetologist and one of the few
scientists who have studied the harvest of reticulated pythons,
said he has been surprised by the species' resilience.
``Reticulated pythons have the life history of a garter snake,'' he
said. ``They grow fast, mature quickly and have a lot of eggs in
each clutch. As a species, it can withstand a fair bit of
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of these characteristics, the species has declined in
some areas. ``It's not an issue about extinction, but there is no
doubt that the commercial trade is reducing the numbers,'' Shine
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian reptile traders' organization has been working
with field researchers and the Indonesian government to ensure that
the hunt is sustainable. But field biologists caution that
sustainable or not, it may have public health consequences. That is
because the snakes are being removed from an ecosystem heavily
populated with rats.
</P>
<P>
   While harvesting pythons may generate profits locally, some
scientists say, they leave behind rats, which carries social costs,
including increases in disease and damage to crops. ``I think we
have to ask ourselves, what is the value of a python?'' said
Brazaitis. ``Is it as a pair of expensive pants? Or is it as a
means to check exploding rat populations in nations where
communicable diseases are rampant?''
</P>
<P>
   This month, the knockoff-bag merchants were selling fake python
clutches and baguettes on the sidewalks outside Bloomingdale's, a
sure sign the snakeskin craze has gone down-market and is nearing
its end. And even though python products remained in some display
windows throughout the city, a salesman at the Original Leather
Store, which operates six boutiques in Manhattan, was pronouncing
the snake dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sick of it,'' he said, pointing toward a pair of python
pants on display overhead, rich maroon hip-huggers, the remains of
a midsize reticulated python. The salesman rolled his eyes and
sighed. ``It's going to be very dated, very fast,'' he said. ``I
think it's the acid wash of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether sinking snakeskin sales in New York City will mean more
pythons in the wild is an open question. The skins remain popular
in Europe, and snakeskin boots are likely to maintain their hold
over would-be rock stars and barroom cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, at least, pythons may soon be getting a
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard,'' the salesman said, ``that in the fall, it's
ostrich that will be hot.''

WHAT TO EXPECT AT PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 18)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to turn a Ford into a Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is what a lot of investors expected would happen at
Procter &AMP; Gamble, the $40 billion consumer products giant, after
Durk I. Jager was installed as chief executive about 18 months ago.
Jager had committed the company to shifting out of cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   But some people on Wall Street now think that he nearly stripped
the gears. Procter missed its higher earnings estimates for the
last couple of quarters, and its stock is down nearly 50 percent so
far this year. This month, Jager resigned.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves A.G. Lafley, his successor, in a tough spot.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Hay, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, took some time last
week to talk about the company and its prospects. Following are
excerpts from the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some have argued that Durk Jager was victimized by Wall
Street, which wanted and expected Procter &AMP; Gamble to grow faster
than it realistically could. Do you agree? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Most companies have become much more sensitive to the demands
of their shareholders, and Procter is no exception. It had been
viewed as a slow-moving, ponderous kind of company, and Wall Street
was pushing for change.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, money managers have very short time horizons, and
companies are judged on 3-month, 6-month and 12-month results,
which are the same periods they themselves are judged.
</P>
<P>
   Given their size and sizeable market shares, Procter faces a
unique challenge. But in a perfect world you want to see the
company continually raise the bar. They have resources others
don't.
</P>
<P>
   If you are big it is hard to grow, but size gives them a
remarkable ability to negotiate with their suppliers, which means
they can keep costs lower than competitors. And they have more
leverage with retailers, which should give them an ability to get
new products on the market quicker than a small, untested company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you were surprised that Durk Jager stepped down?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I was surprised it happened so quickly. Given the scope of
what he wanted to do, I would have thought there would have been a
little more time. There was such monumental organizational change
going on that it shouldn't have been judged in a short time frame.
</P>
<P>
   Procter's culture is very deliberate. Decisions don't get made
off the cuff. There is a lot of research and thinking devoted to
each move, and it might be somewhat more inward-looking than most
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Durk's job was to come in and shake it up a little bit. That
happened, but the outcome was not what they expected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sort of changes was Jager trying to effect? And what is
going to survive? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Among other things, the company's reporting structure was
changed, and so were people's responsibilities and titles. At the
same time, the organizational mind-set was being changed to be more
risk-tolerant and fast-paced. I don't think they will undo the
change in organizational structure. And while they might encourage
a modest amount of risk-taking, they will be a little bit slower to
implement it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But hasn't Procter's performance been hindered by more than
just the effort to change its culture? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. While you have all this internal movement, outside of the
company raw-materials prices were rising and the euro was
plummeting against the dollar. Also, its product categories are
very mature. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you expect things to change with Lafley in charge? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Given his history, I think Lafley will focus on Procter's
core businesses and get out of things that are tangential. That
means that on balance they would be less likely to acquire
something than they were under Durk Jager. A bid for a food
business like Nabisco, for example, would surprise me.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Lafley strikes me as someone who will be more like the
Procter of old, someone who will make everyone feel more
comfortable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does the company need to do to get upward movement in
its stock price?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Procter has some issues that are unique to Procter, but the
environment is a tough one for household products.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current earnings outlook, I think the stock is pretty
fairly priced.
</P>
<P>
   But if Lafley can put together a credible plan, with objectives
people think are realistic, that will help.
</P>
<P>
   I really hope they lower their revenue and earnings targets.
Right now, I think they are stretch goals.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven percent growth in earnings is more realistic than their
current estimates of 13 percent to 15 percent. And top-line growth
of around 5 percent, while they are saying 6 percent to 7 percent,
is a credible revenue number. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there any new products in the pipeline that have the
potential to create lots of incremental growth? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They have a lot of really interesting, technologically
innovative new products. But Procter is a $40 billion company, and
it needs a lot of them. There is not one that will move the dial
for them.

 &HT;    New Baptist leader's church refuses to stand pat
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gather together its membership and First Baptist
Church of Snellville, Ga. is nearly as big as the city it calls
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years that the Rev. James Merritt has pastored the
church, membership has grown from 500 to nearly 11,000, just a few
thousand short of Snellville's population.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing Merritt's evangelical success, the Southern Baptist
Convention elected him president this week in Orlando. Merritt's
conservative views mesh well with the SBC.
</P>
<P>
   What's most striking about First Baptist's growth, say its
members, is that Merritt hasn't compromised his traditional Baptist
beliefs to gain congregants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks straight from the book,'' said 42-year-old Mike
Ridgeway, a George W. Bush man, according to the bumper sticker on
his white Ford truck. ``There's none of this riding the fence
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when churches are struggling with progressive trends
toward the acceptance of homosexuality and a liberal reading of the
Bible, First Baptist remains firmly conservative _ the Bible is
infallible, homosexuality is sinful and divorce is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty agree with that message, especially in the largely
Republican area of Snellville. With a $6 million annual budget,
First Baptist is the county's second largest church in membership,
and it employs 75 people full-time. More than 4,200 worshipers pass
through the church on Sundays. Merritt's evangelical message and
beliefs have taken First Baptist into the ranks of metro Atlanta's
so-called megachurches.
</P>
<P>
   From busy U.S. 78, though, First Baptist could easily go
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring a Huddle House and surrounded by strip shopping
centers, the church's traditional red brick and white columns are
nearly lost within Snellville's congested commercial heart. The
church's tall steeple struggles to stand out among the fast-food
signs below.
</P>
<P>
   But First Baptist's parking lots betray its true scope. As if
marking a marathon route, a yellow line guides guests from the
street across acres of blacktop to various parking areas in the
rear. A Disney-like tram shuttles worshipers from the lots to the
sanctuary for one of four Sunday services and a university-sized
array of Bible study classes.
</P>
<P>
   While adults worship in the main sanctuary, children pass
through the mural-covered hallways of a three-story classroom
building that stretches back like a giant multiplex theater. The
pastoral scenes color every inch of wall space in certain areas.
Scenes depict Joseph and Mary, and a kneeling Jesus surrounded by
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the children's worship suite, kids watch puppet shows staged
in King's Town, a set made of colorful wooden facades. Teens listen
to Christian rock bands and pray in a room that looks much like a
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you offer something of quality to a child, parents will
come,'' said Matt Wethington, minister to Church Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that's the point. In true evangelical spirit,
Merritt has created a church that uses its facilities to ``bring
people to God,'' Wethington said.
</P>
<P>
   Music is important to that end. First Baptist's choir rehearsal
room is as big as some churches. A music school sponsored by the
church serves more non-members than members.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its success, First Baptist's ever-expanding outreach
programs are always looking for the next frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The church spends thousands of dollars a week to buy television
air time for Merritt's Sunday sermons, which are taped in a modern
sanctuary that includes an orchestra pit. An independent production
company the church founded edits the film at a high-tech studio
within First Baptist. The sermons are broadcast on local
television, and nationally on the Trinity Broadcasting Network and
on Family Net.

BRITONS HOLD ON TO WORLD WAR II HATRED OF GERMANS

<P>
   MARAZION, England _ Two weeks ago, Gabbi Muller wasn't too
surprised when a group of English people called the German high
school students she had brought to Cornwall a bunch of Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Muller, a teacher, knew there is latent hostility to Germans in
Britain, especially among those old enough to remember World War II
and the Blitz. What stunned and saddened Muller, and even some
Britons, was that a group of adults were encouraging some young
children to hurl stones, water balloons, and obscenity-laden
epithets at her and her students.
</P>
<P>
   While stories of British heroism and resilience during World War
II are passed down the generations, so, too, is hatred of Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that disturbing blend of patriotism, jingoism, and
bigotry will reach a crescendo as England takes on Germany in the
European soccer championships being played in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   While English soccer hooligans don't need an excuse to hate the
Germans, they have plenty of inspiration, much of it emanating from
the mainstream media. Last year, the Sunday Times ran a magazine
cover story in which A.A. Gill, the newspaper's restaurant and TV
critic, wrote, ``We all hate the Germans. Come on, it's all right,
admit it, we're all agreed, we hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   While meant to be humorous, many Germans, and even some Britons,
considered the piece as racist as any propaganda produced by
Hitler's Third Reich. The then-German ambassador to Britain,
Gebhardt von Moltke, said he thought the article promoted the kind
of xenophobia that inspires verbal and physical attacks on Germans
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As he was preparing to leave his London post, von Moltke
delivered some parting shots, lamenting that British newspapers
``characterize us as Huns and Krauts who eat bratwurst and take the
best seats around the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   While relations between Britain and Germany as good, von Moltke
said, there needs to be greater ``recognition by the public and
some of the media that today's Germany is a modern, open, and
democratic society which differs fundamentally from the one of the
1930s and 1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Moltke said hearing Britons dismiss him and his countrymen
as Nazis was especially hurtful _ two of his uncles were executed
after they attempted -- and failed -- to assassinate Hitler in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   While the perception is that soccer hooligans are often poor and
uneducated, research by British police has found that some are
actually middle-class, with good jobs, wives, and children. So are
some of those who mouth anti-German sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a pub in a comfortable neighborhood in North
London, an English lawyer and father of three said he had no
sympathy for the German tourists who were attacked in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serves them right, the Nazi bastards,'' said the lawyer, who
only a few months ago lamented that the former Chilean dictator,
Augusto Pinochet, was allowed to escape prosecution for crimes
against humanity. The lawyer explained that many members of his
family died fighting the Germans in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   While others who suffered at the hands of the Third Reich have
gone out of their way to reconcile with the Germans, most notably
the French, the British have remained the coolest in western
Europe. Sir Roy Denman, the former European Union ambassador to
Washington, says that attitude has influenced Britain's ambivalence
toward European integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British look at how well the Germans and the French get on
and it bothers them,'' says Denman, who argues Britain should be a
leader of the European Union alongside France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Denman believes the British attitude toward Germans and the
European Union is greatly influenced by its wartime experience.
While the Germans rolled across Europe, conquering and occupying
all in their path, only Britain held out. Londoners withstood the
Blitz, and the Royal Air Force fiercely defended against a
threatened German invasion in the Battle of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Denman says that history has led many Britons to conclude they
can stand alone without Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Gross, a spokeswoman for the German embassy in London,
said the attack on the German tourists was not unique, but
``neither are such attacks widespread or common.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said the embassy had received telephone calls and letters
from English people saying they were outraged by the most recent
attack. ``Basically, they were apologizing for the behavior of some
of their countrymen,'' said Gross.
</P>
<P>
   But Muller, the German teacher who brought her students to St.
Michael's Mount in Cornwall, one of England's most famous
landmarks, said the episode was not an isolated act of intolerance.
She and her students were subjected to verbal abuse almost every
day of their weeklong visit to southwest England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the nightclubs and pubs and in the street,'' she said.
``We are German bitches and Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Smith, a spokeswoman for the Cornwall Tourist Board,
apologized to Muller's group, and called the attacks an aberration.
She insisted that Cornwall welcomes German tourists, who make up
one of the largest national groups to visit England every year.
Smith acknowledged she was deeply disturbed by the coaching the
children received from adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children appear to have been encouraged by their
parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, the German embassy spokeswoman, stressed that she
believes anti-German bigots here are a small minority. In fact, she
said a group of English and Germans planned to watch Saturday's big
soccer match together at a pub on the south bank of the Thames
River. The pub overlooks the HMS Belfast, a British warship that
did much to help end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Henderson, the gentlemanly cricket correspondent for The
Daily Telegraph, may have surprised some of his readers on
Wednesday when he wrote that he would be cheering for Germany. He
said he is repulsed by those who, claiming to love England, insult
foreigners and even English players like David Beckham, who was
heckled viciously by English fans after Portugal beat them last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``English football has become a revolting, festering sore,
bedevilled by poor standards on the field and unacceptable
nationalism off it,'' Henderson said. ``So come on, Germany. Don't
disappoint us true patriots.''

POPE'S ATTACKER SAYS HE WAS ONLY A PAWN IN '79 KILLING OF TURKISH
EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ In a brief but tumultuous court appearance
Friday, Mehmet Ali Agca, the gunman who shot Pope John Paul II,
declared that he was ``just an actor'' in the plot that led to the
1979 slaying of one of Turkey's most prominent newspaper editors.
</P>
<P>
   It was Agca's first public statement since he arrived in Turkey
early Wednesday morning. He had spent 19 years in an Italian jail
after being convicted of shooting the pope in 1981, but was
released and sent home after John Paul appealed to the Italian
authorities on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Agca was arrested in 1979 soon after the slaying of Abdi Ipekci,
editor of the daily newspaper Milliyet, but escaped from his
high-security prison before he could be brought to trial. He was
convicted of the murder in absentia and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was later commuted to 10 years imprisonment. Under
Turkish law, Agca (pronounced AH-jah) must now serve that sentence
minus the 158 days he served before escaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the killer of Abdi Ipekci,'' Agca shouted in the
Istanbul courtroom where he was brought for formal confirmation of
his sentence Friday. ``I am just an actor. I was playing the role
of a killer in that scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   After the presiding judge said he was considering new charges
against Agca for armed robbery and other crimes, the prisoner
called out: ``I am innocent. The robbery and extortion stories,
they are all fairy tales. I am innocent, definitely innocent. I
swear it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the judge ordered him to be silent, he appeared chastened
and said he was overly excited after returning to his homeland.
Soon afterward he was returned to his solitary cell, which is in
the same prison from which he escaped more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Special security measures have been imposed at the prison to
assure that people who may want to silence Agca are not able to
approach him. His cell is under continuous video surveillance, and
everyone entering the adjacent corridor is subject to fingerprint
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Streets around the courtroom were blocked off Friday during
Agca's appearance. Heavily armed security officers surrounded the
building, and sharpshooters were posted on nearby roofs. A handful
of demonstrators chanted slogans demanding that investigators find
the ``hidden hands'' that the demonstrators presume to have been
behind Agca's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Agca was one of the ultranationalist gunmen who threw Turkey
into chaos in the late 1970s. In 1979 hardly a day passed without a
bombing or shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The military staged a coup the following year. There has been
much speculation that the terror was fomented by obscure forces
seeking to create a climate so frightening that such a coup would
be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   This and various other theories about the terror campaign in
which Agca participated have been revived by his sudden
reappearance here. Many Turks are wondering whether he can be
induced to reveal who ordered him to kill Ipekci.
</P>
<P>
   In the months before he was slain, Ipekci had written columns
attacking far-right groups, and others suggesting that heroin
smugglers were working with high-ranking security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ipekci is considered a martyr, with streets and parks
named after him in nearly every Turkish city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the greatest newspaperman of the 20th century in
Turkey,'' said Haluk Sahin, a prominent columnist and television
news director. ``He made Milliyet a major credible newspaper by
introducing modern standards of journalism for the first time in
this country. The Turkish press has lost ground since his death. In
that sense he may have been a well-chosen target.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ If there is an intellectual center of big business, it
is the immaculately maintained faux-Georgian campus of Harvard
Business School, for nearly a century the training ground for the
people who run and advise the world's largest companies. From
turning out future chief executives of IBM, Merck and Procter &AMP;
Gamble to being the home of strategy gurus like Michael Porter,
Harvard has practically stamped its crest on the large industrial
companies that defined the 20th-century economy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``the West Point of capitalism,'' as the school is
known, has spent the last few years behaving like anything but an
academy of big business. Instead, Harvard has undergone a
transformation worthy of the case studies that are the hallmark of
its MBA curriculum. This one goes something like this: Fearing new
kinds of competition, an industry giant changes how it does
business to remain relevant and retain its dominance under a new
set of economic rules.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the changes is an effort to reorganize Harvard
around the study of entrepreneurial ventures, be they dot-com
start-ups or divisions of large companies trying to act like small
companies. Those are the places that many Harvard students want to
work today, and they are the businesses that occupy the thoughts of
the nation's most sought-after academics. The shift has touched
every Harvard student and caused the business school _ the world's
richest, best-known and most influential _ to start a series of
initiatives in Silicon Valley, where Stanford, its most important
rival, is pre-eminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard MBA's who received their diplomas earlier this month
here, across the Charles River from Harvard University's main
campus in Cambridge, were the last who were required to take
general management, once the school's signature course. Students
now must enroll in a first-year class called ``The Entrepreneurial
Manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past school year, more than one-quarter of the
electives chosen by second-year students were in the
entrepreneurship department, which 20 years ago consisted of just
two classes. Next year, 40 students will opt out of regular classes
for two months to receive credit for working inside mostly small
companies in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts. Already, officials
have taken to boasting that Harvard sends more graduates to the
valley than any other business school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to change, indeed get out in front of the parade, to
continue to attract these bright 25-year-olds,'' said Jay Light, a
Harvard professor for 30 years and one of the school's senior
associate deans overseeing the curriculum changes. ``If we don't
maintain our relevance for what they want to do with their lives,
there's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift brings some significant risks. In essence, Harvard has
allowed its current students' interest in working for small
companies _ an interest that cynics might brand a grasp for instant
riches _ to play a major role in shaping its curriculum for the
next decade. And while the Internet may be here to stay, the stock
market's recent volatility suggests that entrepreneurial fervor may
be more fleeting. The consolidation spree of the last decade also
indicates that large companies _ indeed, ones larger than in the
past _ will continue to dominate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Harvard, as it reinvents itself, could alienate the
big-company recruiters who have faithfully trekked to Boston every
autumn for decades. The school has made ``quite a radical set of
changes,'' said Adrian J. Slywotzky, a vice president at Mercer
Management Consulting near Boston who has often written about large
organizations' attempts to reinvent themselves and who received his
MBA from Harvard in 1980. ``Large companies could say, `I'm not
sure how Harvard is serving me,''' Slywotzky said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard professors, however, say that the economic changes of
the last five years have forced them to act and that, in any event,
they are not really leaving behind the study of big companies.
Almost like a mantra, the professors repeat word-for-word a
definition of entrepreneurship that they say applies to General
Electric as well as it does to a dot-com operated out of a garage:
the pursuit of opportunities beyond means that are currently
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of entrepreneurship not as a personality type or as a
stage in the life cycle of a business but as a way of managing,''
said Kim Clark, the dean since 1995, whose overhaul of the business
school has earned him mention as a candidate for Harvard
University's presidency, now vacant. ``The concepts of leadership
that are important now and are going to be important in the future
spring out of an understanding of entrepreneurship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosabeth Kanter, a professor of management, added, ``Big
companies are dying to behave more like start-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, Harvard is simply catching up to its
alumni. The school teaches students to think like general managers
_ chief executives or presidents _ but not all of the 800-plus
Harvard MBA graduates each year can end up in such jobs at big
companies. In fact, about one-third of graduates who have been out
of Harvard for at least 15 years own their own businesses,
according to studies done by the school.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harvard is arguing that it, more than any other institution
and more than the hands-on experience of working at a start-up, can
help today's students become entrepreneurs quickly. That argument
is part realpolitik and part intellectual. The school gives
students access to one of the economy's most powerful professional
networks _ a Harvard keiretsu that includes all those earlier
entrepreneurs, as well as dozens of venture capitalists and the
founders of dozens of recent dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Business Battle Simulator
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the two years away from working life gives
students time to think through a broad range of business problems,
to take risks that they could not if actual dollars were at stake
and possibly, to even come up with their own business plans. ``We
run a simulator where people are taking live shots at them,'' said
William Sahlman, a longtime professor of entrepreneurship. ``This
is the big time, but still low risk. You can't get that in the
outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Harvard's transformation ultimately
succeeds, it is already being felt far beyond Boston. Every year,
Harvard's publishing house sells some six million copies of the
school's famous case studies to other business schools and
organizations. So unlike, say, Berkeley's physics department or
Yale's law school, Harvard Business School has a direct and
immediate effect on the curriculum of hundreds of its peers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it just isn't at Harvard that business students
are now learning about companies that most of them had never heard
of. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Professor Paul Marshall was settling in to plan the last week of
the semester when one of his teaching assistants offered a blunt
assessment of the situation. ``It's coming apart!'' he said. One of
the final case studies for Harvard's new core class in
entrepreneurship would contain sensitive information that eStyle _
the Internet retailer that was its subject _ was unwilling to
release on Harvard's timetable.
</P>
<P>
   The professor would have none of it. ``Then pick up the pieces
and run across the finish line,'' Marshall recalled telling the
assistant. Sure enough, Harvard got eStyle to release the case in
time for it to be printed, though students had to rush through
reading it in two days, rather than the usual few weeks. Call it
business school on Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faculty is scrambling like hell'' to keep up with
developments in the business world, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Students say the class was uneven at times, but most agree that
it was still much better than studying how Caterpillar might cut
costs by a percentage point or how a Procter &AMP; Gamble manager
should market a new brand of tissues _ the sort of topics and
companies on which Harvard's case studies had focused for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one way that the school is a very different place
than it was five years ago, when Clark became dean. Netscape
Communications had just gone public, and thousands of college
students across the country were already addicted to e-mail. But
Harvard Business School, one of the richest of any kind and one
supposedly with a foot in the real world, had not given e-mail
accounts to its students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so far behind in 1995; we were, like, way, way
behind,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He figured that the school could prosper by helping managers
think about how to deal with the ways that technology was altering
the corporate landscape _ or that it could fall behind its peers
quite rapidly. ``My sense was that we were at an inflection point,
and we needed to seize the moment and take action,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the changes were straightforward. By the first week of
1996, every student and professor had an e-mail account and could
connect to it from all over campus. Harvard's case studies soon
included spreadsheets tied to real-time data sets and videos.
</P>
<P>
   Altering the curriculum was more complicated, and more profound.
Until the mid-1980s, the school offered only one or two
entrepreneurship courses; many faculty members saw the subject as
unworthy of rigorous study. ``It was pretty lonely,'' said Howard
H. Stevenson, who has taught entrepreneurship at Harvard since the
early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   As the technological shifts of the last 20 years took hold,
however, the market changed all that. Students clamored for such
classes, and the faculty's interest grew, too. The entrepreneurship
department now offers some 18 courses taught by 28 professors, who
range from lifetime academics to a co-founder of the Staples office
supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change is the switch of the required
first-year class from general to entrepreneurial management. In
1990, the case subjects for the class included Bank One,
Caterpillar, Colgate-Palmolive, General Electric, Honda, Nike, and
Pepsi-Cola. This year, the lineup included perhaps only two
companies that a layman would recognize as major corporations _
Charles Schwab and Intuit. The others included Bitstream,
Chemdex.com (now part of the Ventro Corp.), Go Fish and Onset
Ventures
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and his teaching assistants are not the only ones to
find the transition bumpy. Last year, Clark felt it necessary to
send a memo to professors forbidding them to serve on the boards of
companies started by current students. And students have been
pushing the career services office to do more to help them wade
through the dozens of dot-coms that would eagerly hire a Harvard
MBA.
</P>
<P>
   The more important question, however, may be what the changes
will mean for corporate America. After all, generations of Harvard
MBA's have filled the ranks of the country's consulting firms,
investment banks and corporate giants. Now many of the most
talented students are starting their own businesses or joining
smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's decision to cater to that clientele, some people fear,
could produce a group of budding executives with a much firmer
understanding of how to raise venture capital than of how to steer
a global enterprise. All the while, the world's corporations are
becoming ever more complex as they swallow up rivals and stretch
across international borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a risk to our generation all working in 10- and
50-person companies,'' said Kevin M. Lalande, 28, a member of
Harvard's class of 2001 who started two companies between his
undergraduate work and business school. ``Later on, it's going to
be much more difficult to find people who have the kind of
experience to run a multinational.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivals? What Rivals?
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University is not given to paying much heed to its
competition, and the business school generally fits the
institutional mold. ``We don't think of ourselves as competing with
other schools,'' said Light, a senior associate dean, when asked to
name Harvard's closest rival. ``We think of ourselves as producing
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   That is often a surprisingly insular process. Of the 28
professors in the entrepreneurship department, 13 hold a Harvard
MBA and another 7 have other Harvard University degrees. Ask them
where they studied and some pause briefly before replying,
``Here.'' The answer is so obvious that the question seems almost
to take them by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But ``here'' is not exactly the center of the new economy; that
would be 3,000 miles west of Boston, and Stanford Business School
is in the midst of it.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford admits only one of every 13 applicants, making it
almost twice as selective as Harvard by that measure. By
reputation, Stanford has won a place alongside Harvard as one of
the two best business schools in the country, most students agree,
a notch above the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, the
University of Chicago, Northwestern and Columbia. In the most
recent ranking by U.S. News &AMP; World Report, Harvard and Stanford
tied for No. 1. ``We are each other's biggest competition, by
far,'' said Robert Joss, Stanford's dean. ``In fact, our
second-most-important competition is students who decide not to go
to business school.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this presents a challenge to Harvard. It may have the
advantage of better name recognition than Stanford, and more
resources, but as the case studies often point out, such benefits
do not guarantee success in the new economy. Indeed, if Harvard
became the school of big business and the old economy while its
cross-country rival was identified as a training ground for the new
economy, it could look forward to the same kind of problems that
business icons like General Motors have suffered in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy is not lost on Clark. A graduate of both Harvard
College and Harvard's doctoral program in economics, he spent much
of his academic career studying innovation at automobile companies,
among others. It was he who, during yet one more long trip to the
Bay Area a few years ago, conceived the notion that Harvard should
establish a beachhead in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   After a typically frustrating search for Silicon Valley real
estate _ agents offered sites like the third floor of a decrepit
Victorian house and an office without a single parking place _ the
California Research Center finally opened on Sand Hill Road in
Menlo Park in 1997. And if the name on the door and the address are
impressive _ America's most prestigious university setting up shop
on Silicon Valley's BMW-lined boulevard of venture capital and
innovation _ the research center is not much to look at. It is a
typically charmless suite of small second-floor offices that
Harvard shares with a technology development firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have visitors come in, especially from Asia, and say, `This
is it?''' acknowledged Christina Darwall, the office's director and
a former software entrepreneur. ``A lot of these people pull up in
their big, long limousines. They're expecting marble.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no marble, but a steady parade of Harvard professors _
more than a third of the faculty, so far _ have tramped through the
research center since it opened. Darwall and a small staff keep in
closer touch with Silicon Valley companies than Harvard professors
ever could from Boston, writing some case studies themselves and
opening doors for the faculty to write others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are busier here, and it doesn't mean as much to them to
be in a case,'' Darwall said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Harvard wants its paying customers to feel
that studying at the business school can include time in Silicon
Valley. So the center helped organize a job-hunting trip that sent
more than 500 Harvard students to California during their winter
vacation last year. Harvard also has begun conducting executive
education programs in the valley, with about half of the students
coming from the region.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this has raised a few eyebrows at Stanford, which
has not exactly welcomed its Eastern counterpart with open arms.
When Harvard officials were planning the research center, they
approached Stanford about collaborating. Stanford never responded,
Darwall said. Still, Joss, Stanford's dean, says he is not worried
about Harvard's presence. ``We welcome the fact that they're
interested in and engaged in the ideas out here,'' he said. ``We
have the real benefit of being right in the heart of the action.''

BRITONS HOLD ON TO WORLD WAR II HATRED OF GERMANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARAZION, England _ Two weeks ago, Gabbi Muller wasn't too
surprised when a group of English people called the German high
school students she had brought to Cornwall a bunch of Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Muller, a teacher, knew there is latent hostility to Germans in
Britain, especially among those old enough to remember World War II
and the Blitz. What stunned and saddened Muller, and even some
Britons, was that a group of adults were encouraging some young
children to hurl stones, water balloons, and obscenity-laden
epithets at her and her students.
</P>
<P>
   While stories of British heroism and resilience during World War
II are passed down the generations, so, too, is hatred of Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that disturbing blend of patriotism, jingoism, and
bigotry will reach a crescendo as England takes on Germany in the
European soccer championships being played in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   While English soccer hooligans don't need an excuse to hate the
Germans, they have plenty of inspiration, much of it emanating from
the mainstream media. Last year, the Sunday Times ran a magazine
cover story in which A.A. Gill, the newspaper's restaurant and TV
critic, wrote, ``We all hate the Germans. Come on, it's all right,
admit it, we're all agreed, we hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   While meant to be humorous, many Germans, and even some Britons,
considered the piece as racist as any propaganda produced by
Hitler's Third Reich. The then-German ambassador to Britain,
Gebhardt von Moltke, said he thought the article promoted the kind
of xenophobia that inspires verbal and physical attacks on Germans
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As he was preparing to leave his London post, von Moltke
delivered some parting shots, lamenting that British newspapers
``characterize us as Huns and Krauts who eat bratwurst and take the
best seats around the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   While relations between Britain and Germany as good, von Moltke
said, there needs to be greater ``recognition by the public and
some of the media that today's Germany is a modern, open, and
democratic society which differs fundamentally from the one of the
1930s and 1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Moltke said hearing Britons dismiss him and his countrymen
as Nazis was especially hurtful _ two of his uncles were executed
after they attempted -- and failed -- to assassinate Hitler in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   While the perception is that soccer hooligans are often poor and
uneducated, research by British police has found that some are
actually middle-class, with good jobs, wives, and children. So are
some of those who mouth anti-German sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a pub in a comfortable neighborhood in North
London, an English lawyer and father of three said he had no
sympathy for the German tourists who were attacked in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serves them right, the Nazi bastards,'' said the lawyer, who
only a few months ago lamented that the former Chilean dictator,
Augusto Pinochet, was allowed to escape prosecution for crimes
against humanity. The lawyer explained that many members of his
family died fighting the Germans in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   While others who suffered at the hands of the Third Reich have
gone out of their way to reconcile with the Germans, most notably
the French, the British have remained the coolest in western
Europe. Sir Roy Denman, the former European Union ambassador to
Washington, says that attitude has influenced Britain's ambivalence
toward European integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British look at how well the Germans and the French get on
and it bothers them,'' says Denman, who argues Britain should be a
leader of the European Union alongside France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Denman believes the British attitude toward Germans and the
European Union is greatly influenced by its wartime experience.
While the Germans rolled across Europe, conquering and occupying
all in their path, only Britain held out. Londoners withstood the
Blitz, and the Royal Air Force fiercely defended against a
threatened German invasion in the Battle of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Denman says that history has led many Britons to conclude they
can stand alone without Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Gross, a spokeswoman for the German embassy in London,
said the attack on the German tourists was not unique, but
``neither are such attacks widespread or common.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said the embassy had received telephone calls and letters
from English people saying they were outraged by the most recent
attack. ``Basically, they were apologizing for the behavior of some
of their countrymen,'' said Gross.
</P>
<P>
   But Muller, the German teacher who brought her students to St.
Michael's Mount in Cornwall, one of England's most famous
landmarks, said the episode was not an isolated act of intolerance.
She and her students were subjected to verbal abuse almost every
day of their weeklong visit to southwest England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the nightclubs and pubs and in the street,'' she said.
``We are German bitches and Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Smith, a spokeswoman for the Cornwall Tourist Board,
apologized to Muller's group, and called the attacks an aberration.
She insisted that Cornwall welcomes German tourists, who make up
one of the largest national groups to visit England every year.
Smith acknowledged she was deeply disturbed by the coaching the
children received from adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children appear to have been encouraged by their
parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, the German embassy spokeswoman, stressed that she
believes anti-German bigots here are a small minority. In fact, she
said a group of English and Germans planned to watch Saturday's big
soccer match together at a pub on the south bank of the Thames
River. The pub overlooks the HMS Belfast, a British warship that
did much to help end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Henderson, the gentlemanly cricket correspondent for The
Daily Telegraph, may have surprised some of his readers on
Wednesday when he wrote that he would be cheering for Germany. He
said he is repulsed by those who, claiming to love England, insult
foreigners and even English players like David Beckham, who was
heckled viciously by English fans after Portugal beat them last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``English football has become a revolting, festering sore,
bedevilled by poor standards on the field and unacceptable
nationalism off it,'' Henderson said. ``So come on, Germany. Don't
disappoint us true patriots.''

BRITONS HOLD ON TO WORLD WAR II HATRED OF GERMANS

<P>
   MARAZION, England _ Two weeks ago, Gabbi Muller wasn't too
surprised when a group of English people called the German high
school students she had brought to Cornwall a bunch of Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Muller, a teacher, knew there is latent hostility to Germans in
Britain, especially among those old enough to remember World War II
and the Blitz. What stunned and saddened Muller, and even some
Britons, was that a group of adults were encouraging some young
children to hurl stones, water balloons, and obscenity-laden
epithets at her and her students.
</P>
<P>
   While stories of British heroism and resilience during World War
II are passed down the generations, so, too, is hatred of Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that disturbing blend of patriotism, jingoism, and
bigotry will reach a crescendo as England takes on Germany in the
European soccer championships being played in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   While English soccer hooligans don't need an excuse to hate the
Germans, they have plenty of inspiration, much of it emanating from
the mainstream media. Last year, the Sunday Times ran a magazine
cover story in which A.A. Gill, the newspaper's restaurant and TV
critic, wrote, ``We all hate the Germans. Come on, it's all right,
admit it, we're all agreed, we hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   While meant to be humorous, many Germans, and even some Britons,
considered the piece as racist as any propaganda produced by
Hitler's Third Reich. The then-German ambassador to Britain,
Gebhardt von Moltke, said he thought the article promoted the kind
of xenophobia that inspires verbal and physical attacks on Germans
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As he was preparing to leave his London post, von Moltke
delivered some parting shots, lamenting that British newspapers
``characterize us as Huns and Krauts who eat bratwurst and take the
best seats around the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   While relations between Britain and Germany as good, von Moltke
said, there needs to be greater ``recognition by the public and
some of the media that today's Germany is a modern, open, and
democratic society which differs fundamentally from the one of the
1930s and 1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Moltke said hearing Britons dismiss him and his countrymen
as Nazis was especially hurtful _ two of his uncles were executed
after they attempted -- and failed -- to assassinate Hitler in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   While the perception is that soccer hooligans are often poor and
uneducated, research by British police has found that some are
actually middle-class, with good jobs, wives, and children. So are
some of those who mouth anti-German sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a pub in a comfortable neighborhood in North
London, an English lawyer and father of three said he had no
sympathy for the German tourists who were attacked in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serves them right, the Nazi bastards,'' said the lawyer, who
only a few months ago lamented that the former Chilean dictator,
Augusto Pinochet, was allowed to escape prosecution for crimes
against humanity. The lawyer explained that many members of his
family died fighting the Germans in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   While others who suffered at the hands of the Third Reich have
gone out of their way to reconcile with the Germans, most notably
the French, the British have remained the coolest in western
Europe. Sir Roy Denman, the former European Union ambassador to
Washington, says that attitude has influenced Britain's ambivalence
toward European integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British look at how well the Germans and the French get on
and it bothers them,'' says Denman, who argues Britain should be a
leader of the European Union alongside France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Denman believes the British attitude toward Germans and the
European Union is greatly influenced by its wartime experience.
While the Germans rolled across Europe, conquering and occupying
all in their path, only Britain held out. Londoners withstood the
Blitz, and the Royal Air Force fiercely defended against a
threatened German invasion in the Battle of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Denman says that history has led many Britons to conclude they
can stand alone without Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Gross, a spokeswoman for the German embassy in London,
said the attack on the German tourists was not unique, but
``neither are such attacks widespread or common.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said the embassy had received telephone calls and letters
from English people saying they were outraged by the most recent
attack. ``Basically, they were apologizing for the behavior of some
of their countrymen,'' said Gross.
</P>
<P>
   But Muller, the German teacher who brought her students to St.
Michael's Mount in Cornwall, one of England's most famous
landmarks, said the episode was not an isolated act of intolerance.
She and her students were subjected to verbal abuse almost every
day of their weeklong visit to southwest England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the nightclubs and pubs and in the street,'' she said.
``We are German bitches and Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Smith, a spokeswoman for the Cornwall Tourist Board,
apologized to Muller's group, and called the attacks an aberration.
She insisted that Cornwall welcomes German tourists, who make up
one of the largest national groups to visit England every year.
Smith acknowledged she was deeply disturbed by the coaching the
children received from adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children appear to have been encouraged by their
parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, the German embassy spokeswoman, stressed that she
believes anti-German bigots here are a small minority. In fact, she
said a group of English and Germans planned to watch Saturday's big
soccer match together at a pub on the south bank of the Thames
River. The pub overlooks the HMS Belfast, a British warship that
did much to help end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Henderson, the gentlemanly cricket correspondent for The
Daily Telegraph, may have surprised some of his readers on
Wednesday when he wrote that he would be cheering for Germany. He
said he is repulsed by those who, claiming to love England, insult
foreigners and even English players like David Beckham, who was
heckled viciously by English fans after Portugal beat them last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``English football has become a revolting, festering sore,
bedevilled by poor standards on the field and unacceptable
nationalism off it,'' Henderson said. ``So come on, Germany. Don't
disappoint us true patriots.''

 &HT;    Lingamfelter spring boards into the future
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For onetime high school star Jenny Lingamfelter,
the upcoming U.S. Olympic diving trials are more than a just a
chance to win a trip to Australia. They're a huge fork in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't make the Olympic team, medical school in San
Antonio starts in July,'' said the1999 NCAA 1-meter springboard
champion. Lingamfelter, who would be enrolled at the University of
Texas Health Science Center, has wanted to be a doctor since she
was 5. Yet, she wouldn't mind putting that particular dream on hold
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I want to make the Olympic team is that I'm not
ready to quit diving,'' she said. ``If I've only got two more weeks
in the sport, knowing that I have to retire is going to make me
much more upset than knowing I didn't make an Olympic team. I would
love to make the Olympic team, it would be a really great honor,
but mostly it would allow me to keep doing this a little bit
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Diving is something Lingamfelter has done very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of our best chances for an Olympic medal,'' said
Southern Methodist Coach Jim Stillson. ``She's a very technically
proficient diver with real good line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is really one of the beautiful divers in the air, very
graceful,'' said Hongping Li, Lingamfelter's coach at the Pan
American games, where she earned a silver medal on the 3-meter
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her grace in the air, in a way, belies the struggle it often
has been for Lingamfelter to practice her art. A record-shattering
performer as a high school phenom here, she was injured much of her
college career and only now might be approaching her true
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Like many divers, Lingamfelter got into the sport after doing
gymnastics, which she started when other kids her age were doing
daycare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the kind of child that you couldn't keep from bouncing
all over everything. I would try a forward roll off the couch, a
cartwheel over the ottoman or use the back of the couch as my
beam,'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries, however, eventually kept her from progressing in that
sport and she turned to diving when she was 10. It was soon
apparent that she had found her special niche.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Lingamfelter won two state championships and was
kept from a third only by an accident. She won her first title as
sophomore, coming within a few points of breaking the state's
scoring record of 485 points set way back in 1972. The next year
she shattered that 22-year-old record, and the 500-point barrier,
winning with 510.5 points. Then in her senior season, right before
the state meet, she fractured a toe when she clipped the board on a
practice dive.
</P>
<P>
   Lingamfelter's success _ she was named national high school
female diver of the year _ came in spite of some physical problems.
She has scoliosis, curvature of the spine. Luckily, it curves in
two places in something of an S and balances out so that her hips
and shoulders are level. Still, the condition is a big reason she
competes only in springboard events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped doing tower when I was 15 or 16. The impact of
diving 33 feet alone is pretty difficult on the body. Since my back
was not straight I believe I absorbed even more on an impact,''
Lingamfelter said. ``A lot of this sport is muscle memory, and if
you take a couple of days off and come back, sometimes you're like
a whole different person. I would dive platform, then the back
would start hurting and then I'd take a day or two off and I felt
like it would take the whole week to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it finally felt good it was time for the next tower
practice. It was kind of a cycle for a while and my springboard
diving had gone downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Lingamfelter dived for the Texas Diving Club, and her parents
graduated from the University of Texas. Yet, when it came time to
pick a college, she chose a smaller school, Southern Methodist.
There she worked with Stillson. After her freshman year they made a
decision to upgrade her dives with some more difficult ones,
perhaps sacrificing some short-term success with the hope of
eventually doing better on the international scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing the same dives that the Chinese and Russians are
doing,'' Stillson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was about that time, however, when Lingamfelter began
experiencing pain in her left shoulder. It was so loose that at
times it would almost feel detached from her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a danger of it coming out of the socket. Both
of us were very nervous about trying to push my training too hard
and having my shoulder break down. We trained as hard as we could,
but still we were very careful,'' Lingamfelter said. ``But it's not
a good feeling to go to practice and have to sit on the side and
watch or go home.''
</P>
<P>
   She coped with it for two years and won the 3-meter event in the
spring national championships in 1998. Later, she had surgery in
May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the anterior ligaments was so stretched out that it
wasn't really doing what it was meant to do. It's meant to hold the
bone in the socket,'' Lingamfelter said. ``They reconstructed that
ligament and then what is typically done to people who have
shoulder injuries and whose shoulders are too loose, they shrink
the capsule by heating it. It's similar to cooking a steak, when
you cook it, it shrinks up. ``
</P>
<P>
   She didn't do a dive until September and it was late December
until she could do all her dives. In some ways, it was like
starting over. For years she'd been compensating for her shoulder.
Suddenly, she felt out of balance. She had trouble diving straight.
</P>
<P>
   Things were corrected sufficiently by the NCAA championships in
1999. There, in addition to her first place on the 1-meter, she
took third on the 3-meter. Not long after that high point and three
days after her 22nd birthday, however, Lingamfelter's 50-year-old
father, Pete, died from complications following a kidney problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lingamfelter was devastated, but continued diving.
</P>
<P>
   She once said, ``That was a low point in my life. My body was
going through the motions, but there was no coordination at all,
and it was like I forgot how to dive.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally pulled out that slump with her silver-medal
performance in the Pan American games. For the past year she's been
healthy and training harder than her body would allow her to do
before. Although she had a couple of disappointing performances
this winter she should be ready for the trials and whatever
follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Olympics until a couple of years ago. My love
is for the sport, the people, the competition and the places that
we get to go. The Olympics is a dream for me, like it is for
everyone else, but it's not my only goal,'' Lingamfelter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't make it my life hasn't changed at all. I'm still
going to go to medical school. None of my other life goals are
going to be affected . . . This year, looking toward the Olympics,
seeing the pressure that different people have put on themselves,
has made me try harder to put my life in perspective. Throughout
most of my career diving has been a very big part of my life. It is
right now. But I think I've done a pretty good job of preparing
myself for a life beyond that.''

BRITONS HOLD ON TO WORLD WAR II HATRED OF GERMANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARAZION, England _ Two weeks ago, Gabbi Muller wasn't too
surprised when a group of English people called the German high
school students she had brought to Cornwall a bunch of Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Muller, a teacher, knew there is latent hostility to Germans in
Britain, especially among those old enough to remember World War II
and the Blitz. What stunned and saddened Muller, and even some
Britons, was that a group of adults were encouraging some young
children to hurl stones, water balloons, and obscenity-laden
epithets at her and her students.
</P>
<P>
   While stories of British heroism and resilience during World War
II are passed down the generations, so, too, is hatred of Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that disturbing blend of patriotism, jingoism, and
bigotry will reach a crescendo as England takes on Germany in the
European soccer championships being played in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   While English soccer hooligans don't need an excuse to hate the
Germans, they have plenty of inspiration, much of it emanating from
the mainstream media. Last year, the Sunday Times ran a magazine
cover story in which A.A. Gill, the newspaper's restaurant and TV
critic, wrote, ``We all hate the Germans. Come on, it's all right,
admit it, we're all agreed, we hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   While meant to be humorous, many Germans, and even some Britons,
considered the piece as racist as any propaganda produced by
Hitler's Third Reich. The then-German ambassador to Britain,
Gebhardt von Moltke, said he thought the article promoted the kind
of xenophobia that inspires verbal and physical attacks on Germans
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   As he was preparing to leave his London post, von Moltke
delivered some parting shots, lamenting that British newspapers
``characterize us as Huns and Krauts who eat bratwurst and take the
best seats around the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   While relations between Britain and Germany as good, von Moltke
said, there needs to be greater ``recognition by the public and
some of the media that today's Germany is a modern, open, and
democratic society which differs fundamentally from the one of the
1930s and 1940s.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Moltke said hearing Britons dismiss him and his countrymen
as Nazis was especially hurtful _ two of his uncles were executed
after they attempted -- and failed -- to assassinate Hitler in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   While the perception is that soccer hooligans are often poor and
uneducated, research by British police has found that some are
actually middle-class, with good jobs, wives, and children. So are
some of those who mouth anti-German sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a pub in a comfortable neighborhood in North
London, an English lawyer and father of three said he had no
sympathy for the German tourists who were attacked in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serves them right, the Nazi bastards,'' said the lawyer, who
only a few months ago lamented that the former Chilean dictator,
Augusto Pinochet, was allowed to escape prosecution for crimes
against humanity. The lawyer explained that many members of his
family died fighting the Germans in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   While others who suffered at the hands of the Third Reich have
gone out of their way to reconcile with the Germans, most notably
the French, the British have remained the coolest in western
Europe. Sir Roy Denman, the former European Union ambassador to
Washington, says that attitude has influenced Britain's ambivalence
toward European integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British look at how well the Germans and the French get on
and it bothers them,'' says Denman, who argues Britain should be a
leader of the European Union alongside France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Denman believes the British attitude toward Germans and the
European Union is greatly influenced by its wartime experience.
While the Germans rolled across Europe, conquering and occupying
all in their path, only Britain held out. Londoners withstood the
Blitz, and the Royal Air Force fiercely defended against a
threatened German invasion in the Battle of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Denman says that history has led many Britons to conclude they
can stand alone without Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Gross, a spokeswoman for the German embassy in London,
said the attack on the German tourists was not unique, but
``neither are such attacks widespread or common.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said the embassy had received telephone calls and letters
from English people saying they were outraged by the most recent
attack. ``Basically, they were apologizing for the behavior of some
of their countrymen,'' said Gross.
</P>
<P>
   But Muller, the German teacher who brought her students to St.
Michael's Mount in Cornwall, one of England's most famous
landmarks, said the episode was not an isolated act of intolerance.
She and her students were subjected to verbal abuse almost every
day of their weeklong visit to southwest England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the nightclubs and pubs and in the street,'' she said.
``We are German bitches and Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Smith, a spokeswoman for the Cornwall Tourist Board,
apologized to Muller's group, and called the attacks an aberration.
She insisted that Cornwall welcomes German tourists, who make up
one of the largest national groups to visit England every year.
Smith acknowledged she was deeply disturbed by the coaching the
children received from adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children appear to have been encouraged by their
parents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, the German embassy spokeswoman, stressed that she
believes anti-German bigots here are a small minority. In fact, she
said a group of English and Germans planned to watch Saturday's big
soccer match together at a pub on the south bank of the Thames
River. The pub overlooks the HMS Belfast, a British warship that
did much to help end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Henderson, the gentlemanly cricket correspondent for The
Daily Telegraph, may have surprised some of his readers on
Wednesday when he wrote that he would be cheering for Germany. He
said he is repulsed by those who, claiming to love England, insult
foreigners and even English players like David Beckham, who was
heckled viciously by English fans after Portugal beat them last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``English football has become a revolting, festering sore,
bedevilled by poor standards on the field and unacceptable
nationalism off it,'' Henderson said. ``So come on, Germany. Don't
disappoint us true patriots.''

 &HT;    Sibling rivalry with a twist
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The apartment is shared by three cats, Tiger,
Squeak and Junior, who presumably always land on their feet, and
three brothers who always land on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Troy, Justin and Brice are three-fifths of the diving Dumais
family, which also includes younger sister Leanne and younger
brother Dwight. The Dumais are the Jackson Five of their sport.
Troy, who looks as much like a surfer as a diver, is the Michael
Jackson-talent of the family, minus all of Michael's quirks. A
University of Texas sophomore, Troy won a record 19 national junior
titles and has been compared to four-time Olympic gold medalist
Greg Louganis.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, who quietly transferred to UT this year, is the eldest
Dumais sibling. He's not exactly the Jackie Jackson or Tito of the
group, but he has been the Other Brother. In spite of his own
impressive accomplishments in and out of the pool, he's had trouble
escaping from Troy's long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still gets to me every once in awhile,'' Justin said.
``Troy is great at diving. That's his thing. But how Troy is with
diving, that's how I was with school. I never really had to study.
It just came to me. No one really got to see my area of expertise.
It was you had a 4-point, whatever. I didn't even care because I
was so focused on diving.''
</P>
<P>
   With a quick shrug Justin adds, ``It's made me stronger. A lot
of other people might have quit because they couldn't have dealt
with it, but I'm starting to make my own name now. For the Olympic
trials I've gone from a dark horse to being a serious player.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin and Troy are pointing for the U.S. Olympic diving trials
that begin Tuesday in Federal Way, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, Justin is the only Dumais brother in
the pad, having taken a much-needed day off from practice. Tiger is
the sole cat creeping around on the black leather couches and
occasionally knocking something over on the desk. The others
felines are staying out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is sitting, but not sitting still. He can't. Like Troy,
he's all quick-twitch energy. He has to move his fingers. Or his
toes. Something, anything. There's nothing he likes better than an
adrenaline rush like he gets from diving off a tower. And he has
just finished watching a documentary of the flying Thunderbirds on
the piece de resistance of the apartment, a $3,000, 43-inch TV with
DVD players and stand-alone speakers that are higher than a 1-meter
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything little. I guess it's our personalities,''
Justin said. ``We almost got one of those flat screens ones, but
the biggest they made them was 36 inches and that just wasn't big
enough. This is big enough where it fits the apartment, but not
like obnoxiously 61-inch big.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy and Justin went in on the video system and have been living
together for this year and boarding Brice, who attends Southern
Methodist, for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   GOT ALL THAT?
</P>
<P>
   Not all that long ago, even the same state wasn't big enough to
hold Troy and Justin. Troy ended up at UT in part because it wasn't
the University of Southern California. That's where Justin enrolled
earlier and where the Dumais' longtime coach, Jeff Shaffer, was
entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Dumais drove daily from Ventura to Los Angeles to
work with Shaffer. First it was Troy and then Brice.
</P>
<P>
   Justin recalled, ``I was always forced to go and watch the
practices. My mom wanted us out of the house. I'm sure we were holy
terrors. I mean, look at us now. You can't get Troy or me to shut
up at all. Dad took us to practice. I just had to sit there and
watch. I probably got pretty fed up with that. I thought I may as
well try diving, too. It takes serious commitment. Diving is 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really had a typical high school experience. We went
to school, and then we drove three hours a day to and from
practice. We'd do homework in the car and pass out when we got back
and then do it all again the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to pick a college, Troy decided it was more
important to get away from the constant comparisons with his
brother than to stay with the same coach. UT was a nice fit for
him. Then, this past year, Justin and Shaffer had something of a
falling-out and Justin grew dissatisfied with some things at USC.
</P>
<P>
   Justin related, ``I didn't have anyone to dive with, no one to
work out with. That was the major consideration. That's how Troy
and I had gotten so good in the first place. We always had each
other to push. Everything was a competition. Everything still is,
and that's not always a good thing. But that's what has made us so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the fall, Justin decided to join his brother and work
under Texas Coach Matt Scoggin. Justin misses the beach, and his
surfboard has been retired to a wall in his room. Still, he said,
``I like the atmosphere out here. People are so friendly. It's a
lot different than L.A. We're living a lot better here. I'm 21 and
taking care of myself and most of my major, steppingstone
performances have come since I've moved here.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, he finished sixth on the 3-meter springboard in an
international field in a World Cup event in Germany. Later that
month he won the three-meter competition in a strong American field
at the Sunshine Diving Invitational in Fort Lauderdale. Yet, the
progress has not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past six months have been quite an ordeal. A month and one
half ago I was ready to quit diving, to hang up the Speedo. Diving
had gotten to be a chore,'' Justin said. ``I've said I'll go
through anything to make that Olympic team. This may be God's way
of saying, I'm calling your bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   SLEEP? WHAT'S THAT?
</P>
<P>
   Justin, who was on an academic scholarship at USC, transferred
to UT in the fall and couldn't get an athletic scholarship to UT
for this season. He sat out this year and has two years of
eligibility left. To make ends meet, Justin worked three jobs in
the fall, parking cars for a valet service, interning at an
investment firm and coaching girls diving.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a mess. I was sleeping three hours a night,'' Justin
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., he'd get up for morning workouts, then grab a bite
and maybe a short nap. Then it was time for classes, followed by an
afternoon workout. Then he hit the weights and did his coaching. At
night he parked cars at some of the city's trendier night spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm big on schmoozing. That's what I'm good at,'' he said. ``I
get maybe a minute or two to interact with the customers and that's
when you make or break your tip.''
</P>
<P>
   After parking cars it was time for some homework and bed by
maybe 1 or 2 a.m. Then, it was up at five to start again.
</P>
<P>
   That insanity ended after the fall, but winter brought its own
troubles. In January he flew to Sydney, Australia, site of the 2000
Olympic Games, for a World Cup diving event. He wanted it to be a
coming-out party against an international field. Instead, he got
bronchitis and an ear infection that left him weaving when he
walked. Try diving off a 10-meter platform when you feel like that.
He finished 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, driving in a drizzle, he hit a slick spot and
spun into oncoming traffic before overcorrecting and slamming into
a tree, totaling the tree and the car. Until he got a replacement
he had to depend on Troy for rides.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, without the money to pay for school again, Justin
concentrated on his diving.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect he probably needed to be in school, `` Scoggin
said. ``Diving became a job. But that's all changed in the last
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoggin has cut Justin's workouts to one a day, and he's been
diving much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a definite contender,'' Scoggin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transferring out here I had to make quite a few sacrifices,
but hopefully that will all culminate in making the Olympic team in
a few weeks,'' Justin said. ``I've always had to work my way up
inch by inch by inch. But if I dive like I can on platform, you
can't touch me.''

DOUBLE-TEAMING MONICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 18)  
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The private ``sky box'' at ESPN Zone had its own
waiters, several television monitors broadcasting a press
conference by Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers and a spread of
hors d'oeuvres. Still, Vicky Bullett, Murriel Page and Nikki McCray
seemed bored by it all.
</P>
<P>
   The women, all members of the Washington Mystics, one of the
leading teams in the WNBA, hadn't come to eat fried chicken fingers
or to watch Bryant feign modesty. They were there, on the evening
before their Tuesday game against the New York Liberty, to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go upstairs,'' said Bullett, 32, a 6-foot-3 power
forward who has a reputation for rowdiness among her teammates.
``I'll show you all how it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bounding out of the elevator at the top-floor video sports
arcade, they immediately jumped onto snowboard simulators. The ride
was familiar to them because the ESPN Zone in Washington is where
they hang out after home games. ``I love this one because I have
absolutely no idea what I'm doing,'' said McCray, 26, a 5-foot-11
guard pretty enough to model and poised even as she bobbed and
weaved.
</P>
<P>
   After half an hour of riding simulated Harley-Davidsons and
thoroughbreds and driving simulated Formula One racers (they passed
the free-throw area without so much as a glance), they were ready
to depart for the main event _ the American Foundation for AIDS
Research benefit at the Central Park boathouse. They conceded right
away why they were going. ``We're looking for famous people,''
Bullett declared. The one they were most hoping to see was Monica
Lewinsky, whom they seemed to root for like a home town underdog.
</P>
<P>
   In the town car (a tight squeeze of long slender limbs) they
gossiped about other players' weight gains and looked out the
windows longingly at the stores. ``Donna Karan,'' Page said. ``I
need some of that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to the boathouse, there was a gaggle of
photographers and a red carpet. The players switched into
celebrity-spotting mode, giraffing their necks above the crowd.
When one of the organizers of the event asked if they would pose
for a photograph, the women seemed shocked that they themselves
were considered celebrities. ``You want us?'' Bullett asked.
</P>
<P>
   The first celebrity they glimpsed once inside was Donald J.
Trump. The players introduced themselves and shook his hand. ``He's
got big bucks,'' Bullett said afterward. ``I wanted to ask him to
help the league, but I didn't have the nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   The players made their way to the VIP area, picking up plates of
food from the tables that had been set up by many of the city's
most stylish restaurants. All around, ingenue models and actresses
like Angie Harmon swooshed by in decollete cocktail dresses. The
players, dressed in casual slacks and tops, fretted that they were
underdressed. ``I should have worn my capri pants and heels,'' Page
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the celebrity trail, Bullett spied Sandra Bernhard
(well, she didn't actually recognize her by name, but she was sure
it was someone). It was growing near their self-imposed 9:30 p.m.
curfew when they saw Lewinsky across the room. ``We need to talk to
her,'' she said breathlessly to her teammates. ``We need to tell
her that Bill comes to our games in his sneakers. We need to tell
her that he looks fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky made her way toward the waving teammates and stood for
a photo. They didn't say a word to her about ``Bill,'' but just
stood and grinned. ``Us with Monica,'' Bullett said. ``Now I can
die and go to heaven.''

INSURANCE-FRAUD SUSPECT MARTIN FRANKEL FACING EXTRADITION TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Martin Frankel, the fugitive American
financier wanted on charges of embezzling more than $200 million
from insurance companies, may soon be returned to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, arrested in Hamburg in September after evading the FBI
for months after fleeing to Europe, pleaded guilty Friday to German
charges that he evaded taxes on about $5 million worth of diamonds
he had brought to finance his flight from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's plea removes the main obstacle to Frankel's extradition
to the United States, where he faces more than 30 charges of fraud
and money laundering, as well as civil suits claiming damages of
$600 million.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities have already approved the U.S. Justice
Department's request to extradite the financier, and they have
indicated willingness to do so as soon as they have prosecuted
Frankel on the German charges.
</P>
<P>
   Though German court officials declined to say exactly what the
next step in the process will be, Frankel could be returned to the
United States as early as the end of next week. Frankel's German
trial will be concluded Wednesday, after all sides make their final
statements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the charge of evading about $1 million worth of
taxes on the jewels he brought to Germany, Frankel was also
indicted for carrying eight false passports and impersonating a
British citizen while in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, bearded and rumpled and wearing a heavy wool overcoat
despite the spring weather, made it clear throughout his short
trial that he wanted to stay in Germany as long as he could. He
spoke English in the courtroom, and his remarks were translated
into German by a court official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans respect human values,'' Frankel told reporters in
the courtroom Friday. ``An extradition to America would be the same
as an execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's guilty plea Friday is the latest in a series of
reversals that have befuddled Frankel's own attorneys and angered
the presiding judge. On Wednesday, Frankel balked at even
confirming his name and place of birth, and then refused to enter
any plea or make any statement on his own behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But later, under pressure from Judge Horst Muntzger, Frankel
announced that he wanted to call four witnesses _ three from the
United States and one from Italy. The witnesses included Mona Kim
and Cynthia Allison, two of his female associates who joined
Frankel for part of his time last year in Rome and Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   German officials had worried that arranging for testimony from
the witnesses _ something Frankel had said earlier would not be
necessary _ would delay the trial for months. Hans-Gerd Meine, the
prosecutor in charge of the case, warned Frankel that the German
government might simply drop the charges and proceed immediately
with the extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Before his abrupt flight from the United States last year,
Frankel built up a convoluted business empire by acquiring small
insurance companies and then arranging to have himself put in
charge of investing the companies' assets.
</P>
<P>
   While secluded in his mansion in Greenwich, Conn., Frankel is
accused of illegally using a multitude of aliases and using the
insurance companies' money to pay for a lavish life. But as the
scheme was collapsing around him, he disappeared May 1999.
Firefighters in Greenwich found his mansion on fire and discovered
volumes of documents stuffed into the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel led the FBI in a global cat-and-mouse game, first
reportedly hiding with Kim in Rome and then leaving for Hamburg
just as FBI agents were about to locate him. It took several more
months to track Frankel down at a small but luxurious Hamburg
hotel. German police arrested Frankel, who was accompanied at the
time by Allison, and he has been imprisoned awaiting trial and
extradition ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's German attorneys say he has experienced enormous mood
swings and habitually changed his mind on legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Though he does not speak German, Frankel apparently made
acquaintances in prison who recommended lawyers to represent him.
Thomas Piplak, the first attorney Frankel retained, said his client
decided to add a second and then a third attorney to the defense
team.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Piplak resigned as Frankel's attorney, and he has been
represented by Dirk Meinicke and Guenther Thiel.

<P>
   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.

<P>
   RACE-POLITICS (Bainbridge Island, Wash.) _ The ferry from
Seattle is 10 minutes from landing as first light slips through the
mist of Puget Sound, and Ron Sims is still not sure what face he
will present to the world today. He wears a politician's suit _
standard uniform for the leader of a county with a population
greater than that of a half-dozen states. Passengers recognize him:
There are stares and smiles. But he is also attracting the kind of
curious glances that might fall on a square-jawed, rock-shouldered
black man sitting next to a sheriff's deputy as he arrives at a
place where blacks are more abstractions that neighbors. When he
was sworn in three years ago, Sims became one of three nonwhites
holding the top political jobs in the state. The others are Gary
Locke, the nation's first and only Chinese-American governor, and
Norm Rice, Seattle's mayor, who is black. Sims is known as an
ebullient man; he is also a natural storyteller with a compelling
one to offer, a bootstrap tale about a journey from anger to open
arms. Yet his friends and advisers have long urged him to keep a
large part of that story _ race _ bottled up. What people want to
hear are his views on property taxes, traffic growth and salmon. On
this day, however, Sims has been asked to say something in honor of
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and he is tempted, he says, to
let them see the whole man. But do they really want to hear what it
is like for a black politician to live in two worlds? By Timothy
Egan.

   RACE-CHURCH (Decatur, Ga.) _ Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m Sunday
the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. And yet the Tabernacle
is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What draws its
members is the intensity of their Pentacostal faith, which teaches
that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all believers,
regardless of background. By Kevin Sack.

   RACE-IMMIGRANTS (Miami) _ Before they left Cuba for America in
1994 Joel Ruiz, who is black, and Achmed Valdes, who is white, were
the best of friends. Today, in Miami, the two men live only 4 miles
apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by a far
greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in Cuba.
In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to the
white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race. For
the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their skin
defines the outlines of their lives _ where they live, the friends
they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they eat. By
Mirta Ojito.

   RACE-MILITARY (Fort Knox, Ky.) _ On a chill December morning,
two soldiers _ one black, one white, both part of an institution
portrayed as a model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in
the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the
victim of racism; one because of an award, the other because of a
transfer. The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment
anymore. Its work force is integrated. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and supposedly no one gives it a second thought. But that
is an idealized image. The Pentagon has found that two-thirds of
its men and women had experienced a racially offensive encounter in
the previous 12 months. And those findings are more or less
mirrored here at Fort Knox. By Steven A. Holmes.

   RACE-TV-DRAMA (Baltimore) _ Who Gets to Tell a Black Story: When
David Simon proposed to HBO a television series based on his book,
``The Corner,'' about black inner-city drug addicts, he was not
thinking much about the fact that he was white. But as the project
began to take shape, the issues of race loomed ever larger. HBO was
not about to make a series about black drug addicts created by, as
one HBO executive put it later, ``a bunch of white guys.'' Charles
Dutton, who had grown up in the city, spent his early years on its
streets and had his own tale of redemption, was chosen to direct
all six episodes. But as he said, there would not be one moment
when he would forget that ``it's a white writer and a white
producer and it's HBO and a black director.'' By Janny Scott.

   RACE-WEB-ENTREPRENEUR (Atlanta) _ On the eve of the year 2000,
Timothy Fitzgerald Stevenson Cobb Jr. had much to celebrate. Over
two sleep-deprived years, he and his partner, Jeff Levy, had built
an Internet research company in Atlanta and by May 1999 each man's
net worth had swelled by about $25 million. It conferred an
uncommon distinction on Cobb: He became one of the country's few
black Internet millionaires. To Cobb, Jeff Levy understood his
satisfaction in a way that probably no one else could. Yet Cobb
also recalled a creeping uneasiness that weekend. Shortly after
their company's IPO, Levy and Cobb went off to start separate
Internet ventures. Levy's was doing fine. Not so Cobb's. The racial
backdrop to Cobb's accomplishments went largely unmentioned by the
people he did business with, but he seemed never to forget it. When
things were good, being black made them better; when things were
not so good, it made them worse. By Amy Harmon.

   RACE-MEAT-PLANT (Tar Heel, N.C.) _ The first thing you learn at
the Smithfield hog plant here is the value of a sharp knife. The
second thing you learn is that not everyone has to work with a
knife. Whites, blacks, American Indians and Mexicans, they all have
their separate stations, but it is blacks and Mexicans that are
left to battle over the dirty jobs at the factory, one of the only
places within a 50-mile radius in this muddy corner of North
Carolina where a person might make more than $8 an hour. While
Smithfield's profits nearly doubled over the past year, wages have
remained flat. So a lot of Americans have quit and a lot of
Mexicans have been hired to take their places. But the workers see
one another, more than management, as the problem, and they see the
competition in skin tones. By Charlie LeDuff.

RUSSIA EASES UP ON MEDIA MOGUL, BUT CHARGES REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Responding to rising criticism within Russia and
abroad, Russian authorities Friday released media mogul Vladimir
Gusinsky, whose arrest and three-day imprisonment fueled
accusations that the Kremlin is cracking down on the press.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not drop the swindling and theft charges against
Gusinsky, whose Media-Most company owns broadcast and print media
that have criticized the Kremlin in recent months. Gusinsky's
lawyers said he was freed only after giving a written pledge not to
leave Russia, and following an unexplained, last-minute change of
heart by investigators that appeared to have been supported by
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   If Gusinsky was disappointed with the terms of his release, it
did not show as he walked into Media-Most's central Moscow office
late Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank all those who supported me,'' a smiling
Gusinsky told journalists, in comments broadcast on his flagship
television station, NTV. ``First of all journalists and all my
colleagues, Russian and non-Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky's arrest sparked a furor among Russia's political and
business elite, which accused the Kremlin of trying to shut up
critics, and prompted concern from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on a three-day visit to Spain and Germany aimed at
improving Russia's ties with Western Europe, was instead put on the
defensive by embarassing questions about the arrest of the
prominent business and media leader. Thursday in Madrid, Putin
called the decision to arrest Gusinsky ``excessive'' and Friday in
Berlin repeated that he thought the arrest was a mistake, though on
both occasions the Russian president has denied the case was
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Gusinsky is suspected of taking part in the
theft of $10 million in state funds in a privatization deal. The
lead investigator, Valery Nikolayev, told state TV there were no
``political motives'' and it was ``a common criminal case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gusinsky's lawyers and colleagues say the arrest smacks of
intimidation in response to Media-Most's journalistic edge. That
includes the constant criticism of Putin's crackdown in Chechnya,
the probes on corruption in the FSB security service Putin once
led, and investigations of alleged money laundering by Kremlin
insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky used to be an insider himself, but he broke with other
business and political leaders, particularly fellow magnate Boris
Berezovsky, who remains close to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most officials charge that the Kremlin was behind the raid
by masked, machinegun-toting police on the company's offices last
month. Friday, editors of four Media-Most holdings said Gusinsky's
arrest had been preceded by informal bribe offers and threats.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Venediktov, editor of the Echo of Moscow radio station,
said he has met regularly in the Kremlin since last summer with
``two highly placed officials'' to discuss the government's
objections to critical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joked, with smiles, that Gusinsky would soon be put in
jail,'' Venediktov told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton chose Echo of Moscow to demonstrate his
sympathy for Media-Most, by giving the station an interview during
his visit to Moscow earlier this month _ instead of Russian state
radio or television.
</P>
<P>
   One theory popular in Moscow is that Putin had been unaware that
Gusinsky was about to be arrested. This theory has it that a
Kremlin clique led by Berezovsky made the move while Putin was
abroad to embarrass the president while reminding him of his
political weakness.
</P>
<P>
   But NTV head Yevgeny Kiselyov said that theory missed the point.
``Gusinsky is a political hostage who we consider has been taken by
the authorities in order to shut up NTV television and other parts
of the Media-Most empire,'' Kiselyov said. ``I am sick and tired of
hearing about the good king and the bad court. If he did not know
about the plans to arrest Mr. Gusinsky, it shows Mr. Putin does not
control the situation in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Gusinsky's lawyers had said investigators
formally charging him had initially refused to free him from the
overcrowded, 18th century Butyrskaya jail.
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, the Prosecutor General's office released a
statement saying investigators had changed their minds.

   It occupies a marginal space between the public and the private.
It can signify wealth and virility. We always want to repress it.

<P>
   Trash, the academy is ready for you.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, academics are finding that garbage _ the
previously ignored contents of wastebaskets and Dumpsters _ holds
vital clues to consumer culture. What people consume has long been
studied on college campuses and in academic journals. But, some
scholars argue, the nether part of consumerism, what people
discard, may be just as important.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Strasser, a history professor at the University of
Delaware, writes in her recent book, ``Waste and Want: A Social
History of Trash,'' that ``what counts as trash depends on who's
counting.'' In other words, a useless potato scrap in one culture
may be a crucial soup starter in another.
</P>
<P>
   Why trash now?
</P>
<P>
   Some have grumbled that trash studies are just another academic
jobs program: something grubby and controversial with shock value
from which to generate paper, so to speak. But others, like Robin
Nagle, who teaches a course at New York University on the
anthropology of trash, view it as a timely concern. ``There's so
much of it and it never goes away, and in considering our impact as
a species, it's a pretty significant mark,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic interest in refuse was awakened a decade ago by a
seminal real-world event: A garbage barge called the Mobro 4000
drifted along the world's waterways with over 3 tons of trash from
Long Island and no place to dump it.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with the prospect of homeless trash and limited
space, the nation was swept with garbage guilt. Under the title
``Buried Alive,'' Newsweek ran a cover story noting that the
Mobro's trip to nowhere was ``to the trash crisis what the sinking
of the Lusitania was to World War I.'' But while homeowners
envisioned overflowing Dumpsters and shrinking landfill space,
scholars focused on the social and political effects of detritus in
a culture of abundance. Had the state relegated our garbage to the
private realm, as a form of political control? Do we generate trash
to demonstrate our buying power, often a symbol of our sexual
power?
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish studies should not be confused with the more practical
work of solid-waste managers, who concern themselves with space: Is
there enough room in the world's landfills for the increasing
number of plastic diapers we use?
</P>
<P>
   Garbologists, on the other hand, concern themselves with
content: What's in whose garbage bag and what it means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wait till everyone who is throwing away stuff is dead
before we tell them why it's important?'' asks William Rathje,
director of the Garbage Project at the University of Arizona and
co-author, with Cullen Murphy, of the book ``Rubbish! The
Archaeology of Garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rathje's class actually excavates landfill and analyzes its
contents to learn about what consumers use up. He got little
respect from academic circles, he said, until the Mobro sailed.
Then one archaeologist (who used to lump him derisively with
solid-waste managers) sent him a note urging him to change his
title from garbologist to garbage archaeologist. That is when
Rathje knew there was room for trash in the ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   In his work on trash, Rathje actually gets his hands dirty; by
contrast, the theorists rummage through abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Johnson is a graduate student of Victorian literature at
Stanford University and the co-editor, with William Cohen, of an
forthcoming essay collection, ``Filth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets rid of trash, it's looked on as abject,'' he
said, ``but it recirculates symbolically and you can never really
get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The essays in Johnson and Cohen's volume will examine such
topics as the relation of sanitary reform to gender identity and
social class, the ideology of sanitary reform in colonial India and
the use of filthy language in the radical theater of 19th-century
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For students of the Victorian era, the sanitary reform movement
of the 19th century reflected a changing attitude toward garbage,
and a broader shift in the individual's relationship to society. In
documents like Edwin Chadwick's sanitary report of 1850, they see
the desire for cleanliness, a value of the new bourgeoisie, leading
to a mountain of trash by encouraging people to throw old things
away. Strasser calls this ``the veneration of newness.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1850s, garbage was a commodity that dust pickers would
pay for the right to collect. Discarded scraps were the raw
material for quilts, soap, charcoal and fertilizer. Almost
everything was reused. In New York City, pigs wandered the streets,
eating garbage and, in turn, feeding the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But with reform, Londoners began paying for their garbage to be
taken away. Decades later, after the period of thrift imposed
during World War II, America went further and began to celebrate
disposability, using paper cups _ and even paper clothing _ for
purposes not only of cleanliness but of liberation from fuss as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Popularizing hygiene was bad news for dirt. It was no longer
welcome in the public or the private realms and needed to go
somewhere else _ out there, into those liminal landfills of the
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Academics are increasingly exploring the social and
psychological consequences of this repression of dirt. ``Dust: A
History of the Small and the Invisible,'' by Joseph Amato, laments
Windex and the dust-repellent household surfaces that have
relegated dust to the corners of our consciousness. The study
reminds us that, according to the Book of Genesis, we are all made
of dust and destined to return to it, so we should appreciate the
microscopic stuff that has been brutally repressed in a hygienic
society.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Strasser says, the richness of waste as a topic for
academic investigation lies in how people choose to designate it.
``I define my topic, and my interest, not just in piles of trash
but the sorting process that takes place in the marginal spaces
between the public and the private,'' she writes. ``The marginal
things we're not sure of we sort in marginal spaces of the house,
the attic, the basement.'' By such activities, people reveal
themselves. Or, as a German philosopher might put it, we are what
we throw away.

AWARE OF IMAGE DAMAGE, N.Y. CRACKS DOWN IN `WOLF PACK' CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With public indignation mounting, the city is
cracking down on the ``wolf pack'' of young men who stripped,
mauled, and terrorized dozens of young women in Central Park last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ten men have been arrested, six of them handcuffed and paraded
in a ``perp walk'' before news cameras Friday, as a sign that
law-enforcement officials consider them serious criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Police have examined 10 videotapes of the assaults _ shot and
provided by citizens who just happened to be taking pictures in the
park that day _ to identify and capture more suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the response, more than 40 women have come forward
to say they too were molested in the park _ 10 times the number
initially reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police commissioner Howard Safir pledged to hunt down every
assailant who took part in the attacks, stating, while staring into
a TV camera, ``We are going to find you.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir also announced Friday that he has stepped up an internal
probe into charges that police on the scene stood by while the
assaults were going on _ with 76 sergeants and several officers
interrogated so far.
</P>
<P>
   One police officer investigating the assaults, who asked not to
be identified, said the surge of arrests and detective-work has
been due to the sudden realization of the incident's impact on the
city's international image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told these things happen at Mardi Gras (in New Orleans)
every year,'' the officer said, ``but this is Central Park, this is
the jewel of the world. If there's outrage about it in the world
community, and if this means people in Europe decide not to come to
New York on vacation, then that outrage _ that perception _ has to
be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of action presents a bustling picture of what the
NYPD does best _ but it's also a far cry from the reaction in the
first 48 hours after the event.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani tried to minimize its
significance, noting that roughly the same amount of violence took
place the same weekend last year and that crime, in Central Park
and the city generally, is way down from the days before he was
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Safir issued a similar shrug. ``If I put 10,000 cops in Central
Park,'' he said, ``we couldn't cover every single area.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until public shock boiled and spread worldwide did they take
a harder stance.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Giuliani had forgotten the basic principles of what
made his administration's crime-fighting policies so successful _
and made him, at least in his first term, such a popular mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Those principles, which he used to spell out repeatedly, were:
No tolerance of even apparently minor disorder in public places;
and, when it comes to group violence, or what used to be called
``wolf packs,'' no resting until every member of the pack was
tracked down.
</P>
<P>
   He and his first police commissioner, William Bratton, saw these
principles as the key not only to cutting crime, but also to
restoring confidence in the city as a safe place to live, work, and
visit _ and, therefore, as a tool of economic development, as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview, Giuliani said, ``An article in a foreign
magazine that says crime in New York City has gone down _ that's
much more effective than any ad I can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet two of the first known victims of Sunday's ``wilding'' spree
were a French and a British tourist, one of whom, in the city on
her honeymoon, was stripped of all her clothing and mauled by
several men while two others held her husband down.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has since met with the tourists and with several other
victims, but it took him a bit longer to do so than might have once
been the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not known precisely how the mayhem erupted or
whether all the attackers _ now believed to number as many as 50 _
knew each other or whether some simply, spontaneously, joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Reports now indicate the attacks began much earlier in the
afternoon, while the Puerto Rican Day parade _ attended by a
million marchers, most of them young, some of them drunk or high _
was still making its way down Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The assault expanded after 6 pm, as celebrants spilled into
Central Park, with most of the incidents taking place along the
park's southern _ and most publicly visible _ edge.
</P>
<P>
   The videotapes, which have been repeatedly shown on local TV
newscasts, show dense crowds. If police were off to the side, it is
conceivable they did not see what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   However, while some victims who approached police afterward were
helped, others said they were turned away, in some cases
dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   There are also reports that police along the parade route
ignored open displays of alcohol and marijuana, possibly to avoid
provoking racial incidents. One police consultant, who asked not to
be named, said, ``If cops were relaxing in the face of public
drinking, that's an invitation to disaster when you've got a
million people on the streets.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jules Feiffer's moody modern dancer, the comic strip figure who
has leaped and stretched interpretively to spring, summer, autumn
and winter for more than 40 years, is finally hanging up her
tights. The reason? Her only venue, ``Feiffer,'' Feiffer's doodly
comic strip of personal, sexual and political rants, is ending
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 52-week-per-year schedule was relentless,'' Feiffer said,
speaking of his comic strip, which has run every Sunday in The Los
Angeles Times, The Miami Herald, The Chicago Tribune and The
Observer in London. ``I'm getting to be an old man,'' he said. So
``the dancer is retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Feiffer started drawing his strip in 1956 for The Village Voice.
It was about the ``usual boy-girl stuff,'' as he described it. The
dancer made her first appearance in 1957 with ``a dance to
spring.'' Then she began doing interpretive pieces to the rest of
the seasons. In spring her dance was stretchy, hopeful and giddy.
In summer it was ``lazy, so lazy'' and ultimately wilted in the
heat. In the autumn she danced wistfully to the leaves falling. She
and the strip were syndicated in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The dancer, who was given to leaps of ecstasy, ranting and
silliness, was modeled after ``the first girl who slept with me and
spent the night,'' Feiffer said. She was a modern dancer attending
Brooklyn College, he said, adding that he thinks she has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early dancer looked just like her,'' Feiffer said, ``and
as I changed girlfriends, her body changed.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Feiffer can remember, he said the dancer was never
modeled on his wife, Jenny, but the dancer did come to represent
Feiffer himself. ``At a certain point, the girl became me and I
became her. She was there to talk about how lousy her life was.
That I will miss. It is not the cartoon I got tired of, it is the
weekly schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Feiffer, who is 71, writes plays, teaches a course on humor and
truth at Southampton College of Long Island University, writes and
illustrates children's books, and still draws political cartoons
for The New York Times, The New Yorker, American Prospect and
Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard work trying to make Al Gore and George W. Bush funny
all the time, he noted. ``Something had to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Feiffer's farewell comic strips have already run, and
the last will appear Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to give up the strip two or three months ago,'' he
said. ``I was just going to drop it without saying anything, but
there are readers who are going to be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   So Feiffer devoted the last few strips to explaining to the
dancer why she is now out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   Feiffer tells the dancer that he is giving up the strip. The
dancer gasps, ``You're dying.'' But as she finds out that he is
quitting merely to devote more time to his life beyond his weekly
six panels, she starts berating him. She calls him pathetic and
asks whether he is abandoning the strip because it has become
boring or ``because no one of your generation knows you're around
anymore and young people have never heard of you?''
</P>
<P>
   Feiffer is unfazed: ``It's my turn to dance,'' he says, shoving
her out of the way.

3.3-LEVEL QUAKE RATTLES WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would have been no big deal in Los Angeles or San Francisco.
An earthquake measuring 3.3 on the famous Richter Scale would send
barely a noticeable ripple through a glass of Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   But in Western Massachusetts, where such tremblors are rare,
residents aren't used to being rattled in their beds as the earth
sends jarring reminders about its geological stresses.
</P>
<P>
   The quake Friday at 12:03 am, although considered mild, was one
of the strongest ever recorded in New England west of the
Connecticut River. It sent worried residents out into the street
and had seismologists and other scientists pondering again if The
Big One could ever strike here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was that a plane went down,'' said Debbie
Christie, of Granville, Conn., who lives along one of the approach
lanes for Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Conn. ``There
was a loud crash and then a sound like thunder rolling down the
valley,''
</P>
<P>
   No damage was reported but the vibration was felt all the way
from Northampton to northern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the West Coast, where earthquakes occur primarily along
well-known fault lines and in some cases even at roughly
predictable intervals, quakes in New England tend to leave
seismologists scratching their heads: they can occur virtually
anywhere, at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Though the region is riddled with ancient fault lines, most of
them more than 200 million years old, there are no known
currently-active faults along which earthquakes align themselves,
and they often occur in places with no known faults.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the East Coast is thousands of miles from the nearest
boundary between the ``plates'' which make up the Earth's crust. It
is along the boundaries of those plates _ for instance, in
California, Alaska and Japan _ that earthquakes are by far the most
common. The nearest such boundary is in the middle of the Atlantic
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   And, it turns out, that may be the place where the stresses that
cause earthquakes in New England originate. Research has shown that
most quakes in the region arise from the compression of the crust
in an East-West direction. That is just what would be expected if
the mid-ocean ridge, where the ocean floor is slowly but constantly
expanding outward, was the cause of the earthquake-triggering
stresses.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately that provides no clues as to where or when the
next temblor could strike. This region has suffered major
earthquakes in the distant past _ one estimated at magnitude 6 was
centered on Cape Ann in 1755 and caused damage from Boston to
Portland, and one in 1638, estimated at 6.5, was probably centered
in New Hampshire and was felt by the Pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   But such large quakes are rare hereabouts. John Ebel, director
of the Weston (Mass.) Observatory, which is the principal seismic
recording center for the region, said that earthquakes of magnitude
5 or greater _ the level at which there starts to be some damage _
occur somewhere in New England on average about once every 50
years. The last was a pair of such quakes centered in Ossipee,
N.H., in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes of magnitude 6 or more, which cause severe damage,
are much more rare. They are estimated to occur only every 450 to
500 years, Ebel said.
</P>
<P>
   Quakes of between magnitude 3 and 4, such as Friday's, occur
about two or three times a year in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ebel stressed, ``those averages really have no predictive
value at all. At any given locality in New England, instead of
stresses building up over tens or hundreds of years as in
California, it would probably build up over hundreds of thousands,
or even millions of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But while big, destructive earthquakes don't happen often in
this area, when the next big one comes along it could have
devastating effects. For one thing, Boston and surrounding cities,
though they have good building codes in place now, still have many
old unreinforced masonry buildings _ the kind that are most
vulnerable to earthquake damage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Boston is built on a lot of landfill,'' said
Ebel, including most of the Back Bay and much of South Boston, and
``areas of landfill and river muds tend to amplify ground
shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   One other important difference is that the shaking of
earthquakes tends to spread over an area 4 to 10 times greater in
eastern earthquakes than on the West Coast. This is probably
because the Earth's crust here is older and cooler and spreads the
motion more easily, Ebel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My seismologist friends in California are always amazed at how
widely even small earthquakes are felt here,'' Ebel said, ``and my
colleagues here are always amazed at how small the areas affected
by bigger earthquakes in California are.''
</P>
<P>
   While California earthquakes along previously unmapped fault
lines occur only occasionally, they are typical in the East, said
Charles Doll, a seismologist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and director of the New England Seismic Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be surprised by a big earthquake tomorrow,'' he said,
``in an area where we don't have records of any earthquakes.''

BRAZIL SEEKS TO CAPITALIZE ON RAIN-FOREST PRODUCTS

<P>
   MAUES, Brazil _ For decades, this remote town overlooking the
chocolate-colored waters of the Amazon River has been the main
source of guarana, a bright-red, highly caffeinated berry that is
believed by many Brazilians to be an aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a Romeo-and-Juliet-esque legend that guarana
originated from a tempestuous affair between two teen-agers from
rival Indian tribes, Brazilians have consumed guarana in a variety
of forms: teas, tablets, even soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   These days, guarana provides a clear example of the way many of
the 20 million Brazilians living in the Amazon River Basin are
seeking to harness the region's exotic flora and fauna to promote
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better product to represent the Amazon than a natural
stimulant that is harvested without harming the environment?'' said
Valmir Ferrari, an agronomist with Companhia de Bebidas das
Americas, a Brazilian beverage company planning to export a guarana
soft drink to rich industrialized nations in a venture with
PepsiCo. ``This could be bigger than Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   While the libido-enhancing effects of guarana may have more to
do with fiction than fact, it is no small wonder that products from
the Amazon, a region that has long gripped popular imagination as
the world's largest rain forest, are being viewed as a way for the
region to develop without harming the environment at a time when
other forces are threatening to speed its depletion.
</P>
<P>
   Several massive road projects are under way to link the Amazon
with other parts of Brazil and are apt to increase migration to the
region. The expected increase in commerce resulting from better
integration with the rest of the country is expected to increase
pressure on an already precarious infrastructure, according to a
report recently released by groups including the World Wildlife
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   And traditional threats to the Amazon, like cattle ranching,
timber razing and wide-scale soybean farming, continue to loom
large. According to a separate report issued by Brazil's
environment ministry, an area of 6,347 square miles of rain forest,
roughly the size of the state of Hawaii, was destroyed last year as
a result of such activities.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that some of the Amazon's business and
political interests have begun to carry the flag of environmentally
friendly economic development projects. According to Joao
Capiberibe, the governor of Amapa, one of the nine states making up
the Brazilian Amazon, it is a question of economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global economy we are becoming part of is one in which
diversity produces riches,'' said Capiberibe, whose government is
viewed as a pioneer after prohibiting wood cutting and soybean
farming. To replace these activities, Amapa is supporting the
production of organically harvested hearts-of-palm and oil made
from cashew nuts.
</P>
<P>
   There are similar efforts taking place in other Amazonian
states. One of the most commercially promising sustainable
development projects is under way on tracts of land where the rain
forest was already razed to make way for activities like ranching
in Para, a state neighboring Amapa.
</P>
<P>
   There a company called AgroPalma is using the region's ample
humidity and sunlight to grow African oil-palm trees to produce
palm oil, which is used as a cooking oil in the cuisine of
northeastern Brazil and by food processors to make products like
margarine and shortening.
</P>
<P>
   AgroPalma hopes to make Brazil a contender in the palm-oil
industry, allowing the country to compete with Malaysia, the
leading producer, and other Asian nations. One of the company's
main selling points is the view that the palm-oil business is an
agricultural activity that does not harm the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We defend the rational exploitation of the environment,'' said
Harald Brunckhorst, executive director of AgroPalma, which is
backed by Aloizio Faria, one of Brazil's most prominent financiers.
``Palm trees take so well on land that has been degraded by other
types of farming or ranching, so we don't have to clear new lands
to cultivate.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the company is eyeing the potential of the organic
food market by seeking to increase ecologically certified
production. For instance, AgroPalma is reducing the use of
pesticides by using natural biocontrol agents from the rain forest
to combat plant diseases transmitted by insects, like spear rot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our organic production is 10 percent and growing,'' said
Brunckhorst. ``It is the best way to gain market share in the First
World.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the palm-oil business is labor-intensive, its advocates
also claim that it is a viable alternative to economic activities
like gold mining, which pollutes water sources in the Amazon
through miners' use of mercury. And jobs on palm-oil plantations
operated by AgroPalma and other companies could alleviate migration
to large Amazonian cities like Manaus and Belem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any economic project in the Amazon is useless if it does not
take into account people's livelihood in addition to the
environmental impact,'' said Eduardo Morales, director for the
eastern Amazon region at Embrapa, the government's agricultural
research institute. ``The rain forest cannot be preserved if the
people living in it cannot feed and school their children.''
</P>
<P>
   While palm oil is one of the few environmentally sound products
from the Amazon that have large-scale corporate potential _
AgroPalma's clients include companies like Frito-Lay _ there are
several companies and small cooperatives that are selling exotic
products with tongue-twisting names like cupuacu, a fruit used to
make juices and chocolate, or pirarucu, a freshwater fish that can
grow to be nearly 9 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quickest way for an Amazonian to get some control over his
economic destiny is to get involved in small-scale sustainable
development projects,'' said Moacyr Bittencourt, the program
officer for marketing natural products in Brazil for the World
Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   That group is involved in projects to sell sandals made from
rubber collected by rubber tappers in the western state of Acre,
which was home to the rain-forest advocate Chico Mendes before his
murder in 1988, in addition to a reforestation project in the state
of Amapa to help people there break into the market for aromatic
timber like rosewood.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For any of these projects to succeed, their directors might
benefit from studying previous efforts to develop businesses in the
Amazon. The region, larger than Western Europe, has a spectacular
history of failures to establish viable enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of Manaus, a 16-hour boat ride from Maues and the
largest city in the region, an ornate turn-of-the-century opera
house and a few European-style buildings are all that remain of the
boom witnessed a century ago in the Amazon from rubber production.
Competition from Asian rubber producers eventually wiped out the
wealth of Manaus, leaving behind these symbols from another time.
</P>
<P>
   Or there is Fordlandia, a far-flung American-style outpost in
the state of Para established by Henry Ford in the 1920s to produce
carnauba wax, used in the production of rubber. All that remains of
Fordlandia, which halted production at the end of World War II, is
a few buildings and a church. The town's golf course was long ago
transformed into an area for grazing cattle.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Daniel Ludwig, an American shipping magnate,
invested nearly $1 billion in a project to produce cellulose and
other products on a Connecticut-sized property near the border of
the states of Para and Amapa, only to have the debt-ridden
enterprise fall into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any company that is seeking to avoid the fate of
these ventures it is AmBev, the company planning to export a
guarana drink with Pepsi. It already has Pepsi's experience to
learn from, since Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y., stopped making a
guarana drink called Josta shortly after introducing it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, AmBev hopes to capture 1 percent of the $70
billion global soft-drink market with its ``Antarctica Guarana''
brand, labeled a ``Rain Forest Original'' on bright-green cans and
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Although AmBev's installations in Maues are impressive,
including a well-kept guarana plantation on the town's outskirts
and a research center in the town, it is clear that the guarana
used to produce AmBev's soft drinks is only a minuscule part of the
process.
</P>
<P>
   While AmBev does not disclose the secret formula of its guarana
drink, it acknowledges that the percentage of the berry in the
mixture is kept to a minute level so children can consume it
without getting too much of a buzz. After all, guarana has three
times as much caffeine as coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to capitalize on the allure the Amazonian rain
forest has in the imagination of the entire world,'' said Victorio
de Marchi, co-president of AmBev. ``How to convey this is probably
more a job for our marketing people than it is for our
researchers.''

`THE ROCKIES' AIMS HIGH BUT MISSES MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B-  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Rockies'' is the kind of breezy documentary that makes The
History Channel the TV equivalent of Coors beer, which for years
had a fabulous mystique because many Americans couldn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel has enjoyed the same cachet. People in
cable-poor areas were ready to surrender their firstborn for a hit
of THC that wouldn't get them arrested. They'd heard it was the
greatest thing since front-seat cup holders and generally made
pests of themselves inquiring of their cable providers as to when
their neighborhoods might be blessed with its arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Expectation is usually better than realization, of course. Turns
out Coors was no big deal, another light American lager without
bite. The History Channel _ alternate name: The Hitler Channel _ is
pleasing to the armchair historian, its programming neatly packaged
and stacked like cans on a supermarket shelf. But, like a lot of
convenience food, it frequently leaves one hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockies'' has this effect. Four one-hour programs, airing
on consecutive nights, scale the heights from different approaches,
providing a fascinating assortment of informational nuggets. But in
clambering across the scree of Rocky Mountain history, the series
sets off a cascade of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday night's ``Great Explorers'' installment, no one ever
bothers to disclose why Maj. John Wesley Powell needed barometers,
which he almost lost, in his exploration of Colorado's treacherous
Green River in 1869. It probably had to do with measuring altitude
and perhaps the river's total drop in elevation from source to
terminus. But it is never fully explained and, as the film moves on
to the next subject, the omission leaves one of those nagging
little questions rattling around in the brain, the sort that
inevitably get in the way of total enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a segment in Wednesday's episode, ``War &AMP; Disaster,''
deals with a copper-mine fire in Butte, Mont., that killed 168 men
in 1917. In telling the story of Marnus Duggan, a heroic miner
whose quick thinking and resourcefulness saved many of his
co-workers, the film never explains how or why Duggan died after
the fire was out.
</P>
<P>
   The other two installments of ``The Rockies'' are Tuesday's
``Striking It Rich,'' including a segment on the creator of the
Coors brewing empire, and Thursday's ``Taming the Mountains,''
which may be the best of the bunch for its telling of John D.
Rockefeller Jr.'s secretive efforts to preserve the Jackson Hole
Valley in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Peter Fonda as narrator is understandable: He
lives in Montana. It's also troubling: Henry's son and Bridget's
dad is a fuzzy-tongued word swallower who makes Sly Stallone's
Rocky Balboa the paragon of erudition.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ``The Rockies'' succeeds modestly in spite of Fonda's
marble-mouthed, stone-faced delivery. What it might have been with
David McCullough or Bill Moyers hosting is something to ponder. As
it is, ``The Rockies'' is like a history book that could have been
better researched and better packaged. It doesn't alter the
incredible history pouring out of the Rockies like a stream in
springtime. And it doesn't destroy the notion that a documentary
series centered on the Rockies' place in U.S. history is a
terrifically good idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies. Four-hour documentary about the Rocky Mountains and
their place in American history. Narrated by Peter Fonda. Airing
Monday through Thursday on The History Channel. Repeating Sunday in
one four-hour broadcast. Parental guideline rating: TV-G.

 &HT;    In Chapter 11, Flooring America debt to Shaw Industries hurts
stock value
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Flooring America's bankruptcy filing will likely hit
Shaw Industries the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents for the Chapter 11 filing were not immediately
available, but Dalton-based Shaw was the first to acknowledge a
significant impact.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, the world's largest carpet maker and Flooring America's
largest supplier, said the retailer owes it about $14 million, plus
a promissory note of about $12 million. The manufacturer is also a
guarantor of certain leases for stores it sold to Flooring America
in 1998. Shaw will lose some of the $80 million in annual sales it
makes to the retailer's company-owned stores.
</P>
<P>
   That exposure prompted Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Dennis
Rosenberg to cut his earnings estimates on Shaw for this year to
$1.65 a share from $1.70, and its 2001 estimate to $1.70 a share
from $1.80. The estimate for this year does not include a possible
12 cents-a-share writeoff for the $26 million in accounts
receivable and promissory notes.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's stock fell 6.5 percent Friday to $12.44, down 88 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on other vendors wasn't clear Friday. Calhoun-based
Mohawk Industries, the second-largest carpet maker, said it doesn't
sell a lot of merchandise to Flooring America's corporate stores.
</P>
<P>
   Some suppliers had cut off shipments to certain Flooring America
stores before the bankruptcy filing. Flooring America Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer David Nichols said Friday that the company
is working with vendors on a cash-only basis and is trying to
re-establish credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally dedicated to paying (our vendors) back,''
Nichols said. ``This reorganization is allowing us to step back and
catch our breath.''

   BRAZIL-AMAZON (Maues, Brazil) _ For decades, this remote town
overlooking the chocolate-colored waters of the Amazon River has
been the main source of guarana, a bright red, highly caffeinated
berry that is believed by many Brazilians to be an aphrodisiac.
Inspired by a legend that guarana originated from a tempestuous
affair between two teenagers from rival Indian tribes, Brazilians
have consumed guarana in the form of teas, tablets and even soft
drinks. These days, guarana provides a clear example of the way
Brazilians living in the Amazon River Basin are seeking to harness
the region's exotic flora and fauna to promote economic
development. By Simon Romero.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Kathleen Neal Cleaver, instantly recognizable
by her iconic Afro and knee-high leather boots, was writing to
agitate for the Black Panther Party.
</P>
<P>
   Today she is 55, the Afro has given way to a cascade of
golden-brown locks, and Cleaver is engaged in a rather different
writing project. She is plumbing her buried past for a book aptly
titled ``Memories of Love and War.''
</P>
<P>
   Unearthing those recollections has taken years. It has forced
her to recall the murders and incarcerations of countless friends.
It has pushed her to reflect on what happened to many others,
including her ex-husband, Eldridge Cleaver, the Panthers'
information minister who later became a Republican, a Mormon and a
drug abuser. It has compelled Cleaver to consider her own
trajectory: the constant surveillance by law enforcement officials,
the raising of two children on the lam, the dissolution of the
Black Panthers and the breakup of her own marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Cleaver's memoir not only underscores the
difficulty of writing about a life spent under the gun. It also
reveals how tricky it can be for such a central figure to write a
personal account of such a contested period of American history.
Does she confirm or defy official Panther lore? Does she set the
record straight on the unflattering things written about her, most
notably in the former Panther leader Elaine Brown's 1993 memoir,
``A Taste of Power,'' in which Cleaver and her ex-husband are
described as destructive elements in the organization?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Martin Duberman, a historian who has also written memoirs, says
the history of a movement written by an outsider is not necessarily
any more reliable than one by a participant. ``The
counter-assumption tends to be, once a historical account is
conscientiously done by a so-called objective observer, it is
definitive,'' Duberman said. ``There would be a variety of
accounts, none of which by itself will be a definitive version of
what went on. All you have to do is take part in a bridge game and
later ask the four people what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Cleaver says she can't be bothered with answering
other people's accounts of history (although she does dismiss
Brown's version as unreliable).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a memoir,'' she said recently. ``I'm entitled _ in fact,
I am required _ to be subjective and emotional and personal.'' She
was speaking during a conversation over sushi in Midtown Manhattan,
a few blocks from the New York Public Library, where she was one of
15 fellows this year at the Center for Scholars and Writers.
``That's not going to be, by definition, historical.''
</P>
<P>
   Revealing herself took some getting used to, however. Once she
offered an early manuscript to a writing teacher. ``It doesn't
really say much about you,'' she recalls him saying. ``Well,'' she
snapped, ``that's nobody's business.''
</P>
<P>
   She offers a throaty laugh at this exchange now. It has taken a
long time to be able to pick through threads of memory. This book
has undergone various incarnations over the last 15 years. ``I
wrote agitational material,'' she said. ``I had no clue that if you
tell a story in which you are a participant, you have to write
about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born Kathleen Neal in 1945, and she spent her earliest
years in what she remembers as a sheltered, segregated black
community, almost Victorian in its conventions, in Tuskegee, Ala.
Her mother had an advanced degree in mathematics. Her father taught
sociology at Tuskegee University before joining the Foreign Service
and taking the family to India and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, she attended a desegregated Quaker boarding
school and enrolled at Oberlin College in 1963. But it wasn't long
before she dropped out, moved to New York City and threw herself
into the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, then a driving
engine of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   She was 21 when she met Cleaver and through him, the Black
Panthers. He had just been released from Folsom State Prison.
``Soul on Ice,'' his groundbreaking 1967 prison memoir, was
attracting enormous attention because of his confessions of rape.
</P>
<P>
   They were married within months, on Dec. 27, 1967. (The wedding
date _ which they had forgotten _ was one of the few useful pieces
of information she has culled from the files kept on her by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, she says.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after a shootout with the Oakland, Calif., police in
which another Panther was killed and two policemen injured,
Eldridge Cleaver fled to Algeria. A few months later, pregnant with
their first child, Kathleen Cleaver joined him. There, they had a
son and a daughter. By 1971, after bitter leadership battles inside
the organization, the Cleavers split from the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Today Cleaver compares those four years in Algeria, then ruled
by a military dictatorship, to being shipwrecked. It was one of the
only times in her life she remembers being depressed. ``I'd never
been marooned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The task of raising her children kept her anchored. Youthful
delusions of immortality helped her survive, she says, and
probably, too, the contradictory conviction that life could end at
any moment. ``You don't have to maintain your sanity if you think
any day, you might get killed,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the Cleavers returned to the United States, and
Eldridge Cleaver, after turning himself in to the authorities,
drifted sharply to the right. It is a metamorphosis that Kathleen
Cleaver doesn't discuss much. ``It has nothing to do with me,'' she
declares.
</P>
<P>
   She will say that she considered leaving him long before she
actually did. She was held back by two things: the knowledge that
slavery had torn apart black families for centuries, and that her
other family, the Panthers, had by then disintegrated into discord
and paranoia. ``I didn't initiate the collapse of the movement, but
I had to initiate the separation of my family,'' she said. ``That
was very hard.''

   When she finally did leave _ in 1981 _ she picked up where she

</P>
<P>
   Still, it has taken her a long time to pour the words onto the
page. She pulled from her briefcase a section she had just
finished, about the peak years of Panther activity. In 15 pages,
she records three deaths and five trials. ``It's very traumatic,

   These days, when she isn't writing, she lectures widely about
the Panthers. Next Saturday she will appear for a

the Panthers at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She is still an advocate for political prisoners, and she still
delights in watching street protests. She lives in an affluent
village near New Haven with St. Clair Bourne, a documentary
filmmaker. If Cleaver's life today seems like a sharp contrast to
the days when her 1968 campaign poster for the California state
Assembly pictured her holding a gun, it is only the latest curve in
a story that has taken many unpredictable turns. In some ways, it's
possible to see the more radical twist as the one that led a girl
with such a proper past to a life with the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, there is a glimpse of the traditionalist in her. She
bemoans the fact that children who misbehave at school no longer
fear that their mothers will be called. Other times, she appears
stunned to discover that many parents no longer eat dinner with
their children every night. You mean Kathleen Cleaver, the young
radical, had time for that sort of thing when her children were
young? ``Yes!'' she replies emphatically. ``Cooked it, too!''

   Does she sometimes miss the revolutionary life? Not at all, she
declares. She is happy she is not in jail. She is happy she is not
a Republican, she says, chuckling. She is happy, she adds, to be
alive.

   BRAZIL-AMAZON (Maues, Brazil) _ For decades, this remote town
overlooking the chocolate-colored waters of the Amazon River has
been the main source of guarana, a bright red, highly caffeinated
berry that is believed by many Brazilians to be an aphrodisiac.
Inspired by a legend that guarana originated from a tempestuous
affair between two teenagers from rival Indian tribes, Brazilians
have consumed guarana in the form of teas, tablets and even soft
drinks. These days, guarana provides a clear example of the way
Brazilians living in the Amazon River Basin are seeking to harness
the region's exotic flora and fauna to promote economic
development. By Simon Romero.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Craig Bierko had a good life in Los Angeles. He had
been working steadily as an actor for the last decade. He had a
nice house in Hancock Park and cruised the freeways in his Jeep.
Boyishly handsome, 6 foot 4, with thick hair and green eyes, Bierko
was socially in demand and found the hardest part of working on a
set was the waiting around.
</P>
<P>
   But something was missing. Perhaps it was that he was doing
guest appearances on popular television shows like ``Ally McBeal''
and ``Mad About You'' without landing a star vehicle of his own.
But Bierko says it was something deeper than that: At 35 _ corny as
it may sound _ he wanted to do more than coast through the rest of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   So he raised his hand for the role of Harold Hill in the
Broadway revival of Meredith Willson's ``Music Man.'' And somewhat
incredibly he won the part, even though the producers originally
wanted a more bankable star like Steve Martin, Matthew Broderick or
Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bierko is performing night after night on Broadway and has
won a Tony nomination (losing to Brian Stokes Mitchell of ``Kiss
Me, Kate'').
</P>
<P>
   Though critics have said that he reminds them of Robert Preston,
who originated the role in 1957 _ indeed there are times when
Bierko seems to be eerily channeling the voice of his predecessor,
it is so similar _ the critics agree that he has brought his own
winning charm to the role of the slick but disarming traveling
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bierko ``steps into Preston's long shadow with remarkable
assurance,'' Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times. ``At times
he seems to be patterning his gestures and inflections too closely
on his famous predecessor. But he has a gleaming impishness of his
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Inexperience notwithstanding, Bierko has also apparently won
over his fellow cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the ladies love Craig,'' said Susan Stroman, director and
choreographer of the revival. He has also passed muster with stage
veterans like his co-star Rebecca Luker, who has been on Broadway
four times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so consistent,'' she said. ``He's right there with me
every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he could attempt this role, Bierko said, he got to the
point where he believed he could survive falling on his face. He
has not read his reviews, he said, so he does not wholly realize
how well things turned out.
</P>
<P>
   He said the experience had proved to be precisely the
``something more'' he had been craving. He is working harder than
ever before. He has no social life. And he has never been happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how thirsty I was for a life like this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the adjustment has been profound. ``I wasn't
psychologically prepared for what it means to do previews at the
same time that you're rehearsing eight hours a day, then promote
the show after you open,'' he said. ``I didn't know what it meant
to buckle down and really learn to dance. It's an entirely new
world of discipline for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierko said the process of mastering this role had had a
maturing effect on him. ``I finally felt like I was older than 18
for some reason,'' he said. ``Grown-upness kicked in. I now have to
clean up. Up until now it was adorable to keep dishes in the
sink.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he had not performed onstage since he appeared in a
revival of ``The Boys From Syracuse'' in Los Angeles in 1989,
Bierko said he was not nervous about being on Broadway for the
first time. He credited this calm to Stroman, who he said taught
him his huge part one small bit at a time and made rehearsals feel
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than creating a relationship where I was constantly
trying to prove something to her, where I felt like I was still
auditioning even after I had the role, she would light a fire,'' he
said. ``She inspired me. I wanted to come in and learn all this
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroman said her leading man came in with no Hollywood attitude,
that he was ready to make a fool of himself if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a fearless personality,'' she said. ``He was very
willing to learn how to twirl the baton, though the first day he
clipped his eye and was bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierko was not entirely new to the stage; he grew up around it,
because his parents ran the Harrison Players community theater near
Rye Brook, their hometown. As a boy he helped out with chores
there. His mother, who worked for Dolce International, a hotel and
conference-center company, and his father, a traveling salesman,
divorced when he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   At Northwestern University he studied theater, appearing in
plays like ``The Threepenny Opera'' and ``Twelfth Night.'' But he
also studied film and television, and when he graduated, the
glamour and sprawl of Los Angeles beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a weird freak who actually likes to drive, so it's a
perfect city for me,'' he said. ``It was a lifestyle choice.''
</P>
<P>
   His film roles have ranged from the villain in ``The Long Kiss
Goodnight'' to a comedic turn in ``Sour Grapes'' and a part in the
virtual-reality thriller ``The 13th Floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the things that I've done, I like the choices I've
made,'' Bierko said. ``But suddenly I developed a hunger to learn
other things. I felt I was beginning to fall into a groove in
L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroman said: ``He studied in school but went west instead of
east. Thank goodness he's finally come east, because we need him
here on Broadway. We don't have leading men like Craig Bierko.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Bierko said that he had grown up loving the 1962 movie version
of ``The Music Man'' and Preston's performance in it, but that he
was doing his own version of the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he kind of haunts this performance a little bit,'' he
said. ``But I didn't purposely try to recreate his performance.
Rather than try to copy him or go out of my way to disregard
everything he did, I was just going to try to honor his
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as hard work has sobered and intensified his outlook,
Bierko said, perhaps the most lasting impact of his ``Music Man''
experience has been watching firsthand how Stroman created a work
of such buoyancy even as she was weathering the loss of her
husband, the director Mike Ockrent, to cancer in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way she navigates her way through her life right now and
pulls so much beauty from the darkness _ it's been an amazing
lesson in keeping things in perspective and trying to achieve some
kind of balance,'' Bierko said. ``She's dealing with the
unspeakable grief of losing the love of her life and finding solace
in the work. What that is teaching me nothing can take away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves her, her work saves her,'' he continued. ``And it's
not an escape. It's a true healing experience. Some people are
workaholics, and some dive into work with their souls and heal
themselves. And that's what I've watched her do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierko said he believed that Stroman's loss had added a darker
side to the show and that the searching quality of both Harold Hill
and Marian the librarian, who ultimately find companionship in each
other, is more pronounced in this production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is something in what Susan is going through
right now that is very attached to that sense of loneliness,'' he
said. ``She's living it every minute. It's the perfect example of
grabbing something joyful out of something horrendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long journey from trying to get a sitcom deal
together. I feel like I've beheld something majestic.''

<P>
   In this, the information age, there is no shortage of data about
public companies available to investors. The phalanx of newspapers
and magazines devoted to financial matters has ballooned in recent
years, as have cable television programs and Internet chat rooms
focused on investing. And Wall Street research, once shared only
with a privileged few, has become widely available to investors on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But as Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at
PaineWebber, points out, there is a big difference between
information and knowledge. He believes that the instant
dissemination of information today carries a substantial cost: the
tendency among investors to act first and think second. That
behavior, he said, may account for the recent jump in stock market
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, Kerschner has tracked volatility on the
major stock indexes against the growth in daily household
viewership of CNBC, the popular investing channel on cable
television. As viewership has exploded, so has volatility,
particularly among Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it is becoming increasingly difficult for
investors to pick through all the dross to find gold. Investing
chat rooms, with their anonymous contributors, are especially good
breeding grounds for misinformation. But wisdom can be found there
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Equally difficult to fathom are company research reports penned
by Wall Street analysts. While these reports include a great deal
of data, they can also be extremely biased. Researchers whose firms
have or want to have investment banking relationships with the
companies they follow are more inclined to be positive in their
forecasts and assessments than those whose firms do not have such
kinships.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much more positive? According to five years of
research by Siva Nathan, associate professor of accounting at
Georgia State University in Atlanta, analysts whose firms have
banking relationships with companies they follow issue earnings
forecasts that, on average, are 6 percent higher than forecasts
issued by other analysts. Nathan's research also shows that
analysts writing about companies whose securities have been
underwritten by their firms put out 25 percent more ``buy''
recommendations, 46 percent fewer ``sell'' recommendations and 23
percent fewer ``hold'' recommendations than other analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, three professors examined analysts' forecasts
from 1982 to 1997 to see what incremental value they provided to
investors over and above the data publicly available in companies'
financial statements. Eli Amir at Tel Aviv University, Baruch Lev
at New York University's Stern School of Business and Theodore
Sougiannis at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
concluded that analysts, over all, made only a modest contribution
to investors' results beyond what could be divined from the
financials.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that analysts provided the most added value in
forecasts on technology companies, whose financial statements are
the least informative about new product developments, for example.
Analysts also contribute more to investors' returns in stocks of
companies that report losses rather than in those with profits. And
analysts provide more value to investors during economic boom times
than during recessions.
</P>
<P>
   But over all, the professors said, the results suggest that
analysts generally react to changes in stock prices rather than
cause those changes, Which makes it seem that investors would be
well advised to shut out all the yammering about earnings
expectations, consensus forecasts and whisper numbers and focus
instead on the financial information reported by companies
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, investors are deluged with data today. This is, after
all, the information age. The Enlightenment, however, it is not.  &QL;

 &HT;    Grocery scanning not stress-free
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From now on I'm only picking the Vidalia onions with
coded stickers.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the lessons I learned during my first encounter
with a Kroger U-Scan.
</P>
<P>
   I hoped for a stress-free experience. Instead it was filled with
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   I rolled the cart through the aisles, picking up romaine
lettuce, bananas, half-and-half and a few other things. I tried to
keep an eye on prices, in case they didn't scan properly.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 items I qualified for the U-Scan Express lane. When I
arrived, one machine was down, the other in use.
</P>
<P>
   I was cleared for scanning about 30 seconds later (it felt like
10 minutes). I was already feeling rushed as I approached the
machine. A line had formed behind me and the shoppers looked
impatient. The pressure was on.
</P>
<P>
   My first item scanned with ease. Then, a problem. My pole beans
had no code. Within 15 seconds or so, a nearby employee watching my
transaction through a camera noticed the problem and punched in the
code. I scanned on, only later noticing the clerk inadvertently
coded my beans as snap beans, which are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The people in line were watching. I tried to hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The machine stopped again because it sensed I had not placed an
item into a bag when I did. It's one of the ways U-Scan machines
guard against fraud. The employee could see I had and cleared me to
keep scanning.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I finished. Next came the payment. I had to dig into my
purse for my wallet, something I'd usually do while waiting for the
clerk to finish scanning my items. I found it after what seemed an
eternity, and pulled out my credit card to swipe. I never checked
prices on most of the items I bought.
</P>
<P>
   What's the total, I wondered? I wasn't sure, but my transaction
was done and the people behind me were staring. I grabbed my
receipt and made for the exit.
</P>
<P>
   On the way past the employee at his computer I noticed he was
sweating, too.

 &HT;    New machines allow shoppers to scan their own groceries.
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robert Sunday never imagined he'd be a grocery
checkout clerk. But he gladly does the job for free at his
neighborhood Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, 29, uses the express self-checkout line, where he scans
and bags his own groceries, then feeds money into a machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've used it ever since the service started,'' Sunday said
during a recent shopping run.
</P>
<P>
   And how easy is it to use? Sunday cites himself as evidence.
``I'm not a computer-head,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The self-checkout stations, called U-Scan Express, have been
limited to shoppers checking out 15 items or less, and only some
stores have them.
</P>
<P>
   But they are showing up in growing numbers. Retailers view the
technology as a tool to help solve labor shortages and cut costs.
Other grocery chains and big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart are
experimenting with self-checkout, and there are models in
development for pharmacies and video stores.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Kroger store in Atlanta became the first in the
nation to install a larger self-scanner, dubbed U-Scan Carousel,
that can handle bigger orders. Other grocers and superstore chains
could be getting them soon, according to the machine's maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kroger is the first company to jump on it,'' said Neil
Wechsler, chief executive officer of Optimal Robotics Corp., of
Montreal. ``By the end of the summeron't think that retail
understands that not everybody is obsessed with racing through the
store.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Kroger said there's no plan to eliminate the
human element entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one answer to help our customers get through the
line quicker,'' said spokeswoman Susie Brower. ``It's to address
the shortage of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The retail industry is one of the lowest paying professions,
which makes hiring and retaining employees even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Self-checkout machines are appearing at time when bank ATM
machines, and more recently the Internet, have given people more
confidence with automated transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But there are issues associated with self-checkout.
</P>
<P>
   Cheating is one. Shoppers might try to slip extra items in their
grocery bag without scanning or paying. Kroger has an employee
stationed in front of the exit, who can view the action at each
U-Scan station through a screen connected to cameras in the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Also, U-Scan senses when items are placed in a bag. Thes have
the machines and another 13 locations will have the Express
stations by the end of this year, Atlanta division President Paul
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Observers believe shoppers better get used to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kroger is thinking about replacing all the lanes in the
store,'' said Neal Johnson, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey, who
follows Optimal Robotics. ``If the past is any example, Kroger will
test U-Scan Carousels in a few locations to get a fair analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Of shoppers spending $75 or more on groceries weekly, one in
three seek out interaction, said consumer researcher Britt Beemer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're making the people invisible _ even your best
customer'' said Beemer, president of America's Research Group in
Charleston. ``I don't think that retail understands that not
everybody is obsessed with racing through the store.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Kroger said there's no plan to eliminate the
human element entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one answer to help our customers get through the
line quicker,'' said spokeswoman Susie Brower. ``It's to address
the shortage of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The retail industry is one of the lowest paying professions,
which makes hiring
</P>
<P>
   The cameras also enable employees to punch in codes for produce
items if they aren't marked.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is logjams caused by customers who
either don't understand the process or are simply slowpokes. The
nearby employee can intervene when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger is not the only grocery chain deploying such devices.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Teeter has express-lane scanners installed in 16 stores
in the chain. The chain plans to test a U-Scan Carousel at at
several stores in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has installed U-Scans in about 20 stores, but none in
Atlanta yet. Bi-Lo and Cub Foods also have the machines in some
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie has self-scanners installed in 10 of its area stores
from Productivity Solutions, a U-Scan competitor. Those scanners
can handle any size checkout, a spokesman for the company said.
</P>
<P>
   U-Scan's Wechsler said part of U-Scan's appeal lies in giving
people the impression they are more in control of their own
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're actually doing something,'' Wechsler said, ``the
perception is it's faster than doing it in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler said the company has also developed a one-bag unit to
go into pharmacy or home-and-garden departments, or in video and
floral stores. He also thinks superstores and office stores will
sign on to the big-order scanners.

A DANGEROUS SECURITY LAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disappearance of two computer hard drives from a vault in
the X Division, or nuclear weapons section, of the Los Alamos
National Laboratory was a cause celebre for grandstanding
politicians and wisecracking comedians right up until the minute it
was reported Friday that they had been found in a secure area of
the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing funny, however, about the security lapses
exposed in the case and the potential danger to Americans should
such information ever fall into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   The data on the two small hard drives consists of information
that could enable members of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team to
locate and disable nuclear devices on American soil. This catalog
of nuclear signatures represents an indispensable instrument that
the team's experts may use to overcome an enemy's efforts to cloak
or conceal a nuclear weapon planted here.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the two hard drives could be thought of as components of a
defense against the nuclear arms most likely to be used _ or
deployed for blackmail _ against this country.
</P>
<P>
   In the possession of a terrorist, the missing hard drives could
yield hints on how to disguise a nuclear device on American soil
from the detection specialists on the Nuclear Emergency Search
Team. They could also disclose the designs of Russian nuclear
weapons as well as America's sources and methods for learning about
Russian, Chinese, or French nuclear weapons designs.
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Energy, which has responsibility for Los
Alamos and other national nuclear labs, received most of the blame
for the lax security that allowed 26 of the 86 members of the
Nuclear Emergency Search Team to have access to the hard drives
without having to leave any record that they removed the hard
drives from the vault.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have derided this laxity, saying there is tighter
security at their hometown libraries or Wal-Marts.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the Energy Department does not deserve the entire
blame for whatever went wrong at Los Alamos. Last December, the
Energy Department proposed and the Defense Department rejected a
plan to improve nuclear weapons security by reclassifying as ``top
secret'' information such as the data on the lost hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   That information is now classified as ``secret restricted
data,'' a less restricted category. Late in the Bush
administration, the government proposed that, for the sake of
openness, ``secret restricted data'' would not have to be tracked
and its users would not have to be identified. The change was
carried out by the Clinton administration in 1993, although it was
initially resisted by the labs.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the Pentagon's reasons for opposing the changes
in classification look penny-wise and pound-foolish. An assistant
secretary of defense wrote to the Department of Energy's security
chief last December to explain that the cost would be too steep for
``secret storage facilities and buying more secure computer
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as investigators probe how the hard drives were misplaced
for more than a month _ and whether they might have been misused _
one crucial lesson should be that cyber-age security requires a
thorough revision of the rules governing access to such sensitive
information.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be hard to devise a security system that restricts
and monitors users of the data in the Los Alamos vault yet permits
the Nuclear Emergency Search Team members, in an emergency, to
remove the hard drives and take them to a site where they may help
detect and disarm a nuclear explosive.

NEW ROUTE TO A HEALTHY HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 18, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time and again, researchers have offered tips for warding off
life-threatening diseases by suggesting that we eat certain foods
or avoid others, or take this hormone supplement but not that one.
Much of this advice is based on incomplete experimentation, and
sometimes it doesn't hold up when better work is done. Lately,
scientists have focused on a new villain in our blood,
homocysteine, and are proposing that we keep it at healthy levels
by passing up animal protein and getting more of the B vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened, perhaps, by the recent finding that a high-fiber diet
does not in fact protect against colon cancer, researchers are less
emphatic than they might once have been in calling for dietary
changes to keep homocysteine down. What they do know is that high
levels of this amino acid, a product in the body's breakdown of
protein, are associated with arterial disease. Still to be proven
is that eating less animal protein or more vitamin B6, B12, or
folate (another B vitamin) will actually reduce our risk of
cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   While the jury is still out on that count, the evidence of the
benefit of folate (also known as folic acid) in preventing birth
defects is so strong that for the past two years bread, pasta and
cereals have been fortified with it under a mandate from the US
Food and Drug Administration. In addition, homocysteine has been
linked to miscarriages, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   All of this builds a strong case for eating foods rich in folate
or vitamin B6: asparagus, broccoli, spinach, cabbage, orange juice,
bananas, avocados, wheat germ, lentils, oatmeal, chicken, and egg
yolks. The last two items on the list show that dispensing with
animal proteins altogether is tricky, especially since vitamin B12
is found only in liver and other meats, fish, eggs, and milk.
Vitamin supplements are an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be forgotten is the meditation factor. A study at Ohio
State University shows that stress can raise homocysteine levels.
The message is simple: yoga and yolks. Now if only someone would
invent an egg with a low cholesterol content.

almost mythical blues man, had come to Lincoln County to see Virgie
Jane Smith and a son he had never seen. Claude wants to believe
that Robert came for him that day, and he always wondered what
would have happened if he had run across that porch to him, so that
everyone would know he was Robert Johnson's son. Now, 63 years

 &HT;    Death penalty politics brings media attention to inmatesBy Jamie
Manfuso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Texas _ Wednesday is media day on Texas' death row.
And the recent national glare on the state's justice system has
made the supersecure Terrell Unit, where death row is located, a
popular place.
</P>
<P>
   A television crew led by Geraldo Rivera shines its lights on
Gary Graham, the death row inmate whose case has become a cause
celebre in recent weeks. Cameras zoom in as Graham wrings his
hands, a symbolic moment for a man scheduled to die by lethal
injection on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   In a cubicle across the room sits Victor Hugo Saldano. He is one
of at least seven death row inmates whose sentencing hearings
included testimony that their Hispanic or black heritage made them
more dangerous in the future. Saldano hopes to get a new sentencing
hearing, and he, too, is telling his story.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the backs of the crew, in another cubicle, sits Paul
Nuncio, literally and figuratively out of the spotlight. Nuncio
grins nervously as he speaks, revealing a crooked gap between his
front teeth.
</P>
<P>
   A day later he would be dead, number 22 this year in the state's
modern and efficient capital punishment machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no fears,'' he says. ``I have made my peace.'' But his
upper body visibly trembles, and it takes him 20 seconds to sign
each release form granting an interview. He seems not to realize
what's going to happen the next day. He continues pulling out all
of the stops _ he's mentally unstable, he says, DNA will clear him,
his trial lawyer was incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they proclaim themselves guilty or innocent, some
inmates have taken advantage of the escalating national debate over
the death penalty and the attention surrounding Gov. George W.
Bush's run for president. Still, it remains to be seen if the
attention will have any impact for them.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Flores, convicted for the 1989 kidnapping, sexual
assault and murder of a 20-year-old woman, said curiosity led him
to accept an interview with the Spanish language television
network, Telemundo. Still, he isn't sure being cast as a bit player
in a presidential contest will necessarily play out in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   He knows national support for the death penalty, though
decreasing lately in some polls, is still overwhelming, and that
any concessions could make Bush look weak on crime. Of course, he
adds, the execution of an innocent man, if discovered, could be
tragic for governor's presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not jealous of the other guys,'' says Flores, referring to
better-known inmates like Ricky McGinn, who received a 30-day
reprieve minutes before his scheduled execution on June 1 to allow
for DNA testing. Flores is happy for them, but he'd like to see the
focus change to the widespread problems that affect more inmates,
like ineffective counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, whose execution date has not been set, doesn't contest
that he is innocent. ``All I want is a fair sentencing hearing,''
he says. In his first hearing, a psychiatrist testified that Flores
would be violent in the future without examining Flores himself or
his psychological records. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court in April
said the psychiatrist's testimony lacked scientific validity.
</P>
<P>
   It is stories like Flores' that feeds the ongoing debate and
beckons journalists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Media requests for interviews have increased ``1000 percent''
over the past two to three months, estimated Glen Castlebury, a
spokeman with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. He
attributes most of the increase to national and international media
organizations. Over recent weeks he has been forced to limit the
visits mainly to Texas state media. Or at least he tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French, they do not translate the English word 'no','' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not business as usual for prison officials.
Between shoots, Castlebury said, Rivera goes out to his vehicle, a
Lincoln parked in a handicap parking space, to dab at his makeup.
Prison guards on break venture out for photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The increased attention comes as Texas lawmakers and
representatives push reforms in the criminal justice system. Last
week, State Senator Rodney Ellis announced plans to introduce
legislation that would allow DNA testing in limited circumstances.
This week, a congresswoman from Houston and a congressman from San
Antonio called for a statewide moratorium on executions in the
state and a full review of Graham's case.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Monday by the Columbia University School of Law
said appeals courts found serious errors in 68 percent of murder
trials that ended with death sentences between 1973 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's renewed questions and debates going on and
everybody's jumping on the bandwagon,''said Stan Schneider, a
Houston attorney with four clients on death row. ``You can't ignore
the fact that it's a presidential election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney David Cunningham, who visited three death row
inmates on Thursday, said inmates are ``glad for any ruling that
can help an inmate in their situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect recent events to have any immediate impact on
inmates' cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives us some hope, but they've killed two people in two
days,'' he said on Friday. ``It doesn't seem to be doing anything
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Cynthia Orr said most death row inmates have lost hope.
It's an environment that's tough on hope: inmates are locked up in
air conditionless cells 23 hours a day. They can still follow the
latest turns in the death penalty debate in newspapers and on the
radio. But restrictions against television in their cells means
most will never see Geraldo again.

MERGERS IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, June 19, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prospective purchase of US Airways by UAL Corp., owner of United
Airlines, has already drawn concern from employees, competitors,
and regulators. While there are solid arguments in favor of this
undertaking, its size and the increasingly international character
of airlines call for better coordination of merger objectives not
just within the United States but among all countries.
</P>
<P>
   United and US Airways are well-suited to the combination because
they are to a large degree complementary to each other rather than
competitive. They have anticipated some antitrust challenges by
agreeing in advance to transfer critical landing rights in
Washington, D.C., to a new airline and by announcing a freeze on
air fares other than adjustments for fuel costs and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidated airline would be significantly larger than any
other domestic carrier, which over time could provide it with
advantages in some intensely competitive markets. Its very broad
geographical reach would provide travelers with more single-carrier
options, reducing or eliminating the need to race through airports
to make connections.
</P>
<P>
   The UAL-US Airways agreement is far from complete but has
already spawned talks among other carriers _ American and Delta in
this country and British Air and KLM in the European Union.
Transnational mergers involving US carriers would be more complex,
but they are not intrinsically impossible or undesirable, assuming
they meet reasonable standards to guarantee passenger protection
against monopoly powers.
</P>
<P>
   Should there be international coordination, the critical
standard should be guarantees of competition in a maximum number of
markets and especially at key airports and in heavily traveled
corridors like Boston-New York-Washington in this country. The
industry has a history of international cooperation along with
competition, and national governments often negotiate over specific
markets. Such a merger would raise the level of negotiation to a
broader policy perspective _ and there is no need to wait for the
next consolidations before taking it up.

TALKS BETWEEN AETNA AND DUTCH COMPANY FALTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aetna Inc. indicated Friday that negotiations to sell
its financial services and international units to ING Group, the
Dutch financial services and insurance company, had hit a bump.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it had started talks with other, unnamed possible
buyers while continuing negotiations that it began two weeks ago
with ING.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Aetna fell $3.875, or 5.3 percent, to $69.50 Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange, reflecting disappointment among
traders who had bet on an imminent sale of the units to ING for $8
billion or $9 billion, as well as generally lower prices for
insurance stocks.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Donaldson, the chairman and chief executive of Aetna,
said that talks with ING, which were disclosed May 31, were
continuing. He said Aetna was evaluating ``numerous expressions of
interest'' by companies that wanted to buy its non-health-care
units.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said the announcement could mean that ING
was not interested in buying all of Aetna's financial and
international units. Some said ING probably did not want the
Hartford, Conn.-based insurer's Latin American health business,
which had been a drag on earnings. Others speculated that there
were tax issues for Aetna or ING or both that made it difficult to
agree on a price.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said
that if a buyer like ING did not take the whole package, selling
the units piecemeal could be a complicated, lengthy process. ``A
bird in the hand is often worth two, three or five birds in the
bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson reiterated that there were no assurances that there
would be a sale. When the talks with ING started two weeks ago, he
said Aetna was still ready to split the company into health and
``wealth'' divisions and spin them off to shareholders as separate
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Arun Kumar, an investment-grade bond analyst at Chase
Securities, said he was sure a sale of the financial and
international units was still likely. ``It's a matter of when, and
not if, they will announce a definitive sale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Laberge, a spokesman for the company, declined to say what
was holding up a deal with ING or how many interested buyers were
now talking with Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Clark, an insurance industry analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's,
said other big financial-services companies that might be
interested include Allianz AG of Germany, Fortis of Belgium and
Aegon of the Netherlands. He said American companies like Citigroup
and American International Group were less likely to be interested.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Aetna dropped into the $30s in February on news of
lawsuits against the company and disappointing financial results.
Under pressure from large investors, Richard L. Huber resigned as
chief executive on Feb. 25 and was replaced by Donaldson, a board
member and a co-founder of the Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
securities firm..
</P>
<P>
   After rebounding, the price slid back into the high $50s after
the company rejected an earlier offer in March from ING and
WellPoint Health Networks, a California insurer that wanted to open
discussions about paying $10 billion or so for all of Aetna's
businesses.

FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY IN MURDERS ON SHAKY GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aquilla Barnette lurked in the woods, along the Billy Graham
Parkway in Charlotte, N.C., a sawed-off shotgun in his hand. He
waited until a car paused at a light. Then Barnette rushed over,
that summer day in 1996, aimed the shotgun at motorist Donald Allen
and forced him out of his Honda Prelude.
</P>
<P>
   Barnette had the car, but shot Allen anyway: Three times in the
back as he begged for his life.
</P>
<P>
   The case _ similar to last week's execution-style slaying of
college students Amy Shute and Jason Burgeson in Johnston, R.I. _
is the first homicide prosecuted by the federal government under a
1994 carjacking statute that resulted in a death sentence. But in
May a judge ordered resentencing. It's a telling example,
specialists say, of how these cases typically ricochet in the
federal court system, frustrating family members hoping for the
ultimate punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The public reacted with outrage to the June 9 carjacking murders
of Shute and Burgeson. Residents immediately began signing
petitions, asking Attorney General Janet Reno to take the case and
apply the death penalty statute.
</P>
<P>
   But as Rhode Island prosecutors prepare to ask for federal
prosecution _ in part so they can seek capital punishment, which
would not be possible under state law _ they know the chances of
seeing the suspects executed are slim.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnette case is one of about 200 cases prosecuted under the
federal law, which allows the government to seek death sentences
for those who commit murders connected to drug dealing, robberies,
carjackings, terrorism, abductions, and a list of other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Of those cases, only about two dozen have resulted in death
sentences, according to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Council
Project. And of those, 13 are either on appeal, or are being
retried or resentenced.
</P>
<P>
   No federal death row inmates have been executed since the
government reinstated capital punishment in 1988. Because the
penalty is irreversible, juries and judges take special care with
them, and the appeals process can take many years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is a growing sense that the US Supreme Court
will eventually chip away at the federal government's claim to
jurisdiction in these capital offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few Supreme Court cases that seem to be
saying the federal government may have gone too far,'' said William
Matthewman, a Florida lawyer who has defended a number of federal
death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave the Department of Justice the right to prosecute
cases by tying it to a provision in the Constitution that grants
the federal government the ability to pass laws that prohibit
interference with interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But using this provision in murders, critics say, some
prosecutors have used some fairly twisted logic. For example,
Matthewman said, for a murder at a 7-11 convenience store, federal
prosecutors could argue that the store sells products trucked in
from other states.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rhode Island case the connection could be that the men
who allegedly carjacked Burgeson's SUV, before killing Berguson and
Shute, had stolen a car that was assembled in another state.
</P>
<P>
   Five men participated in the carjacking, according to
investigators: Gregory Floyd and Raymond Anderson, both 19; Sammie
Sanchez, 20; and 21-year-olds Kenneth Day and Harry Burdick.
</P>
<P>
   Shute, 21, of Coventry, R.I., had been at a Providence night
club with Burgeson, 20, of Lakeville, Mass., and other friends and
Burgeson was planning to drive her home.
</P>
<P>
   The five men ambushed the two friends in downtown Providence at
gunpoint, drove them to the Buttonhole Golf Course in Johnston, and
stole $18 from them. The two pleaded, ``Please don't kill us,'' as
Floyd allegedly shot them. Police say Floyd confessed on videotape
that he pulled the trigger of the .40-caliber gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime was so horrendous. It was like they did it for
fun,'' said Ernest Burgeson, Jason's father. ``There was no reason
for them to kill. It was two in the morning and it was pretty dark.
If they had a halfway decent lawyer they could've beaten the
(carjacking) charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgeson said even if the men are sent to death row, and are
never executed, a death penalty sentence means they will at least
spend the rest of their lives behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Without federal prosecution, he worries, the men might spend a
few years in jail, be paroled, and repeat their crime. All five
suspects have criminal records. Providence and Johnston
investigators are now looking into whether Floyd was responsible
for other robberies and car thefts in Providence this year that
went unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse said this week
that he favors federal prosecution. If Reno accepts the case, it
would be one of dozens reviewed by the US Justice Department. A
justice department official said that 69 cases of carjackings
resulting in death have been reviewed by the department since 1994.
Of that number, 15 were accepted for prosecution. But only one has
resulted in a death sentence: The Barnette case of Charlotte, N.C.
He is currently awaiting resentencing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Johnston case, the federal government can prosecute using
the carjacking or firearms provision of the law, said Paul
Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown Law Center. Rhode Island,
however, is not supposed to forward the case just to seek the death
penalty, he said, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
   A similar case is headed for trial in Springfield, Mass. this
year. Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Kristen
Gilbert, a nurse who allegedly murdered a patient with injections
of epinephrine, a drug that induces heart attacks. Because the
death occurred at the Veteran's Administration hospital in
Northampton, Mass., it falls under federal jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Burgeson, Jason's father, will continue to push for the
death penalty. In his eyes, it's the only way to deter these crimes
from happening. And he doesn't mind sparking fear in the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' he said. ``You're at a light. Your door
ain't locked. It could happen to anybody.''

ETHICS   SPECIALISTS TROUBLED BY PLAN TO SELL HEART STUDY DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medical ethicists warned Friday that Boston University is
wandering into ethically challenging geography with its plans to
sell data derived from the famous heart study of 10,000 Framingham,
Mass. residents. But ethicists said that, with the right
safeguards, the for-profit venture could benefit the public.
</P>
<P>
   The university, which along with investors is forming a company
to compile, analyze, and sell the study's vast collection of
clinical, behavioral, and genetic data, must insure that the
Framingham participants consent to the new venture and that their
identities are protected, ethicists said.
</P>
<P>
   And because the families volunteered for a study largely funded
with public money, the new company should compensate the community
for its donation and make sure the data stays publicly accessible,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly things to be alert to,'' said Arthur
Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``The people who participated in the study for
decades, what are their rights? Whose permission do you get? Can
their data be used for any purpose? And given that it's a
government study, how do you distribute the money that's made?''
</P>
<P>
   BU officials said they're still working out the details of the
deal, but they are carefully addressing ethical concerns about the
new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deal's preliminary nature, it's too soon to tell
whether the rights of participants will be protected, Caplan said.
But he added that those concerns must be weighed against the
potential benefits that investors, drug companies, and
biotechnology companies can bring to the data, X-rays, and DNA
samples, some of which now sits in boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to take this raw data to the next step takes a lot of
money,'' agreed Jay Lander, a lawyer in Framingham, a participant
in the heart study and a member of the organization formed to
represent the volunteers. ``We're not here to prevent that from
happening. It would be foolish to stifle research and keep it in
the academic archives. We just want it done above board and without
conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston University, which runs the 52-year-old Framingham Heart
Study, has struck a deal with a group of venture capitalists, who
have committed $21 million to form Framingham Genomic Medicine Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Raw data from the heart study, which has been used by
researchers worldwide to publish more than 1,000 papers on the
causes of heart attacks and stroke, will still be available to the
public and to scientists cost-free.
</P>
<P>
   But Framingham Genomic Medicine will use computer tools to
analzye and expand the data, which the university believes it can
sell to pharmaceutical companies racing to create the next
generation of genetically developed drugs and diagnostic exams.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, the university must negotiate protections for
patients and ownership of the enhanced data with the National
Heart, Blood and Lung Institute, the government agency that has
spent more than $40 million to fund the heart study.
</P>
<P>
   One area of possible disagreement is genotyping, the process of
documenting variations among the participants' DNA that could
explain disease or differing reactions to drugs. Is the genotyping
raw data that belongs to the study and the government? Or, as
Framingham Genomics would prefer, is it proprietary data that
belongs to the company?
</P>
<P>
   BU spokesman David Lampe said the company does not intend to
obtain additional consent forms from participants because it
believes the existing consent forms cover commerical uses.
Volunteers can choose to withhold their data from the company, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Caplan said the issue of additional consent requires more
debate, while Ronald Green, director of the Ethics Institute at
Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., said ``as companies use
information given by generous volunteers, they have to think about
ways of giving back.''
</P>
<P>
   Framingham Genomics plans to donate stock to a charitable trust
for the town of Framingham and pay for an ethics oversight
committee and science education in the schools.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted unanimously Friday to approve a
bill that catapults electronic commerce to a new level by allowing
consumers and businesses to sign contracts online and know that
their e-signatures are just as binding as those in ink.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed 87-0, had already been passed by the House and
now goes to President Clinton, who said Friday that he would sign
it into law.
</P>
<P>
   By giving electronic signatures the legal weight of paper
signatures, the new law would offers consumers the chance to sign
legally enforceable contracts for health insurance, bank loans and
brokerage accounts over the Internet, around the clock and with no
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, consumers and businesses have to wait days or weeks
for paper contracts to be written, mailed, signed and returned.
</P>
<P>
   While many types of banking, insurance and brokerage accounts
can now be opened on the Internet, they still require a signature
on paper for final approval; that requirement would disappear.
Until now, taxpayers who have filed their taxes electronically with
the Internal Revenue Service have still needed to file a piece of
paper bearing their signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions and insurance companies are expected to
save billions of dollars a year by eliminating the cost of
preparing paperwork and mailing it. Most records would be retained
electronically, doing away with the need for giant warehouses of
files to store the material.
</P>
<P>
   But while the legislation had overwhelming, bipartisan support
on Capitol Hill _ only four members of the House opposed the bill,
while 426 approved _ some consumer advocates expressed concern that
the law would lead to new types of fraud and identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't sat down to figure out how to protect consumers,''
said Margot Saunders of the National Consumer Law Center. She said
she worried that without a requirement for a paper signature,
criminals could easily ``forge'' electronic signatures on
everything from online purchases to credit-card applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are left to prove a negative,'' she said.
``Everything changes with electronic signatures.''
</P>
<P>
   The law goes into effect Oct. 1, and consumers and businesses
are expected to take advantage of it almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce companies, like e-loan and Etrade, are all
set to take advantage of the legislation, and some of the larger
traditional banks like Citibank, which already do business online,
are expected to make adjustments quickly. A Baltimore company,
eOriginal, said it would offer completely electronic mortgages as
soon as the law allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill revolutionizes the way consumers, industry and
government conduct business over the Internet,'' said Sen. Spencer
Abraham, R-Mich., who helped steer the bill through Congress. ``It
is a tremendous cost-cutting tool because people and businesses can
now enter contractual arrangements without having to drive across
town, fly thousands of miles for a meeting or mail reams of paper
back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a nod to Democrats and consumer rights organizations, the
bill also helps protect the millions of people who do not have
access to the Internet or who worry about being defrauded in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This landmark legislation will ensure that consumer
protections remain strong in the technology age,'' Clinton said
Friday. ``It will help create new rules of the road for America's
high-tech community.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill does not specify what a digital signature will look
like, allowing companies, and ultimately the free market, to decide
what kind of technology works best.
</P>
<P>
   A signature could simply be strings of numeric code that is
encrypted _ scrambled and unscrambled _ or it could involve more
sophisticated devices, like scanners that read thumb prints or
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Since many consumers remain nervous about conducting these kinds
of transactions online, many institutions will probably try to
improve online security. Congress, too, has a role to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a lot more focus on watchdogging against
hackers,'' said Wyden. ``A hacker today is sort of like the guy who
goes around rattling all the windows and doors in a neighborhood,
and there is a pretty good chance he will find one open.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that develop this kind of security clearance online
are already scrambling to offer their services. One Utah company,
iLumin, plans to launch a ``digital handshake system'' next week
that would gather all parties involved in a cyber signing room to
help them securely complete their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The law would enable consumers to choose whether to do business
online or on paper. Certain sensitive legal documents will still
have to be produced on paper. For example, insurance and utility
companies must still send cancellation and termination notices
through the mail, wills cannot be executed over the Internet, and
products may not be recalled online. Mortgages must be foreclosed
on paper.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``My mantra through this all was consumer rights can't be
virtual rights,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who helped draft the
bill. ``They have to exist in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill made several serious stumbles during negotiations
between the House and the Senate versions, mostly over consumer
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Companies said Friday that their paperwork saving as a result of
the bill would be matched by new convenience and time-saving for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Crocker, a lobbyist who represents Charles Schwab, the
discount brokerage firm, said the bill would save Schwab and its
customers time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you open a Schwab account now, most of it can be done
online,'' he said. ``But you still have to print it out and do a
wet signature on the account agreement.'' Under the law, the
requirement of a paper signature is ended.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is also expected to benefit business-to-business
transactions. ``For instance, an automobile manufacturer will be
able to have complete contract negotiations with parts suppliers
online,'' said David Colton, a lobbyist for the Information
Technology Association of America. ``There are huge cost savings
associated with this, and the cost savings will ultimately be
passed on to the consumers.''

F16CRASH (Undated) - IFor the ninth time in 20 months, a $20
million Luke Air Force Base F-16 fighter jet has crashed. A student

<P>
   With horror stories about family farmers forced off their land
and small business owners driven from their stores and offices,
Republican leaders in Congress have taken steps to eliminate the
federal estate tax. They have won the initial public relations
campaign and the first key vote. The House passed the measure by a
margin almost large enough to override a promised veto from
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate should avoid a veto fight by rejecting the
measure outright.
</P>
<P>
   Several issues are involved. Some small businesses do face a
threat from the tax now, but this problem can be cured with
targeted provisions. The loss to the Treasury _ the tax now brings
in some $20 billion a year _ raises the question of whether the
money could be used better elsewhere, for a prescription drug
program for the elderly, for instance, or even a tax cut for
persons more in need. Additionally, charities may lose an estimated
$1 billion a year if the tax is eliminated, since it now provides
an incentive for the rich to give tax-sheltered donations.
</P>
<P>
   Overriding all these considerations is the fact that the
proposal is enormously regressive, a colossal giveaway to the
nation's wealthiest families, at a time when the nation's income
gap is already growing relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, individuals can leave $675,000 (and couples
$1.35 million) to their heirs free of tax. That is scheduled to
increase to $1 million ($2 million for couples) by 2006. Less than
2 percent of Americans pay any estate tax at all, and most of those
pay modest amounts. Half of all estate taxes are paid by less then
10 percent of those who pay, or less than 0.2 percent of those who
die.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing that the windfall for the wealthy inherent in
repeal of the estate tax is so popular. While Al Gore would retain
it, George Bush proudly says, ``I intend to abolish it.''
</P>
<P>
   This at a time when the real incomes of the poorest 40 percent
of society have actually declined in the last 20 years, while the
incomes of the wealthiest 1 percent have more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there is a sound reason or time for eliminating the
estate tax, this is not it.

<P>
   In a continuing threat both to the environment and to orderly
lawmaking, Congress is being asked repeatedly to attach riders to
bills unrelated to the environment, riders that in the aggregate
would seriously erode protections won in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these riders arrive on the floor with little or no
debate and are pasted on to legislation deemed immune to defeat
because of their importance and unlikely to face a veto.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 of these riders have been identified in House or
Senate legislation, according to Defenders of Wildlife, drawing
from a variety of conservation organizations. They range from
relatively specific issues, like the transfer of 327 acres of land
in Maryland from the Fish and Wildlife Service to the Treasury
Department for a firearms training facility, to broad questions
like funding for prevention of global warming under the Kyoto
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Others would prohibit any change in oversight of the Army Corps
of Engineers, alter hardrock mining rules, affect land transfers in
the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, ease restrictions on slaughter
of bison in Yellowstone Park, reduce funding to cut greenhouse gas
emissions, freeze auto efficiency standards, cut funds for
protection of endangered species, expand cattle grazing on
vulnerable public lands, strengthen Army veto power over new
wildlife refuges, eliminate funding for protection of American
Heritage Rivers (like the recently designated Connecticut River),
and continue subsidized lumbering in the Tongass rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   A few of these proposals may be justified, but the manner in
which they are being run through the legislative mill, with neither
serious review nor debate, entitles skeptics to fear the worst.
Individually, few of the riders would have a profound environmental
effect, but together they constitute a serious threat. Equally
troubling, passing such riders would serve as precedent for further
attacks on unique national assets. Congress should shun them.

 &HT;    Culpepper endures hard knocks in Olympic bid
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ashley Culpepper might not be able to remember
it, but she did have at least one bad day this year.
</P>
<P>
   It came on May 11, when the former high school diver was warming
up for the 3-meter springboard competition in the FINA/USA Diving
Grand Prix at Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She came down too close to the
board and slammed her head against it, suffering a concussion and
opening a deep gash that required two staples to close. She not
only had to withdraw from the international meet, she had to be
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hit my hands and feet before, but never my head,''
Culpepper said. ``At first I didn't remember what happened to me
three days before that. I didn't remember coming to Florida. Some
of the stuff has come back, but I still don't remember that entire
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even taking that accident into account, however, Culpepper said,
``Overall, this ytremendous. It's my best year so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way better than we even dreamed,'' added Coach Scott
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper, who now dives for Louisiana State, won the 3-meter
title at the NCAA championships this year. An even bigger moment,
though, came when a surgeon opened up her knee again.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper is one of many divers who came to the sport from the
sport of gymnastics, and she arrived with a body that showed the
battering of four-hour-a-day practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I came to diving, my body had pretty much had
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 11, she had her first knee surgery. She had another
at 16, which left her with no more cartilage to remove, just a lot
of bone spurs and bone chips. And that wasn't the scary part. When
she was about 9, doctors discovered that she had a bone disease in
her femur, the same kind that Bo Jackson had in his hip and which
ended the football and baseball careers of that incredible athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bone just dies,'' said Culpepper. ``I thought I was going
to have to have a full knee replacement when I was 25 instead of
65. The doctor was expecting to find a disaster area.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he found signs that the bone was becoming healthy
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disease just upped and disappeared. I don't know how, but
thank God it did,'' Culpepper said.
</P>
<P>
   After the surgery she was scheduled to be out of the water for
six to eight weeks. She was back in by four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did tons of rehab. It took a lot out of me,'' Culpepper
said. Until this year she had been known mainly as a platform
diver. But, with an improved knee and jumping ability, her
springboard diving dramatically improved.
</P>
<P>
   At the NCAA championships, Culpepper not only won the 3-meter
title, she finished third in the 1-meter springboard and fifth in
the platform. At the U.S. National Indoor Diving Championships this
April, she led the 3-meter and platform competitions heading into
the final dive. She didn't nail either effort and finished second
in the 3-meter behind Sara Reiling and fourth behind winner Kathy
Pesek in the platform. Yet she and Reich were very encouraged that
she was that close in both events.
</P>
<P>
   The head injury in May was a setback, and Culpepper is still
coping with that accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a couple of weeks to get going on that dive,'' she
said. ``Now I do it about four feet from the board. I used to do it
a foot and one-half. I'm going to have to bring it back in before
the trials or I won't score as well. I just have to suck it up and
forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic diving trials in Federal Way, Wash., begin on
Tuesday (June 20) and Reich said, ``She has to be one of the
favorites. She's made a ton of improvement, and she has always been
a great competitor. She's qualified in two events, so she has two
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my chances are pretty good in both events,'' Culpepper
said. ``I don't have that much pressure going in. I just started
getting really good this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich added, ``She's always been a hard worker. I think she's
grown as a person. She's learned how to deal with adversity and how
to set priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, it looked as if this would be Culpepper's only
shot to make an Olympic team, and that it would be something of a
long shot. Now, she said, 2004 might not be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper said, ``I don't know . . . If I can stay healthy for
another four years. With all the progress I've made this year I
don't think I've peaked.''

KENNEDY SCHOOL TIGHTENS DOWN ON FACULTY-STUDENT BUSINESS LINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid conflicts between academic standards and the
new economy, Harvard's Kennedy School of Government has set some of
the strictest limits to date on faculty involvement in student
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The school told professors in a memo last week to avoid
advising, investing in, or consulting for commercial ``enterprises
in which Kennedy School students are involved'' until three months
after they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules go beyond some adopted by Harvard's business
school last fall, when professors were warned against taking on
financial roles in companies run by students still at the school.
Both policies come at a time when when every classroom idea seems
loaded with commercial possibilities on the Internet, and when many
students _ especially those at schools that stress
entrepreneurialism and innovation, such as the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology _ are spending more efforts on their
business plans than on thesis work.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty connections can be key to the success of these
start-ups. But some, like the Kennedy School's dean, Joseph Nye,
worry professors might lose credibility if they become too involved
with student companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one student in class gets an A, and one gets a B, if
student A is in a position to make the professor a lot of money,
compared to student B . . . you can see how over time it could have
a corrupting effect on the morale of the student body,'' Nye said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nye and William Sahlman, a Harvard Business School
professor, say the rules aren't meant to discourage faculty from
discussing business plans informally.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some young capitalists still regard the new limits as red
tape. Venture capital and other support comes easier to companies
with big-name connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole business concept can be validated'' by participation
of the faculty members, said Gilberto Carrasquero, who just
received a master's degree from the Kennedy School.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasquero, 36, helped prompt the school's new policy when he
tried unsuccessfully to sign up Nye as a formal adviser to a
company he is creating, govXchange.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company will sell government procurement services online in
developing nations and record the transactions publicly, which
Carrasquero says will help reduce corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasquero said he agrees a student shouldn't be allowed to
hire a professor whose class he is taking. But once the course is
over, faculty or administrator participation can play a key role in
determining whether a business succeeds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Harvard graduate, Anish Rajparia, called the limits on
faculty involvement ``not the most advantageous'' for students.
</P>
<P>
   Rajparia created the Parlo.com languages Web site in New York
after he received his MBA in 1997 and counts a Harvard marketing
professor among his advisers and credits him with ``a lot of help
in defining our strategy.'' Students in the Kennedy School could
use the same help, he said, and faculty know their limits. The
chance a professor might compromise a student's grade, Rajparia
said, ``doesn't seem like much of a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what roles faculty should take in private ventures is an
old debate, but never in memory have so many enticements come from
students themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Also, schools such as Harvard, Northeastern, and Bentley College
are busy promoting entrepreneurship, licensing out research and
hosting contests in which students submit their business plans for
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts have done much to develop the region's technology
sector. Perhaps the best-known success story is routing-software
maker Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., created in 1998
by several students and faculty at MIT. At the close of Friday's
trading its stock was worth around $9.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many fret the success of such companies could blur academic
and commercial distinctions. John Guttag, head of MIT's computer
sciences department, said three years ago he discouraged students
and professors from joining in for-profit ventures while in school,
in order ``to make MIT look clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, contemplating the fortunes amassed by Akamai and others,
Guttag insists only that professors don't directly oversee the
academic work of any student with whom they have a financial
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company is being built around ideas that were really
partly the students', it doesn't make sense to deprive the students
of the opportunity to be involved,'' he said. ``That also means
it's wrong to deprive the faculty from being involved, because that
would limit the chance of the company to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticky situations are likely to increase as more schools become
business-incubators. Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, for
instance, will introduce a new curriculum this fall to encourage
students and faculty to create companies together.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft description, the new courses are needed
because ``a top school of management can no longer tolerate a
boundary between itself and the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuck's dean, Paul Danos, said he expects to decide soon just how
the spoils of the new ventures should be divided among students and
faculty. ``We'll definitely have to be creating rules between
grading and investing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Kennedy School, which traditionally fed graduates into
jobs in government or nonprofit organizations, lately has seen more
students looking to start their own companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this idea everybody has that they have to rush'' to
start a business, said Steve Kelman, a professor of public
management at the school. ``They feel they have to do it right now
or they'll lose their window.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new rules, Kelman says he has become an adviser to
Carrasquero's company, govXchange.com, and may receive stock
options. The role is permitted because it was arranged before Nye
issued the new rules, Kelman said, and it doesn't present a
conflict because he didn't teach Carrasquero directly.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-month waiting period ends, Carrasquero said, he
also hopes Nye will take a role with his company.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might still be interested, Nye responded by e-mail:
``No commitments till three months!''

VITAL DRUGS' PRICES OFTEN HIGHER IN AFRICA THAN IN WEST, STUDY
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The price of life-saving medicine in Africa,
where the need is greatest and the poverty is worst, is often
higher than in Europe and North America, according to a study
issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The study confirms what doctors in poor countries complain of:
that the medicine their patients need for AIDS and for tropical
ailments like malaria and worms are often available only at
exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical pricing is about the law of the jungle, where
might is right,'' said Kirsten Myhr, the pharmacist who oversaw the
study. ``Profit maximization seems to be the only objective of the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Myhr, a Norwegian who used to run the medical supplies system
for Botswana, said even malaria medicine was cheaper in her frigid
homeland than in much of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' she said. ``They only sell a few boxes, and
you have to relabel them in a Nordic language, and it's still half
the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevirapine, which prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, costs $430 per 100 units in Norway,
where there is hardly any market for it, she said, and $874 in
Kenya, where the need is desperate. Drug prices in Norway are about
average for European Union prices, which are generally lower than
American ones.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's prices are among the highest in Africa, the study said,
while South Africa's are far higher. According to Dr. Sam Muziki, a
World Health Organization regional officer, most Africans must pay
80 percent of prescription-drug costs out of pocket. If they cannot
afford them, they simply do without, and go home to die.
</P>
<P>
   The imbalance is even greater when the low purchasing power of
poor countries is taken into account. The cost of a course of
first-line TB treatment would cost a Swiss worker only one hour's
wages, Muziki said, and a Tanzanian laborer 500 hours'.
</P>
<P>
   Myhr's study was one of two issued here at a conference on
African drug prices sponsored by Doctors Without Borders and other
groups pressuring drug companies to cut prices.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya was chosen because it is the center of the small East
African drug industry, and is now rewriting its patent law. Drug
companies and health advocates like Doctors Without Borders are
lobbying the government heavily.
</P>
<P>
   The second study was a UNAids analysis of prices for anti-AIDS
drugs in Brazil. Like India, Brazil ignores Western patents and
lets its companies make cheap copies of the newest inventions of
U.S. and European drug companies. Unlike India, it has not yet
begun to export, but the study found it prepared to. Brazilian
prices were very low: the anti-retroviral cocktail ZDV/3TC, for
example, was $1.44 a dose there vs. $18.78 in the United States and
$7.34 in Uganda. Uganda, unlike next-door Kenya, does not permit
patent monopolies, so drugs there are often cheaper.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The copying infuriates Western drug companies. As Parmindar
Singh Lotay, regional sales manager for Glaxo Wellcome, the
British-based drug giant, told a generic maker at the conference:
``The law still says `intellectual property.' You're telling me I
should just give my property to you?'' He described the millions of
dollars worth of medicine his company now gives away and argued
that it was still required to make profits for shareholders,
profits that were ``the engine that drives tomorrow's drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to compare drug prices worldwide. The same pill is
sold at different prices in different countries, and at different
prices in one country to small pharmacies, bulk buyers and public
hospital systems. Retail markups, taxes and pharmacy discounts vary
widely. Many poor countries use the World Health Organization's
bulk purchasing system, which negotiates low prices. But the drugs
may not reach consumers because of theft, corruption and
incompetence along the chain.
</P>
<P>
   Also, imitations made in India, Brazil or elsewhere may be of
excellent quality or worthless counterfeits. One theme repeated
often here was the need for some sort of international
generic-testing lab.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's minister of health, Dr. Amukowa Anangwe, opened the
conference with an aggressive speech defending the right of poor
countries like his to cancel the patents of companies whose
medicines are beyond the incomes of average citizens. The speech
was drafted for him by Doctors Without Borders, but he stuck by it
in an interview afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected Kenya's Parliament to soon pass the new
patents law with clauses on importing practices and patent seizure
that the industry opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and
Industry who have reservations about it,'' he acknowledged, ``but I
think the government's mood is that of the member of Parliament who
asked, `How can we be denied access to drugs that prolong life when
our people are dying?'''

GALAXY HEALTHY, MAYBE POISED FOR PUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The last month seemed like a long year for
Los Angeles Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, but now the excuses are over.
With his team's tank nearly full again, it's time to make a serious
push. The Galaxy will get its first chance to do so when the Tampa
Bay Mutiny (8-6-0, 24 points) and Mamadou Diablo visit the Rose
Bowl tonight at 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy striker Cobi Jones and defender Greg Vanney have returned
from a two-week stint with the U.S. National team. Defender Robin
Fraser's injured ankle is healed and newly acquired Mexican striker
Luis Hernandez has had a full week of uninterrupted training.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Galaxy's eight-match slide - L.A. is 1-3-4 during that
span - actually turn into a positive?
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you come out of it,'' Schmid said. ``If you don't,
you're in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``But yes, a bad stretch can always help, it makes you work a
little harder, brings you closer as a team because you overcome
adversity together. It can also give you the feeling that you can
accomplish anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he would like to see the players mentally assert
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to regain our confidence, our arrogance and our belief
in ourselves that we know we're going to figure a way to win,''
Schmid said. ``I don't think we've had that lately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (6-3-6, 24 points) has another home match Wednesday
against Chicago, then embarks on a 10-day, three-match road trip.
Schmid has been given permission by Major League Soccer to take his
entire roster of 18 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next month is very important,'' Schmid said. ``This is our
time to really get together as a team, almost like our preseason
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already witnessed signs of cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the airport after the Colorado game, Luis was held up doing
something so Mauricio (Cienfuegos) bought his breakfast. Luis also
went to a record store with a few of the guys. This is the stuff
that brings you closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez scoring goals would bring everyone closer. The
two-time Mexican scoring champ has yet to record his first MLS
points after four MLS matches and a U.S. Open Cup match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luis has to be a little frustrated,'' Galaxy assistant Ralph
Perez said. ``What we are hoping for is that with Cobi back, we'll
play them up front together and hopefully they will find each other
with Mauricio also finding them in good position.''

COMPANIES VIE TO DEVELOP TREATMENT FOR GENETIC DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The race to gain approval for an enzyme replacement drug to
treat Fabry disease, a rare genetic disorder, entered the final
stretch Friday when Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. submitted its
license application for Replagal to the US Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme Corp., TKT's major rival, said it will submit its Fabry
drug for FDA approval within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The proverbial brass ring both Cambridge, Mass. companies are
seeking upon FDA approval is designation as the sole provider of
the medication to treat Fabry patients under the Orphan Drug Act,
which grants one company seven years of market exclusivity. Genzyme
is familiar with the law, having developed Ceredase, an
enzyme-replacement drug to treat the rare inherited disorder
Gaucher's disease,
</P>
<P>
   Last year Cerezyme, the successor drug to Ceredase, had sales of
nearly $480 million from about 2,500 patients. Replagal is TKT's
first drug submitted for final FDA review.
</P>
<P>
   Both TKT and Genzyme are expected to submit drugs that are very
similar to alpha-galactosidase A, a naturally occurring enzyme that
is missing or deficient in people with Fabry disease. Without the
enzyme some fats and sugars, known as lipids, accumulate on blood
vessel walls, restricting blood flow and causing intense pain in
hands and feet and ultimately damage to vital organs such as the
kidney and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Each company has been circumspect about discussing clinical
trial results for their respective drugs. Genzyme said it has
conducted pivotal Phase III tests of its drug at eight medical
centers in the United States and Europe but declined to specify how
many people participated.
</P>
<P>
   TKT Friday said it submitted two Phase II clinical trial results
for FDA approval _ a 26-patient trial conducted by with the
National Institue of Neurological Disorders and Strokes in
Bethesda, Md., and a 15-patient examination at the Royal Free
Hospital in London. In both trials patients received either
Replagal or a placebo by intravenous infusion every two weeks over
a six-month period. TKT has also provided the FDA with long-term
data from 25 patients treated for about one year in a separate
study for the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike major diseases, only about 2,000 people in the United
States are diagnosed with Fabry, according to Genzyme and TKT
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why TKT is submitting Phase II data rather than conduct a
pivotal Phase III trial, president and chief executive Dr. Richard
F. Selden said its clinical trials were the equivalent of Phase III
examinations, only with fewer participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually Phase III trials are thought of in large numbers, but
we have worked with the FDA on the protocols of these (Phase II)
trials,'' said Selden, who hopes to gain FDA approval by the end of
this year or early 2001, along with Orphan Drug designation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeman for Genzyme said submitting data to the FDA a few
weeks after TKT should not impact who gains final approval.
</P>
<P>
   TKT's plans for Replagal are independent of the company's patent
infringement trial against Amgen Inc. before US District Court
Judge William G. Young, currently in recess until July 5.
</P>
<P>
   TKT closed Friday at $35, up $1.6875. Genzyme closed at $56.75,
up 31 cents.

XEROX WARNS STREET ON EARNINGS, PROMPTING SHARES TO PLUMMET 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Xerox Corp., besieged by strong competition in its
highest-margin product lines, debt problems in Mexico and upheaval
in its sales force, warned investors Friday that its second-quarter
earnings would be as much as 12 cents below analysts' expectations
of 42 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox issued similar warnings in the third and fourth quarters
of last year. Investors who had hoped the bad news was over when
the company met expectations last quarter demonstrated their
disappointment swiftly and harshly. They drove shares of Xerox down
almost 19 percent, to close at $20.563, down $4.75.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Xerox ousted its chief executive, G. Richard Thoman,
and returned its former chief, Paul Allaire, to the top spot. Anne
Mulcahy, 47, head of the company's general markets organization,
became president and is seen as the likely heir apparent. Analysts
doubt, however, that the new team has a quick fix for Xerox's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul and Anne found more maggots under the rock than they
expected,'' said David Nadler, a consultant to Xerox. ``They have
tremendous credibility with employees and customers, but they still
have to earn credibility on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Xerox did not comment on future earnings,
analysts flooded First Call-Thomson Financial with lowered earnings
estimates for this year and next. ``No one thinks this is just a
one-quarter problem,'' said Charles Hill, director of research at
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Xerox's problems stem from last year's sales force
reorganization in which the company made sales representatives
responsible for specific industries, not geographic territories.
Xerox also consolidated its customer administration offices,
resulting in numerous customer service problems. Thus, sales people
had to cope with new clients even as they fielded irate calls from
old ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients tell us it can take Xerox salesmen a week to return
calls,'' said James Lundy, a director at the technology research
firm Gartner Group. ``Xerox has to learn how to compete again.''
</P>
<P>
   Xerox management did not try to sugarcoat the company's
responsibility for its current woes. ``Most of our difficulties are
of our own making,'' Allaire told analysts in a conference call.
``The issues that led us to this point are largely the issues we've
talked about previously.''
</P>
<P>
   It is exactly that all-too-familiar ring that worries many
analysts. ``You could have listened to that conference call, and
said it's June 16, 1999, not 2000,'' said Jack Kelly, a Goldman,
Sachs analyst. ``The longer this turn-around takes, the higher the
probability that the problem is strategy, not execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that even one-time earnings disappointments may
point to deeper problems. Take, for example, Xerox's warning that
unexpected problems with customer receivables in Mexico could pare
more than 5 cents a share off the quarter's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Gibboney Huske, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston,
said, ``I'm less concerned that this will be a recurring item than
I am about the company's financial controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said the worries were misplaced. ``Our internal
investigation spotted the problem,'' said Christa Carone, a Xerox
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors, meanwhile, like Germany's Heidelberger
Druckmaschinen AG, Japan's Canon Inc., and most recently, IBM _
with a high-speed copier that uses a Heidelberger engine _ are
making deep in-roads into the market for super high-speed copiers,
Xerox's most profitable product line.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Xerox picture is not all bleak. The flood of
experienced sales representatives out of the company has slowed to
a trickle. Sales of color copiers have been brisk. Many analysts
have applauded the company's joint venture with Microsoft Corp. to
sell software, and its recent distribution deal with Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox will soon introduce high-priced office copiers and a line
of low-priced printers. Analysts say Xerox also is negotiating a
deal to bundle Xerox inkjet printers with a large computer
company's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround will take longer than we thought, but the long
term picture is bright,'' Huske said.

NVEST SOLD TO FRENCH MONEY MANAGER FOR $2.2 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHRYN TONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Asset manager Nvest LP, which has seen money flow out
of its funds for 10 straight quarters, was sold Friday to France's
second largest money-management company, $2.2 billion in cash and
debt.
</P>
<P>
   CDC Asset Management, the money management arm of Caisse des
Depots et Consignations, will pay $40 per limited partnership unit
for Nvest, double Nvest's closing price on Thursday. CDC also will
assume the Boston firm's $311 million in debt. Nvest and CDC said
that the combined company will have more than $300 billion in
assets. Nvest's stock priced more than doubled, to $37.625, as
investors responded to the news.
</P>
<P>
   The sale ends MetLife's four-year ownership of a 48 percent
stake in NVest. The New York insurance giant gained its stake in
NVest when it purchased The New England in 1996. MetLife is
retaining its ownership of State Street Research &AMP; Management,
another Boston fund firm.
</P>
<P>
   CDC hopes that the purchase will give the company a foothold in
the $7 trillion US mutual fund market, after its failed past
attempts to enter on its own. ``The acquisition of Nvest is an
important part of our strategy to become a global investment
house,'' said Gerard Barbot, chairman of the supervisory board of
CDC Asset Management. The joint company plans on developing a
presence in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Nvest, formerly known as New England Investment Cos., owns some
well-known investment firms including Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co., which
specializes in bonds; Capital Growth Management, run by star fund
manager Kenneth Heebner; the Kobrick family of funds; and
Chicago-based Oakmark funds. NVest manages $134 billion for
individuals and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   CDC oversees about $170 billion for investors, $5 billion of
which is in US hedge funds that invest in mortgage backed
securities. The company was founded by  &UR; Louis XVIII  &LR; in 1816 and
remains state-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Nvest's buyout follows a trend of European banks acquiring US
fund companies, including the purchase of The Pioneer Group Inc.,
another Boston mutual fund house, last month by UniCredito Italiano
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The high price that CDC is willing to by shows the determination
that foreign banks have in entering the US mutual fund market, said
Dennis Gallant, a consultant for Cerulli Associates Inc. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife Inc., the biggest US life insurer, will receive $858
million from the sale for its 48 percent stake in Nvest. ``Nvest
didn't really benefit MetLife's core business venture,'' said
Gallant. He predicts that the buyout will not affect either company
because each had separate distribution channels. MetLife, which
went public in April, has held its Nvest stake since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other Nvest shareholders will receive a cash out of $40 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Voss, Nvest's CEO, will continue to head the company. He
will join the CDC Asset Management's executive committee. Nvest
said it expects no layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Company headquarters will remain in Boston and be renamed CDC
Asset Management-North America.

MARRIAGE INSURANCE FOR THE YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By ABBY ELLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a happy thought during this month of matrimony, this
saison d'amour: Of the nearly 230,000 marriages that begin in June,
more than half will end in divorce, and of those, about 60,000 will
involve heated legal battles.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults, of course, account for the bulk of the people
making trip No. 1 to the altar: in 1998, the average bride was 25
years old, the average groom 26.7.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that young people today _ some of whom, as we
have heard ad nauseum, are worth millions _ know full well the
connubial risks. To combat them, they seek preventive medicine in
the form of prenuptial agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see lots of kids,'' said Raoul Felder, a divorce lawyer, who
writes 150 to 200 prenuptial contracts a year, 70 percent of them
for people under 35 _ up from 20 percent just four years ago. In
the past, he said, most of the clients were on their second or
third marriages _ jaded, older and presumably wiser. Not these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What used to happen is that people would start out with
nothing but a big bag of hopes, so they didn't need a prenup,''
Felder said from his Manhattan office. ``But young kids today have
economic clout. Marriage is usually thought of as a disease of the
young, and money is flowing into young people as it never has
before, so they want to protect what they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid came in wearing sneakers,'' he said. ``I thought he
was the delivery boy. He didn't have much money, but he had these
options worth $12 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Prenuptial agreements have grown in specificity. Once they
mainly protected an inheritance, ``but now you can protect
everything _ business, homes, how much child support there will
be,'' said Seymour Reisman, a divorce lawyer with Reisman, Peirez &AMP;
Reisman in Garden City, N.Y., who also sees many young clients.
``There are a lot of different choices for people to make.'' And
waltzing down an aisle need not be one of them: many lawyers write
these agreements for unmarried people who live together.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman Sporn runs a New York Internet management company with
his name on the door. He is 29, worth in the low single millions,
presently unmarried and completely pro-prenup. Many of his clients
in the dot-com world have them, and he would insist that any spouse
of his sign one. ``You look at the people who were in love and are
now divorced, and you realize that so many had hidden agendas,'' he
said. ``I'm a purist. I believe a couple should share everything.
But a part of me is distrustful: I want to know I'm protected if
something goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is still a stigma attached to the little
document, which typically costs from $500 to $1,000. Plenty of
people hesitate to acknowledge marrying for any reason but
dewy-eyed wonder _ or that their assets might mean more than their
mates. ``Usually the moneyed spouse wants to sign and the other
doesn't,'' said Reisman, who has seen couples split up over the
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Some people attribute the rise in prenuptial agreements among
the dot-com set to youthful anxiety in an uncertain economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prenup is just another way of young kids' pumping up their
ego or being underconfident about what their real abilities are,''
said Avi Moskowitz, 36, chief executive of Virtual Communities,
which builds online portals. ``No one's seen these Internet
companies exist for more than three or four years, so no one knows
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Moskowitz will celebrate his 14th wedding
anniversary. He says he understands why some people might want a
prenuptial agreement as a safety net, but he and his wife and
business partner, Helen Moskowitz, do not have one. ``A prenup
essentially says we may stay together, but we may also carve out
some things that are yours and some that are mine, which
overemphasizes the material aspects of the relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is right. Ideally, anyway, we should all say ``I do'' with
the proper amount of optimism and hope; we shouldn't worry in
advance about who'll get the stock options, the Lexus or the 'N
Sync CD's. We should plan for the best _ or at least learn to part
amicably without needing written instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, as Felder suggests, society needs to rethink the
matrimonial institution. ``There never was an instrument people
would buy if it only worked half the time,'' he said. ``Yet people
are getting married knowing there's a failure rate of 50 percent.
It's truly amazing.''

 &HT;    Bush looks to Cheney for guidance in choosing running mate
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - George W. Bush's one-man vice presidential
search committee comes battle-tested and with mom's seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is ``as competent as they
come,'' Barbara Bush wrote in her diary on March 2, 1991, as the
success of Operation Desert Storm had become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems very laid back and reassuring. He does not have a Dr.
Strangelove image that so many of our secretaries of defense get,
whether they deserve it or not,'' Mrs. Bush wrote in the diary note
recounted in her autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a man who was President George Bush's second choice
_ to Texan John Tower, who failed to win Senate confirmation _ and
had never served in the military before becoming defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to steal from our congressional ranks,'' the
ex-president later wrote of his selection of Wyoming's only U.S.
House member, ``but I knew Dick would be accepted on the hill and
would do a great job. I was right on both counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the next Bush who wants to be president is counting heavily
on Cheney to help find the right running mate for the November
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I trust Dick Cheney's judgment; I know his character,'' Bush
said in announcing Cheney's assignment in April. ''It's obviously
an important decision for me and I can't think of a better person
to work with on making that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently said he talks with Cheney roughly once every four
days as the process continues.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, born in Nebraska and raised in Wyoming, arrived in
Washington in 1966 for a congressional fellowship. He advanced to
the Nixon White House, including a stint as deputy to White House
counselor Donald Rumsfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney worked on the transition team when Nixon resigned and
then-Vice President Gerald Ford took over, rising to chief of staff
in November 1975 at age 34, the youngest person to hold that key
post.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Carter ousted Ford in 1976, Cheney went home to
Wyoming as an investment adviser. He won a House seat in 1978 and
served six terms, suffering three heart attacks along the way.
Cheney developed a reputation as a moderate, though he supported
military aide to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the invasion of
Grenada and the bombing of Libya, and opposed the Equal Rights
Amendment and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the elder Bush tapped him for defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cheney became chairman of Halliburton Co., a
Dallas-based oil, engineering and construction firm, a job he gave
up in 1998 after a merger, but regained in February.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney toyed with the idea of running for president in 1996 but
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the search process, Cheney has demonstrated the trait
that Bush covets most _ loyalty _ by remaining tight-lipped about
any speculation on a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, there are many good candidates to choose from in
our party,'' Cheney said when he took the assignment. ``We will
look at them all. And we will make sure we have the best possible
ticket this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has been a Bush adviser since the campaign was in
its embryonic stage, had been considered a potential running mate.
But he squelched that speculation when he became the search
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Halliburton stockholders at a May meeting in Dallas,
he said: ``I made a long-term commitment to the company and I have
absolutely no desire to go back to government.''

ALBRIGHT TO VISIT SOUTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to capitalize on the momentum of the
Korean summit meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
decided to visit South Korea next week and will stop immediately
afterward in China, where officials said she would also focus on
Korean developments.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's mission in Seoul will be to bless the policies of the
South Korean leader, Kim Dae-jung, that resulted in the summit
accord, and to stress that the United States supports the ultimate
goal of reunification, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main objective of direct North and South Korean dialogue
is that if you can move the discussion on reunification, you begin
to get momentum on other issues,'' an administration official said.
``There are opportunities here we don't want to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   The major issues for the United States include North Korea's
long-range ballistic missile program for which the administration
has proposed a $60 billion missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official is to meet North Korean officials at the
end of the month to try to persuade Pyongyang to agree to a
permanent moratorium on the flight testing of its long-range
missile.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the administration will publish in The Federal
Register the provisions of a broad lifting of economic sanctions
that have been in place since North Korea invaded the South 50
years ago. President Clinton announced the easing of sanctions in
September as a reward for North Korea's suspending missile testing
while talks on a longer-lasting ban proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the importance that the Clinton administration
places on the broad accord that North and South Korea reached, the
national security adviser of South Korea, Hwang Won-tak, who
attended the summit meeting, briefed Clinton on Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Kim, who is receiving accolades from U.S.
officials for the success of his ``sunshine policy'' toward the
North, telephoned Clinton to tell him details of the meeting, a
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who had been planning to visit China next month for
what would probably be her last trip there as secretary, pushed the
trip forward so she could encourage Beijing to continue to be
helpful on North Korea. The United States and China have some
shared interests on the Korean Peninsula, primarily in avoiding
armed conflict between North and South.

AT ARKANSAS BAR'S GATHERING, FEW WILLING TO DISCUSS CLINTON CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ Exchanging pinstripes and flannel for golf
shirts and madras trousers, the Arkansas Bar Association munched,
sipped and seminared its way through its annual summer meeting here
with no official mention that its most famous member is in danger
of not being a member much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid the coffee break congeniality and the cocktail hour
comradery, many of the thousand Arkansas lawyers gathered here, the
city where Bill Clinton spent his boyhood, were reluctant to
discuss the president's pending disbarment case, or the impact it
could have on a profession seemingly in perpetual need of a
public-relations makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hush-hush sort of subject,'' sighed H.A. Taylor, a
trial judge from Pine Bluff. ``Lawyers want to talk about it, but
they want to talk about it privately.```
</P>
<P>
   When they do, their opinion on the appropriateness of disbarring
Clinton tends to break along party or ideological lines, if only
barely. Interviews with more than two dozen lawyers indicate that
party affiliation and past voting behavior do not necessarily
translate into support for a less-severe sanction than disbarment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate,'' said Laura E. Partlow, 44, of
Little Rock, an attorney for the Arkansas Human Services
Department, who said she had campaigned for Clinton and had twice
voted for him for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can make a contribution to society without a law license,''
Partlow said. ``I hear he's a great teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   John P. Lewis of Hot Springs, who was once a clerk at the 8th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis, said he did not believe
that Clinton's conduct ``'s conduct ``rises to the level of
disbarment _ I don't know if it would even require a suspension of
his license.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the lawyers in my circle see it as a political
issue,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one condones lying under oath, but I'm ambivalent'' about
disbarment, said Ron C. Wilson, 41, of Marion, , one of a handful
of African-American lawyers at the convention. He said he
considered the case against Clinton to be ``somewhat political.''
</P>
<P>
   David K. Harp, a 51-year-old lawyer from Fort Smith, said that
while stripping Clinton of his law license ``seems extreme to me,
the consensus I hear is that another lawyer would have been
disbarred a long time ago'' for the same offense.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a year since U.S. District Court Judge
Susan Webber Wright cited Clinton for contempt for giving what she
described as ``intentionally false, misleading and evasive''
testimony in a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case.
</P>
<P>
   Wright fined Clinton $90,000 and referred the matter of his
testimony to the Arkansas Supreme Court's Committee on Professional
Conduct, which on May 19 recommended that the president be
disbarred. Clinton has said he will vigorously contest the action,
first in Circuit Court at Little Rock, and, if need be, at the
Arkansas Supreme Court, the state's ultimate arbiter on law
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   People with knowledge of the disbarment referral say that the
professional conduct committee has retained a special counsel to
press its case against Clinton and that it should be formally filed
by month's end. They also say preliminary maneuvering could delay
the case until after Clinton leaves office in January.

TEXAS A&AMP;M SUSPENDS BONFIRE FOR TWO YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In response to the worst tragedy in the history of
Texas A&AMP;M University, the president of the university Friday
suspended its traditional football bonfire ritual for two years to
allow time to plan a scaled-down, tightly supervised event that
will better ensure student safety.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the university's president, Dr. Ray Bowen,
reverberated across Texas and punctuated a seven-month period of
criticism and Texas A&AMP;M soul-searching after a four-tier stack of
logs nearly 60 feet tall collapsed last Nov. 18, killing 11
students and a former student and injuring 27 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tragedy was a wake-up call for everyone here and everyone
in the country,'' said Bowen in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said the bonfire could resume in the fall
of 2002 provided that students meet conditions established by
Bowen. He said that when classes resumed in late summer, he would
convene a committee of administrators, faculty members and students
to begin reorganizing the event.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling the next two bonfires will allow appropriate time to
plan, Bowen said. He predicted that a smaller, safer bonfire tower
would be built, with increased oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quite optimistic we can create a safe structure,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire, a tradition that began in 1909 at Texas A&AMP;M on the
eve of its football game against its archrival, the University of
Texas, annually draws thousands of people to the A&AMP;M campus about
90 miles northwest of here in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Student crews working with little supervision stacked and bound
thousands of logs felled from nearby forests into a tower shaped
like a wedding cake. The final week of construction, known as Push,
required round-the-clock efforts as students raced to finish in
time to set the stack afire at a pep rally before the game.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a five-member independent commission appointed by Texas
A&AMP;M issued a report saying that design flaws in the log tower were
largely to blame for the collapse. The report also said students
building the tower were inadequately trained, and criticized
university officials for failing to provide adequate supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Friday's announcement was quiet on the A&AMP;M campus.
The academic year ended several weeks ago and most students had
left the campus. Only about a dozen students and faculty members
attended Bowen's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good they're making this decision, though I don't
know about the two-year period of holding off,'' said Justin
Lightsey, 19, a sophomore from nearby Bryan. ``I think it's good
they're making it safer. My parents, though, told me not to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Braus, whose son Dominic remains in physical therapy after
suffering extensive injuries to his arm in the collapse, said she
was pleased with the new safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Braus also said that she did not blame the university for her
son's injury and that she was elated that one of A&AMP;M's oldest
traditions would eventually continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop Christmas trees, you can't stop Easter eggs,''
Braus said. ``These traditions have to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to continue the bonfire tradition has been
enormous. More than 8,000 students have signed a petition
supporting its continuance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Texas A&AMP;M Faculty Senate recommended
that Bowen suspend the tradition for at least one year. And on
Wednesday, the Texas Board of Professional Engineers voted to
conduct an inquiry to determine whether state engineering laws were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, an alumnus of the university, endorsed the
new policy. ``He supports the administration,'' said Eric Bearse, a
spokesman for the lieutenant governor. ``The most important thing
is to ensure the safety of the students, and they have put together
a process that puts safety first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the restructured bonfires would differ greatly
from those of recent years, when students spent up to three months
cutting down thousands of trees and then building the tower of
logs. In the future, the event will last only two weeks. The trees
will be donated from companies and students will not participate in
the harvest. Also, Bowen said, the reduced size of the tower will
lessen the environmental damage, a point criticized even before the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, construction will end by midnight, and university
officials will provide continual supervision. A fence will surround
the site and a video camera will record construction. The hierarchy
of the student organization, which had been run by upperclassmen
known as Red Pots and Brown Pots, will be reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   And the unstable wedding cake shape will be abandoned in favor
of a teepee shape used in the 1950s and '60s. Professional
engineers will draft the design and establish the construction
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the bonfire structure would be assessed and
certified every year and that failure to meet the specifications
would result in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't comply, if the rules are broken, there will be
no bonfire the following year,'' said Cindy Lawson, the school's
executive director for community relations.

COMMENTARY: SHALLOW AND CALLOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been questions all along about the depth and
seriousness of George W. Bush. They have been brought into sharp
focus now by a surprising issue: the way the death penalty is
administered in Texas. In his comments on that subject Bush has
defined himself, unforgettably, as shallow and callous.
</P>
<P>
   In his five years as governor of Texas, the state has executed
131 prisoners _ far more than any other state. Bush has lately
granted a stay of execution for the first time, for a DNA test.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to questions about that record, Bush has repeatedly
said that he has no qualms. ``I'm confident,'' he said last
February, ``that every person that has been put to death in Texas
under my watch has been guilty of the crime charged, and has had
full access to the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   That defense of the record ignores many notorious examples of
unfairness in Texas death penalty cases. Lawyers have been under
the influence of cocaine during the trial, or been drunk or asleep.
One court dismissed a complaint about a lawyer who slept through a
trial with the comment that courts are not ``obligated to either
constantly monitor trial counsel's wakefulness or endeavor to wake
counsel should he fall asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   This past week The Chicago Tribune published a compelling report
on an investigation of all 131 death cases in Bush's time. It made
chilling reading.
</P>
<P>
   In one-third of those cases, the report showed, the lawyer who
represented the death penalty defendant at trial or on appeal had
been or was later disbarred or otherwise sanctioned. In 40 cases
the lawyers presented no evidence at all or only one witness at the
sentencing phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In 29 cases, the prosecution used testimony from a psychiatrist
who _ based on a hypothetical question about the defendant's past _
predicted he would commit future violence. Most of those
psychiatrists testified without having examined the defendant: a
practice condemned professionally as unethical.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses included one who was temporarily released from a
psychiatric ward to testify, a pathologist who had admitted faking
autopsies and a judge who had been reprimanded for lying about his
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Tribune study, Bush said, ``We've adequately
answered innocence or guilt'' in every case. The defendants, he
said, ``had full access to a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways of understanding that comment. Either Bush
was contemptuous of the facts or, on a matter of life and death, he
did not care.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem is the Texas way of providing
lawyers for defendants too poor to hire their own, as most are in
death cases. There is no state system. Judges assign lawyers _
often lawyers who have contributed to their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State of Texas is a national embarrassment in the area of
indigent legal services,'' a committee of the State Bar of Texas
says in a report just approved. Again, Bush has shown no concern
about this reality. He vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature,
that would have let Texas counties set up a limited public defender
program for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment, long favored by a majority of Americans, has
become a national issue again because of concern about the fairness
of its administration. Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican,
imposed a moratorium on executions in that state after 13 men on
death row were shown to be innocent. Pat Robertson and other
conservatives have called for a national moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   The most complete study ever done of the death penalty process,
by Professor James Liebman and others at Columbia University, was
published the other day. It showed that two-thirds of death
convictions or sentences were upset on appeal for such reasons as
incompetent defense lawyers or prosecutors who bent the rules.
</P>
<P>
   To all this George Bush is seemingly indifferent. Or perhaps not
entirely. If he were not running for president, it is doubtful that
he would just now have granted his first stay of execution. Next
week Gary Graham, convicted of murder on the testimony of a single
witness who said she saw him at night from 30 to 40 feet away, is
due to be executed. Will Bush care?

WHY IT HELPS TO GESTICULATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 18, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge are cosmocrats.
Oxford-educated, they travel the world relentlessly for London's
Economist magazine, as its United States editor and Washington
correspondent, respectively, poking noses into nooks and crannies
of interest to them. A few years ago they wrote a sprightly survey
of the management consulting industry, which they called ``The
Witch Doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   They also are, so far as I can tell, the coiners of the term
``cosmocrat'' _ meaning any cosmopolitan entrepreneur, corporate
executive, or bureaucrat who is involved extending the new world
order. Their new book, ``Future Perfect: The Challenge and Hidden
Promise of Globalization,'' is a higher, drier version of Thomas L.
Friedman's ``The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding
Globalization''
</P>
<P>
   Future perfect is the verb tense of the English language wherein
human will and possibility are expressed together in terms of an
imagined concrete reality in some time from now, as in (they quote
from Tennyson), ``the wonder that would be.'' Most of the book
consists of an engaging tour d'horizon of those regions for which
The Economist functions as something of a weekly roadmap.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the three engines of globalization are described in some
detail under the headings of technology, capital flows, and modern
management. Five ``myths of globalization'' are controverted: that
size trumps all; that universal products triumph; that economics
must be rewritten; that globalization is a zero-sum game; that
geography no longer matters. Paradoxes are elucidated: that nation
states mean more in an age of globalization as world government
such as the United Nations means less; that winner-take-all market
means more for everyone else as well. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   One chapter in particular breaks new ground. The suspected
existence of a shadowy global ruling class has been a familiar
bugaboo for most of 20th century: the Masons, the Protocols of the
Elders of Zion, the Comintern, the Trilateral Commission and all
that. Yet the past 25 years of rapid globalization have finally
begun ``to produce a group of people who have the classic
characteristics of a class,'' the authors say. These are, of
course, the cosmocrats.
</P>
<P>
   Where do you find them? Not necessarily at the Swiss ski resort
of Davos in the winter, nor Nantucket and Easthampton on Long
Island in August, those being just the most exclusive annual
meetings of certain portions of the group. To see cosmocrats at
work, it is better to visit instead the enormous annual MIPCOM film
market in Los Angeles, for example; or the Comdex electronic trade
show in Las Vegas, the Academy of Management meetings in shifting
convention cities in the summer and the Frankfurt book fair in
Germany in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Who qualifies for membership? The backbone of the cosmocracy
still comprises the executives of the multinational corporations,
say the authors. But the proprieters of more and more start-ups are
finding their way in, often equpped with little more than a server
and and a web of contacts. There are the staffers of the ubiquitous
NGOs (non-governmental organizations, from the World Bank to the
Worldwatch Institute); of governments themselves and of the
universities. Professional services have become international:
money management, law, accounting, advertising, public relations,
and even political consultants now spin around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cosmocrats are Westerners, naturally. McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
which the authors call the Vatican of the cosmocracy, is run by an
Indian; so is Bain &AMP; Co., which must be its Society of Jesus. Half
the teachers at the London Business School speak English as a
second language. But the culture of the international class is
denatured American. The authors offer Jack Welch's definition of
General Electric's ``universal values'': meritocracy, dignity,
simplicity, speed, and a hatred of bureaucracy. In the end,
membership is available to any who possess ``ideas, connections,
and sheer chutzpah'' to master the international economy.
</P>
<P>
   Where do you get in? The royal road remains the business school.
Where a college education from a fancy university used to be
enough, entry into the new elite may require an MBA, a law degree,
or something like it. Micklethwait and Wooldridge describe a
business school wedding to illustrate the bonding power among those
who spend their lives on global circuits. But in fact it is
probably the language acquired in school, the ``way of seeing,''
that unites alumni more deeply than anything else _ that and the
periodic reunions.
</P>
<P>
   A second institution that binds the cosmocracy together is the
professional service firm, consulting firms especially. (It used to
be investment banks.) Each year McKinsey screens 50,000 resumes to
hire 500 new associates. Arthur Andersen recruits receive 26 weeks
of training during their first five years. New consultants work
long hours in demanding jobs, moving rapidly from city to city and
industry to industry. In time, most move on to corporate jobs, and
in due course many of them become top leaders. ``The result is that
former consultants are beginning to form a quasi-masonic elite at
the summit of modern business,'' the authors write. Among the 5,000
alumni of McKinsey, they note, are the leaders of IBM, American
Express, and the Conservative Party of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The final institution of importance is the Internet. Indeed, it
is not too much to say that the Net was designed by (academic)
cosmocrats, for cosmocrats. For them it is more than just a medium
of exchange for information. It is a community, unrestrained by
national rules and gender neutral, not to mention a potent source
of metaphor. Marriage is a great way of doubling your Rolodex, one
cosmocrat tells the writers; another refers to it as the ``ultimate
hotsynch,'' resorting to the language of _ what else? _ the Palm
Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the cosmocracy is described as an ``anxious'' elite.
Placelessness has its perils, it turns out. There's only so much
that can be learned in a succession of hotel rooms. For Ellen
Knapp, chief information officer of PricewaterhouseCoopers ever
since the two giant accounting firms merged in 1997, this
vulnerability is an opportunity. She spends nine days out of 10 on
the road teaching people to cooperate. Technology depends on trust,
Knapp tells the authors, and trust depends on personal
communication. E-mail often doesn't do the job unless its way has
been prepared by _ at least _ an introduction. ``It is important to
gesticulate,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen just how much clout the cosmocrats will
have, apart from organizations in which they serve. Even
Micklethwait and Wooldridge describe their hold on power in modern
politics as ``fragile.'' Many other organizations have more
leverage: political parties, the business community, trade unions,
the disciplines, the press and, yes, the family. At least in
successful organizations, all of the networks, the message traffic,
and reunions may count for less than a gesture, a touch, a joint
project, or even a shared cigarette between meetings. (That it must
be outside the building only increases the tightness of the bond!)

 &HT;    Bush looks to Cheney for guidance in choosing running mate
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - George W. Bush's one-man vice presidential
search committee comes battle-tested and with mom's seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is ``as competent as they
come,'' Barbara Bush wrote in her diary on March 2, 1991, as the
success of Operation Desert Storm had become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems very laid back and reassuring. He does not have a Dr.
Strangelove image that so many of our secretaries of defense get,
whether they deserve it or not,'' Mrs. Bush wrote in the diary note
recounted in her autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a man who was President George Bush's second choice
_ to Texan John Tower, who failed to win Senate confirmation _ and
had never served in the military before becoming defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to steal from our congressional ranks,'' the
ex-president later wrote of his selection of Wyoming's only U.S.
House member, ``but I knew Dick would be accepted on the hill and
would do a great job. I was right on both counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the next Bush who wants to be president is counting heavily
on Cheney to help find the right running mate for the November
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I trust Dick Cheney's judgment; I know his character,'' Bush
said in announcing Cheney's assignment in April. ''It's obviously
an important decision for me and I can't think of a better person
to work with on making that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently said he talks with Cheney roughly once every four
days as the process continues.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, born in Nebraska and raised in Wyoming, arrived in
Washington in 1966 for a congressional fellowship. He advanced to
the Nixon White House, including a stint as deputy to White House
counselor Donald Rumsfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney worked on the transition team when Nixon resigned and
then-Vice President Gerald Ford took over, rising to chief of staff
in November 1975 at age 34, the youngest person to hold that key
post.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Carter ousted Ford in 1976, Cheney went home to
Wyoming as an investment adviser. He won a House seat in 1978 and
served six terms, suffering three heart attacks along the way.
Cheney developed a reputation as a moderate, though he supported
military aide to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the invasion of
Grenada and the bombing of Libya, and opposed the Equal Rights
Amendment and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the elder Bush tapped him for defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cheney became chairman of Halliburton Co., a
Dallas-based oil, engineering and construction firm, a job he gave
up in 1998 after a merger, but regained in February.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney toyed with the idea of running for president in 1996 but
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the search process, Cheney has demonstrated the trait
that Bush covets most _ loyalty _ by remaining tight-lipped about
any speculation on a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, there are many good candidates to choose from in
our party,'' Cheney said when he took the assignment. ``We will
look at them all. And we will make sure we have the best possible
ticket this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has been a Bush adviser since the campaign was in
its embryonic stage, had been considered a potential running mate.
But he squelched that speculation when he became the search
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Halliburton stockholders at a May meeting in Dallas,
he said: ``I made a long-term commitment to the company and I have
absolutely no desire to go back to government.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary General Kofi Annan Friday certified
Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, opening the way to a
more robust U.N. peacekeeping presence along Lebanon's
often-troubled border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the long road toward peace in the
region, but I hope it will be seen as the beginning of the end,''
said Annan, who promptly departed on a weeklong trip to a
half-dozen countries in the Middle East to discuss ways for the
United Nations to build on the achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The certification was challenged a few hours later when
Lebanon's prime minister, Salim Hoss, contended in Beirut that
Israeli troops still controlled some parts of the border are. He
did not identify the areas or their size, or threaten to withhold
cooperation with the U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general's confirmation of the Israeli pullout to
the Security Council is significant because it credits Israel with
fulfilling an essential condition of Resolution 425, which the
Council passed in 1978. The resolution demanded that Israeli troops
pull out of the territory they had just occupied in southern
Lebanon to create a security buffer zone and now, Annan says,
Israel has done just that.
</P>
<P>
   With that accomplished, the 22-year-old resolution authorizes
U.N. peacekeepers to be deployed across southern Lebanon to help
the Lebanese government restore peace and security in the area and
reassert its lost authority.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the United Nations appeared to be embarking on yet
another peacekeeping operation at a time when its financial and
troop resources are already thinly stretched. As of this month, the
United Nations had 35,469 military personnel and police officers
deployed in 14 peacekeeping operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike another operation being planned for Congo, the
mission in southern Lebanon offers unusually high prospects for
success at comparatively modest physical risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a happy day for Lebanon, but also for Israel,'' Annan
said. ``And it is a day of pride for the United Nations. It shows
that U.N. resolutions, when fully implemented by all parties
working together, can be the building blocks of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoss said in a statement released in Beirut: ``There are
still several Israeli military outposts inside the Lebanese border.
And there are several tracts of Lebanese territory under Israeli
control in a flagrant act of encroachment.'' He did not specify
where the tracts were.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Lebanon's president, Emile Lahoud, warned that
his country might not recognize the U.N. findings if they were
``confined to a fictitious nonexisting line that does not reach the
existing internationally recognized frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general and other officials have repeatedly
stressed that the United Nations is not demarcating the border
between Lebanon and Israel but merely confirming the line to which
the Israelis have withdrawn. This has meant verifying Israel's
pull-back across a frontier imperfectly defined in 1923, with
subsequent small adjustments, according to contemporary maps.
</P>
<P>
   After Annan telephoned Lahoud Friday to allay his concerns, the
announcement went ahead. But the mixed signals seem unlikely to be
clarified before Annan visits Beirut in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   During the inspection of the border, Lebanese officials have
repeatedly expressed reservations, and then supported the U.N.
effort. Some diplomats here suggested that the complaints of Hoss
and Lahoud were in good part for domestic consumption, to assure
the Lebanese people that their government will not cede any border
territory.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat here said that Lebanon was worried that the
Israelis might try to turn the line of withdrawal identified by the
United Nations into their international border, causing the
Lebanese to forfeit some land.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, called
by its acronym UNIFIL, was largely limited to looking on _ and
ducking _ while Islamic guerrillas in southern Lebanon fired
artillery and rockets into northern Israel and the Israelis
retaliated with airstrikes and cross-border raids. The peacekeepers
can now occupy fixed positions and conduct mobile patrols along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Annan confirmed that the peacekeepers' main task now would be to
help the Lebanese government and its armed forces assume their
responsibilities along the border and throughout the area that
Israel has vacated.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general's special representative in the region,
Terje Roed-Larsen, said that the peacekeeping mission would be
expanded to 5,600 troops, from the 4,400 now stationed in southern
Lebanon, in the first two weeks of July.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen, who was entrusted with handling the complex and
politically sensitive verification process, said that the Lebanese
government has already deployed 1,000 soldiers and internal
security troops in the border area.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement, the secretary general said he hoped that
the international community would help Lebanon rebuild its economy
in the south and re-establish ties to the rest of the country.
``This will help move the whole country closer to peace and
stability,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed hope that the successful implementation of the
Council's resolution on Lebanon would encourage others in the
Middle East, ``especially Syrians, Palestinians and Israelis, as
well as Lebanese,'' to move faster in negotiating other peace
treaties based on two earlier Council resolutions, which also
called for Israel's complete withdrawal from occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal from southern Lebanon got under way after
Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, set a self-imposed deadline of
July 7 for Israeli troops to leave. When the Israelis started
pulling out last month ahead of schedule, their allies, the
surrogate Southern Lebanese Army, collapsed, abandoning heavy
weapons and fortifications to the guerrillas and forcing the
Israelis to accelerate their departure.

COMMENTARY: THE SOUNDS OF SILENCING 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you wanted to pick the two people on the American cultural
landscape least likely to share a headline, you couldn't do much
better than Bruce Springsteen and Laura Schlessinger. Springsteen
is The Boss, a pillar of humanity in rock. Schlessinger is merely
bossy _ a mean-spirited ``doctor'' (in physiology, not psychology)
who dispenses authoritarian advice to pathetic lonelyhearts
desperate enough to seek family counseling from a call-in radio
show.
</P>
<P>
   But at this peculiar moment this odd couple have one thing in
common, besides loud voices and huge audiences: powerful forces are
campaigning to make them both shut up. Dr. Laura, who has labeled
homosexuality as ``deviant'' and a ``biological error,'' has drawn
months of protests from gay civil rights groups hoping to persuade
sponsors and Paramount to dump the new syndicated TV show she is to
start this fall. Springsteen, who is performing a song called
``American Skin'' about the shooting of Amadou Diallo, was labeled
a ``dirtbag'' and ``floating fag'' by the head of the New York
state chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police and is also the
target of a boycott. The New York Post went so far as to argue that
the lyrics of ``American Skin'' might ``nurture a growing
acceptance of violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anger out there about speech,'' says Floyd
Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer who led the Brooklyn Museum's
successful defense against Rudolph Giuliani's effort to squelch its
``Sensation'' exhibit. ``The sound of censorship is in the air, and
it cuts across political lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of silencing are in fact rapidly becoming a roar.
Such is the censorious impulse, you'd think we were in the midst of
a Red Scare or widespread social unrest _ not in an utterly bland
peace-and-prosperity presidential campaign. There are movements in
17 states to keep Harry Potter books from kids because they contain
witchcraft and violence, according to the American Library
Association. Religious-right groups went ballistic over an
innocuous and now-defunct NBC cartoon series titled ``God, the
Devil and Bob.'' The Web site TomPaine.com has hectored journalists
(myself among them) to boycott the sometimes racially and sexually
profane Don Imus radio show, and the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill is protesting the new Jim Carrey gross-out comedy,
``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' for its insensitivity. Next up for outrage
from every watchdog organization across the entire ideological
spectrum: Eminem, a charismatic white rapper whose new No. 1 CD
trades in violence, crude sex and invective roughing up
heterosexual women, lesbians and gay men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura isn't as nasty (or talented) as Eminem, but she's a
bigoted bully and is herself no defender of the First Amendment,
which she has derided (``It is not the Eleventh Commandment'') when
invoked by those who disagree with her. Yet the escalating
vehemence of the protest against her makes me uncomfortable when it
mirrors the tactics used by those on her side who fought to keep
the openly gay Ellen DeGeneres' eponymous sitcom off the air three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Laura advocates argue that the cases aren't parallel. Dr.
Laura doesn't star in a sitcom but is a pseudo-medical authority
whose oral prescriptions may lead directly to the punitive
treatment of gay people. Perhaps. But the more I've heard Dr.
Laura, the more I'd argue that she is essentially another brand of
entertainer whose shrill shtick is only likely to be taken
literally by those who share her antediluvian views in the first
place. I'd rather see her go on TV uncensored and widely ridiculed
(as she has been on ``Frasier'') than see a boycott by the Southern
Baptist Convention silence next season's prime-time series with
John Goodman as a sympathetic gay parent.
</P>
<P>
   But if the loud calls for squelching Dr. Laura sound
hypocritical coming from liberals who often deride the same tactics
from ``family values'' censors, the sudden embrace of the First
Amendment by her defenders has been even more ludicrous. It's hard
for the right, which has relentlessly called for the neutering of
everything from ``South Park'' to ``Dogma'' to ``WWF Smackdown!''
to explain why it now is in favor of untrammeled free speech for
Dr. Laura. But when there's a will _ and a political ally involved
_ there's a rationalization. One amusing recent effort to grab the
moral high ground, concocted by the commentator Michael Medved, has
been to argue that ``when conservatives boycott, they tend to
boycott because of obscenity,'' while the liberal anti-Laura
campaign is ``based upon [her) opinion.'' But what's obscene about
Harry Potter? Or Springsteen's plaintive narrative of the Diallo
case?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The other conservative tack is to play the victim card and argue
that Dr. Laura _ and her current companion in trash talk, John
Rocker _ are victims of political correctness run amok, martyrs to
``McCarthyism of the left.'' The Rocker flap, according to a Dennis
Prager rant in The Weekly Standard, is ``a case study in liberal
hysteria.'' I don't disagree that some of the response to this
baseball player's ignorant ramblings has been over the top, but no
more so than the right's the-sky-is-falling reaction to an Off
Broadway play like ``Corpus Christi'' or a sitcom like ``Ellen,''
both case studies in conservative hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Political correctness is always in the eye of the beholder.
Conservatives and liberals use the same arguments to defend the
free speech of their un-p.c. ideological bedfellows: Dr. Laura's
demeaning remarks about gay people are justified as arising out of
her deep spiritual convictions, much as liberals cited Chris
Ofili's Nigerian heritage in accounting for his ritualistic use of
elephant dung in ``The Holy Virgin Mary.'' As the right makes the
excuse that John Rocker is the half-innocent product of his hick
background, so the pop-music press portrays Eminem as the tortured
product of his harsh urban childhood.
</P>
<P>
   It all makes for a healthy and rowdy, if sometimes predictable,
debate; what's disturbing, says Joan Bertin of the National
Coalition Against Censorship, is the rising eagerness of all sides
``to obliterate from public view something they find offensive.''
Offensive speech is too often conflated with hateful acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a human reaction to want to suppress speech with which we
disagree,'' says Floyd Abrams, ``but it is contrary to the spirit
of the First Amendment and the broader spirit of living in a open
society. Dr. Laura at her worst, which is very bad indeed, does not
come close to advocating violence. The people offended by her have
First Amendment rights too, and exposing her is a good thing.
Suppressing her speech is wrong-headed and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a cacophonous First Amendment world, ugly speech often
backfires anyway. Charlton Heston's sonorous threat to cling to his
last musket with his ``cold, dead hands'' has probably done more to
speed gun control than any silencing of him or the NRA could ever
accomplish. The religious right's homophobia has cost it and the
GOP votes in each successive election. It's entirely possible that
Dr. Laura will go bust on TV faster than Rush Limbaugh did. As
Michael Harrison, editor of the trade journal Talkers, observes,
Schlessinger's ``veins-in-the-neck tautness'' is hardly a sure bet
to translate from an aural to a visual medium.
</P>
<P>
   What remains mystifying to First Amendment advocates I've talked
to is why there should be this much censorship in the air now. As
Abrams asks: ``Why is it happening when through the Internet we're
rapidly moving into an era when more is being said than ever before
and more people will be saying it?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is the reason. At this time of anxiety-making
technological change, this may be the last chance for any group to
stand its ground before the ground shifts unrecognizably beneath
it. In that sense, the effort to stop any legally protected form of
speech is increasingly becoming an academic exercise. With or
without Paramount, Dr. Laura will have a myriad of electronic
forums on the coming broadband Web in digital perpetuity, just as
Eminem and Springsteen songs will keep being disseminated through
Napster regardless of who stages what boycott against them. It's
the paradox of our historical moment that even as the clamor grows
to suppress offensive speech, we are speeding into the first
century in which doing so may well be impossible.

FCC APPROVES MERGER OF GTE AND BELL ATLANTIC INTO `VERIZON' 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to update, refine and expand by 675 words.)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission on Friday
approved the proposed merger of Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp.,
clearing the final obstacle to the creation of the nation's largest
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which will be called Verizon once the deal is
closed later this month, will control a third of the nation's local
telephone market, some 63 million local lines, plus 25 million cell
phone customers, in 40 states. It is the latest in a series of
mergers and acquisitions that has put the nation's telephone and
high-speed Internet system in the hands of a few huge corporations
that are planning to offer consumers a variety of services from
cable television to cell phone and local and long-distance calling.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators say they have approved every deal in the
frenzied consolidation of the industry in the hopes that a few
telecommunications giants would have the capital and expertise to
quickly roll out new technologies, like high-speed Internet
service, at affordable prices for consumers. But consumer groups
have raised concerns that the domination of the industry by a
handful of colossal companies could ultimately prove costly to
consumers and discourage the kind of innovation and price wars that
accompany robust competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be those that will claim this merger brings us
closer to a re-emergence of Ma Bell,'' said William E. Kennard, the
chairman of the FCC. ``However, my support is predicated on the
applicants' enforceable commitments to open ... traditional local
markets to competitors, invest in new markets and accelerate
deployment of broadband technologies. The end result should produce
more competition, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Bell Atlantic and GTE vowed Friday that, for their
current customers, the conditions imposed on the company will yield
economies of scale and lower prices, permitting Verizon to offer
packages of services _ wireless and wired telephone service as well
as high-speed Internet _ on one bill. Government officials also
said that the deal would promote competition both inside and
outside the markets dominated by Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC recognizes that this merger uniquely combines
complementary assets that will generate enormous public-interest
benefits,'' said Ivan G. Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive
of Bell Atlantic. ``We look forward to creating the next great
brand in communications, one that will set the standard for global
communications companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But disputing the government and companies, consumer groups
warned that the deal, along with other telecommunications mergers,
would dampen competition in a field in which many customers already
face few choices, higher prices for some services and largely
unregulated monopolies. They noted that as a result of this latest
deal, two companies, Verizon and SBC Communications Inc., would now
control 69 percent of the nation's telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being positioned to compete against each other, six
of the eight equal-sized local telephone monopolies have been
consolidated into two super-regional fortress monopolies, Bell
Atlantic and SBC,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union. ``They are virtually
insulated from a broad-based competitive threat. With telephone
companies merging rather than competing, and cable companies
expanding their dominance over television into new high-speed
interactive Internet services, the law will not deliver on its
promise of broad-based competition and lower prices for
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The approval of the two-year-old deal had been expected for
months, but was delayed as regulators and lawyers for the companies
struggled over the difficult issue of permitting the consolidation
of a local telephone company, Bell Atlantic, with GTE, which has a
huge long-distance Internet business, Genuity. Federal regulations
restrict the local company from entering the long- distance
business.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty was that the companies had hoped to keep control
of as much as possible of Genuity, a fast-growing Internet
business, while government officials and rivals said that such
control by the nation's largest local telephone carrier would
violate the law. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 provides that a
regional Bell company may offer long-distance service only when its
local market is sufficiently competitive, a test that Bell Atlantic
has satisfied only in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that obstacle, the FCC rejected a series of proposals
by the companies that government officials concluded would have
given Verizon too much control in Genuity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan that was ultimately approved, Verizon will
shortly spin off most of its interest in Genuity in a public stock
offering, keeping a 9.5 percent interest. Should Verizon manage to
open its local telephone markets within the next five years, it
would be able to exercise an option to control 80 percent of
Genuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, the sticking point was that we wanted a path back
to this asset,'' Seidenberg said in a teleconference with reporters
Friday afternoon. ``The FCC's interest was sufficient divestiture
of control. The commission did what it had to do and we did what we
had to do and that's how we got to where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivals including AT&AMP;T and smaller competitors had sought through
months of lobbying to block the merger, and federal officials say
they would not be surprised if one of the rivals filed a lawsuit
seeking to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which on Thursday completed its $44 billion acquisition of
MediaOne to become the nation's largest cable company, issued a
statement Friday night saying that it would carefully review the
FCC order before deciding whether to take any further action.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg said that Verizon plans to seek permission soon to
enter the long-distance business in Massachusetts and New Jersey,
and Pennsylvania after that. He said the company hopes to be in a
position to seek approval to offer long distance in Maryland and
Virginia by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to promote competition in other regions of the
country, the FCC ordered Verizon to enter new markets within three
years or make what officials described as voluntary payments of up
to $750 million to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman of Consumers Unions said that the voluntary nature of
the penalties made that provision meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust officials at the Justice Department approved the
proposed merger last year after the companies agreed to sell one of
their two interests in overlapping wireless phone systems in nine
states. The divestitures included holdings in Chicago, Houston,
Richmond, Va., and Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic emerged from the breakup of the old American
Telephone and Telegraph Co. in 1984 as the local phone monopoly for
the mid-Atlantic states. Shortly after the deregulation of the
telecommunications industry in 1996, Bell Atlantic acquired Nynex
Corp., which served most of the region between New York and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The GTE brand has its genesis in 1935, with the organization of
General Telephone Corp. After it merged with Sylvania in 1955, the
company became known as General Telephone and Electric, and two
decades later, it shortened its name to GTE.

 &HT;    Bush looks to Cheney for guidance in choosing running mate
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - George W. Bush's one-man vice presidential
search committee comes battle-tested and with mom's seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is ``as competent as they
come,'' Barbara Bush wrote in her diary on March 2, 1991, as the
success of Operation Desert Storm had become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems very laid back and reassuring. He does not have a Dr.
Strangelove image that so many of our secretaries of defense get,
whether they deserve it or not,'' Mrs. Bush wrote in the diary note
recounted in her autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a man who was President George Bush's second choice
_ to Texan John Tower, who failed to win Senate confirmation _ and
had never served in the military before becoming defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to steal from our congressional ranks,'' the
ex-president later wrote of his selection of Wyoming's only U.S.
House member, ``but I knew Dick would be accepted on the hill and
would do a great job. I was right on both counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the next Bush who wants to be president is counting heavily
on Cheney to help find the right running mate for the November
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I trust Dick Cheney's judgment; I know his character,'' Bush
said in announcing Cheney's assignment in April. ''It's obviously
an important decision for me and I can't think of a better person
to work with on making that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently said he talks with Cheney roughly once every four
days as the process continues.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, born in Nebraska and raised in Wyoming, arrived in
Washington in 1966 for a congressional fellowship. He advanced to
the Nixon White House, including a stint as deputy to White House
counselor Donald Rumsfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney worked on the transition team when Nixon resigned and
then-Vice President Gerald Ford took over, rising to chief of staff
in November 1975 at age 34, the youngest person to hold that key
post.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Carter ousted Ford in 1976, Cheney went home to
Wyoming as an investment adviser. He won a House seat in 1978 and
served six terms, suffering three heart attacks along the way.
Cheney developed a reputation as a moderate, though he supported
military aide to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the invasion of
Grenada and the bombing of Libya, and opposed the Equal Rights
Amendment and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the elder Bush tapped him for defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cheney became chairman of Halliburton Co., a
Dallas-based oil, engineering and construction firm, a job he gave
up in 1998 after a merger, but regained in February.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney toyed with the idea of running for president in 1996 but
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the search process, Cheney has demonstrated the trait
that Bush covets most _ loyalty _ by remaining tight-lipped about
any speculation on a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, there are many good candidates to choose from in
our party,'' Cheney said when he took the assignment. ``We will
look at them all. And we will make sure we have the best possible
ticket this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who has been a Bush adviser since the campaign was in
its embryonic stage, had been considered a potential running mate.
But he squelched that speculation when he became the search
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Halliburton stockholders at a May meeting in Dallas,
he said: ``I made a long-term commitment to the company and I have
absolutely no desire to go back to government.''

 &HT;    Advice from many, decision made by twoBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Behind closed doors, as quietly and deliberately
as possible, Gov. George W. Bush is exercising what could be the
most power granted to any one person in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In picking a running mate, Bush, who will be the GOP
presidential nominee, will have the one-man authority to grant
near-world leader status to the person of his choice.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, White House chief of staff under President Gerald
Ford, is Bush's one-man search committee. But Bush has made it
clear that he is the one-man selection committee. Though he said
the list of potential running mates is ``getting shorter,'' Bush
insists the criteria have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   He wants a running mate who is loyal, qualified to serve as
president and generally shares his political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   He talks names, publicly, only in the most general of ways.
Virtually anyone who has not publicly withdrawn from consideration
gets praise from Bush as someone worth review.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, says this decision is
being made above his level. If that's true, it's a new category for
Bush, who has trusted Rove for input on most decisions, including
the appointment of Texas Supreme Court justices and other top-level
officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that this is a process in which only
two people are involved: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney,'' Rove
said en route home from a five-day retreat with the candidate and
staff in Maine last week. ``How the process is shaped and who they
are talking to is known only to them, and maybe their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Also under consideration is when to make an announcement.
Revealing the name weeks before the Republican National Convention
(which begins July 31 in Philadelphia) could create some early
excitement, but it also would jump-start press scrutiny of the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the speculation has rotated among a small herd of
possible picks. Retired Gen. Colin Powell and Arizona Sen. John
McCain, favorites of many, have ruled themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating has confirmed that Bush asked him to
fill out a questionnaire. Others still under consideration include
Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin,
George Pataki of New York and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey;
Sens. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and
George Voinovich of Ohio; U.S. Reps. John Kasich of Ohio and
Christopher Cox of California; and former Red Cross President
Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides have been characteristically closed-mouth about the
process, but there is no shortage of tea leaves to read. Last year,
before selling his political company to go full-time with the
campaign, Rove bought a long list of Web domain names, including
BushEngler.net, BushRidge.net, BushWhitman.net and BushPataki.net.
He also bought the .org version of each name.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign now cautions against assuming that Engler,
Ridge, Pataki or Whitman are pre-ordained for the No. 2 slot.
Spokesman Ray Sullivan said the names were gobbled up by an
``overzealous'' staffer who had been told to reserve a number of
``Bush-related domain names.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bush headquarters in downtown Austin, the files are not short
on outside advice.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to Bush, conservative leader Paul Weyrich
said Bush's selection criteria ``are vague enough that those of us
on the outside have few clues as to who you have in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Weyrich declined to recommend a candidate
``because any candidate so designated by any of us publicly would
soon become a target. You would be accused of caving in to us if
you selected someone we named.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weyrich urged Bush to pick someone who can energize the
``conservative coalition.'' And he urged Bush to look above for
guidance in picking the candidate below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Holy Spirit grants the sort of wisdom required to
make such an extraordinary decision. He is waiting to be asked,''
Weyrich concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The advice to stick with a conservative came as former President
Ford urged Bush to balance the ticket by choosing someone who
supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need, as I've said repeatedly, a team that reflects
the broadest possible spectrum of the Republican philosophy,'' Ford
told the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk sparked reaction from people like Merrill
Matthews Jr. of the American Conservative Union, who believes a
ticket should be balanced by experience, not ideology. That means
Bush, a state politician, needs a running mate with Washington
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign knows that,'' Matthews concluded, ``which is
why concern over Bush picking someone like Gov. Tom Ridge is
misplaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge presents an interesting potential dilemma. He will be the
homestate governor when the Republicans gather in Philadelphia for
their national convention. But his support of abortion rights puts
him out of step with Bush (who has said no single issue would be a
litmus test) and his party's platform.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, a Catholic, has been barred by the bishop in his hometown
of Erie, from speaking at Catholic events in that part of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Ridge, Weyrich said in his open letter to
Bush that ``a VP candidate who is perceived to be pro-abortion will
produce a noisy and divisive walkout'' at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   That could make for bad TV. And TV is what a national convention
is all about.
</P>
<P>
   MANY PETITIONS, ONE VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Though picking a running mate may be the most undemocratic part
of democracy, there are plenty of amateurs trying to petition or
lobby their favorite candidate onto the ballot. The files of the
Bush campaign include input from folks convinced they have just the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, The BplusK Committee will deliver petitions it hopes
will bear more than 25,000 signatures from people who want Bush to
pick Kasich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a Bush-Kasich ticket can win the election and
provide responsible leadership for our country,'' Larry Emmet,
director of BplusK, told the Bush campaign in a recent letter
seeking a meeting with Bush and Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the files is correspondence from American Women
Presidents, a Sacramento-based group urging both major parties to
put a female on the ticket. The group recently sent petitions, with
1,400 signatures, to both campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bush insists he does not make major decisions by
reading polls, there is no shortage of surveys about potential
running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Most independent polls show Republicans' favorites are Powell,
McCain and Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the top three, polls indicate a scrambled field.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Powell and McCain on the not-me list last week was
former Missouri Sen. John Danforth, who enjoyed a brief run in the
spotlight. No thanks, Danforth said last week after he and wife
Sally pondered how life might change.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he awoke recently
in the middle of the night with the memory of a long-ago visit from
then-Secretary of State George Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of Secret Service people standing in our
back yard in the dark, and I remembered that,'' Danforth said.
``It's the fact that if you do that (high level of a) job, it
crowds out everything else in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   And in some cases, being No. 2 can mean a reduction in political
power. In 1988, then-Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas shocked some of
his staffers by accepting Michael Dukakis' invitation on to the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had independence and power as chairman of the (Senate)
finance committee. I was surprised when he agreed to run,'' said
former longtime Bentsen aide Jack DeVore.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis-Bentsen lost to Bush-Quayle, but Bentsen easily won
re-election to the Senate. The experience, according to DeVore,
offered an insightful look at the running mate selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can figure out how it gets done until you
get to the one guy who makes the decision. It varies widely from
person to person,'' he said. ``In many ways you are campaigning for
an office in an election and there is only one voter. It's hard to
figure it out.''

   URUAPAN, Mexico _ His hair is shot through with gray, his
shoulders slope, and his ravine jowls have grown even deeper. But
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the battle horse leader of the leftist
opposition, is running for president for the third time. And
despite the long odds, his determination seems unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   After months when Cardenas' stolid campaign seemed stalled, it
has picked up steam. He is still well behind the two leading
candidates. But because of the peculiar arithmetic of three-way
politics here, Cardenas' surge has made him the pivotal player in
the most contested presidential race in Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   His gain mainly takes votes away from Vicente Fox, who is also
battling to oust the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as
the PRI, from the presidency that it has controlled for seven
decades. Because polls show that Fox is locked in a tie with the
candidate of the governing party, Francisco Labastida, Cardenas'
pull on opposition voters could be just enough to cost Fox the
election on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And if Cardenas threw any support to Fox, he could tip the
balloting the other way.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas has disdained the idea of exercising his kingmaking
powers. Instead, he is tenaciously riding his campaign bus from
village to village, just as if he were on the cusp of victory,
pitching his nationalist platform, opposing free trade and
showering rebuke equally on his two rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have seen me in the these lands for 40 years, always
maintaining the same principles,'' Cardenas, 66, said before an
eager crowd of farm workers in straw cowboy hats jammed into the
quaint square of this rural city. ``I come to you exactly as I am,
and I say exactly what I believe. I have never moved from my
positions, because they represent the majority of the Mexican
people.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas made his first presidential run in 1988, after he had
defected as a reformist rebel from the PRI and had generated a
wildfire popular movement against its corruption. Many Mexicans say
that they believe that Cardenas really won that election but that
PRI vote-rigging stole it from him in favor of Carlos Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Cardenas placed a lackluster third. But three years
later, he became the first opposition mayor of Mexico City, the
post he left for his current effort.
</P>
<P>
   In that first presidential race, Cardenas discovered his style
as an anticandidate, and he has been running that way since then.
He distrusts television and hesitates, against advisers' pleas, to
shape his campaign to feed its habits. Late at night, long after
the newscasts, he holds teeming rallies. He is the opposite of
telegenic, because his demeanor is formal and his natural
expression is a furious frown. While Fox and Labastida rushed in
early to fill the airwaves with trendy commercials, Cardenas moved
only recently to produce modern-toned spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political ads can't govern Mexico!'' he railed in one speech
from the stump.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it was television that gave him the recent lift.
Cardenas was the moderator of a testy spontaneous encounter among
himself, Fox and Labastida late last month that was carried live
for more than two hours nationwide. Cardenas won the argument,
about whether or not to hold a formal televised debate, and he also
cracked several jokes at Fox's expense, the first time that
Mexicans could recall him being funny in public.
</P>
<P>
   When the three candidates finally met to debate on May 25,
Cardenas gave another spirited performance that further helped his
showing in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   A poll on June 5 by Reforma, the newspaper, showed that Cardenas
had risen to 17 percent of voter preferences, up from 12 percent in
April. Several polls show Fox and Labastida tied at around 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Cardenas' defense of his leftist convictions has
done little to build his popularity. During three days of
whistle-stops in Michoacan, an agricultural state here in central
Mexico, he called repeatedly for the release of jailed student
strikers from the national university, saying they were political
prisoners. But Mexicans, especially the working class, were
outspoken in their disapproval of the strike that paralyzed the
most important public university for nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Although opinion surveys show that crime is a burning issue,
Cardenas pledged to disband a new federal police force created to
confront the problem, calling it a repressive unit.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Michoacan villagers by the thousands poured out to
hear Cardenas and gathered in unscheduled rallies along his route,
blocking the road to make him stop and visit. His followers are
devoted less to his positions than to his persona, as the son of
Lazaro Cardenas, a beloved president in the 1930s who was from
Michoacan; as the standard-bearer for the faltering welfare state,
as a politician who has long battled the PRI and as a man who does
not cut his suit to fit political fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does what he says,'' said Rafaela Vazquez de Herrera, 60, a
farm woman who prepared a beef stew for the candidate's lunch. ``He
sees a poor person who is down and lifts him up.''

<P>
   In one town, the crowd lifted him on to a dappled grey walking
horse and marched behind him through the streets. In another,
supporters jammed a square in the shadow of a mighty statue of his
father to chant: ``Down with the system! Throw out the PRI!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a passionate speech in Uruapan (pronounced oor-WAH-pan),
Cardenas ruled out renouncing his candidacy at the last minute or
making any other effort to help Fox, who represents the
right-of-center National Action Party. After a volley of attacks he
had aimed at Fox days earlier, his exasperated opponent accused
Cardenas of ``betraying himself and many Mexicans who believed in
him,'' and even disparaged Cardenas' mother, a breach of etiquette
that signaled a permanent break between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The rift has caused a painful dilemma for Mexicans who are fed
up with the PRI, especially those on the left. Fox's strategists
have appealed for their support, arguing that a vote for Cardenas
is tantamount to a vote for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend that Cardenas does not grasp the damage
that he is causing for the opposition's larger anti-PRI cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt the experience of winning in 1988, and it traumatized
him,'' a political expert, Jose Antonio Crespo, said. ``He is
stuck. He has not been able to measure the enormous changes in
Mexico since then.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas said he has no fear that history will judge him
harshly as having deprived the opposition of its best chance to
unseat the world's longest-governing party. His first concern, he
insisted, is to build the base of his own Democratic Revolutionary
Party. And although Fox is conducting his campaign as a wholesale
political assault on the PRI, Cardenas said Fox's positions are not
really different from those of the governing party.

   MEXICO CITY _ The two leading opposition candidates for the
presidency, Vicente Fox Quesada and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, joined
Friday in a pact to defend the balloting on July 2 against fraud.
They agreed that their parties would work together to monitor the
voting and report vote buying. The accord included a minor
candidate, Manuel Camacho Solis.

<P>
   MILCH-TV (Los Angeles) _ On the face of it, David Milch, who is
the co-creator and architect of ``NYPD Blue, '' lives an affluent,
somewhat predictable life. He works out at a fancy sports club, has
a summer estate in Martha's Vineyard and dotes on his wife, Rita
and their three children. But the 55-year-old Emmy Award-winning
writer is also a heroin addict and alcoholic, a compulsive gambler,
a man who once destroyed a police car's roof lights with a shotgun
blast, spent time in a Mexican jail and came close to death several
times. By Bernard Weinraub.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MACBETH-THEATER (London) _ Antony Sher is the first to
acknowledge that the majority of ``Macbeth'' productions don't
work. Added to that was his first exposure to the text, as a
schoolboy, where, the actor said, ``It was taught appallingly, so I
had no real experience of it.'' It is easy, then, to imagine the
mixture of excitement and trepidation with which Sher and his
director approached the play when they chose to revive it for the
Royal Shakespeare Company last November. The production went on to
be praised as the RSC's best in decades and is now moving to the
United States. By Matt Wolf. &QL;

   CHILDS-THEATER (New York) _ In the middle of Kirsten Childs'
first musical, ``The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,''
which opens on June 20, the main character auditions for a famous
choreographer of sexy musicals called Director Bob. ``You're a
sweet kid, and you've got an irresistible smile,'' Bob tells her.
``So let's try that monologue one more time. But this time, don't
go white on me.'' More than two decades ago, Kirsten Childs
auditioned for the famous choreographer Bob Fosse for a role in the
touring company of ``Chicago.'' Fosse, as Childs recalls it, never
explicitly said she wasn't black enough, ``It was just implied.''

   INTIMATE-MOVIES (Undated) _ What makes a movie intimate? The
word suggests sex and romance on one hand or small, earnest,
slice-of-life films on the other. But intimacy in movies has less
to do with subject than with subjectivity, the filmmakers' and the
characters. By Karen Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   APARTMENT-FILM (Undated) _ Forty years ago, Billy Wilder's ``The
Apartment'' and Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' opened the same week
_ the kind of double whammy that reminds us we now live in
impoverished times. Each is an American classic, although ``The
Apartment'' has barely been acknowledged as such. By Graham Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   SATIRE-FILM (Undated) _ Why do movie audiences squirm and
critics pay scant attention when a gloves-off satire of our tabloid
television culture is brought to the screen? Is it that we're
inured to satire by living in a society where grotesque reality
(Monicagate, the Anita Hill hearings) seems to trump fiction at
every turn? Or can savage mockery of our bottom-feeding popular
culture shame us enough to arouse discomfort? Or have we became so
arrogant and thick-skinned in our prosperity that needling humor is
incapable of penetrating anyone's gold-plated hides? By Stephen
Holden.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DANCE-COMPETITION (Undated) _ Competition is the lifeblood of
sports, where players are asked to put aside their personalities to
serve a goal that can be represented statistically. In the
performing arts, however, where audiences and critics reward
spontaneity and emotional risk, and where standards of excellence
are intensely personal and organic, competition can be hell. By
Mindy Aloff.
</P>
<P>
   JAFFE-DANCE (Undated) _ Susan Jaffe, the luminous classical
ballerina with the flashing turquoise eyes, gets straight to the
point. ``It's neat that I've lasted this long,'' she says.
Longevity is admirable, particularly in a profession where careers
are notoriously short. Two decades spent in the same company,
American Ballet Theater, is also estimable. But to many people,
what has made Ms. Jaffe's career so remarkable was her breathtaking
transformation from a pleasing, technically proficient dancer with
an easy extension into a powerful dramatic artist and dancer of
amazing classical purity. By Terry Trucco.
</P>
<P>
   WHELAN-DANCE (New York) _ Wendy Whelan is the most American of
ballerinas. Tall and thin, unself-consciously inscrutable and
unstoppable-seeming, the New York City Ballet principal dances with
a tangy lack of adornment that is seldom found in Europe. But she
is also something of a mystery, a quintessentially American colt of
a dancer who has suddenly grown into a ballerina of new depth and
dramatic power. By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MOZART-DUET-MUSIC (Undated) _ What's in a name? If the name is
Mozart, plenty. The playbill for the premiere of the ``brand new
heroic-comic opera'' ``Der Stein der Weisen, oder Die Zauberinsel''
(``The Philosophers' Stone, or The Enchanted Island'') in 1790,
listed as author Emanuel Schikaneder, but no composer. The New
Grove Dictionary of Opera credited the score to Benedikt Schack and
Franz Xaver Gerl, noting that one comic duet was orchestrated ``and
perhaps partly composed'' by Mozart. The existence of the duet and
its attribution never sufficed to raise the opera from the
obscurity in which it had lain since its last known performance, in
1814. Fortune smiled in 1997. By Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   GROOVEBOX-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Roland MC-505 Groovebox, a small
programmable synthesizer, is an impressive musical plaything. It
has been called a ``band in a box,'' capable of producing a wild
variety of vintage keyboard sounds, as well as the trademark thuds
and thumps of some of the most popular rhythm machines of all time,
including Roland's 303 bass synthesizer and its 808 and 909 beat
boxes. While those instruments have been out of production since
the early 1980s they remain the objects of a fervid cult among
dance music cognoscenti. By Jody Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   DOWLAND-MUSIC (Undated) _ After successfully combining the jazz
saxophonist Jan Garbarek with the Hilliard Ensemble, ECM Records
now sets its sights on music of the great Elizabethan lute-song
composer John Dowland. The project began as a conventional Dowland
recital by John Potter and Stephen Stubbs, the lutenist and
director of the group Tragicomedia. But Manfred Eicher, ECM's
founder and producer, persuaded Potter and Stubbs to broaden their
interpretive horizons. What results, ``In Darkness Let Me Dwell,''
is a rarity: a crossover project that is both defensible and
listenable. By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   COCTEAU-MUSIC (Undated) _ One of the most wide-ranging artists
of the 20th century, playwright, painter, essayist and filmmaker
Jean Cocteau re-defined the term eclectic. How fitting, then, that
the Criterion Collection's important new release of the three films
that make up Cocteau's ``Orphic Trilogy'' also touches on the many
facets of Cocteau's artistic makeup (VHS, $29.95 each; DVD, a
three-disc box set, 225 minutes, $79.95). By Kevin Filipski.

   CONTE-SECRET-MUSEUM (Undated) _ ``And now to western Formosa and
a song for the gathering of tea,'' intones a calm, sonorous voice
during an installment of ``The Secret Museum of the Air,'' which
may just be the most singular world music show on radio. The
selection was part of ``Herds and Pastures,'' a program in which
listeners heard a Peruvian Indian song recorded by an Yma Sumac
sound-alike, a choral ode to the Sumatran rice goddess, a tune
featuring the Serbian bagpipe and what the host considers ``some of
the most emotional yodeling on record.'' The idiosyncratic voice
belongs to Pat Conte, and the vintage discs from which his shows
are culled belong to what he calls ``The Secret Museum of
Mankind.'' By Jon Kalish.

   HARVARD-BSCHOOL (Boston) _ The Harvard Business School, the West
Point of big business, has transformed itself to maintain its
dominance in the new economy. Its general management course has
been replaced with ``the entrepreneurial manager'' and it has so
many initiatives in Silicon Valley, where Stanford, its rival, is
pre-eminent, that it's almost a satellite campus. The
transformation involves some significant risks. By David

   HARVARD-BUSH (Undated) _ For the first time in its 92 years of
training corporate presidents, the Harvard Business School has a
chance to claim the ultimate chief executive, the president of the
United States. John Solomon, also a Harvard Business School
graduate, writes that George W. Bush's style _ generalist, big
picture, highly delegative _ is the archetypal Harvard Business
School-trained manager. Is the world ready for a Harvard MBA as
president? After all the generals and lawyers, one of Bush's

   WAVE-RISK (Marengo, Ill.) _ Infatuated with a tiny Nasdaq stock
called Wave Systems, two brothers caught the ride of their lives.
David and Douglas McCoy were just two of many ``wavoids'' who road
the stock from $1 to $50. One day it was a $500,000 gain and
shopping for Porsches; the next selling the Honda to meet margin
calls. Their experience is used to discuss the arguments for
diversifying, the little-known fact that the federal clearing house
can raise margin requirements on risky ventures, the difficulties
of transferring accounts and the eternal search for the next
Microsoft. By Danny Hakim &QL;

   NKOREA-SYRIA-REVIEW (Washington) _ It was pure coincidence that
presidential succession in Syria and the rapprochement between
North and South Korea took place the same day. But there were
profound similarities in what was happening. Both North Korea and
Syria are relics of another age _ dictatorships where power has
been based internally on terror and externally on hostility to
neighbors. In both places, power has passed from a dictator to his
son, and the son shows signs of a more modern, outward-looking
approach to solving his country's problems. Perhaps that can make
the world more peaceful. But there is also the disquieting feeling
that it won't be easy; terror and isolation remain hallmarks of the
systems in which these two sons rule. By Elaine Sciolono. (Moving

   SCIENTISTS-SECRECY-REVIEW (Undated) _ As secrets on nuclear
terrorism and miniaturized warheads apparently slip out of Los
Alamos National Laboratory and other federal labs, the message here
would seem to be obvious: do not give dangerous secrets to
scientists. There is a flaw in this solution. Governments need the
scientists and their culture of openness to produce weapons that
are worth keeping secret in the first place. That in a nutshell, is
why science and secrecy have clashed. By James Glanz. (Moving in

   ECON-POLITICS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Politics is still catching
up with prosperity. After decades in which the two parties fought
over how to slice up a shrinking pie and maneuvered to claim credit
for periodic good news, they now operate in a climate in which
economic strength seems a given and the biggest issue is not a
scarcity of money but a surfeit. By Richard Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-PLATFORMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Conventional wisdom holds
that party platforms are archaic. But many experts say platforms
can be revealing documents. At a time when everything else is so
stage-managed, poll-driven and homogenized in politics, platforms
are where the activists often have their say. This can be
troublesome for the nominees. By Robin Toner.

<P>
   STUDENT-SORTING-REVIEW (Undated) _ Lusting after the academic
successes of European and Japanese schoolchildren, American
educators in recent years have imported the idea of a rigorous
system of tests, which other countries use to cull the elite from
the merely literate. But educators here insisted that America,
being the land of second chances, would instead use testing to snap
schools to attention, forcing them to raise standards for everyone.
They would lift up, not weed out. But the evidence so far suggests
that schools here are doing the very sort of gardening they
promised to avoid, employing tests to sort children, and at a far
earlier age than elsewhere. By Kate Zernike.

   IMMIGRATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Just a few years ago, lawmakers
were in full cry about the supposed dangers of immigration _ from
crime to welfare cheats to lost jobs. Yet now Congress is poised to
pass a bill that would grant visas to tens of thousands more
temporary high-tech workers from abroad. An unlikely coalition of
business and immigrants rights groups is pushing to fling the door

   SCOTUS-HMOS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Patients may be wondering

rationing, the court said, is intrinsic to design and mission of

   RUSSIA-POLITICS-REVIEW (Moscow) _ By any standard measure of
democracy, political opposition is just what Russia desperately
needs. But until last week, President Vladimir Putin didn't have
any. Now, with the jailing of Vladimir Gusinsky, Putin may have
actually stirred up some real opposition, setting the stage for an
acid test of Russia's young democracy: how is the opposition to
act, and how will it be treated? By Celestine Bohlen.

   MONTENEGRO-REVIEW (Washington) _ To hear some in NATO talk,
Montenegro _ the last republic of Tito's Yugoslavia remains
alongside Serbia in today's rump Yugoslavia _ is the unsinkable
aircraft carrier in the West's unfinished war against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. But last week, the carrier was given
a significant holing by Montenegro's voters, a sizable minority of
whom want to remain inside Yugoslavia. By Steve Erlanger.

FOR CHIEFS, MORE PRESSURE TO PERFORM (OR ELSE) 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Firing workers, like capital punishment, is applauded in
America. Just the announcement of a mass downsizing in the
mid-1990s would raise a company's stock price. Now that happens
when a chief executive's head rolls. A faltering company seems
somehow cleansed.
</P>
<P>
   We even have a self-appointed scorekeeper: Challenger, Gray &AMP;
Christmas, a Chicago firm that helps companies find new jobs for
workers they lay off. As a sideline, Challenger in the 1990s began
tracking layoff announcements and issuing grim monthly tallies. In
the current robust economy, mass layoffs are way down and out of
fashion. Shedding the chief executive is increasingly popular, and
Challenger began last August to keep this new score.
</P>
<P>
   The total through June 15 was 706 chiefs of publicly owned
companies, an average of 15 a week. Some retired in the usual way
or jumped to better jobs, but the vast majority were dismissed.
Durk Jager's ouster from Procter &AMP; Gamble on June 8 was departure
No. 36 this month, and the toll has since risen to 48.
</P>
<P>
   More formal studies confirm the trend. One found that 40 percent
of new chief executives lose their jobs within 18 months. Another,
by Rakesh Khurana at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
found that for the same poor performance, a chief executive was
three times as likely to be fired in 1996 than in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking them to pitch no-hitters every day,'' said John
Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray. The game, in sum,
rides entirely on the pitcher, not on the other players or on
field-tested team strategies. As Peter Cappelli, a management
professor at the Wharton School, put it: ``We are substituting
people for strategy. Instead of working out plans and goals,
directors look at another company that is doing what they think
they want to do, and they hire an executive from that company and
hope'' he will do the same for them.
</P>
<P>
   Failure is defined as two or three quarters in which profits
fail to rise at a 15 percent annual rate, and the stock price fails
to keep up with the expectations of the bull market. That was the
background music for Jager's departure. Or a new chief executive
fails to bring about a merger or reorganization. Four out of five
directors expect their chief executives to lead in this direction,
according to surveys by the National Association of Corporate
Directors.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the tears, of course. Ordinary workers, even middle
managers, are lucky if they walk away from a downsizing with enough
in savings and severance to support their families for a year. The
chief executives depart with enough not only for their families but
their descendants for several generations. Knowing the high risk of
being fired, they negotiate huge pay and severance packages,
granted by the very directors who will later do the firing.
</P>
<P>
   Just 25 years ago, a typical American chief executive was deeply
entrenched. His cronies dominated the board, his company made money
despite its inefficiencies and he resisted change. The rise of
corporate raiders and leveraged buyouts brought an end to such
inertia, and the increasingly powerful financial markets took
control of most boards; today, directors are more likely than not
to speak for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, if a big institutional shareholder like a pension
or mutual fund did not like management, it sold the stock. Now it
presses the board to drop the chief executive. Instead of being
deeply rooted, the boss sways on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   Is that an improvement? Probably, said Cappelli _ provided that
directors become more committed, participate in strategic planning
and shift more management authority to lower levels. Above all,
they must be patient, giving the chief executive time to carry out
a strategy, even if profits and the stock price do not quickly
respond. The Eaton Corp. behaved this way, according to Stephen
Hardis, who will retire next month at 65 after five years as chief
executive. ``My predecessor owned the board,'' he said. ``My board
owned me. But they always gave me a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   New technologies and product innovation force companies today
into constant, risky change. Eaton manufactures auto and truck
parts and transmissions, and in the Hardis years, the product line
was redesigned to add electronic controls. The process involved the
kind of staff upheaval that might have brought a chief down
elsewhere. ``You cannot change a company without changing people,''
Hardis said.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders, then, whether Durk Jager, who led Procter &AMP; Gamble
for just 17 months, lacked skills, or the board lacked patience.
``When I read about Jager,'' he said, ``I wondered if it would make
other chief executives more risk averse. If you have to
fundamentally reshape a business, it takes time, and makes people
unhappy.''

SERB OPPOSITION LEADER SAYS MILOSEVIC ORDERED ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDVA, Yugoslavia _ Vuk Draskovic, a Serbian opposition leader,
returned Friday to his home here in Montenegro, the scene of his
close scrape with death Thursday night, and accused President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia of ordering an assassination
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certain they did it,'' he said of Serbian secret
services, ``and also it is certain that if there was a decision to
kill me, the Serbian government would know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the shooting attack that left him slightly
injured, he said, he had been warned by a contact in the Serbian
government that an attempt on his life was being planned.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Friday evening that they had arrested suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police are in possession of the attack weapon and are holding
the persons who carried it out, together with those who assisted
them,'' said Vuk Boskovic, Montenegro's deputy interior minister.
``But we also know who ordered this crime.'' The identifies of the
men would be disclosed on Saturday, he told Montenegrin state
television in the capital, Podgorica, adding that the men had
followed Draskovic from Serbia to carry out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his vacation home in Budva after his release from a
hospital, Draskovic looked tired and strained, wearing dressings on
wounds to his right temple and left ear. ``I felt two bullets,'' he
said. ``One made a hole in my ear and the other one hit me when I
was falling down.''
</P>
<P>
   One or more gunmen fired five or six bullets through the
shutters into his living room, where he was sitting watching
television, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As leader of the Serbian Renewal Party, Draskovic is the most
important political opponent to Milosevic and as such represents a
threat to his power. Still, the attack came at a low in Draskovic's
fortunes, when his campaign to force Milosevic out of office by
peaceful protest or elections appears to be faltering.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting in this small seaside resort has nevertheless
caused grave concern among Montenegrin officials, who see it as
another step in an effort by Belgrade to destabilize its smaller
partner republic in the Yugoslav Federation. The shooting of
Draskovic, who had sought the protection of the Montenegrin
government, came just two weeks after the killing of Goran Zugic, a
security adviser and close friend of Montenegro's president, Milo
Djukanovic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Montenegro's interior minister, Vukasin Maras, sat beside
Draskovic as he spoke with reporters, and denounced the attack as
one not only on Draskovic but also on democracy and Montenegro,
which has been trying to distance itself from the Belgrade
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who think that by shooting at Vuk Draskovic they are
achieving anything are making a mistake,'' Maras said. ``This will
only give more strength to democracy in Montenegro.''
</P>
<P>
   The two shooting attacks, he said, showed that the police had to
be more aware that the recent increase of violence in Serbia was
now transferring itself to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the series of disparate killings in Serbia
that have seen at least one high-level figure gunned down every
month this year, including Yugoslav Defense Minister Pavle
Bulatovic and the paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic, better
known as Arkan.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has denied any involvement in the death of Zugic.
Yugoslav Information Minister Goran Matic blamed it on a plot
orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency and an internal
power struggle within Montenegro. Maras denied that scenario
vigorously Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As Draskovic described the shooting, there were two bullet holes
in the wall above the sofa where he sat, and several more holes
marked the wall to the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw myself to the ground, rolled over and crawled up the
steps,'' he said, showing how he had scrambled into the adjoining
kitchen area and sought cover behind a pillar. There was a trail of
blood on the floor to the front door he used to escape to a
neighbor's home.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said he had received a warning from a high-level
contact in the Serbian government a few days ago that an ``order''
had gone out to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Moscow also knew about this,'' he added. He did not
explain further, but last month he visited Moscow with other
opposition politicians and met with Foreign Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warnings, it appears that he had dispensed with the
police security provided by the Montenegrin government during his
few days in Budva. His personal bodyguards were not on hand because
they had been arrested recently in Belgrade, charged with not
having permission to carry weapons.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Danica, who flew from their home in Belgrade to be
with her husband, blamed Montenegrin authorities for failing to
protect him. But Draskovic appeared to admit that he had allowed
the lapse in security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were probably following me,'' he said of his attackers.
``They probably knew I do not like security. I was here working
alone for two or three days and they saw I was on my own and saw
the opportunity for an attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely clear they will try to attack again, and will
attack other people,'' he said. ``This is the way they rule,
without laws or constitution. In Serbia it is a worse situation. It
is like the postwar years of 1946 to 1947,'' he said, a reference
to the postwar communist purges under Tito.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Draskovic, 53, has intensified since last
October, when four members of his political party, including his
brother-in-law and his security chief, were killed in a collision
between their car and a truck in Serbia. Draskovic insists that
Milosevic was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   In May the government took over the Belgrade television station
run by the opposition-led city government, apparently another move
against Draskovic and his party.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic had no doubts as to who was behind the attempt against
her husband. ``Slobodan Milosevic and Mira Markovic, who else?''
she asked, referring to the Yugoslav president and his wife. ``I
think they will repeat themselves until they finish their work.''

THE HARVARD FAST TRACK: FROM INCORPORATION TO FUNDING IN 4 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use on Sunday, June 18) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ There is little unusual about a pair of
ambitious students trying to start their own Internet business
these days. Relatively few of them, however, have access to
anything that resembles the Harvard Business School network of
37,000 living, schmoozing alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the story of Tania Yannas and Benjamin Gordon, two
aspiring entrepreneurs who graduated from the business school
earlier this month. Their path to the campus was typical: first an
Ivy League college, then a job in consulting or investment banking.
During their first week of business school, in January 1999, they
found themselves in assigned seats next to each other in a
``section,'' as Harvard students call it, of an organizational
behavior class.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, Gordon, lanky and intense, was telling
Yannas of his ambitions to create a company; by the start of their
second year, he had written a summary of what the business would
look like. His great-grandfather had started a horse-and-buggy
business in New York in 1904, and his grandfather founded and still
runs a truck-leasing business in New England. Gordon had worked
there during college and had done some transportation consulting
before coming to business school. So he imagined a
business-to-business Web site that would allow shipping agents to
communicate better with both truckers and shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon showed the summary to Yannas, a former McKinsey &AMP; Co.
consultant, who agreed to join him, and they approached Lynda M.
Applegate, a management professor at Harvard. Applegate arranged
for them to meet for 15 minutes with Dave P. Perry _ a co-founder
of ChemDex, a business-to-business Web-based company (now part of
the Ventro Corp.), and a member of the Harvard Business School
class of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perry was intrigued, the students said, and he agreed to serve
as an adviser _ so long as he could buy a stake in their company,
called 3Plex.
</P>
<P>
   Then things really began to move quickly. Carl S. Sloane, the
professor who had taught the class where Gordon and Yannas first
met, put them in touch with several transportation executives,
three of whom are now on 3Plex's advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Two bankers with Harvard MBAs _ one at Morgan Stanley and one at
Goldman Sachs _ read in a venture-capital newsletter about Perry's
investment in the company, and they called Gordon. That led the
banks to take equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   By May, when the company took second place in the school's
annual business plan competition, it had 18 employees and was
operating out of a former furniture showroom just off Harvard
Square here in Cambridge. Gordon and Yannas, meanwhile, were joking
that their neglect of their schoolwork might prevent them from
graduating.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has turned 30, and they are wary of seeming like kids
competing against logistics companies with decades of experience.
They note, for example, that they are the only Harvard MBAs at the
company and that 3Plex has since hired executives from large
transportation companies like the Penske Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But the founders are aware of the school's importance to their
efforts. ``There's an HBS keiretsu of funding, customers and
advisers,'' Gordon said. ``We were able to go from incorporation to
two rounds of funding in four months largely because of the value
the Harvard Business School network was able to provide us.''
</P>
<P>
   The value extends well beyond the executive suites of large
companies, alumni say, and well beyond students' two years in
Boston. The business school gives its graduates lifetime e-mail
addresses, allowing them easy contact with one another. Harvard
says 20 percent of the partners at major venture-capital firms hold
Harvard MBAs. Their familiarity with one another helped fill the
initial board seats at Amazon.com, eBay and dozens of other
Internet companies with Harvard alumni, said William Sahlman, a
Harvard professor of entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you peel back who financed all these things,'' Sahlman
said, ``you'll see networked relationships that were started in
sections.'' &QL;

A JOB RECOMMENDATION FOR GORE AND BUSH FROM THEIR FORMER TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Texas, Tenn.)  (For use on Sunday, June 18) 
 By JOHN SOLOMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bonnie Reece answered the phone, I told her I wanted to
speak to her husband about his former student who now was running
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't teach George Bush,'' she corrected me. ``He taught
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned my call, Jim Reece, a professor of accounting
and operations management at the University of Michigan Business
School, explained that Gore was a student in his calculus class in
the 1964-65 academic year at the St. Albans School in Washington.
Yes, he later taught at Harvard Business School, Reece said, but
George W. Bush had never been in his class. Still, he agreed to
check his files and call me back.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, Reece acknowledged that he might be the
only teacher to have taught the presidential candidates of both
major parties. He had found Bush's class card and photograph, with
a few notes in the margins; they helped jog his memory. ``I
remember George being a very friendly guy,'' he said, ``and a good
student.'' The class was an introduction to management accounting.
</P>
<P>
   In part, he better remembered teaching Gore because his St.
Albans class had only 13 students, versus 84 in Bush's section.
Also, it was Reece's rookie year as a teacher. ``You never forget
your first year in the classroom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before finding out about his unusual predicament, he was
undecided about how he would vote in November. But Reece,
accustomed to giving job recommendations for his students to
prospective employers, was willing to provide this reference to the
American people: ``Based on my experience teaching them, I don't
have any qualms about either being president.''

 &HT;    Four states key to presidential election
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When national Republicans gather Monday in Dayton
to talk about improving Social Security and the nation's schools,
they'll be trying to get the attention of voters like Dayton
elementary school principal Gwen Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis is among thousands of undecided voters across Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois whose support both Republican
George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore need to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Those four states from the industrial heartland are where the
election could be won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   Together they account for 84 of the 270 electoral votes needed
to get to the White House, and right now neither Bush nor Gore can
lay claim to any of them. The battleground for the 2000 campaign
will be fought in places like Will County, Illinois; Lehigh County,
Pennsylvania; Macomb County, Mich., and Montgomery County, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The states are known for farms that grow corn and soybeans and
for factories that turn out steel and automobiles, but they also
regularly determine the winners in close presidential elections.
This year will be no different.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states _ California, Texas, Florida and New York _
have more electoral votes but considerably less suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South and Mountain West have basically been conceded to
Bush, and California and New York have basically been conceded to
Gore, so the heartland states like Ohio are it for these two
guys,'' said Allan Lichtman, history department chairman at
American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of Monday's hearing in Dayton is to gather
ideas on education and Social Security to be considered for the
party platform at the Republican National Convention this summer.
But party officials acknowledge they want to showcase their ideas
in a state considered crucial to winning back the White House,
occupied for the last eight years by Democrat Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons (Dayton) was chosen is so we can convey our
message to the people of the heartland, the people in Ohio,'' said
Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
``One of the things we can do to make it swing our way is to let
people know what we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, 59, the Dayton school principal, historically has not
been a swing voter. She has never voted for a Republican, but this
year she has an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   What the candidates have to say on education will help her
decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is my life and I'm not sure which guy is truly
committed to making our schools better,'' said Jarvis, whose
school, Residence Park, was closed at the end of the school year in
a budget-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   BIG FOUR ARE MICROCOSMS OF THE NATION
</P>
<P>
   No one state represents the nation as a whole. But the Big Four
industrial states provide a good window into the nation's cultural
and economic diversity, said Michael Barone, co-author of ``The
Almanac of American Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   These states all include big cities, small towns, suburbs, edge
cities, farms, factories and factory workers, unions, corporate
headquarters and racial and ethnic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, they are microcosms of the nation,'' said James
Penning, professor of political science at Calvin College in Grand
Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   They have emerged as swing states because they include voters
who almost religiously support one party or another and ``swing
voters'' who change their allegiance depending on the issues and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And they are up for grabs because, with no pressing national
issue this year, nobody is quite sure how the swing voters are
going to swing.
</P>
<P>
   A war, recession or environmental disaster makes it possible to
mobilize voters nationally, said Greg Haas, a Columbus-based
Democratic consultant who directed Bill Clinton's 1992 Ohio
campaign. Without such an issue, Bush, the Texas governor, and
Gore, the vice president, have to appeal more to voters on a
state-by-state basis, Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   These states share similarities _ at the moment, high gas
prices. But as Dayton Daily News reporters criss-crossed the four
states, from surburban Bryn Mawr, to the farm fields outside
Decatur, to the inner-city neighborhoods of Detroit, separate
issues emerged. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Labor in Michigan traditionally provides a key part of the
Democrats' base, but autoworkers upset with Gore's support for
normal trade relations with China could dampen enthusiasm for the
Democratic candidate. On the other hand, voters who helped Arizona
Sen. John McCain win Michigan's Republican primary in February
still are miffed at how McCain supporters have been treated since
then, a potential Bush land mine. And who will pay for ``road
rage?'' Last week, gas prices soared past $2.30 a gallon in
Michigan. The American Research Group poll, taken May 1-10, showed
Bush leading in Michigan, 45-42, a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only twice in the last century has a presidential winner
failed to carry Illinois, the land of ticket-splitters. Illinois is
still divided between the Democrats in Chicago and Republicans in
the suburbs and downstate, but Clinton got enough votes outside
Chicago to win twice here. Education is the issue in Illinois, and
Gore now has a Daley running his national campaign: Commerce
Secretary Bill Daley, the brother of Chicago Mayor Richard M.
Daley. The big unknown: Will soaring gas prices and a death penalty
controversy emerge as central issues in the race? The race here is
considered even.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ohio has no statewide non-judicial Democratic officeholders,
but Clinton won twice here and Democrats will work hard for the
trifecta. Populous Cuyahoga County remains important, but statewide
voting patterns are changing. Republicans no longer believe they
have to keep the Democrats' margin of victory in Cuyahoga County
below 100,000 in order to win statewide. Democrats say they are
making inroads in Columbus, which in 1999 elected its first
Democratic mayor in 28 years. On most polls, education tops the
list of ``most important issues.'' Other hot topics include health
care, gun control, abortion and the ``character'' issue. The
American Research Group's May poll had Bush up 47-41.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pennsylvania is another heavy union state, but unlike
Michigan, it's dominated by the industrial trades. The strong
economy with lots of work is likely to matter more to labor here
than Gore's stance on international trade. Social Security could
also play big. Pennsylvania is among the nation's leaders for
retirees, who stay to reap the state's generous benefits to
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's list of possible running mates also underscores the
importance of this region. Prominent Republicans from Ohio,
Michigan and Pennsylvania are all mentioned. And in Pennsylvania,
for one, both parties concede that if Republican Gov. Tom Ridge
were chosen, the Keystone State and its 23 delegates would almost
surely go to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   In all four states, political power, which helps determine voter
turnout, is divided between Republicans who control all the
governors' offices and Democrats who hold all the big-city mayor's
offices, including Columbus, Cincinnati and Cleveland in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In all four states, President Clinton is a wildcard: a mostly
popular president but a controversial one whose ethical lapses
serve as a lightning rod for voters of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   And in all four states, swing voters hold the key. Michigan
autoworker Alan Koles III, 31, personifies the region's swing vote.
When the economy soured in 1992, he backed Democrat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Turned off by Clinton's conduct, he switched to Ross Perot and
the Reform Party in 1996. This year he's backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's support for normalizing trade relations with China
reinforced Koles' doubts about the vice president. He already was
upset with what he considered Gore's extreme positions on the
environment, particularly the vice president's attacks on the
internal combustion engine, a sacred cow in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gore's support for more gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is a pro-gunner and so am I,'' said Koles, who lives in
suburban St. Clair Shores, north of Detroit, and commutes 40 miles
to work at a Daimler-Chrysler engine plant in Trenton, south of the
Motor City.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Brenda Owens is another of those fence-sitting swing
voters. Owens, director of Kenyatta's Day Care, is still sizing up
the candidates using education as a measuring stick.
</P>
<P>
   She tentatively supports Bush's proposal to provide federal
money for vouchers that parents could use to send their children to
private schools. She spent her own money sending her children to
private schools. Chicago has some excellent public school magnet
programs but the programs were full, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when my kids were in school I had to spend large
amounts of money to put them in a school that was safe and would
give them a good education,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she leans toward Gore in the presidential race. President
Clinton has pushed for more federal money for education and day
care and Gore is likely to continue that, she said.
</P>
<P>
   FREQUENT VISITS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
</P>
<P>
   Swing voters in these four pivotal states _ along with New
Jersey, Missouri and a few smaller states thought to be up for
grabs _ will have plenty of opportunities to make up their minds
before November: After the conventions, candidates Bush and Gore
will all but take up residency.
</P>
<P>
   John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied
Politics at the University of Akron, said one of the principal
campaigners from each side _ the major candidates or their spouses
_ will make a stop in each of the four big states at least once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether the candidates or spouses from each side probably
will make 20 or more visits to Ohio and the other three states,
said Green. At least $40 million to $50 million will be spent by
each side in the four states, not counting national advertising, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driven mostly toward maximizing the (voter) turnout,''
Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said that in 1992, Clinton, Gore or one of their spouses
made 26 visits to Ohio between the Democratic convention and the
election. Haas directed Clinton's Ohio campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a two-week-period in October when every single
day one of the principals was in Ohio,'' said Haas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Scranton, Pa., and Cincinnati last week, unveiling a
tax cut plan and touting himself as the candidate best able to keep
the economy booming. Bush was in Canton Friday pushing his
education proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Gore went to Chicago where he urged Congress to pass a
patients' bill of rights that would give patients the right to sue
their HMOs, a popular issue in Ohio and the other states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been campaigning in traditionally Democratic
areas, came to a working class neighborhood in Cleveland in April
to unveil his ``compassionate conservative'' plan to help the
working poor by cutting taxes, improving access to health insurance
and helping them buy homes and save money. He touted the same ideas
a few days later in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Also in April, Gore picked Philadelphia to outline his plan for
improving Social Security benefits for women who take time off from
work to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has spent a day in public schools in suburban Detroit and
Columbus, while Bush has campaigned at schools in predominantly
black areas of Columbus and Detroit, trying to reach out beyond
traditional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, POLLS AND FRUSTRATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Bush has good reason to reach beyond the Republican base.
Neither of his two predecessors did, and Clinton swept all four
states in 1992 and again in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But although Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Illinois share
much in common, there are political differences that could be a
factor this year.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Ohio leans the most Republican and Illinois the
most Democratic, said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, who grew up
in Bexley, a Columbus suburb. Michigan leans slightly Democratic,
although less than Illinois, while Pennsylvania is somewhat
Republican oriented, but less so than Ohio, said Mellman.
</P>
<P>
   This analysis is based partially on the results of the Clinton
sweep, particularly his win over Republican George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 in Ohio, Clinton squeaked his way to victory with just
40 percent of the vote, compared to 38 percent for Bush. Ross Perot
got 21 percent of the vote and exit polls showed that his presence
in the race probably cost Bush the state.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton decisively won in Illinois, getting 49
percent of the vote to just 34 percent for Bush and 17 percent for
Perot. In Pennsylvania, Clinton got 45 percent to 36 percent for
Bush and 18 percent for Perot.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the results were similar, 44 percent for Clinton,
36 percent for Bush and 19 percent for Perot.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan tendencies aren't ironclad, however.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Ohio and Pennsylvania _ the two most Republican states
_ voted for Democrat Jimmy Carter while Illinois and Michigan
backed Republican Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, winning Illinois or Michigan or Pennsylvania
does not necessarily mean a candidate will win Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The polls so far show Bush with a slight lead or even in each of
the four states, but the Gore campaign isn't panicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's slim lead in Midwest polls is misleading,'' said
Douglas Hattaway, the Gore campaign spokesman. ``Bush has been
sliding and Gore has been rising in the polls for several months.
As people start to pay more attention to the candidates that trend
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign welcomes the early polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters don't really know who Al Gore is,'' said Ray Sullivan,
a Bush campaign spokesman. ``The baggage from the Clinton-Gore
administration is clearly hurting him and the polls reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Columbus, Republican political consultant Curt Steiner knows
better than to take anything for granted. He cheered along with
other Ohio Republicans over the last decade as their party took
over every non-judicial statewide office and both houses of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Democrats haven't gone away, said Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the greatest Republican era in decades, during that time
the Democratic presidential candidate carried Ohio twice,'' Steiner
said. ``That's all you need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   It shows that not much has changed in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The late John F. Kennedy summed up the frustration of running
and losing in Ohio and the other battleground states. In 1960 he
campaigned throughout Ohio to adoring crowds everywhere. Victory
surely would be his.
</P>
<P>
   On election night, however, Republican Richard M. Nixon won the
state in what the late Theodore H. White, author of ``The Making of
the President 1960,'' called ``the greatest upset of the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy held up his right hand, swollen and inflamed by months
of handshaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio did that to me,'' said Kennedy. ``They did it there.''

 &HT;    Four states key to presidential election
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When national Republicans gather Monday in Dayton
to talk about improving Social Security and the nation's schools,
they'll be trying to get the attention of voters like Dayton
elementary school principal Gwen Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis is among thousands of undecided voters across Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois whose support both Republican
George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore need to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Those four states from the industrial heartland are where the
election could be won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   Together they account for 84 of the 270 electoral votes needed
to get to the White House, and right now neither Bush nor Gore can
lay claim to any of them. The battleground for the 2000 campaign
will be fought in places like Will County, Illinois; Lehigh County,
Pennsylvania; Macomb County, Mich., and Montgomery County, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The states are known for farms that grow corn and soybeans and
for factories that turn out steel and automobiles, but they also
regularly determine the winners in close presidential elections.
This year will be no different.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states _ California, Texas, Florida and New York _
have more electoral votes but considerably less suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South and Mountain West have basically been conceded to
Bush, and California and New York have basically been conceded to
Gore, so the heartland states like Ohio are it for these two
guys,'' said Allan Lichtman, history department chairman at
American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of Monday's hearing in Dayton is to gather
ideas on education and Social Security to be considered for the
party platform at the Republican National Convention this summer.
But party officials acknowledge they want to showcase their ideas
in a state considered crucial to winning back the White House,
occupied for the last eight years by Democrat Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons (Dayton) was chosen is so we can convey our
message to the people of the heartland, the people in Ohio,'' said
Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
``One of the things we can do to make it swing our way is to let
people know what we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, 59, the Dayton school principal, historically has not
been a swing voter. She has never voted for a Republican, but this
year she has an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   What the candidates have to say on education will help her
decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is my life and I'm not sure which guy is truly
committed to making our schools better,'' said Jarvis, whose
school, Residence Park, was closed at the end of the school year in
a budget-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
   BIG FOUR ARE MICROCOSMS OF THE NATION
</P>
<P>
   No one state represents the nation as a whole. But the Big Four
industrial states provide a good window into the nation's cultural
and economic diversity, said Michael Barone, co-author of ``The
Almanac of American Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   These states all include big cities, small towns, suburbs, edge
cities, farms, factories and factory workers, unions, corporate
headquarters and racial and ethnic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, they are microcosms of the nation,'' said James
Penning, professor of political science at Calvin College in Grand
Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   They have emerged as swing states because they include voters
who almost religiously support one party or another and ``swing
voters'' who change their allegiance depending on the issues and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And they are up for grabs because, with no pressing national
issue this year, nobody is quite sure how the swing voters are
going to swing.
</P>
<P>
   A war, recession or environmental disaster makes it possible to
mobilize voters nationally, said Greg Haas, a Columbus-based
Democratic consultant who directed Bill Clinton's 1992 Ohio
campaign. Without such an issue, Bush, the Texas governor, and
Gore, the vice president, have to appeal more to voters on a
state-by-state basis, Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   These states share similarities _ at the moment, high gas
prices. But as Dayton Daily News reporters criss-crossed the four
states, from surburban Bryn Mawr, to the farm fields outside
Decatur, to the inner-city neighborhoods of Detroit, separate
issues emerged. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Labor in Michigan traditionally provides a key part of the
Democrats' base, but autoworkers upset with Gore's support for
normal trade relations with China could dampen enthusiasm for the
Democratic candidate. On the other hand, voters who helped Arizona
Sen. John McCain win Michigan's Republican primary in February
still are miffed at how McCain supporters have been treated since
then, a potential Bush land mine. And who will pay for ``road
rage?'' Last week, gas prices soared past $2.30 a gallon in
Michigan. The American Research Group poll, taken May 1-10, showed
Bush leading in Michigan, 45-42, a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only twice in the last century has a presidential winner
failed to carry Illinois, the land of ticket-splitters. Illinois is
still divided between the Democrats in Chicago and Republicans in
the suburbs and downstate, but Clinton got enough votes outside
Chicago to win twice here. Education is the issue in Illinois, and
Gore now has a Daley running his national campaign: Commerce
Secretary Bill Daley, the brother of Chicago Mayor Richard M.
Daley. The big unknown: Will soaring gas prices and a death penalty
controversy emerge as central issues in the race? The race here is
considered even.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ohio has no statewide non-judicial Democratic officeholders,
but Clinton won twice here and Democrats will work hard for the
trifecta. Populous Cuyahoga County remains important, but statewide
voting patterns are changing. Republicans no longer believe they
have to keep the Democrats' margin of victory in Cuyahoga County
below 100,000 in order to win statewide. Democrats say they are
making inroads in Columbus, which in 1999 elected its first
Democratic mayor in 28 years. On most polls, education tops the
list of ``most important issues.'' Other hot topics include health
care, gun control, abortion and the ``character'' issue. The
American Research Group's May poll had Bush up 47-41.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pennsylvania is another heavy union state, but unlike
Michigan, it's dominated by the industrial trades. The strong

REPORT DUE ON WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL DISMISSALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel who has been investigating
the Clintons on several fronts is expected to file his final report
next week with a special judicial panel on what role Hillary Rodham
Clinton played in the firing of several longtime employees in the
White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   The report will not be made public, but lawyers familiar with
the investigation say it is highly unlikely to include a
recommendation that anyone be prosecuted. The independent
prosecutor, Robert W. Ray, who replaced Kenneth Starr last October,
may announce that conclusion publicly at the same time he files the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The report itself, which will not be available to the public for
at least three months, will deal with whether Hillary Clinton was a
moving force behind the decision to fire the seven longtime
employees in 1993 and whether she or other White House aides tried
to conceal whatever role she played.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel law governing Ray's operations,
Clinton's lawyers will be given an opportunity to review any
reference to her in the report. She is entitled to include any
dissenting comments in the next 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   After that 90-day period, the three-member judicial panel is
allowed to make the report public, meaning that its disclosure
could come in the final stages of Clinton's Senate campaign in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The report will deal with two starkly contradictory accounts of
Clinton's role in the dismissal of the travel office employees just
a few months after she and her husband moved into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The workers who helped plan arrangements for news organizations
as they accompanied the president on his travels found themselves
suddenly barred from the White House grounds on May 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has regularly depicted herself as largely uninvolved in
the dismissals. Her lawyer told the General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, that she had no idea how the firings
were initiated.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, a House committee began an investigation, and
Clinton offered a more detailed response, insisting that she was
only interested in being kept informed about what was happening in
the travel office.
</P>
<P>
   She also told congressional investigators that she was too busy
at the time helping her daughter get adjusted in a new school,
tending to her father who had suffered a stroke and trying to plan
a national health care system.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel began investigating the matter at the
request of Attorney General Janet Reno after a memorandum was
discovered in which a senior White House official said that the
first lady had instigated the firings and created a climate of
anxiety in the White House about doing it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The official, David Watkins, said in his memorandum to Thomas
McLarty, then the White House chief of staff, that ``we both knew
there would be hell to pay'' if ``we failed to take swift and
decisive action in conformity with the first lady's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins also wrote a chronology of his role in the firings that
was obtained by investigators in Congress and the independent
counsel's office that appeared to show that Clinton was regularly
pressing for the travel office employees to be fired. In one
section, he recorded that Clinton told a meeting, ``We need those
people out, and we need our people in.''
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the former workers were rehired in other jobs.

LEHMAN BROTHERS' QUARTERLY EARNINGS UP 15 PERCENT OVER '99 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite a sharp slowdown in domestic stock and bond
markets, Lehman Brothers Holdings reported Friday that its
quarterly earnings rose 15 percent from a year earlier, though they
were 33 percent lower than in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, the fourth-biggest securities firm, said it had net
income of $378 million in the quarter, up from $330 million in the
corresponding period in 1999 but down from a record $541 million in
the first quarter of 2000. On a diluted basis, its earnings were
$2.78 a share, compared with $2.09 a year earlier and with
analysts' lowered consensus estimate of $2.49 for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Lehman's gains came from stock trading at home and in
Europe, where the firm has been building its investment banking and
trading operations. Lehman derived 49 percent of its revenue from
outside the United States in the quarter, up from 37 percent a year
earlier, said David Goldfarb, its chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw some extraordinary strength in trading profitability
considering the market environment we were in,'' said Guy
Moszkowski, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst. Moszkowski said
Lehman's results boded well for two bigger competitors that are
scheduled to report earnings next week, the Goldman Sachs Group and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second quarter will turn out to have been quite strong
really, considering the kind of market conditions we had,'' he
said. But, he added, ``I still think we're looking at a much weaker
third quarter than we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldfarb said that the quarter had a split personality: For the
first several weeks, starting in March, the stock markets were on a
tear and investment banks were underwriting new stock issues as
fast as they could. Then, after technology stocks took a dive in
mid-April, business slowed markedly though investors rushed to
adjust their portfolios for the end _ at least temporarily _ of the
run-up in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the quarter, concerns about rising interest rates
bogged down the bond markets, the traditional source of most of
Lehman's revenue. Of the $1.76 billion in revenue last quarter,
only about 30 percent came from trading and underwriting bonds,
Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody still had a thought process that we're a
fixed-income house, this should be a wake-up call that we're a
diversified investment bank,'' Goldfarb said.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive quarter, Lehman spent about 52 cents
of every dollar it took in on compensation and benefits for its
9,300 employees. Like other Wall Street firms, Lehman has had to
increase pay and perks to retain and attract young investment
bankers. Goldfarb said Lehman was also spending heavily on new
technology and an Internet-based system for communicating and
trading with clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet proved treacherous for Lehman last week when the
firm discovered that www.secinfo.com, a Web site for investors, was
still publishing a long list of the firm's investments that had
been filed erroneously with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May, Lehman sent a standard quarterly filing to the SEC
that was supposed to contain a list of its biggest stock holdings,
totaling about $5 billion. Instead, it sent a much longer list of
about $25 billion of positions, including currency contracts and
stock options it had purchased as bets that certain stocks would
either rise or fall.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, big investors like Lehman closely guard such
information out of fear that other investors will use it for their
own trading purposes. Lehman thought it had erased the first filing
when the SEC deleted it and replaced it with a corrected one, but
secinfo.com has a policy of providing all versions of such
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Lehman lawyer asked the site's operators to remove
the original filing. At first, they complied. But then, thinking
like Wall Street traders, they reposted the document and asked
Lehman to make them an offer to remove it. Lehman chose not to bid.

SPORTS COLUMN: TRENT JONES' LEGACY ... MAKE THEM THINK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ At the U.S. Open, the golfers always had
something to say about what Trent Jones had wrought. Seldom was it
complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones has so many doglegs on this course,'' Bob Rosburg said
at Hazeltine National in 1970, ``he must have laid it out in a
kennel.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning at Oakland Hills in 1951 with a 67 in the final
round, Ben Hogan said, ``I'm glad I brought this course, this
monster, to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   And at a reception later, Hogan turned to Trent Jones' wife,
Ione: ``If your husband had to play this course for a living,''
Hogan said, ``you'd be on the bread line.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the golfers have come to expect an Open course
to be altered simply to make them do what they don't want to do:
think. As it was here at Pebble Beach with a few new tees as well
as new seawall bunkers on the 17th and 18th holes. All created
explicitly for this 100th Open.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Trent Jones is smiling. For half a century now, the
Open has been played on famous courses, no matter how old and how
traditional, that are always altered to make life more exacting for
the world's best golfers. And that's the legacy of Robert Trent
Jones Sr., the celebrated golf architect who died in his sleep at
93 just as this Open was about to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of his death was spooky,'' his son Rees was saying.
``For years the Open was his stage.'' Rees Jones is now what his
father was, the architect often hired by the U.S. Golf Association
to perform a face lift on an Open course. He and his brother,
Robert Trent Jones Jr., have been involved in designing more than
250 courses worldwide after having studied under their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought of himself as the defender of par,'' Rees Jones
said. ``He thought that a tournament with a lot of subpar rounds
was a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 1951 Open at Oakland Hills outside Detroit, Trent Jones
was the first to redo an Open course. Oakland Hills had been used
for two previous Opens _ in 1924 when Cyril Walker finished two
strokes ahead of Bobby Jones and in 1937 when Ralph Guldahl won.
But for the 1951 Open, the USGA knew that it needed a more
difficult look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rebunkered Oakland Hills,'' Rees Jones said. ``And his
contoured greens made the golfers think about whether to go for the
flag or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Hills was suddenly golf's ``monster.'' In that 1951 Open
none of the world's best golfers broke par 70 until the final round
when Hogan shot 67 for a seven-over-par 287 to win by two strokes.
Clayton Haefner shot 69 to finish second.
</P>
<P>
   Others also complained about the severity of Jones' changes, but
Gene Sarazen, then the only golfer to have won all four of the
major tournaments, praised them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course was a masterpiece,'' Sarazen wrote in a letter to
the USGA hierarchy. ``It was a challenge to the players, but the
best players finished on top.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, the USGA hired Trent Jones whenever it thought an
Open course needed changes, whether subtle or drastic.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest uproar occurred in 1970 at Hazeltine National
outside Minneapolis, a relatively new course that Jones had
designed. After a practice round, Jack Nicklaus, who had already
won two of his four Open titles, complained that Hazeltine lacked
definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told Jack, `You won't play well because you're
already fighting the course,''' Rees Jones said. ``He was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus shot 81-72-75-76 to tie for 51st as England's Tony
Jacklin won with a seven-under-par total of 281, but that Open is
remembered for Dave Hill's comment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Hazeltine lacked, Hill, who would finish second with
even par 288, replied, ``Eighty acres of corn and a few cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Rosburg, others complained about all the dogleg holes
that created too many blind shots, either from the tees or to the
greens, but Ben Crenshaw, now a two-time Masters winner and a
celebrated golf architect who was low amateur in that 1970 Open,
defended Jones' design.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those blind shots,'' Crenshaw said, ``aren't blind after
your first practice round.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent Jones was just trying to make the world's best golfers
play golf. Trying to make them think instead of just teeing it high
and letting it fly. Trying to make par important. And because of
what he wrought, the Open is based on that philosophy. &QL;

Supporters said the $922,000 sought for the programs would benefit
impoverished children. Opponents said the amendment would eliminate
needed funding for the military. A ``yes'' vote rejects the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SPENDING
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected, 65-32, an amendment to the

</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 380-49, a measure to investigate

necessary. A ``yes'' vote supports the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SIGNATURES
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 426-4, a bill that gives
electronic contracts the same status as those signed on paper,
legalizing transactions made with an electronic signature.
Supporters said it would reduce paperwork for businesses and
consumers. Opponents said it did not go far enough to protect
privacy online. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 217-214, a bill to increase
spending for health and education. The bill would appropriate
$339.5 billion to the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services and Education. Supporters said it would boost spending for
needed federal programs. Opponents said the funding was not
sufficient for education, childcare and worker training.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: MONUMENTS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 243-177, an amendment to the
Interior Department spending bill that limits funding for new
national monuments. The amendment would have prohibited the agency
from planning or managing national monuments designated by the
President this year. Supporters said it would stem government
attempts to acquire more land. Opponents said it would infringe on
presidential authority. A ``yes'' vote rejects the amendment.

 &HT;    Professionals to replace students in designing and carrying out
future bonfiresBy Laylan Copelin and Jaime Adame
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen, admitting that he
seriously considered eliminating the traditional bonfire that
turned deadly last fall, on Friday ordered a two-year moratorium to
plan a dramatically ``restructured'' event.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen outlined a bonfire designed, overseen and, in some
instances, executed by professionals instead of students, altering
a major tradition dating to 1909. The bonfire is burned just before
the annual football game between Texas A&AMP;M and the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, who worked on Bonfire as a student, challenged students
to change the Aggie culture. A $1.8 million investigation of the
collapse concluded that the culture surrounding A&AMP;M contributed to
what Bowen repeatedly referred to as ``the horror'' that occurred
Nov. 18. A dozen people died, 27 were injured and dozens of others
narrowly escaped harm as the 59-foot tower of logs toppled without
warning about 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do what is right,'' Bowen said Friday, ``even though my
decision could be judged as `tough' on the students.''
</P>
<P>
   He said any bonfire must be designed by engineers and overseen
by construction professionals. He shrank the months-long event to a
couple of weeks by forbidding students to cut the bonfire's logs
themselves. He said professionals would cut and deliver the wood.
The bonfire site also would be fenced and monitored by video
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction was as strong as the emotions surrounding the tragedy
and the tradition. It ranged from endorsements from trustees and
the former students association to predictions of unauthorized
bonfires on private land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a lot of bogus bonfires across
Texas, from El Paso to Texarkana to the Gulf,'' said Don Ganter,
who owns five restaurants and bars that cater to Aggie students.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's already talked with students about the possibility
of an unauthorized bonfire, perhaps on his land, although he said
any bonfire would have to be safe and without alcohol. In the past,
Bonfire had been marred at times with allegations of drinking and
hazing by students.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said he would discourage unauthorized bonfires but added
that the university could do little to punish students for
activities conducted off campus if they are not portrayed as
university events.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would take almost two years for students, faculty
members and outside professionals to plan the 2002 bonfire within
his guidelines. For this fall and perhaps in 2001, he said he
anticipated a memorial service for the victims of the bonfire
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   From the day of the collapse, Bowen said he considered
eliminating the tradition. But the university paid for a
four-month, $1.8 million investigation into the cause of the
accident. The investigation, chaired by Houston construction
executive Leo Linbeck Jr., criticized the bonfire's design,
evolving construction techniques, lack of supervision by A&AMP;M
officials and the lack of blueprints for the complicated, six-stack
structure of 5,000 or more logs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would resign because of the findings regarding
a lack of supervision by the administration, Bowen said no. The
report even noted a ``cultural bias'' at the university that
discouraged anyone from questioning the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harsh tone of the report, Bowen said he saw a way of
making a safer bonfire by returning to the simpler, teepee style
used in the 1950s when he attended A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen also said students will have to accept changes in how
their bonfire leaders are chosen. Each generation of bonfire
leaders, called red pots for the helmets they wear, selected and
trained their successors. All were male, although women have been
allowed to work on the project in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A floor below where Bowen delivered his remarks on campus, about
120 students, including about 10 Corps Cadets in military uniform,
watched his televised remarks mostly in silence.
</P>
<P>
   When Bowen said Bonfire is not the defining activity of the
former all-male, all-military school, many scoffed. Students hissed
when he said they would not be allowed to cut logs for future
bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonfire is built by students, for students and taking
construction out of students' hands defeats the purpose'' of
developing leadership, said Martin Hoover, a Lampasas junior who
witnessed the bonfire collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Krista Frederick, a Midland sophomore, said, ``The consensus
from a lot of students is that, `Something will burn next year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Woods, a junior, said students have been unfairly
criticized for the zealous culture surrounding bonfire. She
objected to the two-year moratorium: ``They are just trying to
flush out 'the bad seeds.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many praised Bowen's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Braus, whose son lost his right arm in the collapse, said,
``I applaud any words about safety and responsibility. I wished
they had focused on it sooner, but that's hindsight.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Lane, student body president, said it is up to students
``to move forward and come up with a safe, reconstructed event.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mayo, a 1970 graduate of A&AMP;M and president of the
Association of Former Students, said the association supports
Bowen's decision and he believes most Aggies will accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been the desire of the former student body that a way
can be found to continue Bonfire _ in a safe manner. That's the
caveat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hugh Wilson, an A&AMP;M biology professor and bonfire critic
since 1990, said Bowen should have scrapped the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an opportunity for A&AMP;M to abandon what most people
see as a flawed enterprise,'' he said. ``Keeping it indicates A&AMP;M
is pretty much business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the administration has now taken responsibility for
what it always had contended was a student-run project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very difficult for them to blame the
students, the faculty or other entities when something goes
amiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the administration in the past ``paid lip service''
to its rules against hazing and drinking, but he expects that will
change after the deaths of a dozen people.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said stricter oversight by adults may undermine the
future of Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just may not be the attraction to students it once was,''
he said. ``With regulation, I have a feeling that enthusiasm for
bonfire will wane.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council unanimously passed a
resolution Friday night demanding the immediate withdrawal of
Rwandan and Ugandan forces from Congo and expressing outrage over
their fighting earlier this month in the Congolese city of
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   But the council resolution, which was unanimously adopted by the
council's 15 members, dropped a four-month deadline set in an
earlier draft after the United States and Britain pointed out that
there had been no similar deadlines set in the cease-fire agreement
reached by the warring parties at the Zambian capital, Lusaka, last
July.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the council called on all the warring factions to halt
their hostilities throughout Congo and to meet their obligations
under the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was approved in the presence of members of the
Lusaka accord's political committee, who came to the United Nations
for two days of talks with council members to try to find a way to
keep the situation in Congo from deteriorating further.
</P>
<P>
   The political committee's chairman, Amama Mbabazi of Uganda,
said that while there had been violations, the cease-fire agreement
had generally succeeded, despite some violations. Mbabazi confirmed
that Rwandan and Ugandan troops had stopped fighting over Kisangani
and that their withdrawal had begun.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that an exchange of prisoners had begun and that
181 prisoners had so far been freed, most of them from Rwanda,
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Congo itself.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a spokesman for the United Nations, Manoel De
Almeida e Silva, said the Rwandans and Ugandans has agreed to pull
back a little more than 60 miles each in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the council members showed increasingly little patience
with the lack of progress in ending the war, which has devastated
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's representative, Jeremy Greenstock, said the council
was ``fed up to the back teeth'' by the parties who promised to
take action and then failed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. representative, Richard C. Holbrooke, said, ``the
parties have been responsible for the problem, and they cannot
simply create a mess and expect the world to clean it up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Tunisia agreed to send some troops by June 30 to set
up a headquarters for a U.N. peacekeeping presence in the battered
Congolese city of Kisangani. A diplomat said that the Tunisians
would send about 100 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the secretary general's special representative to
Congo, Kamel Morjane, appealed for two companies of peacekeepers
that are needed to fill the vacuum left by the departure of warring
Rwandan and Ugandan forces, who have fought over Kisangani at a
heavy cost of at least 160 civilians killed and 1,000 injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Congo war was also joined by Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia on
the side of President Lauren Kabila of Congo, while Rwanda and
Uganda initially came in to support rival rebel movements before
they turned to fighting each other.

TIME AND POLITICS STILL A MARVEL FOR NATION'S OLDEST GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W. Va. _ ``I was first diagnosed as a tumor,'' said
Gov. Cecil Underwood, grinning at age 77 as he spoke of the many
tricks of time, beginning with the suspicion by his mother, Della,
that she was more likely ill than pregnant with him when she was
43.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood has turned out a hearty offspring, challenging time at
either extreme. He became the nation's youngest governor when he
was first elected here in 1956 at the age of 34, and now he has
returned as the nation's oldest governor after winning a second
term 40 years later.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that his crowded executive desk does not bother
with framed mottoes about where the buck stops. ``Age is a matter
of the mind,'' reads his desk marker. ``If you don't mind, it
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in this spirit that Underwood is running again this year.
He is aiming to be chosen one more time by the voters _ naturally
becoming the oldest re-elected governor _ not so much to defy time
as to simply ignore its accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan politics aside, Underwood may be presaging the
geriatric advancements looming before American democracy, not to
mention before the American workplace with its receding retirement
age. This unpretentious hard-scrabble state already has the
distinction of bearing the oldest median age of any in the Union _
older than Florida with its legions of retirees. Job hunting often
force its natives to emigrate, but a number eventually return home
to settle after their careers. Their ballot choices regularly
include Secretary of State Ken Hechler, an 85-year-old Democratic
legend from the New Deal era who, like his Republican rival the
governor, simply refuses to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time here, my wife spent one night in the governor's
mansion, then had to be rushed to the maternity ward,'' the
governor happily recalled. The occasion was the birth of the second
of three children of Hovah Underwood, who is first lady once more,
presiding over family holiday gatherings that now pack six
grandchildren into their old executive homestead. Underwood will
turn 78 two days before the next election. He registered to vote as
soon as he was 21. Immediately afterward, he listed himself as a
Republican candidate for the state's House of Delegates. He won, at
the age of 22. He served 12 years in the Legislature, then won the
governorship, prevailing as if age were beside the point, when
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's coattails swept the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very stimulating,'' Underwood said of the gilded
Statehouse dome that greets him, same as his first time around,
outside his bedroom window. ``It makes me want to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   As he briskly moves about the executive chamber, he flashes past
the darkly handsome ghost of himself in photos of 40 years ago,
when his hair was thick and black, his ambition keen. Now his hair
is thick and gray, his ambition keen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's much better the second time,'' he said of incumbency
resumed. ``I had been a legislator and done some high school
teaching, but I didn't have any real management experience the
first time,'' said the governor, a graduate of Salem College with a
master of arts degree from West Virginia University. ``Now I have a
much broader understanding,'' he said of varied experience garnered
in four decades of jobs between governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood was a coal mining executive, a chemical company
lobbyist, president of Bethany College and, dearest in his memory,
a founder of the Software Valley Foundation, an early business and
government effort to create high-tech jobs that has taken root in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ran again, I decided to focus on one issue I believed
passionately in,'' said Underwood. The issue was fiber optics and
its industrial promise for this splendidly hilly but remote state.
``But one morning my wife said: `What are you talking about?
Nobody's paying attention to you!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started carrying this with me,'' he said, displaying a
handy length of fiber-optic cable neatly peeled open, as if a
modern mystery unveiled. ``I never made another public appearance
without it,'' said the governor, shaking the futuristic training
aid that became his swagger stick on the stump as he overcame early
poll deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The governor does like to go back in time to the 35-acre farm in
Joseph Mills where he grew up, and where he now works the family
fields any open weekend for his leisure. ``That's Silas, my
father,'' he said, pointing behind the governor's chair to a photo
of his father sweating in those fields at the age of 83, seven
years before his death. ``He never got beyond the second grade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He voted the first time in 1896 and never missed an
election,'' said the governor, reflecting on why he himself loved
politics and refused to retire from it. ``In contrast, my mother
didn't believe in women's suffrage. But she called me one day in
1948 and said she was ready to vote,'' he said, smiling at what
time and politics could accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the people who came by the farm, it was the political
candidates who made the biggest impression on me,'' Underwood said,
remembering how they had always stopped to chat, as determined as
salesmen. Just so, he began developing his candidate's touch as a
young student when he got a job as a Fuller Brush salesman going
door to door. It was his first venture into that nice-to-see-you
world of selling himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very shy, and this was a big help,'' Underwood said of
that far-from-last approach to the people. ``You just had to do
it.''

 &HT;    Florida seeks to halt win streak of Georgia
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This week has been one of both obstacles and oddities
for Florida. The team missed its initial flight into Atlanta on
Sunday, had a bus break down on Tuesday and coach Al Morrell had an
anxiety attack on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida hasn't lost its focus entering the Georgia-Florida
High School All-Star game tonight at 6 p.m at Georgia Tech's Grant
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Georgia's won three in a row and we're here to end
that,'' Florida defensive lineman Santonio Thomas said. ``We're
here to make Florida go up one.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 games, the series is tied at 6-6-3. And if this game is
like most, it should be relatively low scoring. Last year, Georgia
won 13-7 and only once has the game gotten into the 30s. In 1988,
Thomas County Central quarterback and eventual Heisman Trophy
winner Charlie Ward led Georgia to a 38-32 victory. Morrell doesn't
think there'll be a shootout this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see either side scoring more than 21 points,'' Morrell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Stringer, coach for the Georgia Team, has been impressed
with linebacker Daryl Smith (Georgia Tech) and cornerback Terrell
Butler (Nebraska). Northside teammates William Thompson (Georgia)
and Kenny Parker (Florida) shore up the defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be expected to stop Florida quarterbacks Jared Clark
(Notre Dame) and Matt Redding (Georgia) and an offensive line that
has one player weighing less than 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's defensive line already is wagering chicken wings for
the guy who makes the most tackles. They'll be focused on slowing
Cartersville running back Ronnie Brown (Auburn).
</P>
<P>
   And Stringer said speedy receiver Kelvin Kight, a Super 11 pick
last year who signed with Florida, runs on ``another gear.'' That's
all Florida defensive back/receiver Matt Jackson, a fellow Gator
signee, needed to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is for bragging rights, not just Georgia and
Florida,'' Jackson said, ``but me and him, the competition is
starting early. I'm excited about it.''

   NEW YORK _ What does a desperately frustrated Yankees second
baseman have in common with a famous 19th century Russian novelist?
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch may think not much. But in a way, he is in the
same pickle as Leo Tolstoy was as a child, when his brother
challenged him to stand in a corner until he could stop thinking
about white bears.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstoy, legend has it stood in that corner for quite a while,
with white bears _ like the exquisitely maddening image of a
baseball speeding effortlessly to first base _ trooping endlessly
through his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstoy's brush with obsession was trivial, but Knoblauch, who
left a ballgame in frustration Thursday night after his inability
to complete a simple throw to first base resulted in three errors,
has a lot more at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, sports psychologists surmised Friday, is that an
action that Knoblauch has instinctually performed 1000 times is
suddenly the object of conscious thought. In the past two years,
the infielder who once won a Gold Glove award for his defense, has
been plagued by a rash of throwing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine, suggested Rick Wolff, who worked with the
Cleveland Indians from 1989 to 1994 and now is private practice in
Westchester, consciously analyzing how to place your legs each time
you go down a flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballplayers, by the time they get to the major leagues, know
how to automatically run from home to first, they know how to throw
a ball,'' Wolff said. ``They don't think about that stuff. But when
you start thinking about these things, when you start thinking `How
much pressure should I put into my throw? Should I try to grip the
ball a certain way?' you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as the baseball axiom goes: ``Thinking is stinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the more a ballplayer _ or a golfer or a football
player or anyone else abruptly thrust into obsession _ tries to
stop thinking, the more stubborn the thoughts become.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Wegner, a psychologist at the University of Virginia,
knows a lot about such problems, having become interested in such
lapses of mental controls because of the Tolstoy legend. But he
studies these problems mostly in the laboratory, though he has also
carried his experiments to the putting green. .
</P>
<P>
   Wegner and his colleagues have found that they can ``create an
obsession in a matter of minutes'' just by instructing their
subjects, usually college students, to try not to think about
something _ sex, for example, or an old flame.
</P>
<P>
   And stressful situations, Wegner said, make the struggle for
mental control even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiny little things just grow, mostly by our attempts to stop
them,'' he said. ``It's almost like trying to put it out of your
mind causes it to be put into indelible type.''
</P>
<P>
   Wegner has a reverse strategy for combatting such obsessional
thoughts (and Yankees manager Joe Torre, take note): He tells
people that they should think about _ rather than banish _ the
unwanted thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that the thought gets tired and goes away,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's situation, he said, ``sounds like an extreme case.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that perhaps the infielder should try to throw
badly; after making 100 such throws, he might stop focusing on it
and thereby start tossing perfect strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Sports psychologists who work with major league players have
their own methods, and some said Friday that they were dubious
about Wegner's approach.
</P>
<P>
   But they agreed that ballplayers who have problems like
Knoblauch's are struggling more with their minds than with their
bodies. And while there are famous cases involving other baseball
players _ most notably Steve Sax, another second baseman, and
Mackey Sasser, a catcher _ such difficulties are more common than
fans realize, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying cause and the solution may be different for each
struggling athlete, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, who estimates that three or four major league and college
players falter in similar ways each season, said that his strategy
is to try to get players to focus on something else. ``I call it,
for the lack of a better term, distraction therapy,'' he said,
``meaning that instead of letting them get caught up in paranoia or
gripped by fear, you try to distract them with another thought.''
That strategy was parodied in the movie ``Bull Durham,'' in which
Susan Sarandon made Tim Robbins, playing ``Nuke Laloush,'' a wild
pitcher, wear a garter.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on a stumbling ballplayer are so immense, Wolff
said _ great enough Thursday night to drive Knoblauch from the
stadium _ that some athletes try to hide them. As in Knoblauch's
case, the problem escalates in the glare of media attention and
becomes a label the player often finds it hard to shed. The
ballplayer's teammates, he added, are also under pressure, often
not knowing what to do or how to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say to a guy like that?'' Wolff said . ``Don't
worry about it? No sweat? Take it easy? Deep down in their mind,
they're thinking, `I hope it's not contagious.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Maher, a professor at the Graduate School of Applied
and Professional Psychology at Rutgers University, who also works
with the Cleveland Indians, said that the Cleveland team tries to
spot ballplayers who are having difficulties early on, and work
with them before things get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not a player successfully overcomes his problem often
depends on how strong a support system he has, Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are confused. They are tense. They have to see that the
people who are trying to help them have a plan, and feel
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that last season two Cleveland players _ whom he
declined to name _ started having problems with basic technique.
Maher and other team psychologists began working with the
ballplayers immediately, he said, and successfully headed off
further difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who did not respond to calls asking for comment,
had Knoblauch talk to a team counselor during the playoffs two
years ago, after the second baseman had argued with an umpire
rather than complete a play.
</P>
<P>
   While fans and commentators have speculated that stresses in
Knoblauch's personal life _ his father suffers from Alzheimer's _
might be contributing to his troubles, Maher and Wolff said that in
their experience, there is little correlation between such stresses
and the mental glitches that for a major leaguer can turn every
game into torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rhyme or reason to this,'' Wolff said. ``We all
have stress in our lives, and major leaguers have stress. I've seen
guys who have no care in the world and they say `Rick, I can't make
this play.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sax, who in 1983 as a second baseman for the Dodgers had
difficulties almost identical to Knoblauch's, said he does not
remember being under particular stress at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But he remembers, he said, what it felt like, and can guess at
what Knoblauch is feeling now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the toughest thing I've ever gone through,'' said Sax,
now an analyst for Fox Sports Net's Baseball Today. ``It's
completely unexplainable. It's so awful, and everybody in the world
is watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   When his problem was at its peak, he said, he stood on the field
and prayed ``Please, please don't hit it to me, please don't hit
the ball to me!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when a small white sphere was hurtling in his direction,
he felt sorry for himself. Then he got mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really ticked and I beat this thing,'' Saks said. ``I
didn't turn my back on it. I bit it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he is glad he went through the ordeal. ``It made
me a better person. It put things in perspective and it made me a
better player.''
</P>
<P>
   The following years, he added, were the best in his career,
years when his second-base prayers changed to ``Please hit the ball
to me because when you do, this game is over.''
</P>
<P>
   All Knoblauch has to do, Sax said, ``is to get his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just turn our brains off, we'd be fine,'' he said.

SOSA SKEPTICS STALK HUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Sammy Sosa trade speculation has taken an
interesting twist in Boston. Wednesday's unbridled optimism gave
way to Friday's skepticism. By the time I got through reading the
papers, checking e-mail, and listening to nitwit radio, it was
pretty clear that Sosa is a bum not worth a sack of inner tubes;
certainly not worth a future superstar like Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Only in Boston. It's part of our (itals)can't do(unitals)
mentality. We don't want Ken Griffey. Not if we're going to have to
part with Steve Lomasney. Forget about Randy Johnson. If the
Diamondbacks are asking for Tomo Ohka, the price is too high. Same
with Sosa. No thank you, Cubs. Don't try unloading your baggage for
the Sox' best right fielder since Dwight Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Sox prospects should love it here because most of them are stars
before they set foot in Fenway. Few become stars when they get
here, but that doesn't stop us from touting the can't miss kids
down on the farm. It's the Juan Bustabad Syndrome. In his lengthy
reign as the Globe's god of baseball, the estimable Peter Gammons
regularly enlarged kids on the farm. He had us convinced Bustabad
was the next Luis Aparicio. I believe Juan was last seen parking
cars outside the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And now we have legions of Sox fans who don't want Sosa.
Afterall, the bum has only knocked in (itals)299(unitals) runs the
last two years and hasn't hit more than 63 homers since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There are various reasons for not wanting Sammy. He'll make too
much money and that will make Pedro mad. Sammy's lofty salary will
make it tough for the Sox to get a handout from the city and state
for a new Fenway. He isn't a great defensive outfielder. He hasn't
made the Cubs winners. He'll disrupt that perfect Dan Duquette
clubhouse chemistry. He strikes out too much. He's an ex-Cub and
the last big-name ex-Cub the Sox acquired was Bill Buckner. He's an
old 31. When you really think about it, he's no better than Troy
O'Leary. Blah. Blah. Blah.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and here's the biggie. The Cubs are asking way too much.
They want Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Please. We all like Nixon. He's earned his spot in the everyday
lineup. He plays smashmouth baseball. He gets his uniform dirty and
goes all out on every play. He spit nails in Roger Clemens's face,
then hit a game-winning homer off the Rocket in the greatest
regular-season game of the last two decades. He's got fire. He went
into friday night's game hitting .298 with seven homers and 36
RBIs. Trot's teammates love him. His wonderful wife ran the Boston
Marathon for the Jimmy Fund.
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon ripped a first-inning double off the Wall against the
Blue Jays, 30,000 fans said, ``Let's see Sosa do that!'' They said
it again in the fourth when Nixon uncorked a Roberto Clemente-like
throw to home plate from right field.
</P>
<P>
   Trot says he avoids newspapers and sports radio, but he knows
he's getting much fan support during this rumor frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good,'' he said. ``I've always enjoyed these fans. I've
tried to go out and represent the organization and fans the best
way I know how. I go out and play hard and for these fans to back
me like that, what else could I ask?''
</P>
<P>
   With John Valentin and Scott Hatteberg, Nixon is the last
remnant of the Lou Gorman administration. The Sox gave him a hefty
signing bonus and guaranteed him No. 7, then waited patiently while
he struggled through the minors. He seemed to have a lot of
injuries for a young guy, and with last season's abysmal start,
there was fear he might never be an everyday big-league player. Now
he's a fan favorite _ too good to give up for Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They waited for me forever and I've only played one year, and
for the fans to want to keep me here now, it means as much as the
game-winning homer against the Yankees,'' said Trot. ``And that's
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Okay. But if you were a general manager, would you give up Trot
Nixon for Sammy Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Nixon said with a smile. ``The front office is
gonna do their job the way I do my job. They know I love to play
for 'em. But things happen in baseball, whether it's trades or
retirements. I'm just going to continue. If it happens, it happens.
Right now, I'm just trying to get back on track and get back on the
winning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to let these other things bother me and it hasn't
bothered me. I think my name was tossed around when Petey (Pedro
Martinez) was coming over here. Hey, if it's gonna happen, it's
gonna happen. Right now, I'm just going to go out and put it on the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping he would understand, I told Nixon, ``nothing personal,
mind you, but I would trade you to the Cubs for Sammy Sosa. In a
heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't offend me,'' he said. ``He's a great ballplayer.
He'd help any team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Boston. We don't need 60 homers. Not if it means parting
with Nixon or a legend like Ohka.
</P>
<P>
   Think they'll take Bustabad?

<P>
   Say this about brand-name value investors: There seem to be
fewer of them of late.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Julian Robertson of Tiger Management handed in his
slide rule. And Robert Sanborn, manager of the Oakmark Fund,
surrendered his post, as did Gary Brinson, a chief investment
officer at UBS AG.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, value investing still has its core loyalists, at
least as seen at a recent two-day executive seminar on the subject
at the Columbia University Business School. The session is offered
each June.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just any value investing seminar. Over the years,
the audience has included luminaries like Charles Bruni, chairman
emeritus of Oppenheimer Capital; Herbert Allen Jr. of Allen &AMP; Co.;
and Michael Overlock, the former head of investment banking at
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, attendance swelled to 60 people. But this year, as
the market has remained infatuated with high-priced technology
stocks, many of which lack proven franchise power, obvious asset
value, or profits _ the number of participants fell sharply, to
just 16.
</P>
<P>
   The motley roster of guests lacked some of the glamour of former
years. It included an Icelandic Air executive who worries about the
value of his company's Internet investments, an executive at a
Puerto Rican food distribution company and an executive from
Cattolica Populare, an Italian investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   These hard-core acolytes of Warren Buffett would not be swayed
from the value outlook. Jeffrey Todd Hamm, recently out of college,
is investing a bit of his own money while he looks for a job. Over
a lunch break, he compared notes with Francesco Azzolini, who had
flown in from the Molfetta, Italy, headquarters of Cattolica
Populare, which manages $70 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you figure the underlying value of a stock without
getting distracted from the noise?'' Hamm asked. ``I haven't bought
the Internet stocks, and I have still made money. I feel more proud
of myself if I follow my discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is looking for an investing job in a market obsessed by the
new economy, so his attention to valuations may make him appear
old-fashioned. Getting the right position is taking time. ``I want
to find a job where I can hold my investment strategy firm,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The man whom these guests paid up to $2,900 to hear is Professor
Bruce Greenwald, who appeared adamant about the worth of his chosen
discipline as he walked his audience through the rigors of
searching for attractive value stocks. Unlike many proponents of
value investing, who dwell on price-to-earnings and price-to-book
multiples, Greenwald focuses just as much on a company's franchise
and earnings predictability.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar's case studies zeroed in on Sealed Air, a packaging
company, and Liz Claiborne, the apparel maker.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps as a concession to the market's infatuation with
growth, some of the discussion centered on dissecting the worth of
new-economy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald pointed out that there are technology value stocks.
Back in 1994, for example, Intel traded at just 12 times earnings
but had a juggernaut franchise and proven earnings power.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many value investors have ignored the sector because
they cannot make heads or tails of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach helps you understand the difference between
buying an Intel, which has real values, if not at current prices,
and some Internet stock that has no value at all or very little,''
Greenwald said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that value investing may never again return to
favor? ``No, it is not over,'' the professor said. ``Value
investing is really an attempt to use all the information you have
intelligently.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most people continue to shun value stocks. ``The fact is
they love to buy lottery tickets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not Steinn Bjornsson, 40, senior vice president for
marketing and sales at Icelandic Air, a privately held company that
has been doing deals with Internet-based travel companies. ``I am
asked to invest in small companies that have computer-driven travel
operations,'' Bjornsson said. ``Sometimes the guy with the biggest
hype and the strongest arguments gets the investment money, but the
company has no cash flow,'' he said. ``At least I can ask them to
prove what they are promising.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Bazi, a senior manager at Oddio &AMP; Co., a French
brokerage firm, flew in from Paris because he is planning to
redeploy some of his clients' money _ out of the technology sector
and into value stocks. ``We did 25 percent of the IP0's in France,
making a lot of money for our clients,'' he said. ``Some investors
will come back to traditional stocks to diversify their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   As for Greenwald, he is not much of an investor himself, because
he does not feel that he has the time to devote to it. So he is not
agonizing over value stocks' underperformance.
</P>
<P>
   But he is suffering in other ways. His mother, Virginia, 78,
pays scant heed to his value outlook, having bought bought Cisco
Systems at $2.50 a share in 1995, and Oracle at about $15 in early
1999. Before the April meltdown in technology, he said, she sold
Cisco for $80.25 and Oracle for $83.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you feel with a mother who's a genius?'' he asked
ruefully.

THE HARVARD FAST TRACK: FROM INCORPORATION TO FUNDING IN 4 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: R.I., N.C., Mass., Conn., Texas)  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By JOHN SOLOMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On their first day at Harvard Business School, a dean told the
students of the class of 1975 that what they would learn there
would prepare them less for the job they would take immediately
after graduation than the job they would have in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later, one of those students is up for a
big management position that has never been filled by someone with
such preparation. If he gets the job, George W. Bush would be the
first president with a master's degree in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not a part of his biography that he often discusses,
Bush is in many ways the archetypal Harvard Business School-trained
manager. As someone who went through the same training, 16 years
after Bush, I find it striking how his style _ generalist, big
picture, highly delegative _ is almost exactly in line with the
management approach taught at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But is that a good thing? Is a Harvard MBA appropriate training
for the presidency? How much of George W. Bush, presidential
candidate, is really a reflection of his Harvard years?
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``A Charge To Keep'' (William Morrow &AMP;
Co., 1999), Bush mentions his time at Harvard only briefly, calling
it ``a turning point for me'' that taught ``the principles of
capital, how it is accumulated, risked, spent, managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates and professors say that while the raw elements of
Bush management were in place when he arrived at Harvard, business
school had a significant role in melding his style.
</P>
<P>
   They remember a relaxed attitude and an unusual confidence that
stood out even in a class of some of America's most confident. They
scoff at the suggestion that Bush is not smart enough to be
president _ though, of course, that is not necessarily an impartial
view, given that his grades fell in the middle of the bell curve,
along with most of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was known as a quick study _ not a very deep thinker, but
an efficient one. In class, he was more of a listener than a
participant. (That may be why Bush left Harvard without having
substantially improved his extemporaneous speaking abilities,
though it also may be that heredity ultimately trumps business
school.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he distinguished himself more in team-oriented
activities. Whether in the campuswide business simulation game or
on the intramural basketball court, he was often the consensus
choice to run things.
</P>
<P>
   ``George's leadership was not based on raw brain power,''
recalled Mitch Kurz, a classmate who now runs his own marketing
consulting firm in Norwalk, Conn. ``He had an intangible quality
about him, that there wasn't a problem that couldn't be solved _
not necessarily by him, but somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   In 92 years of training presidents, Harvard Business School has
never trained a president of the United States. The MBA has not
been widely viewed as proper preparation for a career in politics,
in part because of the management failings of one of the school's
best and brightest: Robert S. McNamara, the former Defense
Secretary. But McNamara's quantitatively driven analytical style,
which led him astray in Vietnam, is actually antithetical to the
more broad-based, qualitative general management taught by Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a misperception _ even among many students in the
school _ that Harvard's management training is applicable solely to
business. It is true that a high percentage of the case studies
used in its courses are corporate situations. Most students come
from the private sector and return there upon graduation. But
Harvard Business School training is much more about process than
content; its problem-solving and decision-making methodology is
easily transferable to the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's class, that point was made presciently during
discussion of one of the very rare public-sector case studies, on
the paper flow in the office of Edward M. Kennedy, then as now a
senator from Massachusetts. Classmates said that when a student
challenged the case's relevance to a business degree, the professor
responded: Who knows? Someone in the class could end up as
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   From his seat in the top row, Bush _ often relied upon for humor
_ raised his arms over his head in a Nixonesque victory gesture.
</P>
<P>
   MBAs now in elective politics say that course work at business
school _ including marketing, finance, accounting and political
economy _ has become as relevant to governing as any other academic
training, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president,'' said Rep. Chet Edwards, a Texas Democrat who
graduated from the school in 1981, ``is the manager of the largest
and most powerful corporation in the world.'' Of course, the public
sector is different: there, popularity is a more important
performance criterion than profitability, and checks and balances
are not financial terms but constraints on executive authority.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Bush made a distinct impression on Section C,
the group of 84 students with whom he would go through his first
year of course work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the front row, and I heard this strange noise
coming from up behind me,'' Kurz recalled. ``I remember thinking,
`What the heck is that?' I turned around and there was George
spitting tobacco juice into a cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the school's forced grading curve, about 5 percent of the
800 or so students in each class will be asked to leave after the
first year. Early on, almost everyone thinks it might be him or
her. ``Plenty of students were scared out of their wits when they
got there,'' said Rudy Winston, who taught Human Behavior and
Organization to Section C that year.
</P>
<P>
   But not Bush, who was 27 and had just completed his service in
the Air National Guard when he arrived at Harvard. Winston
remembers entering the class the first day and seeing Bush flying
paper airplanes. ``George felt that this environment was something
he could handle,'' Winston said.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the three daily, 80-minute classes at the school, one
student is ``cold called'' to ``open'' with a five-minute action
plan and analysis of a case study, a well-researched narrative of a
real-life situation seen through an executive's eyes. A
free-for-all Socratic discussion follows, with classmates either
building upon or tearing apart the presentation. The stakes are
high, because class participation can count for up to 50 percent of
the grade _ not to mention the thrice-daily opportunity to
embarrass yourself in front of your peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case method relentlessly trains you come up with solutions
to problems,'' said Michael Porter, the Christensen Professor of
Administration, whose first teaching assignment at Harvard was
Bush's Section C class.
</P>
<P>
   The back row of the amphitheater-style classroom is called the
Sky Deck, and ``if the seating chart is an allegory, then George
was the perfect Sky Decker,'' said Charles Braxton, a section mate
who is now an energy company executive in Charlotte, N.C. ``He
wanted to take it all in, hear everybody and pick his spot to make
a big-picture comment.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It was in team activities that Bush asserted himself. In the
three-day, campuswide business simulation game, Section C elected
Bush one of six team presidents. His 15-person ``company'' did not
win, but Porter, the group's faculty supervisor, told the class
that it worked best together and would have had the best long-term
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a star academic performer here,'' said Porter, now
an economic policy adviser to the Bush campaign. ``But he was very
good at getting along with people and getting things done.''
</P>
<P>
   There was more evidence of those abilities in the highly
competitive intramural basketball league. Despite hoop skills that
one teammate described as ``mediocre at best,'' Bush, at point
guard, took control of a squad of more talented players.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schroer, a 6-foot-5 former college basketball standout,
acknowledged having been the toughest management challenge. ``I was
a prima donna. I know the rest of the guys appreciated that George
was able to get through to me,'' said Schroer, now vice president
of global marketing at the Ford Motor Co. ``Not too many people in
my life were able to whip me into shape.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-70s, distrust of the cold certitude of the McNamara
style _ expert-oriented management by numbers _ put a premium on
the consensus-building style of someone like Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was keenly aware that the model of putting the expert
_ the smartest guy _ in charge was changing,'' Braxton recalled.
``George was not leading from technical expertise. He was of the
new model that was not afraid of teamwork and of not knowing the
answer to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not yet announced if he will attend the 25th reunion of
his Harvard Business School class in late September, in the heat of
the presidential campaign. If he does, he can be assured his
classmates will be attentive to his comments during planned reunion
classes like ``Business and Politics Along the Technological
Frontier'' and ``National Economies in the Global Village.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened to him 25 years ago,'' Kurz joked. ``But the fact
that he could be the leader of the free world does give him a
little more credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gebhard, another Section C student who now runs a
metal-finishing company in Providence, R.I., even has a possible
campaign slogan ready: ``The lawyers and the generals have had
their chance. Why not give an MBA a shot?''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN IGNACIO, Mexico _ Chalk one up for the environmentalists.
Last March, a 5-year-old multinational environmental campaign
helped to stop the construction of what would have been the world's
largest salt plant. Destined for the shores of the San Ignacio
Lagoon in the pristine desert of southern Baja California, the
project was to be located within the borders of the largest nature
preserve in Latin America, the Vizcaino Biosphere Preserve. Home to
numerous endangered and threatened species, the preserve is a
Unesco world heritage site, a designation given only to spots with
``outstanding universal value.''
 &HT;    ``This shows that globalization has its positive side,'' says
Homero Aridjis, a Mexican poet who started the campaign against the
proposed plant in 1995. ``It is a triumph of life over commerce.''
 &HT;    Now that the battle has been won, there's work to be done. More
appropriate development schemes must be hatched to ensure the
long-term peaceful coexistence of the preserve and local
inhabitants. Additional measures will be necessary to ensure that
tourists don't chase away the area's most prized residents _ the
gray whale _ and to prevent poachers from threatening the other
endangered species in the park.
 &HT;    The salt plant was a project of Exportadora de Sal (Essa), a
joint venture between the Mexican government (51 percent) and
Japan's Mitsubishi (49 percent). Essa already runs a giant
50-year-old salt facility on another whale-inhabited lagoon some
200 kilometers up the coast from San Ignacio. The new project would
have entailed the construction of an enormous system of salt
evaporation ponds and dikes covering some 116 square miles, as well
as a mile-long loading pier.
 &HT;    Environmentalists had the charisma of one of nature's perennial
poster children on their side: the Pacific gray whale, which counts
the San Ignacio Lagoon among its few remaining breeding and
birthing grounds. In Baja, the baby ``friendly whales'' will even
glide up to boats to be petted, seemingly as curious about human
visitors as visitors are about them. That's quite a switch from
their 19th-century reputation as devil fish, an infamy stemming
from fierce attacks on whaling ships in defense of their young.
 &HT;    Even though environmentalists quietly conceded the whale would
probably be the creature least affected by the development, they
spun a global ``Save the Whale'' campaign around stopping the
project. The campaign enlisted the support of Hollywood actors,
Nobel laureates and thousands of school children, turning an
obscure piece of the dusty Mexican desert into a cause celebre.
 &HT;    In the end, the campaign, waged via consumer and investor
boycotts, the Internet, newspaper ads, billboards and a
letter-writing effort that sent more than 700,000 pieces of protest
mail to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and Mitsubishi, forced
the partners to abandon their plans. In early March, Zedillo
announced the project's cancellation, taking environmentalists by
surprise.
 &HT;    Zedillo maintained the Mexican government had decided to cancel
its plans not because the plant would harm the environment or to
appease environmentalists, but because it would alter the landscape
in unacceptably drastic ways. ``The environmental-impact statement
proves the salt plant would not have hurt in any way whales or any
other species in the preserve,'' he said. ``Nevertheless, the
preserve is a unique place in the world both for the species that
inhabit it and for its natural beauty, which we should preserve.''
He lashed out at environmentalists, accusing them of using the
project to ``gain fame and even to reap economic and political
benefits.''
 &HT;    James Brumm, a U.S.-based director of Mitsubishi, also claimed
the environmental-impact statement would have allowed the plan to
go forward. But he said his company had decided against the project
in favor of preserving the unique natural landscape. ``This would
very much alter the landscape, and ultimately the decision was made
that it is better to leave this as an untouched area for
eco-tourism and just for preserving the whole area,'' he said.
Nevertheless, Brumm told reporters that the company relented, at
least in part, due to public pressure.
 &HT;    While environmentalists say some 70 percent of the local
population was against the plant, fearful it would ruin their
fisheries business, the task remains to replace the 200-plus jobs,
paved roads, water and electricity service to Punto Abreojos, the
town that would have been the center of development.
 &HT;    To replace the economic boost that the salt plant would have
created, Zedillo promised that special projects would be started to
provide compensation for the communities that would have received
jobs and other benefits from the plant.
 &HT;    But that's a tall order. Essa had planned to invest some US$180
million in the construction of the plant and local infrastructure
upgrades. Indeed, in the 13,000-resident town adjacent to the
present salt plant, the company has provided a number of
improvements. It has helped to pave streets, plant trees and
develop better schools, hospitals, potable water systems and
sanitation services.
 &HT;    That's not all. The 1,000 plant workers and their families also
enjoy the benefits of two gyms, tennis courts, a scholarship
program for the children, a subsidized food store and an emergency
evacuation service for medical care unavailable in the town. About
half of the plant's well-compensated workers get an additional
perk: They live in company-owned houses that form an idyllic suburb
that resembles a piece of San Diego or Houston.
 &HT;    Finding other means of more compatible development may not be
easy. Baja California Sur Governor Leonel Cota Montano has said
that salt development was the area's only hope. The little town of
Punto Abreojos is across the lagoon from where the tourists board
boats to see the whales, and even eco-tourism is limited in its
appeal.
 &HT;    In the Ojo de Liebre lagoon up the coast, which attracts fewer
tourists (but more whales), whale-watching captain Carlos Barajas
Aguilera says his company used to see 8,000 visitors a year. But
six years ago, three other whale-watching companies started up. Now
he says that his outfit draws some 2,500 visitors a year.
 &HT;    More tourists might drive away the whales altogether. Paul
Dayton, professor of marine ecology at Scripps Institute of
Oceanography, says the whales may prefer the Ojo de Liebre lagoon

 &HT;    But aside from the fisheries and eco-tourism businesses, there
are few other options. The landscape is too dry for agriculture or
ranching. Indeed, the area just endured a six-year drought. Without
job creation, the area's two illicit sources of employment _
poaching and drug smuggling _ may swell.
 &HT;    Poaching is already a serious problem facing some of the
preserve's endangered animals, particularly the pronghorn antelope

land and sea vessels and funding for ranger positions for poacher
prevention and apprehension programs. These efforts would be
carried out in conjunction with the already-in-progress local
anti-poaching education campaigns.
 &HT;    Environmentalist groups say they are committed to helping the
locals build a better life, but through compatible and sustainable
development. ``We don't want to just declare victory and abandon
the area,'' Spalding says. That's a nice thought. But the area will
probably also require another concerted international effort to
pull it from the grip of poverty and ensure the survival of the
park.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN IGNACIO, Mexico _ Chalk one up for the environmentalists.
Last March, a 5-year-old multinational environmental campaign
helped to stop the construction of what would have been the world's
largest salt plant. Destined for the shores of the San Ignacio
Lagoon in the pristine desert of southern Baja California, the
project was to be located within the borders of the largest nature
preserve in Latin America, the Vizcaino Biosphere Preserve. Home to
numerous endangered and threatened species, the preserve is a
Unesco world heritage site, a designation given only to spots with
``outstanding universal value.''
 &HT;    ``This shows that globalization has its positive side,'' says
Homero Aridjis, a Mexican poet who started the campaign against the
proposed plant in 1995. ``It is a triumph of life over commerce.''
 &HT;    Now that the battle has been won, there's work to be done. More
appropriate development schemes must be hatched to ensure the
long-term peaceful coexistence of the preserve and local
inhabitants. Additional measures will be necessary to ensure that
tourists don't chase away the area's most prized residents _ the
gray whale _ and to prevent poachers from threatening the other
endangered species in the park.
 &HT;    The salt plant was a project of Exportadora de Sal (Essa), a
joint venture between the Mexican government (51 percent) and
Japan's Mitsubishi (49 percent). Essa already runs a giant
50-year-old salt facility on another whale-inhabited lagoon some
200 kilometers up the coast from San Ignacio. The new project would
have entailed the construction of an enormous system of salt
evaporation ponds and dikes covering some 116 square miles, as well
as a mile-long loading pier.
 &HT;    Environmentalists had the charisma of one of nature's perennial
poster children on their side: the Pacific gray whale, which counts
the San Ignacio Lagoon among its few remaining breeding and
birthing grounds. In Baja, the baby ``friendly whales'' will even
glide up to boats to be petted, seemingly as curious about human
visitors as visitors are about them. That's quite a switch from
their 19th-century reputation as devil fish, an infamy stemming
from fierce attacks on whaling ships in defense of their young.
 &HT;    Even though environmentalists quietly conceded the whale would
probably be the creature least affected by the development, they
spun a global ``Save the Whale'' campaign around stopping the
project. The campaign enlisted the support of Hollywood actors,
Nobel laureates and thousands of school children, turning an
obscure piece of the dusty Mexican desert into a cause celebre.
 &HT;    In the end, the campaign, waged via consumer and investor
boycotts, the Internet, newspaper ads, billboards and a
letter-writing effort that sent more than 700,000 pieces of protest
mail to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and Mitsubishi, forced
the partners to abandon their plans. In early March, Zedillo
announced the project's cancellation, taking environmentalists by
surprise.
 &HT;    Zedillo maintained the Mexican government had decided to cancel
its plans not because the plant would harm the environment or to
appease environmentalists, but because it would alter the landscape
in unacceptably drastic ways. ``The environmental-impact statement
proves the salt plant would not have hurt in any way whales or any
other species in the preserve,'' he said. ``Nevertheless, the
preserve is a unique place in the world both for the species that
inhabit it and for its natural beauty, which we should preserve.''
He lashed out at environmentalists, accusing them of using the
project to ``gain fame and even to reap economic and political
benefits.''
 &HT;    James Brumm, a U.S.-based director of Mitsubishi, also claimed
the environmental-impact statement would have allowed the plan to
go forward. But he said his company had decided against the project
in favor of preserving the unique natural landscape. ``This would
very much alter the landscape, and ultimately the decision was made
that it is better to leave this as an untouched area for
eco-tourism and just for preserving the whole area,'' he said.
Nevertheless, Brumm told reporters that the company relented, at
least in part, due to public pressure.
 &HT;    While environmentalists say some 70 percent of the local
population was against the plant, fearful it would ruin their
fisheries business, the task remains to replace the 200-plus jobs,
paved roads, water and electricity service to Punto Abreojos, the
town that would have been the center of development.
 &HT;    To replace the economic boost that the salt plant would have
created, Zedillo promised that special projects would be started to
provide compensation for the communities that would have received
jobs and other benefits from the plant.
 &HT;    But that's a tall order. Essa had planned to invest some US$180
million in the construction of the plant and local infrastructure
upgrades. Indeed, in the 13,000-resident town adjacent to the
present salt plant, the company has provided a number of
improvements. It has helped to pave streets, plant trees and
develop better schools, hospitals, potable water systems and
sanitation services.
 &HT;    That's not all. The 1,000 plant workers and their families also
enjoy the benefits of two gyms, tennis courts, a scholarship
program for the children, a subsidized food store and an emergency
evacuation service for medical care unavailable in the town. About
half of the plant's well-compensated workers get an additional
perk: They live in company-owned houses that form an idyllic suburb
that resembles a piece of San Diego or Houston.
 &HT;    Finding other means of more compatible development may not be
easy. Baja California Sur Governor Leonel Cota Montano has said
that salt development was the area's only hope. The little town of
Punto Abreojos is across the lagoon from where the tourists board
boats to see the whales, and even eco-tourism is limited in its
appeal.
 &HT;    In the Ojo de Liebre lagoon up the coast, which attracts fewer
tourists (but more whales), whale-watching captain Carlos Barajas
Aguilera says his company used to see 8,000 visitors a year. But
six years ago, three other whale-watching companies started up. Now
he says that his outfit draws some 2,500 visitors a year.
 &HT;    More tourists might drive away the whales altogether. Paul
Dayton, professor of marine ecology at Scripps Institute of
Oceanography, says the whales may prefer the Ojo de Liebre lagoon
precisely because there are fewer tourists.
 &HT;    But aside from the fisheries and eco-tourism businesses, there
are few other options. The landscape is too dry for agriculture or
ranching. Indeed, the area just endured a six-year drought. Without
job creation, the area's two illicit sources of employment _
poaching and drug smuggling _ may swell.
 &HT;    Poaching is already a serious problem facing some of the
preserve's endangered animals, particularly the pronghorn antelope
and black sea turtles. ``The antelope are poached constantly, and
the turtles are just hanging on by a thread,'' Dayton says. Without
raising regional incomes, he adds, poaching may get worse.
 &HT;    Mark Spalding, a lawyer and adviser to the International Fund
for Animal Welfare, says one hope is to provide more and faster
land and sea vessels and funding for ranger positions for poacher
prevention and apprehension programs. These efforts would be
carried out in conjunction with the already-in-progress local
anti-poaching education campaigns.
 &HT;    Environmentalist groups say they are committed to helping the
locals build a better life, but through compatible and sustainable
development. ``We don't want to just declare victory and abandon
the area,'' Spalding says. That's a nice thought. But the area will
probably also require another concerted international effort to
pull it from the grip of poverty and ensure the survival of the
park.

GOP IS WORKING TO AVOID ANOTHER BUDGET FIASCO 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It seems as if two sequels are being produced in
Washington these days.
</P>
<P>
   In front of Union Station, the city's main railroad terminal,
camera crews have been busily filming ``Hannibal,'' the follow-on
to the hit movie ``Silence of the Lambs.'' In the Capitol a few
blocks away and in the White House down Pennsylvania Avenue,
Republicans and Democrats seem to be making a reprise of last
year's budget battle.
</P>
<P>
   In their drama, however, Republicans are fervently hoping for a
happier outcome, praying that in the end President Clinton _ their
version of the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter _ will not eat them
for lunch again.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, speed is the watchword, especially in the
House: Pass spending bills quickly so that ample time is allowed to
negotiate a final budget deal with the president, who has already
threatened to veto six of the 13 spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to negotiate with the president, and we have to
negotiate with the president,'' said Bill Young, the amiable
Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee. ``But if you don't pass bills before September and
October, you don't have time to leisurely negotiate with the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations are expected to be contentious. With the veto
threats, the White House complains that the bills provide $23
billion less than what Clinton has requested and scale back some of
the president's favorite programs, such as providing more money for
classroom teachers and setting aside more land for national
monuments.
</P>
<P>
   With the Treasury awash in a budget surplus, Clinton and his
advisers feel they are on firm policy and political grounds to
oppose what they see as Republican miserliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time of affluence, in a time of surplus, you make
different kinds of judgments than you do when you're facing a
crippling deficit,'' said Jack Lew, director of the Office of
Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   So far, House leaders have been making good on their promise.
With the expected passage Friday of a spending bill to fund the
Interior Department, the Environment Protection Agency and other
agencies, the House has approved four spending measures, and its
leaders predict that all 13 spending measures will be cleared for
action on the floor by the time the House adjourns for its July 4
recess.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Senate has approved three spending measures,
though providing money at far different levels from the House
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, action has been slower in the Senate, and the House
leaders have been able to maintain unity on the measures only by
convincing some of their moderate members to vote for measures just
to keep the process going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're replaying a record that has been played for each of the
previous three years,'' said Robert Reischauer, the former head of
the Congressional Budget Office. ``The year starts off with the
Republican leadership saying, `This year will be different. We'll
get the appropriations bills through in a timely fashion and use
the month of September and maybe a little bit of October to
negotiate with the White House.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what happens is that the press of other business slows
things down, and divisions within the Republican Party slows things
down.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey acknowledges a certain
inevitability in this year's budget fight, saying that the
``essential model will be the same.'' But Armey disputes the idea
that the Republicans were routed last year. ``The president is the
biggest spin doctor in this town,'' he said. ``We got some of what
we wanted. They got some of what they wanted. But they jumped up
and down celebrating like they won the whole ball of wax.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Republicans who have been critical of their party's
leaders in the past say they have little choice but to follow the
course they have set. If the Republicans crafted spending bills
that would attract the support of Democrats and the president, they
would lose the backing of conservative Republicans, possibly
ensuring that no measures were approved. That could lead to a
government shutdown, which Republican leaders fear most.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's their alternative?'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who
has often been at odds with his leadership. ``If they get one or
two Democrats, they would lose five to 10 Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Looming over Congress as it completes its constitutionally
required work on spending bills that allow the government to
continue operating are the coming elections. With all of the House
and one-third of the Senate up for re-election, lawmakers are eager
to finish their work and return home to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And many lawmakers are well aware that with Republicans holding
a wafer-thin six-vote majority in the House and lacking the ability
to break a filibuster in the Senate, Congress has achieved little
this session. Measures such as a patients' bill of rights,
liberalization of trade with China and reform of election law have
languished.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the spending bills have become magnets for the
ideological and policy divisions that are always found in Congress.
Vetoes have been threatened not only because the White House feels
Republican spending bills do not provide enough money for programs
but also because a number of the measures contain amendments known
as riders which do things like blocking agencies such as Veterans
Affairs or Health and Human Services from transferring money to the
Justice Department to help its suit against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Armey's assurances, congressional Republicans want to
avoid a repeat of last year, when Congress and the White House did
not put the final touches on the last spending bills until Nov. 19,
49 days after the fiscal year began on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the crush of last-minute negotiations, with the threat of a
government shutdown looming over their heads, and needing to ladle
out pork-barrel projects to bring reluctant lawmakers on board,
Republican leaders eventually agreed to a budget that was over $30
billion more than the limits placed on spending by the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Such an explosion in spending is heatedly opposed by a small
group of House Republicans who call themselves the Conservative
Action Team and are known on the Hill as the ``cats.'' With the
Republicans holding only a slim majority, the lawmakers have
tremendous sway with the House leaders, who know they can scuttle
any bill by withdrawing their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that bodes well for us is that we've only got a
six-vote majority, and I'm going to stretch that as much as I can
to not spend your grandchildren's money,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., a leading voice among the ``cats.''

SOSA   TAKES A SWING AT TRADE RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sure, they still love Sammy in Chicago, but judging by
the banner in the window of the souvenir shop across the street
from Wrigley Field, the unthinkable has become the anticipated:
</P>
<P>
   ``SAMMY SOSA CLEARANCE SALE.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is almost as unmistakable as Sosa's gesture to his
fans: Tap your heart, blow a kiss, tap your heart again, and blow
out the candles on Sosa's reign as the Cubs' most beloved player.
Those Cubs jerseys with Sosa's name stitched on the back are about
to become collector's items.
</P>
<P>
   The team won't say it and neither will the slugger, who Friday
was visibly annoyed friend Manny Alexander was saying it, but there
is a growing sense Sosa will be traded before the July 31 trading
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have no problem here,'' Sosa said Friday morning to
the daily cluster of reporters that gather around his locker. ``I'm
employed like everybody else. I'm here. I'm here. (itals)I'm
here.(unitals)''
</P>
<P>
   It was true. To borrow the pet phrase of Pedro Martinez, his
across-the-street neighbor in Santo Domingo and rumored future
teammate, Sammy was in the house. Before the game, with batting
practice canceled because of rain, he sat at his locker next to the
biggest boombox in the clubhouse, speaking up when he could no
longer bear an especially slow Michael Jackson ballad. ``What
happened, did somebody die in here?'' he asked no one in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter from Boston mentioned having spoken to
Alexander, the former Cub and Sosa pal who said the slugger wants
to come to Boston, Sosa grew edgy. ``I don't think it was
appropriate, what he said,'' Sosa said. ``I'm not saying what he
said was wrong. But I'll talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was just getting warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Manny, but I didn't tell him to say anything,''
Sosa said. ``Whatever he's saying, he's saying from his point, not
my point. It's possible I could go a lot of places. Manny is not
here no more. He's happy in case something happens, but nothing has
happened. I don't know where I'm going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe everything is going to settle down. If not, I don't
have any control over it. Manny's not my agent. He said something
he's not supposed to be saying. There are rumors all over, and one
of the things I'm trying to correct is that he cannot say something
like that because he's not my agent.''
</P>
<P>
   At no time, however, did Sosa suggest Alexander had falsely
quoted him, or attributed thoughts to him that were not his own. He
just didn't appreciate Alexander sharing his confidences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be talking no more,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the skies parted and the stands filled, Sosa sprinted
out to his position in right field, like he does every game, and
greeted his admirers in the bleachers. He singled in his first
at-bat, then came up with the bases loaded and cleared them with an
opposite-field triple, hustling around the bases like a man who had
a plane to catch.
</P>
<P>
   The three RBIs in the Cubs' 9-8 win over the Expos gave Sosa
1,002 for his career. He has 61 RBIs in the Cubs' first 65 games
and he should easily knock in 100 runs for the sixth straight
season. He and Hall of Famer Hack Wilson are the only Cubs ever to
do so in five straight.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't hit a home run in a week, but he has 19 home runs this
season and has hit 148 home runs since Opening Day 1998, a number
second to Mark McGwire. And since a 3-for-28 start through seven
games, Sosa is batting .335 (76 for 227) in his last 59 games,
including Friday's 2 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't he still be here? ``I'm one of his closest
friends,'' said Cubs outfielder Glenallen Hill, ``and Sammy doesn't
want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be pretty hard to trade Sammy. When you look at what his
value is on and off the field, it's unbelievable. This guy's an
icon. He makes a lot of money for everybody. What I'd like to see
is Sammy Sosa finish his career as a Chicago Cub. He loves it
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's as clear to Hill as it is to the owner of the souvenir
shop across the street why that is unlikely to happen. ``With
Sammy,'' Hill said. ``It's just about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who will turn 32 in Nov. 12, is being paid $10 million
this seson, $11 million in 2001. He will be a free agent after
next year. Sosa would like a contract extension that will pay him
$15 million to $20 million a year, which would make him the game's
highest-paid player _ at least until Alex Rodriguez signs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who are a fourth-place team even with Sosa, say they
haven't decided what they intend to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can trade him, extend him, or let the contract run its
course,'' said Cubs general manager Ed Lynch. ``It's too early to
say what we're going to do. It's not like we have to trade him. But
if there is a deal that makes us noticeably better, it's my job to
listen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But privately, numerous baseball sources believe the Cubs
already have made the decision not to grant him a contract
extension. Trade Sosa? Like Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said,
plenty of superstars have been dealt before, including McGwire, the
slugger with whom Sosa has conducted celebrated home run duels in
each of the last two seasons. The Cubs are also the team that
couldn't pay enough to keep pitcher Greg Maddux from escaping as a
free agent to Atlanta, where he won three more Cy Young Awards to
add to the one he'd already won in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they've been one of those teams that have been
willing to pay one player a third of their budget,'' Hill said. ``I
think that's something they would try to steer away from.''
</P>
<P>
   One Chicago newspaper columnist even ventured into grassy-knoll
territory, suggesting the Tribune Company, which owns the ball
club, was using its flagship newspaper to cast aspersions at Sosa
so that Cubs fans would be more receptive to a deal involving the
city's most popular athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's trade value may never be higher, and there are some
deep-pockets clubs that have indicated a willingness to enter the
bidding for his services, namely the Yankees, Red Sox, and Mets.
One of those teams is likely to package the three or four players
it will take to acquire Sosa, who may be better suited to finish
his career in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are high-profile players involved,'' Lynch said,
``you have people who are calling to say, `I just want to be able
to say that I did,' '' Lynch said. ``You can tell their interest is
lukewarm at best. Then you have other people who, based on your
previous dealings with them and based on the tone of the
conversation, you know they're players in the thing and they want
to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask the question, in any trade, `Is it worth me getting my
people out there to look at your system?' If the guy says, `Yeah,'
right away, then you know they're serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox obviously fit in the latter category. Friday night,
Cubs scouts were in Pawtucket. They've already done their homework
on the Yankees and Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa will command a package of at least three players, and more
likely four, with at least one already in the big leagues. ``The
Cubs can't trade the guy for players who may someday play in the
big leagues,'' one source said. ``They have to be getting someone
of impact in return. It wouldn't surprise me if the Cubs ask the
Sox for (Carl) Everett, for example, even if they know they can't
get him. (Trot) Nixon is a better possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch refused to speculate on what he would want in return for
Sosa. ``I can do everything I want to determine the value of a
player, but the other people are going to determine his value, what
the demand is on their end. The offers that come in for any player
determine what his value is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch cautioned if a trade does happen, it will need time to
take place. ``The Red Sox have been talking about a righthanded
power hitter for years over there,'' said Damon Buford, who played
two seasons for the Red Sox before coming here in a trade for
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the premier power hitters of the last century.
This is just me talking, but for what the Red Sox want over there,
I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sosa had a very public dispute with manager Don
Baylor, who had questioned the outfielder's defensive skills and
had suggested he steal more bases. They later had a clear-the-air
session, but it may be an uneasy truce at best. How does that
impact on whether Sosa stays with the Cubs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrelevant,'' said one Cubs player. ``This is all about
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   The souvenir shop across the street is not alone in weighing in
on Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``A player of his caliber, everybody's got an opinion about
Sammy Sosa,'' Lynch said. ``Good or bad, there's no indifference
out there, and justifiably so. He's the most visible player in the
National League at this point, other than Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth was sold. Reggie Jackson was traded. Frank Robinson.
Mark McGwire. Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Even Manny Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   There's a shop window in Chicago betting Sosa's name will be on
that list, too, and soon.

 WASHINGTON: the ``cats.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week's action on a spending bill to fund the departments of
Health and Human Services, Labor, and Education, and other social
services agencies, displayed all the promise and the potential
pitfalls of the Republicans' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The massive $342 billion measure _ the largest of the 13
spending bills _ is traditionally a lightning rod for fights over
health and education policy, even though 71 per cent of its funds
goes to programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Last year the bill was
so controversial that the House never approved it, instead rolling
it into a larger, broad-based spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   This year Republicans were determined to push the bill through.
The amount allocated to the bill's discretionary programs _ nearly
$6 billion less than what Clinton had requested _ was small enough
to placate conservatives. Republican moderates and heads of the
appropriations committees grumbled, but they held out the hope that
in negotiations with the White House later this year more money
would be found for some of their pet programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some areas in some of the bills already passed, and
some that are coming up, where we could use some extra money,''
said Young.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the measure moved towards passage, Democrats were
relishing using those votes against Republicans in marginal
districts. ``This is an important day for us on the road to winning
back the House,'' said Laura Nichols, spokeswoman for House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. She added, ``We think it's going to
come back to haunt them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, however, conservatives used a parliamentary
maneuver Tuesday night to strip the bill of the ``emergency
spending'' designation for $500 million in funds for public health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Without that emergency designation the measure was not half a
billion dollars over the limit. Young's staff scrambled to find a
way to keep the measure within the spending limits, finally
settling on an amendment to cut by 0.6 percent all discretionary
programs covered by the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But when Democrats released a list of how much that cut would
affect popular programs like funding for the National Institutes of
Health, Pell Grants and Head Start, Republican moderates revolted
and, much to the dismay of their conservative brethren, helped
defeat the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six-tenths of 1 percent!'' said Coburn incredulously. ``We
couldn't even live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the $500 million in public health funds safe for now, even
though it will mean cutting that amount out of another spending
bill later, the House leaders put the spending bill up for a vote.
But even then its passage was rocky. At the end of the 15-minute
voting period the measure looked as if it was going down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders held the voting time open a few extra
minutes and rounded up enough votes to pass the bill by a scant
three votes. Clinton has said he will veto the bill.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN IGNACIO, Mexico _ Los ambientalistas se han anotado un
tanto. En Marzo, una campana internacional que duro cinco anos
contribuyo a detener la construccion de lo que habria sido la mayor
salinera del mundo, a orillas de la Laguna de San Ignacio, en el
desierto del sur de Baja California, dentro la Reserva de la
Biosfera del Vizcaino, la mayor de Latinoamerica. La reserva, donde
viven numerosas especies en peligro de extincion, fue designada
Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la UNESCO, designacion que solo se
da a lugares ``de sobresaliente valor universal.''
 &HT;    ``Esto muestra que la globalizacion tiene su lado positivo,''
dijo Homero Aridjis, poeta mexicano que inicio una campana contra
la planta propuesta en 1995. ``Es un triunfo de la vida sobre el
comercio.''
 &HT;    Ahora que la batalla se ha ganado, hay un gran trabajo por
hacer. Hay que trazar planes de desarrollo que garanticen la
coexistencia pacifica a largo plazo de la fauna y los seres humanos
en la reserva. Haran falta mas medidas para que los turistas no
alejen al habitante mas preciado de la zona, la ballena gris, y
para impedir que los cazadores clandestinos amenacen a otras
especies de la reserva.
 &HT;    La salinera era un proyecto de Exportadora de Sal (Essa), una
empresa conjunta entre el gobierno mexicano (51 por ciento) y la
compania japonesa Mitsubishi (49 por ciento). Essa ya opera una
gigantesca salinera construida hace 50 anos en otra laguna habitada
por ballenas, unos 200 kilometros costa arriba de San Ignacio. La
nueva obra habria dado lugar a la construccion de un enorme sistema
de lagunas y diques para el proceso de obtener sal a partir de la
evaporacion del agua de mar. El sistema habria medido 300
kilometros cuadrados, con un muelle de kilometro y medio.
 &HT;    Los ambientalistas tenian a su favor el carisma ecologico de la
ballena gris del Pacifico, a la que le quedan pocos sitios de
apareamiento y reproduccion, uno de ellos la Laguna de San Ignacio.
En Baja, los amistosos bebes de las ballenas se acercan a las
embarcaciones para que los mimen, al parecer tan curiosos como los
mismos visitantes. Se trata de un gran cambio: en el siglo XIX,
tenian una fama infundada de animales diabolicos, una falacia
causada por los fieros ataques de los cetaceos contra los barcos
balleneros en defensa de su prole.
 &HT;    Aunque los ambientalistas aceptaron discretamente que la ballena
probablemente seria el animal menos afectado por la obra, lanzaron
una campana internacional llamada ``Salvemos a la ballena,'' que
conto con el apoyo de actores de Hollywood, ganadores del premio
Nobel y miles de escolares. Una zona remota del desierto mexicano
adquirio subita celebridad.
 &HT;    Al final, la campana, que incluyo boicots a inversionistas y
consumidores, la Internet, anuncios en periodicos y vallas, y mas
de 700.000 cartas de protesta al presidente mexicano Ernesto
Zedillo y Mitsubishi, obligo a los socios a abandonar sus planes. A
principios de marzo, para sorpresa de los ambientalistas, Zedillo
anuncio la cancelacion del proyecto.
 &HT;    Zedillo sostuvo que el gobierno habia decidido cancelar sus
planes no porque la planta habria danado el medio ambiente ni para
aplacar a los ambientalistas, sno porque alteraria el paisaje en
una forma inaceptable. ``El informe del impacto sobre el ambiente
demuestra que la salinera no habria afectado en modo alguno a las
ballenas, ni a ninguna otra especie de la reserva,'' dijo. ``Sin
embargo, la reserva es un lugar unico en el mundo tanto por las
especies que la habitan como por su belleza natural, que debemos
conservar.'' Fustigo a los ecologistas, acusandolos de usar el
proyecto para ``ganar fama y hasta para conseguir ventajas
economicas y politicas.''
 &HT;    James Brumm, director de Mitsubishi radicado en Estados Unidos,
tambien afirmo que el resultado del estudigico permitia el
desarrollo del proyecto. Pero dijo que su compania habia decidido
no realizar la obra para preservar el singular paisaje. ``Habria
alterado mucho el paisaje, y al final se decidio que era mejor
dejar esta zona virgen para el ecoturismo y para conservar toda la
region,'' dijo. Sin embargo, Brumm reconoce que la compania cedio,
al menos en parte, debido al clamor publico.
 &HT;    Mientras los ambientalistas dicen que el 70 por ciento de la
poblacion local estaba contra la planta, debido al temor de que la
salinera arruinara la pesca, ahora queda la tarea de reemplazar los
mas de 200 puestos de trabajo, los caminos pavimentados, el
servicio de agua y electricidad a Punto Abreojos, el pueblo que
habria sido el centro de la obra.
 &HT;    Zedillo prometio que se crearian obras especiales para compensar
a las comunidades que habrian conseguido empleos y otras ventajas
economicas de la salinera.
 &HT;    Pero sera dificil. Essa planeaba invertir US$180 millones en la
construccion de la planta y en mejoras a la infraestructura local.
En efecto, en el pueblo de 13.000 habitantes contiguo a la salinera
actual, la compania ha pavimentado las calles, ha plantado arboles
y mejorado escuelas, hospitales, el suministro de agua potable y
los servicios de higiene publica.
 &HT;    Eso no es todo. Los mil trabajadores de la planta y sus
familiares tambien disfrutan de dos gimnasios, canchas de tenis, un
programa de becas para los ninos, un mercado subsidiado y cuentan
con un servicio de evacuacion de emergencia para recibir atencion
medica fuera del pueblo. Alrededor de la mitad de los bien pagados
trabajadores de la planta tienen otra ventaja: viven en casas
propiedad de la compania que forman un suburbio idilico que
recuerda a San Diego o a Houston.
 &HT;    No sera facil hallar otros medios de desarrollo. El gobernador
de Baja California Sur, Leonel Cota Montano, dice que la salinera
era la unica esperanza de la zona. Punta Abreojos esta en la orilla
del lago frente al sitio donde los turistas salen para ver las
ballenas, y hasta el ecoturismo tiene un atractivo limitado.
 &HT;    En la laguna de Ojo de Liebre, mas arriba y que atrae a menos
turistas (pero a mas ballenas), Carlos Barajas Aguilera, capitan de
un barco que lleva a los turistas a ver a los cetaceos, dice que su
compania atendia a 8.000 visitantes al ano. Pero hace seis anos
abrieron otras empresas dedicadas al mismo negocio y ahora la
compania de Barajas solo recibe 2.500 visitantes.
 &HT;    Un numero mayor de turistas podria alejar a las ballenas. Paul
Dayton, profesor de Ecologia Marina en el Instituto Oceanografico
Scripps, dice que las ballenas quiza prefieren la laguna de Ojo de
Liebre precisamente porque hay menos turistas.
 &HT;    Pero ademas de la pesca y del ecoturismo, no hay muchas
opcines. El lugar es demasiado seco para la agricultura o la
ganaderia, y acaba de sufrir una sequia de seis anos. Sin creacion
de empleos, podrian aumentar las dos fuentes de empleos ilicitos:
la caza furtiva y el narcotrafico.
 &HT;    La caza furtiva es un problema grave que afecta a los animales
en peligro de extincion, sobre todo a los antilopes y las tortugas.
``Constantemente estan cazando antilopes, y el futuro de las
tortugas cuelga de un hilo,'' dice Dayton. Agrega que si no
aumentan los ingresos de la region, la caza furtiva podria
empeorar.
 &HT;    Mark Spalding, abogado y asesor del Fondo Internacional de
Bienestar de los Animales, dice que se necesitan mas vehiculos y
embarcaciones para perseguir a los cazadores furtivos. La accion
policial iria acompanada de campanas de concienciacion contra la
caza furtiva, que ya estan en marcha.
 &HT;    Los ambientalistas dicen que quieren ayudar a los vecinos a
vivir mejor, pero mediante un desarrollo sustentable y compatible
con la zona. ``No queremos declarar victoria y abandonar la
region,'' senala Spalding. Son buenas intenciones, pero la zona
probablemente necesitara otra campana internacional para sacarla de
las garras de la pobreza y garantizar la supervivencia del parque.

``Constantemente estan cazando antilopes, y el futuro de las
tortugas cuelga de un hilo,'' dice Dayton. Agrega que si no
aumentan los ingresos de la region, la caza furtiva podria
empeorar.
 &HT;    Mark Spalding, abogado y asesor del Fondo Internacional de
Bienestar de los Animales, dice que se necesitan mas vehiculos y
embarcaciones para perseguir a los cazadores furtivos. La accion
policial iria acompanada de campanas de concienciacion contra la
caza furtiva, que ya estan en marcha.
 &HT;    Los ambientalistas dicen que quieren ayudar a los vecinos a
vivir mejor, pero mediante un desarrollo sustentable y compatible
con la zona. ``No queremos declarar victoria y abandonar la
region,'' senala Spalding. Son buenas intenciones, pero la zona
probablemente necesitara otra campana internacional para sacarla de
las garras de la pobreza y garantizar la supervivencia del parque.

AS OFFICE SNOOPING GROWS, WHO WATCHES THE WATCHERS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except for the shouting, it is becoming clear that the debate
over employee privacy is over.
</P>
<P>
   The American Management Association conducts an annual survey on
electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace, and the
latest results, released a few weeks ago, show that widespread,
routine snooping on employees is no longer a threat but a fact.
Nearly three-quarters of the large American companies that
responded to the survey said they actively record and review at
least one of the following: employees' phone calls, e-mail,
Internet connections and computer files. That is twice the rate of
snooping as in 1997. One company in four has fired an employee over
what the surveillance turned up.
</P>
<P>
   So the ethical quandary over whether to monitor will soon be
moot. Factors like fear of sexual harassment litigation, lost
employee productivity and theft of proprietary data and software
have swamped any hesitations about privacy. It is almost a cinch
that your employer will be having a peek at what you're up to _ if
not today, then tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   If monitoring is a given, a new challenge for employers takes
center stage: setting up a monitoring system that is ethical and
fair to all employees, and not merely defensible in court.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue, of course, is: Who will do the monitoring? And that
is where things get sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Two approaches are possible. Monitoring could become a full-time
job for a person or department, or could be made a sidelight among
other responsibilities. Each presents problems.
</P>
<P>
   When policing co-workers is someone's main job, human nature
creates a real danger. The designated monitor will have every
incentive to find problems to justify his or her job, said Ben
Fairweather, a research fellow at the Center for Computing and
Social Responsibility in Leicester, England. Once the egregious
offenders are weeded out, an effective monitoring program can
easily devolve into a wild, self-perpetuating array of witch hunts
and speed traps _ an ethically unjustifiable state of affairs,
however one may feel about monitoring in the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   More often, monitoring is assigned to people or departments that
mainly do something else. Typically, the job goes to
information-technology people, for no better reason than that they
are usually the only ones who have the necessary access to hardware
and software and know how it all works, on the snoop's side as well
as the user's.
</P>
<P>
   But think again of human nature. Making snooping a sideline is
likely to lead to wild inconsistency, occasional incompetence or
outright capriciousness in the way monitoring is applied and
policies are enforced.
</P>
<P>
   I don't meant to suggest that technical people are reckless or
capricious. Only a fool would make such an observation and expect
his office Internet connection to ever work smoothly again.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the do-it-in-your-spare-time approach is doomed
from the outset. People will naturally devote most of their time
and attention to their principal responsibilities _ the ones that
figure in whether they get promotions and raises _ and turn to
monitoring only when they have the time and inclination.
Inevitably, that means inconsistent enforcement, which can be worse
than none at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, in all areas of corporate management, the idea of
having a policy is a good one, but it's not enough,'' said Jeffrey
Neuburger, a lawyer specializing in technology-related issues at
Brown Raysman Millstein Felder &AMP; Steiner, a Manhattan firm. ``If
you don't enforce it, you're almost better off not having a policy,
because you get charged with this standard that you're telling the
world that you're going to live under.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger's point is one both of fairness and of vulnerability
in court. A company sued by an employee over a claim of sexual
harassment can find itself in trouble, for example, if it can be
demonstrated that the company adopted a policy against viewing
Internet pornography on office computers but did not consistently
enforce the policy. It won't do much for the company's defense to
have some harried systems analyst testify that checking the logs
for naughty downloads was item No. 137 on her weekly to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   A survey earlier this year by Elron Software, a publisher of
monitoring software, shows that Internet policy enforcement is far
from airtight. One-tenth of workers responding to the survey said
they had seen co-workers viewing adult Web sites on the job; more
than half of that 10 percent said their companies had explicit
policies forbidding it.
</P>
<P>
   If full-time snoops are prone to overzealousness and part-timers
to inconsistency, what is the right way to manage routine
monitoring? There isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical approach is to use snooping the way the police are
supposed to use searches and telephone taps: only when warranted.
``There might be a need for monitoring, but only after the
organization has good grounds for suspecting that there is abuse,''
Fairweather said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he snoops fairest who snoops least, and then
only with cause.
</P>

BOSTON UNIVERSITY FOUNDS COMPANY TO SIFT LEADING HEART DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa.)   By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what some call a taste of the future of genetic medicine,
Boston University has created a company to analyze a valuable cache
of medical data from a federally financed study that has lasted 52
years. The university expects that companies will want to use the
data to facilitate the search for new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the Framingham Heart Study, is administered by the
university under contract with the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute. Begun in 1948, it has followed thousands of residents of
the town of Framingham, Mass., gathering medical data about them
and, more recently, storing DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The data have always been public, and will continue to be freely
available to researchers who request them, the university
explained. And the study's participants, who are anonymous, will
remain so.
</P>
<P>
   But the new company, Framingham Genomic Medicine, supported by
$21 million from venture capitalists, will assemble the study's
data in ways useful to companies or scientists. For example,
researchers seeking clues to genes and environments that protect
against heart disease will be able to sift through participants'
medical histories and genetic data to home in on the information
they want.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University expects to own about 20 percent of the
company's stock, said David Lampe, a university spokesman. In
addition to that 20 percent, Lampe said, the university will donate
some stock to a trust that will be administered for the benefit of
participants in the Framingham study, a way of compensating people
who have cooperated in the effort for so many years without any
payment.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the arrangement are still being worked out, with
crucial features, like an ethics adviser to represent the research
participants themselves, still under discussion. But the company
and the university are confident that the remaining questions can
be resolved. And others said the agreement was a natural
consequence of medicine's increasing thirst for data that can link
medical and genetic information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a new era,'' said Dr. Arthur Holden,
chairman and chief executive of the SNP Consortium, a collaboration
of 14 companies, mostly drug makers, that are creating a publicly
available map of the human genome, concentrating on individual
places on DNA where people differ. ``The demand for genetic
databases is beginning to increase, and many of the leading
university centers are beginning to think about how they can
commercialize their samples and data sets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative by Boston University could be a boon to
medical science, said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. There is no study like the one in
Framingham, with more than 12,000 participants who have faithfully
come in over the years for regular medical exams and have willingly
provided all the information that investigators request. The
problem has been taking that vast and complex set of data and
extracting information from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 50 years of data that are sitting in a basement,''
Lenfant said. ``If somebody wants to do this, more power to them. I
think it's terrific to have the data used. I'm all for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenfant emphasized that the heart institute would insist that
the Framingham data continue to be freely available apart from the
new company, that the confidentiality of the study participants be
maintained and that the Boston University investigators who
administer the Framingham study have no financial ties to the new
company. Dr. Fred Ledley, chief executive officer of Framingham
Genomic Medicine, said he had already taken care of Lenfant's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The company's work will be data analysis, a task that will
require an investment of $20 million to $40 million, Ledley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham study began before computers were invented, and
its records have been kept in 160 different databases. Laboratory
tests, graphs and images must be put into computers and analyzed.
``We have half a million X-rays and EKGs,'' Ledley said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the genetic information. Since the 1980s, the
study participants have given permission for genetic studies,
providing blood samples that have allowed researchers to extract
the DNA and store it. Ledley said he anticipated looking at 50,000
different genetic landmarks on the participants' DNA.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the company, seeking to protect the
participants, is proposing creation of an ethics panel to advise
them, Ledley said. The company has asked Dr. Arthur Caplan,
bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, to head the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't sign anything; we're not on board yet,'' Caplan
said. ``We're thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others said they still had questions about the ethics of
the arrangement. ``It is fair to say that the rules of how to do
this are somewhere between undetermined and murky,'' Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, ``how do you handle commercialization when
the study began as a public altruistic act by a community?''
</P>
<P>
   Holden, of the SNP Consortium, said such questions could plague
others who want to use data sets begun years ago for other
purposes. ``We desperately need high-quality clinical and genetic
data sets,'' he said. ``But they need to be in line with what's
appropriate ethically. If not, then I think those are data that
cannot be used.''

MOSLEY, DE LA HOYA HAVE PLAN OF ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like Robert Frost's man stopping by a snowy wood,
Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley have promises to keep Saturday
night. But, unlike Frost's man, neither has any idea how many miles
they will go before they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   All they know for sure is that if either of them is true to his
word, somebody is going to sleep early at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is making the first defense of the WBC welterweight
title he was handed after Felix Trinidad vacated it to move to 154
pounds. De La Hoya has promised four knockouts in four fights this
year, and knows to deliver on that he has to deliver Mosley to a
place he's never been: the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, the undefeated former lightweight champion who is
challenging De La Hoya for a lot more than that belt, has promised
he will take De La Hoya ``soul searching'' before knocking him out.
For him to deliver, Mosley has to do what no man has done: render
De La Hoya unconscious, or so near to it that referee Lou Moret
steps in and ends what is anticipated to be a fierce affair.
</P>
<P>
   Such promises have been made far more often in boxing than
they've been fulfilled. Derrell Coley, De La Hoya's last victim,
promised to do terrible damage to him, for example, and then tried
to fight with his fists covering his ears most of the night. This
led to his being destroyed in seven rounds. He was far from the
first De La Hoya opponent to talk one fight and produce another.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, in contrast, has delivered on every promise he's made in
boxing, with the exception of making the 1992 Olympic team. That
failure came as a shock because Mosley was considered the best
139-pound amateur in the United States at the time, yet he was
beaten soundly by Vernon Forrest in the trials in what was arguably
the biggest fight of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that failure, Mosley (34-0, 32 KOs) became the most
dominant lightweight in the world, winning the IBF title from
Philip Holiday and then easily defending it eight times before
moving up two weight classes to challenge De La Hoya. It was a move
Mosley made the right way.
</P>
<P>
   He made it slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley has fought three times at his new weight before
challenging De La Hoya. This has allowed him to get used to
carrying more weight in the ring. Bigger and stronger than most
people understand, Mosley has actually been stronger at 147, but
just as fast as he was as a lightweight. It is a combination that
has some saying he will be the one who exposes De La Hoya's
weaknesses and takes him apart.
</P>
<P>
   To do that Mosley must first get inside De La Hoya's deadly left
jab. Once there, he will surely do what he has always done before,
which is rip at his opponent's ribcage with some of the sport's
best body punches. They are the kind of punches that wear a man
down like each swing of a lumberjack's ax until his opponent
finally collapses from their sheer volume. It is a difficult way to
do a dangerous task, but it is effective and Mosley knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar knows he can't just run in and do what he wants,''
Mosley said. ``He knows I can hit him and I can hurt him. I know I
can knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Mosley's speed and willingness to throw punches, De
La Hoya is sure to be hit more than in any of his previous 33
fights (32-1, 23 KOs). But the same is likely for Mosley, who too
often opens himself up to be hit by the left hand when he becomes
preoccupied with offense. Since that happens to be De La Hoya's
greatest weapon, this could prove to be a fatal stylistic flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pick Oscar for the very reason people are picking Mosley,''
says veteran fight trainer Teddy Atlas. ``Mosley stays busy for
three minutes while Oscar picks his spots. I think Mosley will walk
right into a De La Hoya punch.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, it will likely be a left hook or left uppercut, the
champion's two most devastating punches. Many, including Mosley,
have labeled De La Hoya a one-handed fighter, because he seldom
uses his right hand to do anything but grip a golf club. Although
that may be true, his left has been so murderous that only Trinidad
has been truly competitive against it, and even he was far from his
normal self because of his inability to adjust to De La Hoya's hand
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley should not have that problem, but he may face another.
Although he will be the only fighter De La Hoya has faced who has
faster hands, he will also, for the first time, be in with someone
nearly as fast and clearly more powerful with a single punch. What
that should mean is Mosley will be hit more than in any of his
previous fights and he will be getting hit harder. How he reacts
will have as much to say about the outcome as anything because some
fighters who have never been close to trouble _ as Mosley has not _
find it wearing mentally when they are and at some point they
crack.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley has promised he will be the one to break down De La Hoya.
Perhaps so, but veteran trainer Tommy Brooks hit on Mosley's
dilemma when he said, ``I haven't seen Mosley get hit yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news there is that he is an elusive target. The bad
news is that his 32 knockouts have all come because he has worn his
opponents down with barrages of punches. If he is unable to hurt De
La Hoya enough to prevent the champion from countering, what then?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya believes he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect this fight to be very, very explosive,'' De La Hoya
said. ``My plan is to attack, attack, attack. I'm not going to show
him any boxing skills, the way I did with Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking him lightly, but he doesn't have a knockout
artist's punch. He really doesn't possess one-punch knockout power.
He wears you down. But with the spark of aggression I have now, I
feel I can easily match his speed, no problem. He's so aggressive
at times, it's like he can't control his temper. If he rushes me,
it will be fun to stick my jab on his chest or in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's tendency to attack with wild fury is something De La
Hoya believes he will be able to capitalize on. At some moment when
Mosley least expects it, De La Hoya thinks his challenger will stay
one punch too long at close range and pay a dear price.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, De La Hoya may still beat Mosley, but it will be
a long, hard pull. But if Mosley makes that one mistake, De La
Hoya's promise will be kept and Mosley will have gone to sleep a
few miles short of the welterweight championship.

<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Mass. _ Carved into the flesh of a 17-year-old
student's back, block letters spelled out an anti-gay slur, a
punitive label left by fellow students at Northfield Mount Hermon,
a grand old boarding school here.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a gay-bashing hate crime, though. The victim of the
carving last year was not gay. He simply liked the band ``Queen,''
and, prosecutors said, had irritated Matthew Rogers, 20, the
captain of the football team, by saying that he knew Rogers liked
the band, too.
</P>
<P>
   At Rogers' plea hearing this spring, prosecutors said the attack
had been part of a broader pattern of bullying in the dormitory
rooms of Northfield Mount Hermon. Renee Steese, a prosecutor, told
the court that the investigation had indicated that such assaultive
behavior had been going on throughout the school year. There was
some evidence, Steese said, that school officials were aware of it
to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   School officials deny that the carving assault was anything but
an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   That may be. But around the country, some national experts on
dormitory life report growing problems with the behavior of
residents, and widening efforts by boarding schools to improve
residential life by putting greater emphasis on it. Some schools
even talk about turning it into a ``third curriculum,'' added to
academics and extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been simple to control buildings full of simmering
adolescence, but in recent years, some experts say, boarding
students, like their public school counterparts, have been
increasingly bringing the effects of troubled childhoods to school
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the challenges over the last 10 years have become
greater than ever,'' said Ed Kowalchick, who runs workshops on
residential life for the Association of Boarding Schools, a
national organization. ``Look at the statistics: Binge drinking is
up, suicide attempts are up, eating disorders among men as well as
women are up, depression and anxiety are up _ these are things that
kids come to us with, some real concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Although national organizations keep no statistics on assaults
and other violence in boarding schools, experts agree that the
troubling behavior of dorm residents sometimes escalates into
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, four students at the Winchendon School in Massachusetts
kicked a fellow student so hard they were charged with attempted
murder. The charge was later reduced to assault and battery with a
deadly weapon and the students were sentenced to one year
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year a cadet at the Marine Military Academy in
Harlingen, Texas, sneaked into the room of a classmate and slashed
his throat, requiring 28 stitches. The student was given 10 years'
probation after serving four months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The academy, a private boarding school for boys, is also the
target of a pending lawsuit by parents of several former students
who said that classmates had physically and sexually abused their
sons and the school had failed to provide proper supervision. The
academy denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, the Groton School in Groton, Mass., one of the
most prestigious boarding schools in the country, was rocked by a
boy's announcement at an assembly, before the whole school and
dozens of prospective students and their parents, that there had
been a series of homosexual molestations there. He was referring,
his lawyer said, to assaults, corroborated by several peers, in
which boys in grades 9 and 10 were held down by students and
molested.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two very dangerous issues,'' said Peter Hawkins, the
father of the boy who spoke out at Groton, and a financial planner
in Darien, Conn. ``One is, there are some very disturbed children
out there that your child is being put in contact with, but just as
scary is the school that you're dealing with when the leadership is
so corrupt they won't deal with the problem, where they refuse to
recognize the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Groton, Karen Schwartzman, rejected Hawkins'
accusations that the school had mishandled the allegations, noting
that two students had been disciplined in connection with the
assaults. ``The school undertook a very thorough internal
investigation and questioned every student on campus,'' Schwartzman
said. ``What resulted was a series of extremely conflicting
accounts and it was very hard to know, therefore, where truth began
and ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the assault at Northfield Mount Hermon, the school
had been instituting new programs to help students develop morally
and socially by interacting more with adults. These included
seminars on issues like gender relations and a program to have
students keep journals that would then be read and discussed with
consulting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Groton instituted additional training programs for
students and faculty members on how to best handle hazing, sexual
harassment, bullying and taunting.
</P>
<P>
   But a major problem for boarding schools is structural, the
experts say. Students tend to have excellent supervision until late
afternoon, they say, and then, sometimes, a hint of a style of life
out of ``Lord of the Flies'' _ youth rules _ can creep in, as some
faculty members go home and others try to cope with exhaustion from
their roles as teachers, coaches and dormitory supervisors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Northfield Mount Hermon, one of the biggest boarding schools in
the country, with 1,158 students on separate campuses that used to
be schools for boys and girls, is also one of the most diverse. It
tends to attract students who want strong academics but also plenty
of freedom to find themselves, officials say. With a tuition of
$27,000, it offers many things a college would envy: 230 major
courses and 130 minor ones, a teacher-student ratio of 1 to 6, 65
sports teams, an art gallery, a radio station, and more.
</P>
<P>
   The school requires students to work a few hours a week and
seeks to instill an ethic of service in them, a tradition that
dates back to its 19th-century founder, D.L. Moody, a Christian
evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   When students arrive, the school gives them seven basic rules
they must not break, such as not abusing drugs or alcohol, not
stealing and not ``impinging on the rights of others.'' But in most
cases, it allows students who break the rules a second chance
before expelling them.
</P>
<P>
   At the plea hearing, it came out that two days before the
carving attack, Rogers had slashed two vertical lines down the
shoulder blade of another student.
</P>
<P>
   One parent, in an angry letter to school administrators that was
forwarded to The New York Times, complained: ``From what I have
heard from students at NMH, date rape, rape and sexual harassment
are not limited to the occasional isolated incident. Much of it
goes unreported out of fear.'' It is fear ``of isolation, physical
threats, being called a liar, a slut,'' the parent wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Raymond Jr., a local therapist who treated Northfield Mount
Hermon students for a dozen years, said they had told him about
other dorm bullies and sexual assaults and other problems as well,
for example easy access to drugs, both prescription drugs like
Ritalin, and illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Several students who were interviewed on condition of anonymity
confirmed the drug problem and described occasional hazing style
bullying in the boys' dorms.
</P>
<P>
   Of the illicit Ritalin supply, a student said: ``On any given
day, if you ask one of your friends, and they talk to someone else,
you've got it. You just have to have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, who also taught some elective classes, had proposed
changing the school's counseling and discipline system to encourage
students to speak to adults. Months ago, Raymond applied for but
did not get a full-time job at the school and he is no longer
affiliated with it. He said he believed the school's increasingly
tough policies were driving the hidden and sometimes risky student
life further underground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults need to recognize that kids will talk honestly when we
stop making it detrimental to their well-being to do so,'' Raymond
said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials declined to respond directly to Raymond's
views. But Randy Stevens, the dean of student life, said that he
commonly fielded criticism from both those who thought he was too
strict and those who thought he was too lenient. The school offers
an ``elaborate web of support'' for students, from peer counselors
to adult advisers, Stevens said, and students have told him they
feel safe there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that for 85 percent of our kids here at this
school, they're very high-achieving kids,'' he said in an
interview. ``They make it through here very successfully and have a
wonderful experience. For 15 percent of our kids there are
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said that as part of the new residential life
curriculum, students had four monthly seminars or talks on such
issues as gender relations, hazing, harassment and racial identity.
The school has also been consulting with researchers on how to
handle adolescent boys' cruelty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools are taking similar route.
</P>
<P>
   At the Thatcher School in Ojai, Calif., the focus on residential
life ranges from the headmaster's schoolwide Saturday night
invitation to a movie or cookie-baking at his house, to newer
required courses on human development and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The Rumsey Hall School in Washington Depot, Conn., has begun
trying to address girls' specific problems, giving them programs on
leadership training and the skills needed to live in a residential
community.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hotchkiss, assistant head of Saint Mary's School in
Raleigh, N.C., and a faculty member of the Association of Boarding
Schools, said: ``A lot of different schools I've consulted with, 10
years ago they couldn't have cared less what was going on in the
dorms, just, `Keep them quiet, have them study and don't let them
crawl around outside.' Now they're coming to people like me and
saying, `Help us develop a residential curriculum,' the words for
which didn't exist 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, few would argue that crime among the estimated 2
percent of the nation's students who live in boarding schools is
worse than at day schools. But the students' 24-hour-a-day presence
at schools leaves them vulnerable to assaults at times when most
day students would be safe at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the plea hearing the Northfield Mount Hermon carving assault,
the victim's father told the court that his son's back, though
healing, was still scarred, and the boy refuses to take off his
shirt or swim in public. Prosecutors say the letters were about
three or four inches tall, that they bled but did not require
stitches, and that the boys who carved them also swabbed hydrogen
peroxide on the cuts afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who wielded the knife, pleaded guilty to two charges of
assault and battery and was given a suspended sentence of two and a
half years and placed on probation for three years. He had
previously been accepted on full scholarship into the U.S. Naval
Academy, but that offer was rescinded after the carving assault.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' accomplice, Jonathan Shapiro, 19, pleaded guilty to
assault and battery and was sentenced to three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he had done the carving, Rogers told the Superior
Court judge: ``There was no point. It was a terrible error on my
part.''
</P>
<P>
   But the victim's father said: ``We all make choices about our
conduct. The choice that Matt made, and Jonathan, was to exhibit
power over people.''

INVESTING WITH OSCAR A. CASTRO OF MONTGOMERY GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS
FUND

 (For release Sunday, June 18)  
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You need to learn the game well to play it well,'' said Oscar
A. Castro, manager of the $590 million Montgomery Global
Communications fund, over breakfast at the Mark Hotel in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the ever-changing global telecommunications markets, learning
the game well means gaining a thorough understanding of industry
dynamics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco, where Castro
has worked since 1993, that is the task for the Global Research
Platform, an 18-member team of analysts and managers that Castro
oversees. The unit is the source of investment ideas for Global
Communications and two smaller funds that Castro helps run.
</P>
<P>
   Global Communications has returned 47.2 percent a year, on
average, for the three years through June 9, versus 43.3 percent
for its peers, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, 45, attributes his fund's performance, at least in part,
to its research process. While many analysts and money managers
focus on information gleaned from corporate management, the
Montgomery analysts pay special attention to company rivals,
suppliers and industry regulators.
</P>
<P>
   After a visit with telecommunications regulators in Italy two
years ago, for instance, Castro and Montgomery analysts concluded
that the details of the country's impending deregulation plan would
favor the large incumbent operators. So Castro added to his
holdings of Telecom Italia, which has risen.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Castro and his team favor stocks with lower
multiples than their peer group, based on their prices compared
with both past and expected future earnings or cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   But he is willing to pay more for a company that is growing
faster than its peers. So he looks at the company's peg ratio _
defined as its price-to-earnings ratio, in turn divided by its
long-term earnings growth rate. The lower the peg, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Using Montgomery analysts' forecasts, Castro wants a stock to
have an expected return of 25 percent in the first year he owns it,
50 percent in two years and 100 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures are more esoteric. For example, he looks at a
company' enterprise value _ the market value of its equity and
debt, less its cash _ in relation to future cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Geography plays only a minor role selecting the portfolio's 90
or so stocks. At the end of April, 42.1 percent of its assets were
in Europe, 34.9 percent in the United States, 14.9 percent in Asia
and the small remainder elsewhere or in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, with an annual turnover rate of 146 percent, uses a
fairly strict discipline for selling stocks. Castro is likely to
unload a stock that breaches its upside price target, or if he
foresees deteriorating sales. He will also drop a stock if he
believes management has steered him wrong, or sometimes if
executives take too long to return his phone calls _ a sign of
possible trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The spring sell-off has provided some opportunities, and Castro
has been buying of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a chance to get into stocks we've always wanted to
own but that were too expensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is bullish on the Atmel Corp., a San Jose, Calif., maker
of high-performance memory chips. He said the company was
benefiting from strong demand for its flash memory chips, used in
personal digital assistants and other wireless devices, and that it
was gradually becoming a global player.
</P>
<P>
   The fund started buying Atmel shares in May 1999 when they were
trading for less than $10. They are now at $42.9375, down 27.8
percent from their peak on March 22 and 28.1 times his 2001
earnings estimate of $1.53 a share. His 12-month price target is
$70, and he calculated the company's peg ratio at 0.37 recently,
versus 0.75 for peer companies like LSI Logic.
</P>
<P>
   One recent purchase was Bookham Technology of Oxfordshire,
England, which makes components that generate and control light
signals in fiber-optic networks. He bought shares at 10 pounds at
the initial offering on April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Castro recently raised his 12-month price target on Bookham to
65 pounds, from 50 pounds, because of stronger-than-anticipated
revenue growth. At his new target, the company would trade at a 50
percent premium to the shares of peer companies like JDS Uniphase,
based on its price-to-sales multiple. But Bookham has ``much higher
growth prospects at this stage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed on Friday at 35 pounds. He expects Bookham to
turn a profit of 4 pence a share in 2001 versus a loss this year.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus in Australia. The company
provides a wide range of telecommunications services, including
long-distance and mobile telephone, pay television and Internet
connections. ``They've assembled a huge broadband network that can
soon deliver all of these services,'' Castro said. He expects
earnings to nearly double, to 16 Australian cents a share for the
year ending in March 2001, from 8.3 cents in the most recent fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the shares at an average price of 4.46 Australian
dollars, starting in April 1999; they now trade at 4.26 dollars. He
calculates that the company's enterprise value as a multiple of
2001 cash flow is 18, and has a 12-month price target on the stock
of 8.60 dollars. &QL;

(For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By JOEL KOTKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANNING, Iowa _ Joan Phillips had seen it before. A small town
that once prospered on the rolling Iowa countryside, unable to
adjust to a changing economy, loses population and most of its
businesses. It gradually experiences a kind of living death, marked
by peeling paint and an aging population.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Phillips, a 65-year-old retired insurance agent, and a group
of her neighbors were determined not to let that happen here in
Manning, a town of 1,400 about 100 miles west of Des Moines. In the
last five years, Phillips and her neighbors, through membership on
town boards and by promoting referenda, have pushed Manning to tap
money from the city's publicly owned utilities and through bonds
and low-interest loans from the state and federal government. The
city has used the proceeds to give its Main Street an $850,000
facelift, is in the midst of a $4.5 million expansion of the local
hospital and the adjoining nursing home and has poured an
additional $880,000 into its local schools, in part to upgrade
computers and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important action, Phillips said, was the 1996
decision by 86 percent of the city's voters to issue $3.5 million
in bonds to set up a locally owned local telephone service to
compete with the long-time operator, the GTE Corp. The new service,
the Manning Municipal Communication and Television Systems Utility,
now provides residents with cable television, high-speed Internet
connections and, starting later this summer, improved telephone
services, including voice mail, three-way calling, speed dialing
and call forwarding, that have not been available.
</P>
<P>
   These telecommunications services, Phillips said, would have
arrived only slowly, if at all, from GTE. ``Their attitude was to
let the small town go and die,'' suggested Phillips, who has served
for 12 years as coordinator for the Manning Area Development Corp.,
a local nonprofit group that works closely with state and federal
agencies. ``It doesn't fit into their business plan. For them it's
a business issue. For us it's about a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   A GTE spokesman, Don Neely, denied that his company served rural
communities like Manning poorly. But he said that the company had
been trying to unload many of its rural lines, including those in
Iowa, to invest in wireless services and other new ventures.
</P>
<P>
   GTE's impending sale of its largely rural lines across the state
to the smaller Iowa Telecom _ expected to be completed later this
summer _ has exacerbated the sense of urgency among communities in
the state about positioning themselves to meet the challenges of
the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, like other states, has been promoting the Internet as a
rural development tool. The state has some strong advantages,
notably its educated population, generally excellent public schools
and the absence of crime and other more urban ills. Yet hopes that
the Internet can help revive the state's rural communities have not
widely materialized.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, said Peter Korsching, a sociologist at Iowa
State University, the winners in Iowa's emerging new economy have
not been small towns, but rather larger urban centers like Cedar
Rapids and Des Moines, which serve as major switching centers for
telecommunications and boast the best airport and highway
connections. The state's two major college towns, Ames and Iowa
City, also have done well, drawing on local graduates and
well-educated residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population is coming back in growth centers, while rural
Iowa is shrinking,'' noted Korsching, who is co-author, with Eric
A. Abbott and Patricia Hipple, of the forthcoming ``Having All the
Right Connections: Telecommunications and Rural Economic
Viability,'' to be published by Praeger next month. ``We have
islands of prosperity where Internet-related jobs are clustering.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, somewhat less prototypical standout has been Fairfield,
a city of 15,000 that is home to Maharishi University. Fairfield
boasts among the highest number of Internet domain names per capita
of any community in the nation, one indications of the density of
Web activity. Locals trace the area's successful telecommunications
business to the presence of thousands of adherents of
transcendental meditation, among them many well-educated migrants
from major cities, who have been instrumental in starting Internet
and other high-tech related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Korsching said that for many rural communities, the rise of the
Internet and the digital economy resembles something closer to
``information Armageddon'' than salvation. These areas, he said,
have remained dependent on agriculture at a time when the economics
of farming have changed drastically. The rise of ever larger
corporate farms, he noted, combined with the ability to buy on the
Internet, has reduced the role of smaller towns as vital trading
areas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, roughly 78 percent of Iowa's counties _ like
Carroll, the home of Manning _ have lost population since 1900,
according to Bruce Babcock, an Iowa State University economist.
This is largely the result of the 1930s Dust Bowl and more recently
the industrialization and consolidation of agriculture. Some small
towns, like Grand Junction in Greene County just to the east, have
Main Streets that are largely abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The decay can be seen as what a state economist, Harvey
Seigelman, has called the ``Dakotaization'' of small-town Iowa. In
the end, Seigelman and other observers agree, there will be a
painful reshuffling of Iowa's rural geography, with a handful of
communities prospering while a large number of small towns
virtually disappear.
</P>
<P>
   That is the prospect that haunts Manning's leading citizens and
businesspeople. Although the town looks prosperous enough, per
capita income remains as much as $5,000 below that of more
urbanized areas of the state. The town's population has also
fallen, having peaked at 2,200 in 1920. It also has been aging
rapidly, with its school-age population dropping from 800 to 550
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in danger of becoming a totally middle-aged community,''
said Howard Roe, senior vice president of the First National Bank
of Manning and one of the leaders of the revitalization efforts.
``We have to create opportunities for younger people here. ''
</P>
<P>
   Manning's investment in infrastructure, particularly
telecommunications, may yet be able to stem the decline, said Rick
Haunsacker, executive director of Region XII Council of
Governments, a development agency for six counties, including
Greene and Carroll. ``A lot of it has to do with the culture, ``
Haunsacker said. ``In Manning, people are willing to open their
pockets and use public funds to save their communities. In other
places, they don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That spirit clearly drives people like Joan Phillips, who says
Manning has many advantages _ a low cost of living, good schools
and a disciplined, literate and motivated work force _ attractive
to information-age industries. The city's expanding
telecommunications net, she said, has persuaded Enterprise Corp.
International, a Des Moines-based company that offers technical
support and software for Sony and other electronics manufacturers,
to double its current staff of 28 in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offers a real chance for us,'' said Brenda Steck, the
company's local manager, who graduated from Manning High School in
1983. ``Of the people I graduated from high school with, only 10 or
so stayed. I'm hoping this kind of industry will bring people back
_ and keep people here.''

WASHINGTON, June 16 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 95-3, a $288 billion Defense
Department budget plan for next year that raises military payrolls
and funds new weapon programs. Supporters said the budget would
keep more military personnel from seeking employment in the private
sector. Opponents said the new spending on weapons was not needed.
A ``yes'' vote favors the budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected, 83-15, an amendment to the
Defense Department budget plan that would cut weapons spending by
one billion and reallocate funds to unrelated education programs.
Supporters said the $922,000 sought for the programs would benefit
impoverished children. Opponents said the amendment would eliminate
needed funding for the military. A ``yes'' vote rejects the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SPENDING
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected, 65-32, an amendment to the
Defense Department budget plan that would cut air travel funding
for high-ranking officials in the military. Supporters said the
spending was unnecessary and wasteful. Opponents argued that
military travel was vital to the nation's defense. A ``yes'' vote
rejects the amendment.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 380-49, a measure to investigate
the Department of Education for fraud. The measure authorizes the
General Accounting Office to conduct the audit following recent
thefts at the agency. Supporters said the measure could prevent
future theft of millions. Opponents said the investigation was not
necessary. A ``yes'' vote supports the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: SIGNATURES
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 426-4, a bill that gives
electronic contracts the same status as those signed on paper,
legalizing transactions made with an electronic signature.
Supporters said it would reduce paperwork for businesses and
consumers. Opponents said it did not go far enough to protect
privacy online. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 217-214, a bill to increase
spending for health and education. The bill would appropriate
$339.5 billion to the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services and Education. Supporters said it would boost spending for
needed federal programs. Opponents said the funding was not
sufficient for education, childcare and worker training.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: MONUMENTS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 243-177, an amendment to the
Interior Department spending bill that limits funding for new
national monuments. The amendment would have prohibited the agency
from planning or managing national monuments designated by the
President this year. Supporters said it would stem government
attempts to acquire more land. Opponents said it would infringe on
presidential authority. A ``yes'' vote rejects the amendment.

   WASHINGTON _ A pair of computer hard drives containing nuclear
secrets that had been missing from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory were found Friday afternoon behind a copying machine
under conditions that were highly suspicious, administration
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drives were discovered in a secure area of the New
Mexico laboratory's X Division, where nuclear weapons are designed
and where the drives had been stored. They were discovered Friday
afternoon by an X Division employee, who is now being questioned by
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Officials remained highly skeptical of the circumstances
surrounding the recovery of the hard drives since the area in the
lab where the drives were discovered had already been closely
searched twice, by FBI and Energy Department investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the FBI's criminal investigation of the
security breach was now being intensified in an effort to determine
why the hard drives were removed from a secured vault and how they
could have ended up behind a photocopier. ``They were recovered
under very questionable circumstances,'' said one senior law
enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a lot of inconsistencies here,'' added another
official. ``All of a sudden these things appear, in a place that
had been searched twice.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators now believe that the two recovered drives
are probably the same ones missing since at least May 7, officials
said the FBI was planning to conduct a more thorough examination of
them to make sure, and to determine that they contained the missing
data.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will be checking for fingerprints and other
evidence that might pinpoint who removed them, and the FBI's
computer experts also plan to determine whether the data was copied
or downloaded before it was returned. The FBI now has nearly 60
agents working on the investigation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the computer drives marked a bizarre twist in a
case that had already prompted much criticism over lax security at
Los Alamos, and had led to harsh Republican attacks on Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, who had earlier been mentioned as a
possible running mate for Vice President Al Gore on the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson expressed outrage this week over the security lapses,
especially after it was learned that Los Alamos employees had
waited more than three weeks before reporting the loss of the hard
drives, which reportedly contain some of the nation's most
important nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drives contain data on nuclear weapons and are intended
to be used in emergencies by the government's Nuclear Emergency
Search Team, which is responsible for responding to nuclear
accidents and terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   The data includes information needed by the team to disarm
nuclear devices designed by the United States and other nations,
including Russia. In response to the loss of the hard drives, the
lab's director, John Browne, placed six managers at the lab on
leave, pending possible disciplinary action. The managers include
the lab's head of nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has also asked former Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., a
Republican from Tennessee, and former Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, a
Democrat from Indiana, to conduct an independent review of the
disappearance of the nuclear secrets.

CHALLENGING GORE'S TAX PROPOSAL; POLL GIVES BUSH EDGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   THE ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGING GORE'S TAX PROPOSAL
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas Friday accused his Democratic
rival, Vice President Al Gore, of doubling the size of a proposed
tax cut as a result of polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely America doesn't want a focus-group-driven presidency,''
Bush said. ``America wants somebody who makes decisions based on
what's right, and what's right is sharing some of the surplus with
the people who pay the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called his proposal for a 10-year, across-the-board tax cut
of $1.3 trillion preferable to Gore's latest plan for $500 billion
in tax credits and deductions aimed at particular needs like
education and child care. ``Everybody who pays taxes ought to get
tax relief,'' Bush said in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, Gore's spokesman, said, countered that Bush
``obviously thought the tax cut would be politically popular when
he made it the centerpiece of his campaign.'' Hattaway added, ``We
need to use our prosperity wisely and give tax relief to working
middle-class families.''
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   AN EDGE TO BUSH
</P>
<P>
   A day after Gore replaced his campaign manager, he awoke to yet
another sign of the struggle he faces. A nationwide poll by The Los
Angeles Times found Bush leading Gore by a 10-point margin, 50
percent to 40 percent, and it found that Bush's support among
Republicans was stronger than Gore's support among Democrats. Nine
of 10 Republicans said they backed Bush, while seven of 10
Democrats said they supported Gore. Bush also had substantially
more support among Democrats than Gore had among Republicans. The
poll surveyed more than 1,600 voters in the past week and has a
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   A STAND-IN WITH A PUNCH
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, often say that when she agreed to
marry him, it was on the condition that she would never have to
give a political speech. But Friday, Bush addressed more than
10,000 people at the Texas Republican Party's convention in
Houston. She was substituting for her husband, who was campaigning
in swing states, and she was mixing just a little vinegar into her
remarks. She said that at the beginning of her husband's quest for
the presidency, she had vowed to avoid newspapers and the
inevitably critical articles. But then, she said, ``I learned that
some of the best fiction is published on editorial pages.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THEY'RE NOT JUST THROWS IN THE DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre loosely compared it to the year he went
``from hitting .363 to being a babbling idiot.'' That would have
been the 1971 and 1972 seasons, when Torre dropped from the year of
a lifetime to .281, from 137 runs batted in to 81, from National
League Most Valuable Player to ordinary Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not doing what I did the year before,'' he said, relaxing
in the Yankees dugout before settling in for the stress of sending
Chuck Knoblauch back out to second base against the Chicago White
Sox Friday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch showed up, ready and willing, or ready for anything,
which was an improvement on the previous night, when he committed
three painful throwing errors and had a look in his eyes that
convinced his manager it was time for his second baseman to hitch
an immediate ride home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Knoblauch said when asked who the driver was,
which, hopefully, meant he didn't know the name of the appointed
chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was so discomforting that several Yankees later
called, Knoblauch said, to make sure he didn't do anything rash,
and we're not talking about emptying the refrigerator of fruit to
practice his soft tosses out the window. In his hour of emotional
need, Knoblauch would have preferred to speak to his mother, but
Linda Knoblauch wasn't in and he had to wait for Friday, when she
told him she wished she could give him a hug.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived early in the clubhouse Friday afternoon and received
a group embrace from his close-knit team. Torre told him, ``You're
my second baseman,'' and the core veterans acted as if he had gone
home early Thursday night with an upset stomach, and they all
continued to refute the contention that Knoblauch has become
anything more than an occasional threat to the fans behind first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I throw the ball low, it's not the talk of the town,''
Derek Jeter said. ``If he throws the ball low, all of a sudden,
everyone's bringing it up again. Every player goes through
stretches where they are not catching or throwing the ball the way
they like to, and if they don't tell you, they're lying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were lying to themselves, if they believed that
Knoblauch's throwing problem, which he struggled through so
publicly and commendably during last season's postseason, was just
going to go away. It wasn't a cycle. This isn't a slump. Torre's
reduced batting average from one season to the next had a little to
do with pitchers and fielders. Knoblauch, to the contrary, is
unable to execute what in better times was the most natural play he
could make on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that happened and then you start thinking
about it and then it consumes you,'' said Torre, hoping again that
the problem is rooted in the flaw of the act.
</P>
<P>
   A sports psychologist I know once told me that the most
difficult aspect of treating athletes is getting them to understand
that therapy is not necessarily the act of correcting the
dysfunction, but getting to the bottom of what caused it. Therapy
is open-ended and nonguaranteed. Athletes by nature are a more
scientific breed, staking their careers on mysteries that can be
solved with mechanics and muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch hinted that he had, contrary to public opinion, sought
some form of off-season assistance, though his later comments
suggested that it might have been along the lines of the 24-hour,
self-help course that baseball ordered for another troubled soul
currently lost in the wilds.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker is in his own league, but Knoblauch, when asked if
he had any knowledge of whether his problem might be bigger than
baseball, said: ``That's something maybe a psychologist or some
kind of professional would know. I can't pinpoint when this all
started, or if there was an event in my life that made this happen.
Maybe these people will have the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Blass and Steve Sax and anyone else who has lived through
something like this don't have them. There is no formula here.
Knoblauch's issues are his own. Only he can solve them. The fans
booed him Thursday night, but they stood and cheered
compassionately Friday night when he led off the home first inning.
He promptly singled into right field and soon turned an ankle
sliding into second. He remained in the game, limping, grimacing.
</P>
<P>
   Fans appreciate tough guys _ the smaller, the better _ and
Knoblauch, optimistically listed at 5 foot 9 inches, was showing
them that he wasn't afraid to come back to the ball park, to face
them and the news media and the meanest ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   If only it was that easy for him to look within himself.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, four tourists from Texas
left the galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and began to
make their way through the crowds gathering for the National Puerto
Rican Day Parade along Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   They were petite, middle-aged women, and they said they were
made uncomfortable by the odor of marijuana and alcohol. Clutching
their purses, avoiding eye contact, searching for a quick escape,
they said they headed for an opening between two groups of young
men, perhaps 20 in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they started patting our bottoms,'' said Sharon Brown,
52, a retired school teacher. ``Then they started spitting in their
hands and then rubbing it in our hair. And then the hitting got
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers lined Fifth Avenue, but Brown said that not one
tried to stop the humiliation. Maybe, Brown offered, they did not
see what had happened. But, she added, ``They really didn't appear
to be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Richard Walsh, a 43-year-old businessman, was
running laps around the Central Park reservoir, which is near Fifth
Avenue, when he noticed several young men spraying water on women
and yelling lewd insults at them. On three consecutive laps, Walsh
said, he alerted a nearby contingent of some 40 police officers
taking cover in the shade to what was happening. The officers, he
said, never budged in the 90-degree heat, and the young men
continued to menace women.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the worst of the violence broke out at the fringes
of this year's Puerto Rican Day Parade, the central elements of
trouble were already starting to gel in dangerous and unpredictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a thundercloud is fueled by moisture and heat, Sunday's
wild, uncontrolled mob attacks on women in Central Park were fueled
by an ugly alchemy of alcohol, marijuana, oppressive weather,
testosterone idiocy and lapses in police strategy, tactics and
communication.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ embarrassingly displayed to a worldwide audience,
thanks to grainy amateur videos _ was a day of simply awful terror
for 44 women and an ironic black eye for a police force more often
criticized for being overly aggressive. For days now, city
officials have struggled to explain the sight of weeping,
beer-soaked women stumbling out of the park after being robbed,
groped and stripped bare in one of the most well-policed areas of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   As more victims and eyewitness accounts have surfaced, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and other top police officials have rapidly
retreated from early statements that seemed to minimize the
violence and exonerate the Police Department's handling of the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Even as detectives continue to round up suspects _ seven more
were arrested Friday, bringing the total to 13 _ another police
investigation is focusing on how the 4,000 police officers assigned
to the parade were deployed, when officers were sent home, and how
senior commanders communicated with one another about the movements
of more than a million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to critique this very closely to make sure that it
doesn't happen in the future,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Any examination of the department's performance during and after
the parade will have to try to reconcile a certain indisputable
level of enforcement _ the department wrote hundreds of citations
for public drinking, which is illegal _ with a widespread sense
among people at and around the parade that gross misconduct went
virtually ignored.
</P>
<P>
   All week, for instance, city officials have battled direct or
implicit allegations that the police deliberately took a hands-off
approach because of the department's tense relations with minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has strongly disputed this notion, and police officials
have provided statistics showing, if anything, a history of
somewhat tougher enforcement. During this year's St. Patrick's Day
Parade, for example, police confiscated 200 open alcohol
containers, compared with 2,601 confiscations during this year's
Puerto Rican parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're in a period of time in which the police can't
win,'' Giuliani said Friday on his weekly radio program.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said there was no letup this year, and
according to police figures, officers issued hundreds more
summonses for petty crimes and noise complaints than they did at
last year's parade.
</P>
<P>
   There have been ``a lot of complaints fairly recently that the
police have become too strict in quality of life enforcement,'' one
police official said. ``That in my mind is one of the main things
that keeps the control of various types of events, such as parades,
such as New Year's Eve in Times Square. The enforcement is
necessary. That helps to set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to a growing number of witnesses, police officers
failed again and again on Sunday to provide even the mildest of
responses to scenes of obvious disorder and lawlessness. What's
more, several witnesses have alleged in interviews this week, some
officers failed to react to specific complaints about women being
mistreated and harassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it normal to just turn the city over to those kinds of
people?'' asked Brown of Texas, expressing one common view.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department reported that it made one marijuana arrest
during the parade and confiscated 16 bags of marijuana. But many
witnesses described dozens, if not hundreds, of people openly
smoking marijuana, many of them in plain view of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about second-hand smoke, that's how bad it
was,'' said one 37-year-old jogger, recalling her run through
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a department spokesman, denied
those claims, arguing that it did not make sense for officers to
ignore blatant drug use. ``If I have a parade detail and I walk my
route and smell marijuana, I'd go ballistic,'' he said. ``Why?
Because I know my boss is going to come along soon, and if he
smells something, he's going to ask me what the hell I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Special police teams, each with 24 officers, roved along the
parade route, confiscating open alcohol containers and writing
summonses, but many thousands more teen-agers and young people
clearly drank alcohol with impunity, many people at the parade
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some men circulated in the crowds openly hawking miniature
bottles of rum and vodka. ``There was alcohol all over the street,
bottles of liquor, people offering shots,'' said Nathan Poe, 27, a
Web site developer from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey said that officers sometimes decide, quite properly, that
it is a better use of their time to direct traffic than to go after
someone with an open can of beer. But police officials have
acknowledged in interviews that the department's tactical and
strategic decisions contributed to a set of circumstances that
permitted some of the worst incidents of violence to go forward
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the most serious string of assaults, those
that happened inside the park on Center Drive, just north of the
intersection of Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas,
also known as Sixth Avenue. Roughly half the assaults occurred
there during a frenzy of attacks about 6 p.m., police records show.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have said that 950 officers were deployed
inside Central Park during the parade, 120 more than last year. But
none, they now say, were assigned to cover the stretch of Center
Drive where the assaults took place. The 10 or so amateur videos
that have surfaced thus far seem to support that point: No
uniformed officers can be seen in the crowd on Center Drive, senior
police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, this could be seen as a crucial oversight on the
part of police commanders. But police officials said that they
deployed officers based on their analysis of past trouble spots,
and that analysis, they said, is why the vast majority of the 950
officers were stationed along the eastern edge of the park, by the
parade route itself.
</P>
<P>
   A number of parade veterans, though, have said Central Park
South has for years been the scene of a kind of rowdy overspill.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, at least six people _ including hot-dog vendors,
doormen, store employees, victims _ recalled seeing between 5 and
10 police officers positioned in and around the intersection of
Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas. And from that
intersection the officers could have had a clear view of the mob
some 30 to 70 yards away on Center Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, though, a vagary in the Police Department's
deployment worked against the victims. Central Park South marks the
dividing line between the Manhattan North zone, which includes
Central Park, and the Manhattan South zone, which covers everything
below the park _ including Central Park South itself.
</P>
<P>
   And according to police officials, as the parade wound down,
senior commanders in Manhattan South began sending their officers
home after a long, hot day on the street. As best as police
officials can determine at this point, it appears that most of the
extra officers at the crucial intersection may have been pulled out
at roughly the time that the mob violence was starting to rapidly
escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a riot going on,'' Fahey said. ``We did what we
always do. The parade was over, we waited an hour, and we let some
of the officers go home. We didn't know about what was going on in
the park off Sixth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, at the moment when things began to spiral out of
control, the area of greatest menace was virtually empty of police
protection.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long, then, for the mix of police bad luck and
emboldened, brutish young men to yield disaster.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, the Avenue of the Americas has been a
popular gathering spot for young people both during and after the
parade _ a kind of parade off the main parade. Young motorcyclists
gun their tires so that great clouds of burning rubber fill the
street, primping teen-agers hang out of car windows, waving flags,
and gang members in do-rags flash hand signals.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 5:15 p.m., still above 90 degrees, when a burly
young man stole a bag of ice from an ice van that had stopped on
the Avenue of Americas just south of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the man, a distinctive figure with a lion's face
tattooed across his bare back and the words Puerto Rico shaved into
the back of his head, began pressing the ice bag against the backs
of young women. Someone punctured the ice bag, and young men began
dropping ice cubes down women's shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Several women laughed and smiled and sassed the young men. But
at least one woman grew angry when men surrounded her and trapped
her against a storefront, dousing her with water, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   There were several police officers in the area, and one, a
supervisor in a white shirt, was seen leading off a young man who
had been involved in the ice cube horseplay. Things quieted for a
bit, but then the group re-formed just inside the park, on Center
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Now self-appointed ``scouts'' began to signal to the larger
group when they spotted women who fit their calculus of sexual
appeal, witnesses said. ``Yo, yo, here comes a good one!'' they
would call out, witnesses said, as unsuspecting women approached.
Several older women got through. For the young and attractive,
nearby fences helped form a natural chute into which they were
steered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many said they had no idea what they were entering until it was
too late. Men would close around them from all sides, spraying
water on their heads, their backs, everywhere. The men, when their
water bottles and squirt guns ran dry, simply filled them back up
from a water trough used by the horses that pull carriages through
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Some women said they tried to stay near their friends, but they
were quickly separated by the crowd. So they screamed their
friends' names, to no avail. Some women tried to run, only to be
chased down and surrounded once more.
</P>
<P>
   There was yelling of ``Get 'em, get 'em,'' and chants of ``Go,
go, go,'' and misogynistic curses, witnesses said, and more young
men joined the mob _ men who wore crucifixes. And some of these men
began to tear at shirts, to pull on bras, to tug on shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The women, of course, fought to stay clothed. They clutched torn
shirts to their chests, and they tried to swat sweaty hands away
from their straps and zippers. But they were hopelessly
outnumbered, and several of them suddenly found themselves half
naked in a bleary, swirling crowd of strange men. Even then, the
women tried to hold their arms across their chests, and yet men
pulled at their arms, too. Ashanna Cover, 21, of New Jersey,
recalled that a man squeezed her breast so hard that it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, hair matted with beer and water, her top torn
off, huddled against a wall, and still men tried to grope at her.
Some women said they were groped and grabbed and prodded so
violently that their genitals were scratched and bruised. Some
women began to fear that they were going to be gang raped right
there in the shadow of Trump Parc, right there inside the crown
jewel of New York City. Some feared they were about to be trampled.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Abrams, a 42-year-old Web site designer, said she remembered
screams of, ``Yeah! Yeah! Get her!''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Bryant, who was pulled to the ground off her in-line
skates, curled up in a fetal position. She said the men, hooting
and giggling, would yank her shorts down to her thighs, and she
would yank them back up. Over and over this happened, even as she
kicked and thrashed with her skates.
</P>
<P>
   More men were drawn to the mob. Some took pictures. Some took
videos. Police said some robbed the women of cell phones, purses,
jewelry. Some surged closer to get a peek at what they could. Every
now and then, a man would tell another man to cool it, to back off,
but only every now and then, and not a single one among them dialed
911 to summon help.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some men had strangely bored looks on their faces, as
if what they were watching was a tired Jerry Springer rerun,
according to people in the park. It was as if the crowd had turned
a patch of Central Park into an outdoor version of Scores, the
notorious strip club. Only it was worse; there were no bouncers to
protect the women.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, stripped naked, managed to make it to the safety of a
small, three-wheeled police scooter, and still men converged on the
scooter to get a look. Watching from just across the street was
Rita Berlin, 26, manager of the Whiskey Park, an upscale bar at 100
Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin said she had enduring unrelenting harassment as she
pushed through unruly and drunken street crowds late Sunday
afternoon to get to work. Now, as she watched the poor naked woman,
as she wondered why there were not more police officers about, she
felt a deep sense of shame and anger.
</P>

in New York in my entire life _ the trash, the people, the complete

VEIL LIFTS ON THE MYSTERIES OF CREDIT RATING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Calif.)  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By MICKEY MEECE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of the numbers that matter most when you apply for credit.
You know your date of birth, Social Security number and annual
income well enough, and you may know just how much money you have
in the bank. But the make-or-break figure is one that lenders are
privy to but that you have probably never seen: your credit score.
</P>
<P>
   The veil is lifting from this mysterious metric, in response to
pressure by consumer groups, by legislation before Congress and by
loan-service Web sites like E-Loan that were eager to spill the
beans to customers. Fair, Isaac, the San Rafael, Calif., company
that pioneered credit scoring 40 years ago and dominates the field
today, has published on its own Web site, www.fairisaac.com, its
general recipe for scoring consumer credit.
</P>
<P>
   The factors considered are payment history (35 percent of the
overall score); amounts and types of outstanding debt (30 percent);
length of credit history (15 percent); amount of new credit
recently sought or gained (10 percent); and types of credit in use
(10 percent). Points are added to yield a score that ranges from
the 300s to the 900s _ the higher, the better.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, Fair, Isaac's recipe confirms popular notions of
what good credit means: that people who borrow moderately and pay
on time can expect to score better than those who borrow to the
limit or not at all, or those who chronically pay late. But some
idiosyncrasies and potential pitfalls revealed in the scoring
system may surprise consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Moves to remove credit blemishes, for example, may not help, or
may even backfire. Closing an account that you once paid late won't
remove it from consideration. Say you think you are carrying too
much debt on too many credit cards, so you get a loan from a
personal finance company to consolidate the debt into a single,
easier-to manage payment. A good move? Not for your credit score:
finance-company loans are considered a greater sign of risk than
owing the same amount on credit cards. On top of that, if you
consolidate the debt into one loan and close the credit card
accounts, you have reduced the credit available to you without
reducing the amount you owe, which hurts your score.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a consumer who always pays her credit card balances in
full each month. Her credit scores will rise, based on zero card
debt, right? Wrong. The scoring system generally picks up the
balances on her most recent statements _ before she has paid them.
So if she racks up a lot of charges each month _ say, to earn
bonuses like airline miles _ it is possible that her score will be
pulled down a bit by what the formula considers heavy debt relative
to her credit limit, even if she has never missed a payment.
</P>
<P>
   Even shopping aggressively online for the best rate on a new
loan can lower your score. Each time you enter personal information
like your income and Social Security number on a Web site's form,
it may be reported to credit bureaus as a credit inquiry. Too many
credit inquiries will count against you, though Fair, Isaac said it
had taken steps to collapse multiple inquiries for a particular
loan over a short period into a single hit for scoring purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inquiries are not enough to make or break someone's score,''
said Cheri St. John, a senior vice president of Fair, Isaac, who
oversees its credit bureau scoring services unit. Still, she
advises, ``only shop for and accept the credit you need.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, consumers setting out to establish credit were told
that more credit is better, a myth ``that took a while to dispel,''
St. John said. In fact, getting too much credit at once makes a
person appear risky, she said; building up gradually and
establishing a good payment history is a better approach.
</P>
<P>
   While Fair, Isaac provides the models used to calculate scores,
it does not have access to credit bureau data on individuals. The
scores are used in three out of four mortgage originations as well
as for other kinds of loans; a score in the middle 600s is
generally high enough to get a mortgage on favorable terms. Keith
T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a research firm
in Butler, N.J., said the federally sponsored mortgage agencies,
like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, use 620 as a cutoff for
high-quality loans.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, loans below that score are harder to package and
sell, so many mortgage lenders will deny credit or charge higher
interest rates, added fees and more points up front, Gumbinger
said. But contrary to popular belief, he said, in the mortgage
world, ``there's almost no benefit for having a better score'' than
620.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the only way a consumer can obtain his or her current
credit score is from a lender, which will usually reveal the score
only when an application is denied. Starting next month, consumers
who know their scores can get an explanatory report on the Fair,
Isaac Web site; people who do not know their scores can have their
lenders provide them to Fair, Isaac on their behalf, and then pass
along the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Fair, Isaac said, it would like to be able to
provide scores directly to consumers. Later this year, Trans Union,
one of the three major credit bureaus, plans to create its own
credit scores and explain the results to consumers. &QL;

 &HT;    `Choice is not first-rate '
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELVIDERE, Ill. _ Bob Newport of Belvidere, Ill., is a
Republican in a Republican county, but that doesn't mean the
Republican can chalk up his presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates must earn that vote, and so far, Newport remains
unimpressed by his choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess probably the only conclusion I've drawn is that it is
the lesser of two evils again,'' Newport said recently after a day
helping his son work the son's farm on the city outskirts in
northern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem. I don't know which one I want yet. The
choice is not first-rate as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   A farmer all his life, Newport, 76, has watched as the
agriculture economy lagged even as the national economy surged. In
Illinois, while agriculture is still king, pressure from
development and low prices have led some farmers to wonder if
politicians realize where the food chain really starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are beginning to realize that agriculture has not
shared in the bonanza, so called, that seems to be expanding the
economy,'' Newport said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Mary, raised two children by farming. Their
son, Mark, worked in agribusiness before taking over the farm when
Newport retired. A daughter, Claudia Newport, lives in the Miami
Valley, in Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Both the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush touted their candidates' support for free trade with
China, in part to help export farm produce.
</P>
<P>
   Newport doesn't give either man much credit for supporting what
he sees as a sensible decision to trade with the world's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Newport is waiting for some message from either Gore
or Bush that they are worth his vote.

 &HT;    `Al Gore is OK. He's the best of the two'
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACOMB COUNTY, Michigan _ Demonica Sykes, 22, a student at
Macomb County Community College in suburban Detroit, takes voting
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been voting since I was 18,'' said Sykes, who hopes to be
a pediatric surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The first time she cast a vote in a presidential election, she
picked Democrat Bill Clinton, ``because he was pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He (also) believed everyone should have an opportunity to
afford college,'' Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's contest between Democrat Al Gore, the vice
president, and Republican George W. Bush, the Texas governor,
hasn't excited her very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is OK. He's the best of the two,'' Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   He, however, has not exactly overwhelmed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not very personable,'' Sykes said. ``He doesn't really
talk to people. He talks at them. He's too iffy.'' The lack of
enthusiasm among some voters like Sykes is presenting a challenge
for Gore in the early days of the campaign. By fall, he must
solidify and energize these people, who are part of his natural
political base. Their lukewarm support gives Bush hope he might
snag some of these voters _ or that they'll sit out the election.
</P>
<P>
   While Sykes leans toward Gore, she also voted in Michigan's
Republican primary last Feb. 22. She cast her ballot for Arizona
Sen. John McCain. The primary was open to all voters and McCain won
with strong support from Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes voted for McCain even though she disagreed with him on key
issues such as abortion, which McCain opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McCain) was up front. He spoke to you,'' she said.
``McCain is a people person. . . . It's like talking to your
neighbor.''

 &HT;    `I can be swayed to vote for either guy'
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Jim Hamulock walks by an abandoned green Chevy
Impala with broken windows, steps over four bags of rotting garbage
and drops the letters into the house through a rusted mail slot.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Cleveland the nation doesn't see.
</P>
<P>
   Hamulock, 53, has been a mail carrier in these south side
Italian and Latino neighborhoods for 32 years. He grimaces at the
thought of what these streets and homes used to be and what they
are now.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, only a few miles away, is the Cleveland the
nation does see. The new ballpark. The renovated lake front. The
Flats.
</P>
<P>
   Hamulock, who is married and has three grown children, is one of
the thousands of undecided voters that Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Vice President Al Gore are desperate to win over by November.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Democrat, Hamulock said the people in these
neighborhoods haven't found the booming economy that Gore is taking
credit for and promises to keep going. The letter carrier, who has
never voted for a Republican presidential candidate, isn't sure who
he'll vote for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone sees the new stadiums and says how beautiful
Cleveland is now. Well, those two guys ought to walk with me on my
route one day and see the real Cleveland, the people they need to
be helping,'' Hamulock said. ``There used to be so much pride in
this community. I don't know if either Bush or Gore would do much
to help people in neighborhoods like this help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the issues, Hamulock presents a mixed bag. He likes
Gore's plan for improving health care and thinks the vice president
will protect average workers like him. But he likes Bush's tax cut
ideas that might put a few bucks back into his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit it, I can be swayed to vote for either guy,'' he
said. ``I just don't want to keep hearing from Gore or Bush about
how everybody is doing so well in this economy. Because not
everybody is.''

<P>
   HAVERTOWN, Pa. _ Nelson Azeff is a gleeful ticket-splitter.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he will vote for his conservative Republican
congressman, as he always does, and closely consider the roster of
candidates the GOP _ his party _ has nominated for state and local
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that will mean a thing when Azeff, a Republican
voter in the thoroughly Republican suburbs of Philadelphia, looks
at the presidential race. He twice voted for President Clinton and
at the moment is favoring Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm split, split right down the middle,'' he said,
before adding, ``If I'm leaning at all, it's toward Gore. I haven't
heard of anything great coming out of Texas, except that it has the
most executions of any state in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Azeff's penchant for following his nose to either side of the
political spectrum is common in Pennsylvania, where the governor's
office seems to switch between a Democrat and a Republican every
eight years with a pendulum's precision.
</P>
<P>
   Azeff, 61, of Havertown, Pa., is a retired marketing executive
who specialized in companies that develop environmental testing
equipment _ including several years with a Yellow Springs firm that
had him traveling to Ohio for weeks at a time. His wife is a school
teacher near retirement herself, which has them talking about
getting a part-time place in Florida, where both their children
live.
</P>
<P>
   A back disability forced Azeff into early retirement five years
ago, and left him slightly hobbled and loaded with free time. He
uses it to study politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got those campaign fliers in the mail, I actually read
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Azeff, it's all about issues. He said he believes in
affordable health care for everyone, an end to American military
involvement ``in all these little places all over the world,''
limited immigration and a Social Security program left entirely in
the hands of the federal government. No individual control of
investing that money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that our government has to be involved
in, right up to the neck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, he's conflicted over who would handle the whole
job best. He said he thinks Texas Gov. George W. Bush would do a
better job on the foreign policy issues (``. . . because of his dad
. . .''), but he thinks Gore may be better prepared for domestic
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the things I'm talking about aren't Republican or
Democrat things, they're just good for the country,'' he said.

president, and Republican George W. Bush, the Texas governor,
hasn't excited her very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is OK. He's the best of the two,'' Sykes said.
</P>
<P>
   He, however, has not exactly overwhelmed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not very personable,'' Sykes said. ``He doesn't really
talk to people. He talks at them. He's too iffy.'' The lack of
enthusiasm among some voters like Sykes is presenting a challenge
for Gore in the early days of the campaign. By fall, he must
solidify and energize these people, who are part of his natural
political base. Their lukewarm support gives Bush hope he might
snag some of these voters _ or that they'll sit out the election.
</P>
<P>
   While Sykes leans toward Gore, she also voted in Michigan's
Republican primary last Feb. 22. She cast her ballot for Arizona
Sen. John McCain. The primary was open to all voters and McCain won
with strong support from Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes voted for McCain even though she disagreed with him on key
issues such as abortion, which McCain opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McCain) was up front. He spoke to you,'' she said.
``McCain is a people person. . . . It's like talking to your
neighbor.''

 &HT;    `I can be swayed to vote for either guy'

   CLEVELAND _ Jim Hamulock walks by an abandoned green Chevy
Impala with broken windows, steps over four bags of rotting garbage
and drops the letters into the house through a rusted mail slot.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Cleveland the nation doesn't see.
</P>
<P>
   Hamulock, 53, has been a mail carrier in these south side
Italian and Latino neighborhoods for 32 years. He grimaces at the
thought of what these streets and homes used to be and what they
are now.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, only a few miles away, is the Cleveland the
nation does see. The new ballpark. The renovated lake front. The
Flats.
</P>
<P>
   Hamulock, who is married and has three grown children, is one of
the thousands of undecided voters that Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Vice President Al Gore are desperate to win over by November.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong Democrat, Hamulock said the people in these
neighborhoods haven't found the booming economy that Gore is taking
credit for and promises to keep going. The letter carrier, who has
never voted for a Republican presidential candidate, isn't sure who
he'll vote for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone sees the new stadiums and says how beautiful
Cleveland is now. Well, those two guys ought to walk with me on my
route one day and see the real Cleveland, the people they need to
be helping,'' Hamulock said. ``There used to be so much pride in
this community. I don't know if either Bush or Gore would do much
to help people in neighborhoods like this help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the issues, Hamulock presents a mixed bag. He likes
Gore's plan for improving health care and thinks the vice president
will protect average workers like him. But he likes Bush's tax cut
ideas that might put a few bucks back into his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit it, I can be swayed to vote for either guy,'' he
said. ``I just don't want to keep hearing from Gore or Bush about
how everybody is doing so well in this economy. Because not
everybody is.''

   JACKSON, Miss. _ The legend was that if you touched Robert
Johnson you could feel the talent running through him, like heat,
put there by the devil on a dark delta crossroad in exchange for
his soul. It is why Claud Johnson's grandparents would not let him
out of the house that day in 1937 when Robert Johnson, his father,
strolled into the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, the famous, almost mythical blues man, had come
to Lincoln County, Miss., to see Virgie Jane Smith, a young woman
he had been intimate with, and a son he had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were living in my granddaddy and grandmama's house,'' Claud
Johnson said, thinking back. ``They were religious people, and they
thought that the blues was the devil's music. People back then
believed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told my daddy they didn't want no part of him. They said
he was working for the devil, and they wouldn't even let me go out
and touch him,'' Johnson said. ``I stood in the door, and he stood
on the ground, and that is as close as I ever got to him. Finally,
he said, `Well, I might as well go on.' He wandered off, and I
never saw him again.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to believe that Robert Johnson came for him that day,
and he has always wondered what would have happened if he had run
across that porch to him, so that everyone would know he was Robert
Johnson's son.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 63 years later, the Mississippi Supreme Court has ruled
that Johnson, a retired gravel truck driver who lives quietly in
Crystal Springs, Miss., truly is the flesh-and-blood of a man so
mythologized that many people do not know where the legend ends and
the truth begins.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after years of legal battles between Johnson and
other, more distant relatives, the state Supreme Court ruled that
Johnson is the son and sole heir of one of the most influential
musicians of the 20th century, and that he can rightfully receive
more than $1 million dollars in music royalties amassed in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I have known that he was my father,'' said
Johnson, whose mother had a romantic fling with Robert Johnson in
1931, resulting in his birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was a famous man, but he didn't live to see his
fame,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would never forget the sight of Robert Johnson, still
a young man at 26 or 27, ``clean-cut,'' and sharply dressed as he
walked into the yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was fortunate,'' Claud Johnson said. ``At least I got to
see him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, and in the broader world of music, Robert
Johnson's name evokes rich, dark and mysterious images of the delta
that gave birth to his music.
</P>
<P>
   Every guitar picker knows the story of how Robert Johnson, just
a raggedy farm worker who wanted badly to play the blues on his old
guitar, sold his soul to Satan at that dark crossroads in
Mississippi, how the devil put fire in his fingers and brimstone in
his throat, fusing him with talent and promising him fame.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone, at least most folks in Mississippi, know that the
devil is a liar. Some people here blame the devil for Robert
Johnson's demise, saying he tricked him and gave him just enough
fame to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who wrote such blues standards as ``Rambling on My
Mind,'' ``Crossroads Blues'' and ``Me and the Devil Blues,''
produced 41 records, and his haunting, plaintive vocals and guitar
work influenced countless blues and rock 'n' roll musicians. But
died penniless at age 27 in 1938 in Greenwood. He left no will
because he had nothing to pass on except his music, which few
people seemed interested in at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Guralnik, the author of ``Searching for Robert Johnson,''
(Dutton Books, 1989), said that some have called Johnson the father
of blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so remarkable is not that he struck such an original
chord, but what was new was the way each song was focused in a way
a lot of blues songs aren't,'' Guralnik said.
</P>
<P>
   He was so unappreciated at the time of his death that no one is
even sure where Johnson is buried.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Mike Mills said in his ruling
that it was impossible to get DNA evidence from a body that does
not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, Johnson is buried `down by the highwayside,
so his old evil spirit can get a Greyhound bus and ride,''' the
justice wrote in the ruling, quoting one of Johnson's songs, ``Me
and the Devil Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a body forced Claud Johnson's lawyers to turn to
other means to prove his connection to his father, including, as it
turned out, an eyewitness to his conception.
</P>
<P>
   Claud Johnson's mother, the late Virgie Jane Smith Cain, swore
in a 1992 deposition that Robert Johnson had fathered her child.
</P>
<P>
   That might not have carried much weight in court, but Cain's
testimony had collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   A childhood friend, Eula Mae Williams, testified in a 1998 trial
that she watched Robert Johnson and her friend have sex in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Claud was born nine months later.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson grew up hearing his mother say that he was the son of
the famous blues man, and that made him proud, though he said he
never thought that his father's legend, ``would amount to anything
in money.''
</P>
<P>
   When his mother married a man named Marshall Cain, she insisted
that he take Cain as his last name. But as soon as he was grown, he
legally changed his name to Johnson. ``I got it on my first Social
Security card,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his lawyers, Jeffrey Ellis of Crystal Springs, said that
no one can say that Claud Johnson started claiming his kinship only
after Robert Johnson's recordings became valuable in the 1980s.
``Mr. Claud had been claiming this all his life,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Other relatives questioned the validity of his blood ties to
Johnson. Annye C. Anderson, of Amherst, Mass., and Robert M.
Harris, of Annapolis, Md., are the half-sister and grandson of
Carrie Harris Thompson, who was Robert Johnson's half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson died in 1983 and left the rights to Robert Johnson's
music to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Johnson filed suit in Mississippi seeking to
have himself declared the legal heir and the one entitled to $1.2
million in royalties from the blues artist's recordings.
</P>
<P>
   A trial court ruled in favor of Johnson in 1998, but that ruling
was appealed, leading to the decision on Thursday by the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   James Craig, the lawyer representing the other relatives, said
Friday that he was considering filing a motion for the court to
reconsider the ruling. But he said he did not expect extensive
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also disputed the evidence presented to show Johnson's
parentage. Johnson's birth certificate lists Robert Johnson as the
father, Craig said, but Johnson himself never signed the
certificate. Under Mississippi law, birth certificates for children
born out of wedlock must have the father's signature to be valid
proof of paternity, he said.

MICROSOFT ACCUSES ITS RIVALS OF GARBAGE-CAN TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. accused its rivals Friday of
masterminding an attempt to buy the trash generated by a
Microsoft-backed lobbying organization, apparently hoping it would
yield valuable information about the company.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation came as the Justice Department filed another
brief in the antitrust case against the company. It sought to
counter a Microsoft brief filed Thursday opposing the government's
effort to send the company's appeal in the case directly to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The trash-buying effort was first reported by Wired.com on
Thursday evening and The Wall Street Journal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this month, on June 1 and June 6, a woman identifying
herself as Blanca Lopez offered to pay a worker from a cleaning
service to hand over the trash from the offices of the Association
for Competitive Technology in downtown Washington, according to
documents from the company that manages the association's office
space.
</P>
<P>
   The workers refused both times _ even when, on the second
attempt, they were offered $500 each, plus another $200 for their
supervisor. The second attempt came the day before U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his order to break up
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The association, chartered in 1998, is heavily financed by
Microsoft and has been a an unwavering supporter of the company in
its antitrust battle with the government, as well as other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that our competitors have pursued an
orchestrated and aggressive campaign against us,'' said Vivek
Varma, a Microsoft spokesman, ``and this suggests that they are
willing to go to extraordinary and unseemly lengths to attack our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Zuck, head of the association, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But Zuck and Varma both acknowledged that they had not been able
to determine which competitor, if any, was behind the trash-buying
effort _ though they did say they considered it reasonable to
surmise that a Microsoft rival was involved. The Washington police
are investigating the episode but have not said what they may have
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Zuck said a private investigative company, Investigative Group
International, appeared to have been involved, though he and others
said they did not know who might have hired the company.
Investigative Group International said it would not discuss its
clients or activities.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, according to the documents, gained after-hours entrance
to the office building and the office suite where the Association
for Competitive Technology has its offices using the pass key of an
entity called Upstream Technologies, which had rented an office
nearby last month. But Upstream appears to be a dummy company;
association officers say they believe the private investigators
rented the space under the name of Upstream just to be near the
association's offices.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, someone broke into Microsoft's offices near Dupont
Circle, two miles away, earlier this week, the company said.
Nothing has been found to be missing, and the offices of two other
unrelated companies in the same building were broken into the same
night. So Microsoft officials say they have drawn no conclusions
about that break in.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest move on the legal front, the government responded
to an assertion by Microsoft that the Expediting Act, allowing
direct appeal to the Supreme Court of important federal antitrust
cases, does not apply to the companion case against Microsoft filed
by 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   The government brief Friday noted that even if the Microsoft
argument was correct, the states would file a motion allowing
defendants or plaintiffs to petition the Supreme Court for direct
appeal of any case before the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court seldom agrees to such requests. But Tom
Goldstein, a Washington lawyer who argues cases before the Supreme
Court, said, ``This is the sort of circumstance when it is
permitted, when there's a sister case already up there.''

 WASHINGTON: nuclear secrets. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senior Energy Department officials received word of the
discovery Friday afternoon while they were meeting to discuss how
to deal with the crisis caused by the loss of the hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The latest security problem at Los Alamos dates to May 7, when
members of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team discovered that the
hard drives were missing while they were making sure that equipment
stored in the X Division vault was secure as a forest fire raged
near the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   They did not inform Browne for more than three weeks, on the
night of May 31. The Energy Department and the FBI were notified
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that a total of 86 people had access to the vault
where the hard drives were stored, including 26 scientists who
could enter without escorts and remove material without logging it
in or out.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began conducting polygraph examinations of those with
access to the material this week, and officials said three people
had failed as of Friday. It was not known how the polygraph results
were being interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials stressed that it was too soon to draw strong
conclusions about the disappearance and reappearance of the hard
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials speculated that whoever took the drives might
have panicked in the face of a major investigation and dropped them
behind the copying machine in the last day or so. But the intense
scrutiny of the case by the FBI could make it difficult to maintain
a coverup for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to aggressively pursue this serious matter,''
Richardson said in a statement. ``There will be accountability and
disciplinary actions regarding the Los Alamos incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the hard drives was the latest in a series
of security lapses at the highest levels of government, including
at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Los Alamos came under scrutiny following evidence
that China may have stolen nuclear data from the lab. In December,
a former scientist at Los Alamos, Wen Ho Lee, was arrested for
mishandling classified material after it was discovered that he had
downloaded and copied vast amounts of nuclear data from the
classified computer network at Los Alamos into an unsecure network
and onto portable computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is now in jail awaiting trial, and has said that he is
innocent of the charges.

MYSTIFIED AS EVER, KNOBLAUCH GOES BACK TO WORK

  (See also BBO-KNOBLAUCH-PSYCHOLOGY) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck Knoblauch explained that the first thing he did
after leaving Yankee Stadium on Thursday night was to call his
mother, he intimated that he had received some undisclosed
treatment for his chronic throwing difficulties after the 1999
season and he claimed that he is not thinking about retiring from
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The second baseman who does not always throw straight was back
at the Stadium Friday night, and back in the lineup and back trying
to cope with the unexplainable.
</P>
<P>
   A little anxious and a little tentative, Knoblauch talked about
feeling as if he has little control over the simple act of throwing
a ball from second base to first base. It is something that
Knoblauch had done successfully since he was a boy, but he has been
plagued by his wobbly throws for about two years, and that problem
exploded when he made three errors in a 12-3 loss to the White Sox,
and ended up departing before the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering if I was in Central Park,'' said Knoblauch,
``not Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch knew he was definitely in Yankee Stadium Friday
night as the fans gave him a standing ovation before he batted in
the first inning and gave him a partial standing ovation when he
corralled a pop fly in the second. There were banners supporting
Knoblauch through his ordeal, including one that said, ``We love
you Knobby and our teams needs you.''
</P>
<P>
   As manager Joe Torre discussed how Knoblauch was being embraced
as a sympathetic figure after Thursday's fiasco, he said, ``I think
he only proved that he was human.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch ended some of the suspense about his future by showing
up for work with teammate Jason Grimsley at 2:30 p.m. About 50 fans
cheered Knoblauch when he sauntered from the parking lot to the
Stadium and they also scolded a television camera operator who was
filming the second baseman. Knoblauch kept his eyes focused ahead
of him, mostly oblivious to the attention.
</P>
<P>
   After a security guard escorted Knoblauch to the Yankees'
clubhouse, the Yankees kept the doors closed to reporters for an
extra 20 minutes so Knoblauch could meet with Torre. Torre asked
Knoblauch what he wanted to do and also told him, ``You're my
second baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Knoblauch had spoken to Torre, he basically invited
reporters over to his locker. Knoblauch said he had received so
many calls from teammates that he called it a ``suicide watch,''
but he stressed that despite trashing some items in the clubhouse
Thursday night, he would not have ``done anything crazy'' because
of his current funk.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last October, Alan Hendricks, Knoblauch's agent,
had said that he did not want to talk about Knoblauch's throwing
problems and he did not want his client to discuss them either. But
Knoblauch acknowledged that he will now seek some treatment,
although he refused to specify what kind. He has previously
mentioned a sports psychologist or a hypnotist as options.
</P>
<P>
   Before saying Friday night that he would seek treatment,
Knoblauch first said, ``You got to remember you guys don't know
exactly what I did last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's speculation that I didn't do anything,'' he
added, before inferring that he had. ``Obviously, through the
Yankees, something's going to take place. Whatever road that might
be, we're still deciding.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Torre and General Manager Brian Cashman said that whatever
Knoblauch does or does not do will be a personal decision and will
not be divulged by the Yankees. When Cashman was asked if it
behooved the Yankees to ask Knoblauch, who will make $6 million
this year, to seek treatment, he said, ``I think it's a good idea
that we support him as best as we can. To define that, I won't do.
We're in it together. We'll work it out together.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Knoblauch won a Gold Glove with Minnesota in
1997, when he made just 12 errors. Last year, he made 26, 14 of
them throwing. This season, he has eight throwing errors, and 12
overall, more than any other second baseman in baseball. His .938
fielding percentage is the worst at his position.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking of his dilemma Friday, Knoblauch was
self-deprecating at times and private in other moments. He would
not say why he tapped Torre on the knee and asked to speak with him
after the sixth inning on Thursday, even though the answer was
obvious. Torre said that Knoblauch, his eyes filled with
frustration, told him, ``I don't know what to do. I'm tired of
hurting the team.'' That is when Torre and Knoblauch agreed that he
should leave the game, return to his apartment in Manhattan and
thus avoid having to talk to reporters after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're stuck for anything to say,'' Torre said Friday. ``You
just want to hug him.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, Knoblauch said that the wild throw that he made in
Chicago on May 24 was actually worse than Thursday's three errant
pegs to first base. In a similar moment of frustration three weeks
ago, Knoblauch spoke about retirement three weeks ago, but he said
he did not think about it in this instance and gave ``very little''
consideration to not showing up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the desire,'' said Knoblauch. ``This is what you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Knoblauch said he was not sure if playing was the best
thing for him. Knoblauch, who singled in his first at-bat Friday
night, declined to take any infield practice while joking that he
knows how to catch grounders. Knoblauch sifted through words like
scared and apprehensive to vainly try to express how he felt. He
said his life is ``great,'' refusing to blame his father's
Alzheimer's disease or a complicated divorce after the 1998 season
for his throwing woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't fix something like this,'' said Torre. ``This is
something you have to endure more than you fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who had deep bags under his eyes and who had not
shaved in a few days, was standing beside Roger Clemens' locker
after doing two rounds of interviews. He was relaxed and loose as
he talked about how many people called him and how his mother,
Linda, wished she could fly from Texas to New York and hug him.

   Then Knoblauch glanced into Clemens' locker and pointed to a
miniature stone football on the shelf. Knoblauch told a reporter
that Clemens had given him one of the footballs with a saying from
Vince Lombardi inscribed across it. Lombardi's words were
meaningful to Knoblauch, who nodded in agreement while he read
them, ``The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender.''

RELIGION COLUMN: A LEADER WHO STANDS OUT IN A VIOLENT WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among religious leaders, President Abdurrahman Wahid of
Indonesia stands out, but not simply because he has repeatedly
called for a respectful dialogue among faiths and has decried any
appeal to religion as a justification for violence.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Wahid, who is Muslim, said those things again last
Tuesday at two gatherings in New York, one under the auspices of
the World Conference on Religion and Peace, and the other at the
United Nations under the auspices of the Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
   Many other religious leaders, including the Dalai Lama and Pope
John Paul II, have said much the same, although their
pronouncements have often been ignored, most tragically, by many of
their followers.
</P>
<P>
   But as head of a nation strained by political, economic, ethnic
and religious tensions, Wahid is virtually the only religious
leader who directly confronts the challenge of translating such
convictions into policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, the 59-year-old president was able to
convey both his commitment to religious peacemaking and the
obstacles he faced in meeting that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, Wahid's stature as a religious figure and an
intellectual preceded his political ascendancy. Put simply, in a
nation with the world's largest Islamic population, he headed the
world's largest Islamic organization.
</P>
<P>
   That organization, Nahdlatul Ulama, was founded in 1926 by
Muslim leaders that included his grandfather, an Islamic scholar.
It was meant to be a bulwark of the ``pesantren,'' traditional
rural schools that teach the Koran and other Arabic religious
texts, against urban Muslim modernizers who were establishing
schools that put more emphasis on secular learning, ethics and
individual freedom in interpreting sacred texts. Today, Nahdlatul
Ulama links 7,000 pesantren and claims more than 30 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners might wonder how such a background could produce a
leader like Wahid, a champion of pluralism, a defender of
minorities, a believer in the separation of mosque and state, a
sympathizer with Israel, an advocate of women's rights, a man
seemingly free of hostility toward modernization and the West and
convinced that many core values of post-Enlightenment liberalism
are compatible with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   How did traditionalism produce a man who not only knows the
Koran by heart but also, according to David Lamb of The Los Angeles
Times, travels with a Sony Walkman listening to Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony and Janis Joplin's ``Me and Bobby McGee''?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the explanation lies in Indonesia's Islam. Succeeding an
earlier mix of Hindu and Buddhist religiosity and co-existing with
local folk beliefs, Indonesian Islam seems to have inherited at
least a few genes for live-and-let-live pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   But the explanation is also familial and personal. Wahid's
father and grandfather were religious leaders and national heroes
in Indonesia's struggle for independence. Though steeped in
traditional Islam, the family environment was also polyglot and
cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid became a voracious reader, taking in not only Western
political philosophy and social theory but also the great Russian
and French novels. of the last two centuries. His reading in
American presidential history showed itself on Tuesday at the
United Nations when he wandered, impromptu, into comments on Andrew
Jackson and Old Hickory's fight with the National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   After Wahid's father died in an automobile accident, the son
took on the mantle of religious leadership. His studies in Islam
and Arabic literature took him from the Javanese pesantren to Al
Azhar University in Cairo and to Baghdad. At the same time, he
pursued soccer, French films, discussions about Jewish mysticism
and always his wide-ranging reading with at least equal diligence.
</P>
<P>
   No one has delved into this background more than Professor Greg
Barton, who teaches comparative religion and Asian studies at
Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. Barton, who is
completing an authorized biography of Wahid, also sheds light on
the Indonesian leader's personality and idiosyncrasies.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's spontaneity, playfulness and zest for life seem to
contradict the seriousness expected of a religious scholar and
leader. He is known for irreverent, even earthy, humor and for
puncturing pretentiousness. It is a manner that recalls a number of
Asian spiritual leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, there has been a seemingly erratic,
unpredictable character to Wahid's conduct. At times he has been
cautious, at other times outspoken, sometimes fearless, sometimes
compromising. And his shortcomings in day-to-day management,
exacerbated by his near blindness, are well known.
</P>
<P>
   But his apparent bumbling and inconsistency cloak an instinctual
canniness, said Barton, who compared Wahid to Semar, a clowning
character in the shadow puppet plays that are basic to Javanese
culture. Semar plays the buffoon but turns out to be the smartest
character in the plays' pantheon, the one who has the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Barton says Semar is like Colombo, the television detective
played by Peter Falk, a man who throws others off guard by
calculated maladroitness _ and gets the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Wahid can do the job remains to be seen. It is certainly
a formidable one, leading a nation of thousands of islands,
hundreds of languages and scores of ethnicities from
authoritarianism to democracy while weathering an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, his success will have a great deal to do with
his roots, so deep in Indonesia's Islam that they have allowed him
to encounter democracy and modernization confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he succeeds or not, Wahid has already challenged what
Professor Barton has described as the secular and ``typically
post-modern'' misconception that ``it's only by abandoning all
claims to metaphysical or absolute truth that one can be genuinely
tolerant and pluralist.''

PARTIES ACCUSED OF RUNNING ILLEGAL ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two advocacy groups accused the Democratic and
Republican parties Friday of breaking federal election law by using
large soft-money contributions to pay for television commercials
that are now showing across the country to promote the campaigns of
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the nonpartisan groups, Common Cause and Democracy
21, which both advocate the overhaul of federal election laws, said
they intended to file complaints next week with the Justice
Department and the Federal Election Commission challenging the
legality of the advertisements that began showing in 15 states last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not even an effort to hide the fact that these are
ads for the candidates paid for by soft money, and that is
illegal,'' Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a
former Massachusetts attorney general, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, said: ``We are
charging both the presidential campaigns and the political parties
with breaking the law with these ads. We are going to do everything
we can to make sure that the law is enforced this time, and that
these violations are not given a free ride again.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Common Cause challenged the legality of millions
of dollars of similar advertising, charging that the commercials
promoted specific candidates, not party issues. Although some
lawyers and officials at the Justice Department and the election
commission agreed, neither agency took action. Common Cause and
Democracy 21 are hoping that the new complaints will be more
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Federal election law prohibits the use of soft money, the
unrestricted donations to the parties, to pay for political
advertisements that promote the election of individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic parties defended the commercials,
saying they advocated particular issues and did not violate the
spirit or the letter of federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads are perfectly appropriate and legal,'' said Jenny
Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. ``Our
ads reflect a unified Democratic message, whether it is for the
presidency, the Congress or key state and local races.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff May, the spokesman of the Republican National Committee,
said party lawyers concluded that the Republican issue
advertisements were within the law. ``It's very clear that our ad
is about Social Security,'' May said, ``and it is appropriate to
have the leader of the party talking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential campaign, the parties challenged each
other's spending of millions of dollars on similar issue-advocacy
advertisements. This year, without speaking to each other, the
parties have settled on a set of unofficial rules of engagement:
The candidates can appear in the issue-advocacy commercials, even
speak in them, as long as each advertisement deals with a single
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the first flurry of party advertisements that began running
last weekend, both Gore and Bush appear, with Gore expressing his
concern about the high cost of prescription drugs and Bush
detailing his proposals for overhauling the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Democrats are introducing a new, soft-money
issue advertisement. Timed for Father's Day on Sunday, the
advertisement features Gore promoting ``responsible fatherhood,''
and it includes some biographical information about Gore's
relationship with his father.
</P>
<P>
   None of the commercials contain a specific electioneering
message asking voters to support or oppose either presumptive
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, similar issue advertisements also did not contain the
words ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' the party standard-bearers.
The absence of an electioneering message helped insulate the
parties from the legal challenge by Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   While some officials and lawyers at the Justice Department and
the Federal Election Commission believed the 1996 issue
advertisements were thinly veiled candidate commercials that should
not have been paid for with party funds, neither agency took action
against the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Democratic and the Republican commercials are being
paid for with a mix of hard money (the contributions to candidates
and political parties that are limited under federal law) and soft
money (the unlimited contributions made to political parties by
corporations, unions and wealthy individuals).
</P>
<P>
   Campaign-reform advocates said the issue advertisements now
being shown amounted to commercials to promote Bush and Gore. As
proof, they say the commercials are appearing in several important
battleground states in the presidential race, including Florida,
Missouri and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a total fiction and a fraud to claim that these are
political party issue advertisements,'' said Wertheimer, the
president of Democracy 21. ``Everyone involved knows they are
presidential campaign ads being run for the direct purpose of
influencing the presidential campaign, and therefore they cannot be
financed with soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican strategists acknowledged in interviews
this week that there was close coordination between the Bush and
Gore campaigns and the political parties to produce the
advertisements. In 1996, consultants for the Clinton-Gore campaign
and the Dole-Kemp campaign also created their parties' issue
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, Gore's communications director, said that the same
media consultants were working for Gore and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani said that the vice president had not reviewed the final
scripts of the first advertisements by the Democratic National
Committee, but that the law would allow him to do so. ``This
process has been carefully supervised by lawyers every step of the
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee hired a consultant, Alex
Castellanos, to produce its advertisements. May, the committee
spokesman, said Castellanos was not working on commercials for the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sandler, the Democratic National Committee's top lawyer,
said coordination between the Gore campaign and the national party
was allowed, even assumed, under recent court rulings and Federal
Election Commission opinions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sandler said Democratic leaders in Congress also played ``a
substantial role'' in shaping party advertisements and deciding
where they should run.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, urged
the creation of an advertisement on prescription drugs because the
issue had already worked to the benefit of Democrats in primary
campaigns this year. And Gephardt reviewed the advertisement the
evening before it first went on the air last week, a spokesperson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler said that Joe Andrew, the Democratic committee's
national chairman, and Rob Engel, its executive director, as well
as himself, reviewed the advertisements to be certain they did not
expressly advocate the election of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler noted that the Clinton and Dole campaigns had filed
complaints against each other because of the soft-money advertising
in 1996, saying that each party's advertisements crossed the line
into express advocacy of their candidate. This year, he said,
lawyers for the Republicans and Democrats shared a consensus on
what was permissible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a common legal interpretation that the standard is
more or less no express advocacy and no references specifically
pertaining to the election of any particular candidate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to the House Republican leadership said the national
committee advertisements promoting Bush were not coordinated with
congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't do anything that would hurt us,'' the official
said, ``but the RNC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bush
campaign right now. We have two separate races.''
</P>
<P>
   He said House Republican leaders were waging an intensive
campaign in dozens of contested congressional districts, while the
national committee was overseeing the broad thematic campaign as
well as the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly know what they're doing,'' the official said.
``But the presidential race is so much more generic than the House
races.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee added a 30-second
advertisement late this week to the 60-second spot that began
running last weekend. Both are on Bush's plan to allow workers to
invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in private
investment plans. The spots are running in the same 15 states where
the Democratic prescription-drug commercials are being shown.

NEW YORK: this play. '''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Sax, who in 1983 as a second baseman for the Dodgers had
difficulties almost identical to Knoblauch's, said he does not
remember being under particular stress at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But he remembers, he said, what it felt like, and can guess at
what Knoblauch is feeling now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the toughest thing I've ever gone through,'' said Sax,
now an analyst for Fox Sports Net's Baseball Today. ``It's
completely unexplainable. It's so awful, and everybody in the world
is watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   When his problem was at its peak, he said, he stood on the field
and prayed ``Please, please don't hit it to me, please don't hit
the ball to me!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when a small white sphere was hurtling in his direction,
he felt sorry for himself. Then he got mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really ticked and I beat this thing,'' Saks said. ``I
didn't turn my back on it. I bit it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he is glad he went through the ordeal. ``It made
me a better person. It put things in perspective and it made me a
better player.''
</P>
<P>
   The following years, he added, were the best in his career,
years when his second-base prayers changed to ``Please hit the ball
to me because when you do, this game is over.''
</P>
<P>
   All Knoblauch has to do, Sax said, ``is to get his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just turn our brains off, we'd be fine,'' he said.

PARADISE GARAGE, A GAY CLUB THAT CHANGED NIGHT LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tattoo on Mel Charen's left bicep is the logo of
the Paradise Garage, the club that occupied 84 King Street in SoHo
from 1977 to 1987. In the garden behind his Chelsea apartment is
the sign that used to hang over the club's door: a curly-haired
figure with a tambourine halo, along with a disco whistle and an
amyl nitrate popper dangling below. A friend salvaged it from a
garbage heap after the club closed.
</P>
<P>
   To Charen, 67, who has been a promotion man, a record-company
owner, a painter, a landlord and a philanthropist, the Paradise
Garage was ``the ultimate expression of the whole fabric'' of gay
night life. With some financial backing from Charen, it was created
by his business partner and ex-lover Michael Brody just as disco
music was heading for its commercial peak, pulling gay culture into
the American mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   For Charen and many of the club's other regulars, the Garage's
best years were the culmination of a utopian time for gay men in
New York City, when it seemed that the pleasures of dancing, casual
sex and recreational drug use could go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``All now was turned to jollity and game/To luxury and riot,
feast and dance,'' as John Milton wrote about a different lost
paradise. Charen wasn't a musician, producer, disc jockey or club
owner; he was a fan who made it his business to get the music heard
_ ``the guy who put all the pieces together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The club is at the center of Charen's autobiography, ``Keep on
Dancin': My Life and the Paradise Garage,'' just published by 24
Hours for Life, the nonprofit AIDS relief organization he founded.
(It will receive the book's proceeds.) ``Keep on Dancin''' details
the makings of modern dance music in a tangle of friendships,
aesthetic imperatives, business deals and sexual liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the good times of the late 1970s unravel with the AIDS
epidemic, the decline of disco and his own setbacks. Charen will
give a reading from the book on Thursday at A Different Light
bookstore on West 19th Street, timed to coincide with New York's
Gay Pride Week, June 18 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in the bright first-floor garden apartment of Colonial
House, a bed-and-breakfast that was a dingy single-room-occupancy
hotel in Chelsea when Charen and Brody bought it in 1973 for
$31,000. An excitable pair of gray schnauzers greet guests.
Charen's paintings fill the walls of the living room, some equipped
with ultraviolet lights to make their fluorescent paints glow. One
is a shimmering vision of New York City as clubland, emblazoned
with the names of bygone discotheques. Charen wears a silver ring
and a belt buckle that used to belong to Larry Levan, who died in
1992; Levan was the disc jockey who put the Paradise Garage at the
forefront of dance music. Charen still goes dancing whenever he
can.
</P>
<P>
   But he misses the Paradise Garage. It was, as billed, a
refurbished garage. It had no air-conditioning or central heating;
it didn't sell alcohol, which meant it could stay open after bar
hours, often until noon the next morning. But it had a magnificent
sound system that was constantly being improved by Levan, whose
marathon Saturday night sets carried dancers from sweaty exertion
to exaltation while gospel-diva voices preached love. The club's
devotees _ predominantly black gay men _ came to dance, not to
drink or pose. Among the countless clubs that have come and gone in
New York City, the Paradise Garage is still mourned.
</P>
<P>
   ``One important thing that the Garage did, which is not being
done today, is to bring together black and white, straight and gay
in one place,'' Charen said. ``When people learn to dance together,
they can get along.''
</P>
<P>
   The music Levan played at the Garage taught a generation of disc
jockeys how to work a crowd. It is widely acknowledged as the
precursor of house music, the steady-thumping beat that came out of
Chicago and now holds sway in clubs around the world. New York
City's two reigning house disc jockeys, Junior Vasquez and Danny
Tenaglia, both frequented the Paradise Garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a major wallflower in that club, almost every weekend,''
Tenaglia once said. ``My roots are basically set from the Paradise
Garage era.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, disc jockeys recently named a style of dance music
``garage'' after the club. But Charen insists it doesn't much
resemble what was heard at the Paradise Garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``House music,'' Charen said, ``is the Garage on a budget. The
music Larry played, like the Salsoul Orchestra and MFSB, was made
by orchestras, by live musicians. When the kids in Chicago wanted
to start recording, they couldn't afford that and the computer came
into being, so they did it at home and it was stripped down, with
no vocals. So it was funkier. House is Garage on a budget, and
hip-hop is R&AMP;B with baggy pants.''
</P>
<P>
   His reactivated label, West End, has just released a two-CD
album of Levan in action, from a disc-jockey set mixed live in
1979. People who go to dance clubs now, where a disc jockey may
stretch out a single stark beat for 20 minutes, may be surprised at
how much of Levan's music uses full-length vocal verses and
choruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells a whole story in the songs,'' Charen said. ``And he
would talk to you with the music. Once, after we hadn't been
talking, I was dancing under the booth. He played, `Gotta Get You
Back Into My Life,' and came down and gave me a hug.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Charen, who grew up in Boston, entered the music business as a
sales representative for ABC-Paramount Records in 1959. In the
early 1960s, he began to dabble in painting; he never used a brush,
just his fingers. The jazz producer Bob Thiele liked some of the
canvases, and Charen's paintings ended up on the covers of albums,
including Archie Shepp's ``Fire Music'' and Sonny Rollins' ``East
Broadway Run Down''; he was nominated for Grammy Awards for album
art.
</P>
<P>
   After being drafted into the Army, which stationed him in
Stuttgart, Germany, Charen returned to the music business in 1970,
working for a small label, Scepter Records. He started to go
dancing at discotheques, getting involved in a club circuit that he
has never left. He began to hear rhythm-and-blues songs with a
danceable beat: music that would be embraced at gay dance clubs
like the Firehouse and the Loft, and that would later be
categorized as disco. At Scepter, he became what he calls a ``disco
pest,'' urging the company to release some of the new dance music.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Scepter made a deal for a single, ``We're on the Right
Track,'' by Ultra High Frequency; it owned only that one song. At
the time, disc jockeys were playing three-minute 45 rpm singles,
and wished they could extend songs somehow. Charen convinced
Scepter to put an instrumental version of ``We're on the Right
Track'' on the B-side of the single. Disc jockeys latched on to it
immediately; with two copies of the single, they could add
instrumental passages to stretch the song to any length. Soon, the
instrumental B-side became standard for dance singles.
</P>
<P>
   But Scepter didn't have its heart in dance music, and after it
shut down in 1976, Charen and a partner started West End Music
Industries. Its first attempt at a disco hit, ``Sessamato'' by
Sessa Matto, included a sound effect created by playing a piece of
recording tape backward: a scratchy whoosh that soon caught the ear
of rappers. It was, Charen contends, the first recorded scratch,
now a familiar sound created by hip-hop disc jockeys spinning discs
in reverse. Charen had a chance to be a partner in the new Paradise
Garage, but declined, not wanting to get into business with a
former lover. He put up some money for the new club, however, which
paid for its sound system. With disco entering its commercial
heyday, West End flourished until the early 1980's, pumping hits
onto dance floors like Karen Young's ``Hot Shot'' and two singles
by Taana Gardner, ``Work That Body'' and the indelible
``Heartbeat,'' which sold 800,000 copies and has been repeatedly
sampled by hip-hop producers.
</P>
<P>
   If Levan liked a new song, he'd play it again and again at the
Paradise Garage. Radio stations listened to what was being played
at the clubs, and a song that made dancers scream on a Saturday
night would show up on WBLS on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1980, a backlash had begun. The music business, having
flooded the market with bad disco songs, stopped even mentioning
the word ``disco''; radio stations turned to pop and new wave rock,
and dance music retreated to the clubs. Charen had started smoking
PCP (angel dust); West End's string of hits dried up. Many of his
friends grew ill with a disease that had not yet been named _ AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Charen's world crumbled. He handed over his
interest in West End to his partner, thinking the company was
bankrupt; he successfully litigated to retrieve it in the 1990s.
The Paradise Garage closed in September 1987, two months before
Brody died of AIDS. Charen attended funerals for friend after
friend. He helped organize efforts to make sense of the epidemic.
Colonial House became the first headquarters for Gay Men's Health
Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Charen started 24 Hours for Life to raise
money for AIDS relief from the music business, an effort that
remains frustrating. ``After losing so many friends, I'm still here
and healthy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former Paradise Garage at 84 King Street is now just a
garage again, where Bell Atlantic parks its trucks. Charen dreams
of turning it into a club, and he nurtures the hope that his book
could make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make a movie of the book,'' he said, ``they would need
a set. They could buy the building, put it back the way it was and
leave it, then turn it over to 24 Hours for Life. Every night of
the week would be a different party. Everybody who works there
would get paid, but the profits would go to a community chest of
charities. And if it happened in New York, it could happen in
London, in Tokyo, in Paris. I have Larry Levan's ashes, and I want
to put up a glass enclosure. Like the pope is in the Vatican;
Larry's ashes would be in the Garage.''

FATHER'S DAY, OR FOR SOME, `GODFATHER'S DAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many men who run huge enterprises and reach the
summit of their professions want their sons to follow in their
footsteps. But on this Father's Day, two sons who tried to follow
their fathers' career paths have instead followed them into prison.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, it was a family business. The fathers are John
Gotti, the convicted boss of the Gambino crime family, and Carmine
Persico, the imprisoned leader of the Colombo family.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, 59, and Persico, 66, have been accused by prosecutors of
leading, respectively, two of the nation's largest and deadliest
Mafia families. They are serving life sentences on charges of
murder and racketeering. Their sons, John A. Gotti, 36, and
Alphonse T. Persico, 46, are also behind prison walls, mainly as a
consequence of inheriting their fathers' criminal empires,
organized crime experts assert.
</P>
<P>
   When the elder Gotti and the elder Persico anointed their sons
as their successors, they defied long-standing Mafia orthodoxy,
according to law enforcement officials and mob historians. These
experts note that although mobsters can recruit close relatives,
under Mafia tradition a boss cannot unilaterally designate a
successor. No previous American Mafia boss, the experts said, had
crowned a son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but the Mafia is an organization based on a bit of
meritocracy,'' said Frederick Martens, the former executive
director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission and the former Mafia
intelligence chief of the New Jersey State Police, in an interview.
``Gotti and Persico tried to shove their kids down the throats of
their families, and it created enormous dissension.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say the two sons admire their fathers and do not
hold them responsible for their convictions. The sons would like to
make happy Father's Day calls, but they are barred by federal rules
from telephoning inmates in other prisons.
</P>
<P>
   After first asserting that the Gottis were victims of a vendetta
by the FBI and by prosecutors, Bruce Cutler, their lawyer, said
that the men would ``be together in spirit'' on Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Levin, Alphonse Persico's lawyer, said the son deeply
regretted being unable to speak with his father but would
communicate his affection and respect in letters. ``There is an
incredibly close and loving relationship between my client and his
father,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   So far, what the authorities described as attempts by the Gottis
and the Persicos to create underworld dynasties have apparently
backfired. As ``acting bosses,'' the sons became the subjects of
spirited investigations that led to their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   And, investigators say, the sons' fast-track Mafia promotions
ignited dissension in the Gambino family and a bloody war in the
Colombo family.
</P>
<P>
   Sentenced in 1992, John Gotti is serving a life sentence in
virtual solitary confinement at the federal penitentiary in Marion,
Ill. In September, his son began a sentence of six years and five
months at the federal penitentiary in Ray Brook, N.Y., near Lake
Placid, after pleading guilty to racketeering and extortion
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Carmine Persico was sentenced in 1986 to combined terms of 130
years on two racketeering convictions and is at the federal
penitentiary in Lompoc, Calif. In February, Alphonse Persico began
an 18-month sentence in the federal penitentiary in Miami for
illegal gun possession.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former investigators said that John Gotti and
Carmine Persico groomed their eldest sons for the Mafia. And the
sons, investigators insist, relished the power, money and attention
that flowed to them as mobster princes.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Gotti, whose underworld nickname is Junior, grew up
in Howard Beach, Queens County, and attended an upstate
military-style prep school. Before his conviction, he maintained
that his income came from legitimate trucking, construction and
real estate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   J. Bruce Mouw, a former FBI supervisor of the bureau's Gambino
and Colombo family squads in the 1990s, said that John Gotti
appointed his son as the Gambinos' acting boss from prison in 1994,
with the intention of having him become his full-fledged successor.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mafia tradition, a boss _ even in prison _ retains his
title and much influence until death or abdication.
</P>
<P>
   Mouw described the younger Gotti as an inept leader in his five
years as acting boss, antagonizing veteran members of the Gambino
and other Mafia families. FBI and police investigators maintain
that the younger Gotti's recklessness brought about his quick
downfall. In one case, when FBI agents raided his office in 1998,
they found astonishingly incriminating evidence, including $358,000
in unexplained cash, a list of new Mafia members and an
unregistered handgun.
</P>
<P>
   His erratic record as a mob chief will probably prevent him from
resuming a powerful role in the Gambino family upon his release
from prison in about five years, the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Martens, the former Mafia intelligence chief, said he believes
that only one of John Gotti's four children, his daughter, Victoria
Gotti Agnello, an author of mystery novels, has capitalized on the
family name. ``Her father's fame probably landed her on the
best-sellers list while the same notoriety landed her brother in
prison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alphonse Persico was raised in South Brooklyn and in
Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, two neighborhoods that the authorities say
are Colombo family strongholds. The son, known as Allie Boy,
dabbled with the idea of becoming a lawyer but dropped out of St.
John's University after his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   At trials and in court proceedings, Alphonse Persico has
identified himself as a businessman with real estate holdings and
investments in a limousine service, a restaurant, two bagel shops
and a wholesale coffee company. But what the authorities described
as his criminal alliance with his father crystallized in 1986 when
both men were tried and convicted together on federal racketeering
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Carmine Persico's plan to have his son installed as acting boss
when he was paroled in 1994 provoked an internecine war between two
Colombo family factions in which at least 10 reputed gangsters and
a bystander were killed in the early 1990s, according to the FBI.
Investigators said that a family truce was arranged in the
mid-1990s and that Alphonse Persico was recognized as acting boss
by the Colombo gang last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mafia experts believe that Alphonse Persico's leadership is
shaky because of the gun conviction in February and a separate loan
sharking and fraud inquiry centering on him that federal
prosecutors in Brooklyn disclosed in October.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the sons may be sending their love to their fathers,
but some people will be wondering whether that affection was truly
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What father, if he had any love or compassion for his son,
would encourage him to become a mob boss or even a mobster?'' Mouw,
the former FBI supervisor, asked. ``Who would want his son to be in
danger of being killed or of being sent to jail? ''

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service Article sent on Monday, June 5,
about Ukraine's announcement that it will close the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant by Dec. 15 referred incorrectly to the number
of deaths and illnesses caused by the accident there in 1986. The
Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development said in a report that 31 people died in the first
weeks after the accident. Other estimates of deaths ultimately
caused by the accident range from dozens to tens of thousands;
estimates of illnesses range from hundreds to tens of thousands. It
has not been established that the accident caused untold thousands
of deaths and illnesses.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, June 15,
about talks at the United Nations on the war in Congo misspelled
the name of Secretary General Kofi Annan's special representative
to Congo. He is Kamel Morjane, not Kamal Moranje. The article also

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Saturday, May 13
about executions in Texas during the tenure of Gov. George W. Bush

who was executed in 1999. The lawyer was retained, not appointed.
The article included an erroneous tally from the parole board for
its vote in the case of Troy Farris, who was also executed in 1999.

FREE ADVICE FOR PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa, Ill., Mich.)  (For release Sunday, June 18) 
(Editors: Also See INVEST-Q&AMP;A) 
 By KATE BERRY and ELLEN ALMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How did Procter &AMP; Gamble, arguably the world's pre-eminent
marketer of consumer products, fall so far? The company stunned
investors on June 8 by announcing that it would miss earnings
projections for the third straight quarter and that Durk I. Jager,
its chief executive, would step down after just 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Jager himself was supposed to get the company going
again, his departure has raised doubts about whether it can squeeze
more growth from mature brands like Tide, Pringles and Crest, and
whether it can develop new brands that are nearly as promising.
</P>
<P>
   To provide answers, the company named Alan G. Lafley, the head
of North American operations, as its new president and chief
executive, and called John Pepper, a P&AMP;G former chairman and chief
executive who came back from retirement, to lead the board again.
Pepper admitted that, under Jager, the company took on ``too much
change, too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts including scholars, consultants, managers of other
corporations and former P&AMP;G executives have their own perspectives
on what went wrong and what the company should do to set things
right. Here are some of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Malamatinas, chief executive, Burger King Corp., a unit
of Diageo PLC and former marketing and brand manager, P&AMP;G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G needs to focus on some core brands. They need to put
ruthless focus on brands that create value down the road _ about 20
brands out of 400.
</P>
<P>
   They need to accelerate the introduction of new products and
support them. It's a fine balance between becoming a nimble,
flexible, agile, less bureaucratic organization, while at the same
time preserving great ingredients of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   The company has some great attributes. But they tried to take
out costs too quickly and they tried to shift the culture. The art
of the CEO is to preserve the culture while focusing on growth.
</P>
<P>
   They need to grow their top 10 brands in the top 6 markets. At
Burger King, I operate in 67 markets, but I know there are 6
markets that will deliver 80 percent of shareholder value and we
have to be ruthless in terms of allocating resources.
</P>
<P>
   Durk Jager tried to change the culture so quickly that he didn't
get the best out of the people. He tried to change the company
overnight. Most of the people have been there forever.
</P>
<P>
   When I talk to my people, I always talk about culture. If I was
the CEO, I would bring in some fresh blood from outside. They
always grew from within. I would bring in two or three top people.
</P>
<P>
   They are going to come back. They need the right leader and they
need to move quickly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karen Francis, chief marketing officer, Internet Capital Group;
former manger, Oldsmobile division, General Motors; former manager,
Crest brand, P&AMP;G &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was there from 1984 to 1987, and it really was the boot camp
of marketing training. Their marketing approach was focused on
really understanding a customer, honing in on them, and that was a
very smart and proven strategy for building brands.
</P>
<P>
   But the business economy, and the number of choices people have
today, are accelerating in ways we haven't seen before. So they
should be taking a little bit more risk, and getting involved in
trying more offerings.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent example is their new product Febreze [a spray for
removing odors from household fabrics). It was a risk. A company
the size of P&AMP;G, with their marketing penetration, should be able
to generate more of those products. Everyone is looking for what's
new. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sanmjay Dhar, professor of marketing, University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G is a company that needs a little bit of rethinking of its
vision. If you go back a few years, P&AMP;G essentially started getting
rid of people in-house who were doing analytic work. And that
doesn't make sense to me, because the marketing environment today
is very data intensive. This happened at the same time that other
consumer products companies, like Kraft, were adding more marketing
people and doing this very successfully.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G is good at innovation, and spinning new products. They are
not good at cost-cutting. A few years ago, they tried to reduce
coupons. Now, I have a baby and I end up buying Huggies all the
time because they have coupons available and P&AMP;G cut that out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cook, chairman and founder, Intuit, maker of software
including Quicken and Turbo Tax. Former Crisco brand manager, P&AMP;G &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I left, I applied the P&AMP;G method to an industry that sorely
needed it. Now we have the two best-selling software titles in
retail history. We put it through consumer tests, asked them what
they wanted. This software is written for consumers, not technical
people.
</P>
<P>
   The key at P&AMP;G was research and development. The products were
the best. You would do blind taste tests and give the customer
Brand X and ours, and they'd always pick ours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Schmitt, professor of business, Columbia University;
author of ``Experiential Marketing'' (The Free Press, 1999). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the problems are not confined to just P&AMP;G Unilever,
Nestle _ it's almost an industry disease. It's not just about the
individual products, it's about the companies behind them. It's
similar to the situation that faced IBM in the late 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Markets are conversations, not transaction tools. You have to
talk to customers in a human voice. You can't just project your
image on a screen; nowadays customers want different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   When you look at the products in the supermarkets that are on
the cutting edge, like fruit juices and those directed at New Age
lifestyles _ this entire culture is missing at P&AMP;G There's very
little product innovation.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest that they start experimenting with new product
categories and new approaches. Their focus has to be looking at
young consumers and how they live.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Faith Popcorn, consultant and author on marketing and consumer
trends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble has such great strengths, and you'd never know
it. Usually you have companies that can't shut up about themselves
and exaggerate what they do, but here you have a company that is so
inhibited.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, this company cut the cord to the washboard by
creating all these products _ Ivory soap, which was invented in the
1920s; Tide, which came out in 1938 _ and they don't really talk
about it. They're such a product-oriented company that they think
the products speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They need to really leverage women. Women don't buy brands, they
join them. Without being aware of it, women have joined P&AMP;G If they
knew more about the company, the club could get bigger. It could be
the biggest female club in the world.
</P>
<P>
   If P&AMP;G did that successfully, the stock price would go up. Women
bond to a brand, and one generation of female consumers can lead
you to the next _ we call that ``brand-me-downs.'' And women would
put all their money into P&AMP;G if they understood what an incredibly
female-supportive company this is.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Thane Pressman, chief executive, Tone Brothers Inc., food
distributor based in Des Moines; former associate advertising
manager, P&AMP;G &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Procter and Gamble is historically very successful at what it
does, and it was always a process-driven organization. It was
hierarchical and highly centralized. My sense is it is trying to
change, and they must to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   The things Jager was trying to do must be done. They've
absolutely got to be faster, more responsive, and accept the
reality of product life cycles. They just keep reinventing
products, like new, improved Tide. And that worked for a while. But
they will have a very challenging future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keven L. Keller, E.B.Osborn Professor of Marketing at Dartmouth
College and author of ``Strategic Brand Management,'' (Prentiss
Hall, 1998). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue I think with their culture now is they're
dealing with a market that has changed so much in the last few
years that they need to have more people now that are tuned in to
that market.
</P>
<P>
   I think the savvy marketers are at high-tech firms. If anything,
there needs to be some reverse flow. There are a number of good
marketers, but there are a lot fewer great marketers. I think that
is an issue when you lose those kinds of people. They're just not
getting that young talent now.(BOX) &QL;

   SENATE UNANIMOUSLY PASSES ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE BILL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted unanimously to approve a bill that catapults
electronic commerce to a new level by allowing consumers and
businesses to sign contracts online and know that their
e-signatures are just as binding as those in ink. The bill has been
passed by the House and now goes to President Clinton, who said
that he would sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   By giving electronic signatures the legal weight of paper
signatures, the law would offer consumers the chance to sign
legally enforceable contracts for health insurance, bank loans and
brokerage accounts over the Internet. But certain legal documents
will still have to be produced on paper. For example, insurance and
utility companies must send cancellation and termination notices
through the mail, wills cannot be executed over the Internet and
products may not be recalled online.
</P>
<P>
   BANK STOCKS SEND DOW DOWN 2.5 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks fell, led by financial issues, as two banks
warned that higher interest rates would reduce profits. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 265.52 points, or 2.5 percent, to
10,449.30. The Nasdaq composite index gained 14.82 points, to
3,860.54, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 14.27
points, or nearly 1 percent, to 1,464.46.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER PROFIT WARNING FROM XEROX
</P>
<P>
   Facing strong competition in its highest-margin product lines,
problems collecting accounts in Mexico and upheaval in its sales
force, Xerox warned that its second-quarter earnings would be as
much as 12 cents below expectations of 42 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT CONFRONTS RIVALS' TACTICS
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft accused its rivals of masterminding an attempt to buy
the trash generated by a Microsoft-backed lobbying organization,
apparently hoping it would yield valuable information about the
company. The accusation came as the Justice Department filed still
another brief in the antitrust case against the company. It
countered a Microsoft brief filed Thursday that was aimed at
undermining the government's effort to send the company's appeal in
the case directly to the Supreme Court.

   NET INCOME CLIMBS 15 PERCENT AT LEHMAN
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sharp slowdown in domestic stock and bond markets,
Lehman Brothers Holdings reported that its profits rose 15 percent,
to $378 million, or $2.78 a diluted share, up from $330 million, or
$2.09 a share.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA UNICOM RAISES $4.9 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the recent popularity of telecommunications
stocks and the enduring appeal of the world's most populous
country, China Unicom, China's second-largest telephone carrier,
raised $4.92 billion in the largest initial public offering in Asia
outside Japan.

   TWA AND AIRTRAN HOLDING TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Trans World Airlines and AirTran Holdings rose on
reports that they were holding merger discussions. But people close
to the talks said that there was little chance of a deal. Shares of
TWA rose 31.25 cents, to $2.875, while AirTran shares jumped 25
cents, to $4.5625. TWA would not confirm that it was in
negotiations.

KAPONO TO STAY AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA will not be siphoning as much talent from
the UCLA men's basketball team as was originally expected. Jason
Kapono, part of a threesome of underclassmen who declared
themselves eligible for the June 28 draft, withdrew his name Friday
as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono, who averaged a team-high 16 points per game as a
freshman last season, was supposed to complete a trio of defectors
along with forwards Jerome Moiso and JaRon Rush. With Wednesday's
deadline to withdraw his name approaching, Kapono sent a letter to
the NBA to be delivered today which outlines his desire to resume
his UCLA career.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso and Rush are still expected to enter the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I would have been a first-round selection in this
draft,'' said Kapono, the Pacific-10 Conference's co-Freshman of
the Year. ``The deciding factor for me was being able to come back
to UCLA, be with my teammates, play for the Bruins and continue my
college experience and education.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to leading the team in scoring, Kapono, 6-foot-7 and
199 pounds, was fourth in rebounding (4.4 per game) and was one of
only two players - with Earl Watson - to start all 33 games for
UCLA last year.
</P>
<P>
   And despite having only one year with the program, Kapono has
already established himself in UCLA's tradition-rich annals by
setting the Bruins' single-season record for 3-pointers with 82.
</P>
<P>
   He broke Tracy Murray's 1992 record (78). Also, Kapono's scoring
average was the second-highest in team history among freshmen,
behind Don MacLean, who averaged 18.6 points per game in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono's change of heart means a change in outlook for the
Bruins in 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inside-outside attack will be that much more effective
because of his ability to make shots from long distance; it will
open up (the interior),'' a relieved UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great example for why it's good that this system is in
place that allows players to explore their options and gather
information but still have the opportunity to come back. He got an
accurate read that he was the best shooter in the draft but also
realized it was in his best interest in the long term to come back
to school.''

   (NYT9) UNDATED -- June 16, 2000 -- MAFIA-DADS-1-B&AMP;W -- Many men
who run huge enterprises and reach the summit of their professions
want their sons to follow in their footsteps. But on this Father's
Day, two sons who tried to follow their fathers' career paths have
instead followed them into prison. One father-and-son pair, Carmine
Persico, the imprisoned leader of the Colombo family serving a life
prison term on charges of murder and racketeering, left, and his
son Alphonse Persico seen in 1986 file photos. Alphonse Persico was
recognized as acting boss by the Colombo gang last year. The young
Persico is serving an 18-month sentence for illegal gun possession.

INDEPENDENT COUNSELS SHOULD PROBE NEW YORK POLICE, PANEL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Civil Rights Commission Friday called on
New York City to create a mechanism for the appointment of
independent counsels to investigate serious accusations of police
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was contained in the panel's final report on
the practices of the city's police force. The report released
Friday is a more refined version of a draft that was circulated in
April. The draft had suggested an independent mechanism was needed
for such investigations, but did not specifically suggest the use
of a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has no power to force the city to adopt its
proposals, and the report left unspecified the details of how to
appoint such investigators, suggesting it would be up to the mayor
and the City Council. Such a process might also require state
legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 6-2 on Friday to adopt the staff report
with dissenting views from Carl Anderson, and Russell Redenbaugh,
who were named to the commission by congressional Republicans in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani swiftly attacked the final report, saying
in a statement that the commission had ``embarrassed itself by
released a politicized report that bears no relation to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not specifically address any of the report's
findings or recommendations, although his administration had
already released a detailed rebuttal to the preliminary findings.
</P>
<P>
   The 248-page final report followed the general outlines of the
draft published in April. The commission endorsed the appointment
of an independent board that would oversee the Police Department's
disciplinary process and documented what the commission said was
extensive racial profiling by police officers, including the Street
Crime Unit, the aggressive plainclothes unit involved in the fatal
shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant, in the Bronx in
1999. That shooting sparked the commission's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended more effort to recruit minorities,
new efforts to improve police-community relations and abolition of
the so-called 48-hour rule, a union contract provision that allows
officers charged with a specific case of abuse to delay by two days
being interviewed by their superiors about it.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking recommendation was the ad hoc appointment
of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of misconduct,
such as a shooting of an unarmed civilian by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the independent counsel should come
from a private law firm, rather than from a federal or state
prosecutor's office. The panel said using an independent counsel
would reassure the public that the allegations would be thoroughly
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not say who should prosecute such cases in court
after the independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the recommendations, the commission report also
detailed what it said was extensive racial profiling by the police
department. Examining nearly 140,000 forms filled out by police
officers after they stopped and questioned or frisked people on the
street in 1998, the commission staff found that African-Americans
were stopped ``far out of their proportion in any of the
communities.'' Hispanic people were also stopped at a relatively
high rate, but less so than black people. And whites and Asians
were stopped at far below their representation of the population,
it concluded.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 51.6 percent of individuals who were stopped and
frisked on Staten Island in 1998 were black and 15.5 percent were
Hispanic. The report noted that the borough's population is only 9
percent black and 8.6 percent Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   In making this assertion, the commission disputed the view of
Giuliani and top police officials that the disparity in the number
of people who were stopped and questioned merely reflected people
who were identified as suspects by crime victims and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   This claim, the report noted, is belied by the admission by
police that police divisions _ including the Street Crimes Unit _
root out crime by making stops when no complaints have been filed
and no victims identified. ``They stop who they think they should
stop,'' said Mary Fraces Berry, chairwoman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But commission member Redenbaugh disagreed that police were
deliberately targeting minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that the racial mix of who you stop ought to
resemble the racial mix of the people in the neighborhood is a
specious use of statistics,'' he said. ``I don't know if there is
racial profiling or not.''

 GRADUATES GET A HIGH-TECH SENDOFF  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They probably won't be eating rats, but you
never know with dorm food.
</P>
<P>
   Coming this fall, 361 high school graduates will let the world
eavesdrop on their daily dramas as they fan out from their Silicon
Valley homes to colleges and jobs all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't another network's response to CBS's reality show
``Survivor,'' and no one's getting voted out of the dorm. It's just
the class of 2000 at Santa Clara, Calif.'s Wilcox High School, who
picked up free Web cameras as they exited the commencement ceremony
held Friday night on the school's football field.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras, which attach to a computer to record images and
sell for $50 each, were donated by Logitech, a Swiss Web cam firm,
and its San Mateo partner SpotLife, a Web site that hosts home
movies made with the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   SpotLife is hoping that the graduates will post their adventures
to its Web site, which currently hosts such riveting material as a
24-hour view of the aquarium of a turtle named Pixel and countless
office workers sitting at their desks.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the graduates to use the equipment, SpotLife and
Logitech are giving out two $10,000 scholarships, two personal
computers and 20 more Web cams to the students who do the best job
depicting their new lives online.
</P>
<P>
   Although the scholarships have created some buzz at Wilcox High,
most students say they want to use the Web cams to keep in touch
with friends and family back home and at other schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my closest friends are going to (the University of
California at) Davis or Berkeley, so I thought I'm hardly going to
see them anymore,'' said Chelsea Nelson, who's heading off to
Brigham Young University in Utah in the fall. ``But with the Web
cam I can send them pictures of me and they can send me pictures of
themselves. Or for their birthdays I could sing happy birthday on
the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the broadband connections now ubiquitous in college
dorms, Web cam movies are still somewhat swimmy and disjointed. But
valedictorian Christopher Hussey pointed out that a visual ``Hi,
Mom'' is a lot more personal than e-mail. Although he's
enthusiastic about trying out his new camera, Hussey's not sure if
he'll be using it in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to the Naval Academy. I wouldn't be surprised if
they take it away,'' Hussey said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox principal Cliff Harris said that although the school,
nestled between the campuses of Intel, Cisco and Sony, has received
plenty of bounty from high tech companies in the form of donated
computers and training, this is the first time anyone's ever
offered free gifts for graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat hesitant at first because of the commercialism
involved,'' Harris said. ``But we looked at the total gift that was
going to be given to the senior class, and decided it was worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, SpotLife wanted to hand out the colorful Web cam
boxes on stage right with the diplomas, but the school moved the
giveaway to the end of the ceremony, as the students left the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he'd received nothing but positive feedback from
parents, many of whom were looking forward to checking in with
their kids on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Hagelshaw of Oakland, Calif.'s Center for
Commercial-Free Public Education, complained that the giveaway was
basically a school-sponsored product promotion, and worried that it
might spark a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this graduation giveaway deal becomes more common, you will
see people upset about it,'' Hagelshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   SpotLife's participation in the ceremony was planned to be
unobtrusive, SpotLife spokeswoman Amy Bohutinsky said, and because
uploading video to the site is free, the gifts come with no strings
attached. But she acknowledged that the event was an marketing
tactic to get ordinary people excited about using Web cams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of possibilities for personal broadcast, but
people haven't explored it yet,'' Bohutinsky said. ``This is the
class of 2000, they're the ones who can think of the new uses for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although SpotLife has had the ability to broadcast real-time
video with sound since the beginning of May, most of its users are
still uploading traditional mute Web cam images, updated every few
seconds or minutes.

 GENENTECH STOCK DOWN 4% AFTER HEART DRUG FAILS TESTS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in Genentech Inc. slipped 4 percent
Friday after the South San Francisco, Calif., firm said an
experimental drug to treat heart disease had failed the second of
three stages of human trials.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech had been testing anti-CD18 to see whether it minimized
the aftereffects of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Most heart attacks are caused by blockages in the blood vessels
that supply the heart. Doctors today can bust these blockages with
drugs that dissolve the fibers that hold clots in place.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Dr. Hal Barron, director of cardiovascular
research at Genentech, 20 to 30 percent of the time, the flow of
blood through the heart remains sluggish even after the clot is
busted, weakening the muscle and the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-CD18 had been intended to solve this aftereffect and
restore normal blood flow. As Barron explained, Genentech had
theorized that the sluggishness in the blood flow is caused when
white blood cells, one of the body's defense mechanisms, congregate
in the locale of the former clot.
</P>
<P>
   Barron said anti-CD18 is an antibody designed to bind to white
blood cells in a way that would prevent them from clumping up and
slowing down the blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   To test this theory, Genentech did a Phase II clinical trial,
involving 415 heart attack patients at 60 hospitals nationwide. All
of the patients got a clot-busting drug. Two-thirds also got either
a high or low dose of anti-CD18.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech had hoped to show that heart attack patients who got
anti-CD18 had better blood flow than the group treated only with
the clot buster. But, said Barron, ``the study did not meet its
primary objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech scientists will now review these preliminary results
to ascertain what went awry. Were they wrong to theorize that
clumps of white blood cells slow blood flow? Or, if the white blood
cell theory is correct, was there something wrong with the way they
designed or administered anti-CD18?
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Genentech fell $5.25 to $132.25 Friday.

   Analysts took the disappointment in stride, saying it was more
important to the company's financial health that Genentech recently

 UNION BANK'S LOAN PROBLEMS SPOOK MARKET  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An earnings warning by San Francisco's Union
Bank of California raised fears of an epidemic of bad loans among
the nation's banks, causing the stocks of lenders to plunge Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The shocker late Thursday from Union, the No. 2 bank
headquartered in the West, came just hours after another major
regional bank, North Carolina's Wachovia Corp., issued a similar
warning. The twin revelations of mounting loan problems spooked
investors, who already had been worrying that rising interest rates
would end the boom times U.S. banks have enjoyed for the last six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Union's parent, UnionBanCal Corp., plummeted $8.75 to
$19.94 yesterday, a 30 percent drop. The stocks of other major
banks, including San Francisco's Wells Fargo and Co. and North
Carolina's Bank of America Corp., were also hit. The
Philadelphia/KBW bank index of major bank stocks fell 10.1 percent
in the two days ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said signs of credit problems at Union and Wachovia
appear to be the tip of an iceberg that extends widely throughout
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   As interest rates creep up, the longest economic expansion in
U.S. history is beginning to show stresses and strains, they noted.
Now, some large corporate borrowers are having trouble repaying
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had easy credit for an extended period,`` said Sutro &AMP; Co.
analyst Campbell Chaney. ``You had loans that should not have been
made or should have been structured more tightly.``
</P>
<P>
   Union said Thursday that it plans to set aside $70 million to
cover bad loans in the current quarter, seven times more than it
reserved in the second quarter of 1999, amid a jump in delinquent
credits.
</P>
<P>
   Union's case suggests the problem might be broad indeed. In a
conference call yesterday, bank officials said they had written
down nine corporate loans this quarter, spread throughout a range
of industries, including retailing, health care, technology and
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials did not identify the borrowers. But one person
close to the bank confirmed that the largest troubled credit,
representing about one-third of the $52 million in loan charge-offs
that Union expects to take this quarter, is Stage Stores, a Houston
clothing store chain that filed for bankruptcy a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Credit problems appear to be concentrated among the giant loans
that banks make by forming syndicates to spread the risk. Federal
bank examiners are in the midst of their annual review of such
shared loans, and the industry is rife with stories of a regulatory
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said they won't talk about their review until they
have completed it in about a month. But government officials have
been speaking out for months against what they say is a rise in
imprudent lending, especially to corporate borrowers that are
already tapped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a bit of risk out there,`` said David Gibbons,
deputy comptroller for credit risk at the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, in an interview.

 Giants Fans Have Great Expectations _ For Profits  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How bad do you want to see the Giants go up
against the Houston Astros, a team with the worst record in Major
League Baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there are some Giants season-ticket holders
who think demand for Sunday's matchup is so intense that they're
offering their seats at a markup of more than $200 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The sky-high ticket prices were posted Friday on the Giants' own
Web site  &LR; (www.sfgiants.com), &LR;  where the team recently introduced
an online trading post for season-ticket holders to unload seats
for games they can't attend.
</P>
<P>
   After just one week of operation, this much is clear: Giants
season-ticket holders have a pretty high opinion of the value of
their seats. The majority of tickets offered are going for more
than $100 over the approximately $30 face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just wrong,'' said Bryan Ferreira, information services
manager for a financial services Web site called MetaMarkets.com
and a season-ticket holder himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are paying that kind of money for tickets, that's
definitely an idiotic thing to do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although just about every Giants game on the horizon is
sold out _ thank the new Pacific Bell Park for that _ there are
plenty of other ways for fans to score last-minute seats, and most
are a whole lot cheaper than what's available at the Giants' online
``Double Play Ticket Window.''
</P>
<P>
   Online auction site eBay, of course, offers bargains galore,
including, as of Friday afternoon, a pair of tickets for Sunday's
game for just $49.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the numerous resellers in the Bay Area that offer
tickets for about a 100 percent markup from the face value, which
is still just a fraction of what some of the season-ticket holders
are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred dollars for a pair of tickets?'' asked Susan
Hubley, co-owner of reseller Infield Advantage, which is one of the
few to offer tickets over the Net. ``That's just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   At her site, a $23 Lower Box seat might go for about $40, while
an $18 Upper Reserve might sell for about $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand isn't that great,'' Hubley said. ``There are some games
where we have to eat tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would compel the owner of Field Club, Section 121, Row
K, Seats 9 and 10 to think that his or her tickets for tomorrow's
game are worth $275 apiece on the open market?
</P>
<P>
   Or why would the holder of Lower Box, Section 102, Row 2, Seats
1 and 2 think that anyone would be willing to cough up $220 each
for the tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Tom McDonald, the Giants' senior vice president of marketing,
was silent for a moment when asked these questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free market,'' he finally replied. ``If people want to
try to get these amounts, they're welcome to.''
</P>
<P>
   He added quickly that he didn't think these high-end sellers
would get the prices they're asking. ``But if our customers want to
speculate, that's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The online Double Play Ticket Window was launched June 9. The
idea is to provide a venue for ``charter'' season-ticket holders _
those who ponied up an average $4,000 extra for lifetime rights to
the seats _ to sell off unwanted tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers can have the proceeds credited to future ticket
purchases or can redeem them for Giants merchandise. Or, if they so
choose, they can request that a check be sent at the end of the
season, with the Giants pocketing any interest earned from
investing the funds in the interval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a service we're providing for the people who committed to
the program early,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   In its first week, he said 1,004 tickets changed hands via the
service. The total value of the transactions was not available.
</P>
<P>
   But fully three-quarters of all tickets posted at the site were
at or near the original face value, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   If so, then a sudden wave of greed overcame season-ticket
holders yesterday because only a precious few seats offered were
for anywhere near the original price.
</P>
<P>
   (Confidential to the owner of Lower Box, Section 115, Row 26,
Seat 7, offering the ticket for Sunday's game for a mere $25.30:
Way to go, dude.)
</P>
<P>
   Extending into July, most seats up for grabs at Double Play are
being offered by their owners for between $100 and $200 over the
face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are posting as high as they can, seeing what
the interest is, and then reposting to sell,'' said Larry Baer, the
Giants' chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, many fans may want to look around before
buying tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all relative,'' said Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for
eBay and longtime Giants fan. ``I guess this is the great thing
about the Internet, that there's so many options available.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, four tourists from Texas
left the galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and began to
make their way through the crowds gathering for the National Puerto
Rican Day Parade along Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   They were petite, middle-aged women, and they said they were
made uncomfortable by the odor of marijuana and alcohol. Clutching
their purses, avoiding eye contact, searching for a quick escape,
they said they headed for an opening between two groups of young
men, perhaps 20 in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they started patting our bottoms,'' said Sharon Brown,
52, a retired school teacher. ``Then they started spitting in their
hands and then rubbing it in our hair. And then the hitting got
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers lined Fifth Avenue, but Brown said that not one
tried to stop the humiliation. Maybe, Brown offered, they did not
see what had happened. But, she added, ``They really didn't appear
to be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Richard Walsh, a 43-year-old businessman, was
running laps around the Central Park reservoir, which is near Fifth
Avenue, when he noticed several young men spraying water on women
and yelling lewd insults at them. On three consecutive laps, Walsh
said, he alerted a nearby contingent of some 40 police officers
taking cover in the shade to what was happening. The officers, he
said, never budged in the 90-degree heat, and the young men
continued to menace women.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the worst of the violence broke out at the fringes
of this year's Puerto Rican Day Parade, the central elements of
trouble were already starting to gel in dangerous and unpredictable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a thundercloud is fueled by moisture and heat, Sunday's
wild, uncontrolled mob attacks on women in Central Park appeared to
be fueled by an ugly alchemy of alcohol, marijuana, oppressive
weather, testosterone idiocy and lapses in police strategy, tactics
and communication.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ embarrassingly displayed to a worldwide audience,
thanks to grainy amateur videos _ was a day of simply awful terror
for 44 women and an ironic black eye for a police force more often
criticized for being overly aggressive. For days now, city
officials have struggled to explain the sight of weeping,
beer-soaked women stumbling out of the park after being robbed,
groped and stripped bare in one of the most well-policed areas of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   As more victims and eyewitness accounts have surfaced, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and other top police officials have rapidly
retreated from early statements that seemed to minimize the
violence and exonerate the Police Department's handling of the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Even as detectives continue to round up suspects _ seven more
were arrested Friday, bringing the total to 13 _ another police
investigation is focusing on how the 4,000 police officers assigned
to the parade were deployed, when officers were sent home, and how
senior commanders communicated with one another about the movements
of more than a million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to critique this very closely to make sure that it
doesn't happen in the future,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Any examination of the department's performance during and after
the parade will have to try to reconcile a certain indisputable
level of enforcement _ the department wrote hundreds of citations
for public drinking, which is illegal _ with a widespread sense
among people at and around the parade that gross misconduct went
virtually ignored.
</P>
<P>
   All week, for instance, city officials have battled direct or
implicit allegations that the police deliberately took a hands-off
approach because of the department's tense relations with minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has strongly disputed this notion, and police officials
have provided statistics showing, if anything, a history of
somewhat tougher enforcement. During this year's St. Patrick's Day
Parade, for example, police confiscated 200 open alcohol
containers, compared with 2,601 confiscations during this year's
Puerto Rican parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're in a period of time in which the police can't
win,'' Giuliani said Friday on his weekly radio program.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said there was no letup this year, and
according to police figures, officers issued hundreds more
summonses for petty crimes and noise complaints than they did at
last year's parade.
</P>
<P>
   There have been ``a lot of complaints fairly recently that the
police have become too strict in quality of life enforcement,'' one
police official said. ``That in my mind is one of the main things
that keeps the control of various types of events, such as parades,
such as New Year's Eve in Times Square. The enforcement is
necessary. That helps to set the tone.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to a growing number of witnesses, police officers
failed again and again on Sunday to provide even the mildest of
responses to scenes of obvious disorder and lawlessness. What's
more, several witnesses have alleged in interviews this week, some
officers failed to react to specific complaints about women being
mistreated and harassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it normal to just turn the city over to those kinds of
people?'' asked Brown of Texas, expressing one common view.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department reported that it made one marijuana arrest
during the parade and confiscated 16 bags of marijuana. But many
witnesses described dozens, if not hundreds, of people openly
smoking marijuana, many of them in plain view of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about second-hand smoke, that's how bad it
was,'' said one 37-year-old jogger, recalling her run through
Central Park.

 BLUELIGHT.COM PUTS KMART ON WEB  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's the ultimate Kmart special: free Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   All year, the giant retailer has blanketed its stores with discs
and flyers touting its BlueLight Net service; it stepped up the
campaign this month, sending greeters to stand under a flashing
blue light at Kmart entrances and hand out software.
</P>
<P>
   The objective: Reach out to ``everyday Americans,'' especially
the 44 percent of the population not yet online, and assemble them
into a ready, willing and able audience of Kmart shoppers on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff will come Saturday, with the launch of Kmart's store
in cyberspace, also called BlueLight, after the beacon Kmart used
in the 1970s to identify an aisle with special sales items.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's No. 2 mass market retailer backing it,
BlueLight has lofty goals and expects to realize them fast. ``If we
can't do $100 million in revenue over the next 12 months, we might
as well all start looking for new jobs,'' said Mark Goldstein,
chief executive of BlueLight, which is run as a stand-alone company
in San Francisco, far from Kmart Corp.'s Troy, Mich., headquarters.
He expects the online store to turn a profit by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart owns 60 percent of BlueLight and is giving the tiny Net
firm access to the resources that come with size: ads in the 72
million newspaper circulars Kmart distributes every week; presence
in its 2 billion direct mail pieces a year; clout in purchasing
from suppliers; and a database of 92 million households and their
buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kmart is definitely shooting to capitalize on all of the
synergies between the stores and the Web site,'' said Ken Cassar,
Internet analyst with Jupiter Communications Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   BlueLight calls its integration with the brick-and-mortar stores
``sticky bricks.'' Customers will be able to return their Internet
purchases to any Kmart store (80 percent of Americans live within
15 minutes of a Kmart); the 2,171 Kmart stores will feature kiosks
where shoppers can call up the Web site to order items that are out
of stock in the store.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the site finishes ramping up this fall, BlueLight
will carry many more items than the average Kmart, which is
constrained by shelf space to about 75,000 products. BlueLight will
offer extra colors, styles and variations of Kmart products and
will have additional higher-ticket merchandise such as big-screen
televisions, digital cameras and above-ground swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Products that overlap with Kmart stores will account for about
one-quarter of BlueLight's inventory. For those products, the
online firm will be able to buy from suppliers at the same prices
as Kmart, which enjoys gross margins in the low 20-percent range.
Goldstein said those margins will allow BlueLight to subsidize
lower prices on other items. BlueLight hopes suppliers will cut it
good deals to impress Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drafting everything Kmart does,'' Goldstein said, using
the bicyclist's term for tailing another rider who acts as a wind
block.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution will be handled at a new warehouse in Memphis,
Tenn., where Federal Express has its hub. BlueLight has invested in
a fulfillment company called SubmitOrder, which will be in charge
of shipping and returns.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kmart, BlueLight is backed by Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia, which bought a 5 percent stake for $13 million; Softbank
Venture Capital, which has invested more than $60 million; and
Yahoo Inc. The Yahoo alliance means that BlueLight ISP users will
see a ``MyYahoo'' page whenever they log on to the Internet; about
a quarter of the page is devoted to a column of links to BlueLight
sales and departments.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy-duty backing doesn't necessarily translate into
success online. In just the past few weeks, online ventures
supported by Disney Co. (Toysmart), Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon unit
(Red Rocket) and Hearst/ Maytag (Brandwise.com, comparison
shopping) have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   And a still bigger question is whether the pricey proposition of
using the free ISP as a Trojan horse to get BlueLight onto
shoppers' PCs will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 2.3 million subscribers have signed up with BlueLight;
1.38 million, or 60 percent, are active users who have logged on in
the past 30 days. BlueLight says its customer acquisition costs are
remarkably low: about $3 to reach each new BlueLight subscriber.
But that excludes the cost of subsidizing their free Net access,
which is about $5 per month per user. That translates into $6.9
million a month right now just to carry people who may never spend
a dime with BlueLight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activity of getting Internet access is a different
behavior than the activity of shopping,'' said Andrew Bartels, an
analyst with the Giga Information Group in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's
not clear to me whether there will be synergy.''
</P>
<P>
   Scale matters: BlueLight's cost per subscriber will go down as
more people sign up. But most PC owners in the United States
already have Internet access. So to grow dramatically, BlueLight
will have to achieve an even more ambitious goal: increase PC
penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart and BlueLight are stepping up to the plate by offering a
very low-cost PC beginning this fall. (Goldstein said they
considered and rejected Internet appliances as too limited in
functionality.) PCs are a new product area for Kmart, which carries
few electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the sweet spot comes, when they attract a person
buying their first computer and get them to sign up for the free
ISP'' _ and then shop on BlueLight, Cassar said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Amazon.com holds the e-tailing crown and is BlueLight's
biggest competitor. But a far bigger one is in the wings. Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., the nation's leading retailer, towers over Kmart with
$165 billion in annual sales versus Kmart's $46 billion; 90 million
shoppers a week versus Kmart's 30 million; and a market
capitalization of $243.6 billion versus $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wal-Mart's ventures online have been surprisingly
feeble. But it has been moving forcefully this year. It has linked
up with powerful venture capital firm Accel Partners, hired a
respected Banana Republic veteran to head the online arm, set up
offices in Silicon Valley instead of Arkansas to attract top-tier
talent, and linked up with powerhouse America Online Inc. to offer
a low-cost Internet service _ expected to be about $10 a month,
half the price of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart executes very well,'' Goldstein said. ``We don't
underestimate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, BlueLight will move into a new building near
Fisherman's Wharf, but for now, its 110 employees are crammed into
a rabbit's warren of offices near Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in touch with the middle America sensibilities of their
target audience, all the BlueLight employees are required to wear
Kmart-purchased outfits every Tuesday. ``A lot of these folks had
never even been to Wal-Mart or Kmart before,'' said Goldstein,
pointing out that most of the twentysomething dot-com workers had
lived only in San Francisco or New York _ ``not cities where you
grab the essence of what America is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Now once a week they sport bright orange jumpsuits from Kmart's
Dickie's work-wear line, full-camouflage hunting gear complete with
caps, dresses with the tags still on to prove the provenance, or
sometimes just regular khakis and blue shirts, all purchased at
Kmart's bargain prices.

 GRADUATES GET A HIGH-TECH SENDOFF  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They probably won't be eating rats, but you
never know with dorm food.
</P>
<P>
   Coming this fall, 361 high school graduates will let the world
eavesdrop on their daily dramas as they fan out from their Silicon
Valley homes to colleges and jobs all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't another network's response to CBS's reality show
``Survivor,'' and no one's getting voted out of the dorm. It's just
the class of 2000 at Santa Clara, Calif.'s Wilcox High School, who
picked up free Web cameras as they exited the commencement ceremony
held Friday night on the school's football field.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras, which attach to a computer to record images and
sell for $50 each, were donated by Logitech, a Swiss Web cam firm,
and its San Mateo partner SpotLife, a Web site that hosts home
movies made with the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   SpotLife is hoping that the graduates will post their adventures
to its Web site, which currently hosts such riveting material as a
24-hour view of the aquarium of a turtle named Pixel and countless

<P>
   To encourage the graduates to use the equipment, SpotLife and
Logitech are giving out two $10,000 scholarships, two personal
computers and 20 more Web cams to the students who do the best job
depicting their new lives online.
</P>
<P>
   Although the scholarships have created some buzz at Wilcox High,
most students say they want to use the Web cams to keep in touch
with friends and family back home and at other schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my closest friends are going to (the University of
California at) Davis or Berkeley, so I thought I'm hardly going to
see them anymore,'' said Chelsea Nelson, who's heading off to
Brigham Young University in Utah in the fall. ``But with the Web
cam I can send them pictures of me and they can send me pictures of
themselves. Or for their birthdays I could sing happy birthday on
the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the broadband connections now ubiquitous in college
dorms, Web cam movies are still somewhat swimmy and disjointed. But
valedictorian Christopher Hussey pointed out that a visual ``Hi,
Mom'' is a lot more personal than e-mail. Although he's
enthusiastic about trying out his new camera, Hussey's not sure if
he'll be using it in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to the Naval Academy. I wouldn't be surprised if
they take it away,'' Hussey said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox principal Cliff Harris said that although the school,
nestled between the campuses of Intel, Cisco and Sony, has received
plenty of bounty from high tech companies in the form of donated
computers and training, this is the first time anyone's ever
offered free gifts for graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat hesitant at first because of the commercialism
involved,'' Harris said. ``But we looked at the total gift that was
going to be given to the senior class, and decided it was worth
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, SpotLife wanted to hand out the colorful Web cam
boxes on stage right with the diplomas, but the school moved the
giveaway to the end of the ceremony, as the students left the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he'd received nothing but positive feedback from
parents, many of whom were looking forward to checking in with
their kids on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Hagelshaw of Oakland, Calif.'s Center for
Commercial-Free Public Education, complained that the giveaway was
basically a school-sponsored product promotion, and worried that it
might spark a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this graduation giveaway deal becomes more common, you will
see people upset about it,'' Hagelshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   SpotLife's participation in the ceremony was planned to be
unobtrusive, SpotLife spokeswoman Amy Bohutinsky said, and because
uploading video to the site is free, the gifts come with no strings
attached. But she acknowledged that the event was an marketing
tactic to get ordinary people excited about using Web cams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of possibilities for personal broadcast, but
people haven't explored it yet,'' Bohutinsky said. ``This is the
class of 2000, they're the ones who can think of the new uses for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although SpotLife has had the ability to broadcast real-time
video with sound since the beginning of May, most of its users are
still uploading traditional mute Web cam images, updated every few
seconds or minutes.

 NEW YORK: Central Park.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a department spokesman, denied
those claims, arguing that it did not make sense for officers to
ignore blatant drug use. ``If I have a parade detail and I walk my
route and smell marijuana, I'd go ballistic,'' he said. ``Why?
Because I know my boss is going to come along soon, and if he
smells something, he's going to ask me what the hell I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Special police teams, each with 24 officers, roved along the
parade route, confiscating open alcohol containers and writing
summonses, but many thousands more teen-agers and young people
clearly drank alcohol with impunity, many people at the parade
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some men circulated in the crowds openly hawking miniature
bottles of rum and vodka. ``There was alcohol all over the street,
bottles of liquor, people offering shots,'' said Nathan Poe, 27, a
Web site developer from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey said that officers sometimes decide, quite properly, that
it is a better use of their time to direct traffic than to go after
someone with an open can of beer. But police officials have
acknowledged in interviews that the department's tactical and
strategic decisions contributed to a set of circumstances that
permitted some of the worst incidents of violence to go forward
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the most serious string of assaults, those
that happened inside the park on Center Drive, just north of the
intersection of Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas,
also known as Sixth Avenue. Roughly half the assaults occurred
there during a frenzy of attacks about 6 p.m., police records show.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have said that 950 officers were deployed
inside Central Park during the parade, 120 more than last year. But
none, they now say, were assigned to cover the stretch of Center
Drive where the assaults took place. The 10 or so amateur videos
that have surfaced thus far seem to support that point: No
uniformed officers can be seen in the crowd on Center Drive, senior
police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, this could be seen as a crucial oversight on the
part of police commanders. But police officials said that they
deployed officers based on their analysis of past trouble spots,
and that analysis, they said, is why the vast majority of the 950
officers were stationed along the eastern edge of the park, by the
parade route itself.
</P>
<P>
   A number of parade veterans, though, have said Central Park
South has for years been the scene of a kind of rowdy overspill.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, at least six people _ including hot-dog vendors,
doormen, store employees, victims _ recalled seeing between 5 and
10 police officers positioned in and around the intersection of
Central Park South and the Avenue of the Americas. And from that
intersection the officers could have had a clear view of the mob
some 30 to 70 yards away on Center Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Here again, though, a vagary in the Police Department's
deployment worked against the victims. Central Park South marks the
dividing line between the Manhattan North zone, which includes
Central Park, and the Manhattan South zone, which covers everything
below the park _ including Central Park South itself.
</P>
<P>
   And according to police officials, as the parade wound down,
senior commanders in Manhattan South began sending their officers
home after a long, hot day on the street. As best as police
officials can determine at this point, it appears that most of the
extra officers at the crucial intersection may have been pulled out
at roughly the time that the mob violence was starting to rapidly
escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a riot going on,'' Fahey said. ``We did what we
always do. The parade was over, we waited an hour, and we let some
of the officers go home. We didn't know about what was going on in
the park off Sixth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, at the moment when things began to spiral out of
control, the area of greatest menace was virtually empty of police
protection.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long, then, for the mix of police bad luck and
emboldened, brutish young men to yield disaster.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, the Avenue of the Americas has been a
popular gathering spot for young people both during and after the
parade _ a kind of parade off the main parade. Young motorcyclists
gun their tires so that great clouds of burning rubber fill the
street, primping teen-agers hang out of car windows, waving flags,
and gang members in do-rags flash hand signals.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 5:15 p.m., still above 90 degrees, when a burly
young man stole a bag of ice from an ice van that had stopped on
the Avenue of Americas just south of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the man, a distinctive figure with a lion's face
tattooed across his bare back and the words Puerto Rico shaved into
the back of his head, began pressing the ice bag against the backs
of young women. Someone punctured the ice bag, and young men began
dropping ice cubes down women's shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Several women laughed and smiled and sassed the young men. But
at least one woman grew angry when men surrounded her and trapped
her against a storefront, dousing her with water, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   There were several police officers in the area, and one, a
supervisor in a white shirt, was seen leading off a young man who
had been involved in the ice cube horseplay. Things quieted for a
bit, but then the group re-formed just inside the park, on Center
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Now self-appointed ``scouts'' began to signal to the larger
group when they spotted women who fit their calculus of sexual
appeal, witnesses said. ``Yo, yo, here comes a good one!'' they
would call out, witnesses said, as unsuspecting women approached.
Several older women got through. For the young and attractive,
nearby fences helped form a natural chute into which they were
steered.

 NEW YORK: were steered.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many said they had no idea what they were entering until it was
too late. Men would close around them from all sides, spraying
water on their heads, their backs, everywhere. The men, when their
water bottles and squirt guns ran dry, simply filled them back up
from a water trough used by the horses that pull carriages through
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Some women said they tried to stay near their friends, but they
were quickly separated by the crowd. So they screamed their
friends' names, to no avail. Some women tried to run, only to be
chased down and surrounded once more.
</P>
<P>
   There was yelling of ``Get 'em, get 'em,'' and chants of ``Go,
go, go,'' and misogynistic curses, witnesses said, and more young
men joined the mob _ men who wore crucifixes. And some of these men
began to tear at shirts, to pull on bras, to tug on shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The women, of course, fought to stay clothed. They clutched torn
shirts to their chests, and they tried to swat sweaty hands away
from their straps and zippers. But they were hopelessly
outnumbered, and several of them suddenly found themselves half
naked in a bleary, swirling crowd of strange men. Even then, the
women tried to hold their arms across their chests, and yet men
pulled at their arms, too. Ashanna Cover, 21, of New Jersey,
recalled that a man squeezed her breast so hard that it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   One young woman, hair matted with beer and water, her top torn
off, huddled against a wall, and still men tried to grope at her.
Some women said they were groped and grabbed and prodded so
violently that their genitals were scratched and bruised. Some
women began to fear that they were going to be gang raped right
there in the shadow of Trump Parc, right there inside the crown
jewel of New York City. Some feared they were about to be trampled.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Abrams, a 42-year-old Web site designer, said she remembered
screams of, ``Yeah! Yeah! Get her!''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Bryant, who was pulled to the ground off her in-line
skates, curled up in a fetal position. She said the men, hooting
and giggling, would yank her shorts down to her thighs, and she
would yank them back up. Over and over this happened, even as she
kicked and thrashed with her skates.
</P>
<P>
   More men were drawn to the mob. Some took pictures. Some took
videos. Police said some robbed the women of cell phones, purses,
jewelry. Some surged closer to get a peek at what they could. Every
now and then, a man would tell another man to cool it, to back off,
but only every now and then, and not a single one among them dialed
911 to summon help.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some men had strangely bored looks on their faces, as
if what they were watching was a tired Jerry Springer rerun,
according to people in the park. It was as if the crowd had turned
a patch of Central Park into an outdoor version of Scores, the
notorious strip club. Only it was worse; there were no bouncers to
protect the women.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, stripped naked, managed to make it to the safety of a
small, three-wheeled police scooter, and still men converged on the
scooter to get a look. Watching from just across the street was
Rita Berlin, 26, manager of the Whiskey Park, an upscale bar at 100
Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin said she had enduring unrelenting harassment as she
pushed through unruly and drunken street crowds late Sunday
afternoon to get to work. Now, as she watched the poor naked woman,
as she wondered why there were not more police officers about, she
felt a deep sense of shame and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' she said later, ``was the worst day I have ever seen
in New York in my entire life _ the trash, the people, the complete
disregard for anything.''

 GENENTECH STOCK DOWN 4% AFTER HEART DRUG FAILS TESTS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in Genentech Inc. slipped 4 percent
Friday after the South San Francisco, Calif., firm said an
experimental drug to treat heart disease had failed the second of
three stages of human trials.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech had been testing anti-CD18 to see whether it minimized
the aftereffects of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Most heart attacks are caused by blockages in the blood vessels
that supply the heart. Doctors today can bust these blockages with
drugs that dissolve the fibers that hold clots in place.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Dr. Hal Barron, director of cardiovascular
research at Genentech, 20 to 30 percent of the time, the flow of
blood through the heart remains sluggish even after the clot is
busted, weakening the muscle and the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-CD18 had been intended to solve this aftereffect and
restore normal blood flow. As Barron explained, Genentech had
theorized that the sluggishness in the blood flow is caused when
white blood cells, one of the body's defense mechanisms, congregate
in the locale of the former clot.
</P>
<P>
   Barron said anti-CD18 is an antibody designed to bind to white
blood cells in a way that would prevent them from clumping up and
slowing down the blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   To test this theory, Genentech did a Phase II clinical trial,
involving 415 heart attack patients at 60 hospitals nationwide. All
of the patients got a clot-busting drug. Two-thirds also got either
a high or low dose of anti-CD18.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech had hoped to show that heart attack patients who got
anti-CD18 had better blood flow than the group treated only with
the clot buster. But, said Barron, ``the study did not meet its
primary objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech scientists will now review these preliminary results
to ascertain what went awry. Were they wrong to theorize that
clumps of white blood cells slow blood flow? Or, if the white blood
cell theory is correct, was there something wrong with the way they
designed or administered anti-CD18?
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Genentech fell $5.25 to $132.25 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts took the disappointment in stride, saying it was more
important to the company's financial health that Genentech recently
won approval to sell a new, faster-acting clot buster, TNK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a modest negative _ you never want a Phase II trial not
to work, but that is the nature of drug development,'' Eric
Schmidt, a biotechnology analyst with SG Cowen Securities, told
Bloomberg News.

HILLARY CLINTON RELEASES ATTACK ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton released her first television
advertisements attacking an opponent by name on Friday, assailing
Rep. Rick Lazio for his opposition to legislation on hate crimes
and health care, as she intensified her effort to sow doubts about
her new opponent among New Yorkers who know little of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know, the more you wonder,'' the announcer says
ominously at the conclusion of each of the two stark 15-second
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually short advertisements, each presented as a ``News
Update,'' are staccato presentations of white type on a black
screen that mimic the clatter of type on old teletype machines.
They describe Lazio's position on two issues as out of step with
political thinking in New York: regulation of health-maintenance
organizations, and legislation that provides additional penalties
for crimes in which victims were chosen because of _ among other
things _ their race, gender or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements provide the latest evidence of the extent to
which Clinton is trying to discredit Lazio, who became her opponent
after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stepped aside for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past month, Lazio, R-Suffolk County, has sought to
present himself as a moderate Republican, to the evident concern of
Clinton's advisers. The television advertisements come at the end
of a week in which Clinton has begun attacking Lazio for his votes
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has now become the first candidate in the Senate race to
use negative television advertisements, an event that several
politicians described as an early watershed in the rapid escalation
of this race. Typically, candidates for office refrain from running
negative advertisements until relatively late in the campaign,
instead using their advertising budgets to present their views and
backgrounds to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said that her campaign had decided to move
now as part of an aggressive attempt to lead voters to form
opinions of Lazio. This is the first in what is likely to be a
series of such advertisements. ``This is going to be a race of
clear contrasts, and voters deserve to know where the candidates
stand on the critical issues,'' said Clinton's campaign manager,
Bill de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, asserted that Clinton in
both advertisements distorted Lazio's record in attempt to
discredit him. He described the ads as ``a desperate act by a
desperate campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``History teaches us that the first victim of a
Clinton campaign is the truth, and that is apparently the case in
this race as well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first of the two advertisements focuses on Lazio's
opposition to a Democratic version of a so-called patients' bill of
rights that, among other things, gives patients the right to sue
health-maintenance organizations for mistreatment. Lazio supported
a Republican bill that instead focuses on giving tax deductions to
help people pay their medical premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The second advertisement focuses on Lazio's initial opposition
to a hate-crimes bill passed by the state Senate in Albany. Lazio's
spokesman, Dan McLagan, said the candidate opposed it because he
believed that additional penalties should not be built into the
statute but should instead be addressed by judges during
sentencing. He said Lazio later decided to support the legislation
because ``something is better than nothing.''

 UNION BANK'S LOAN PROBLEMS SPOOK MARKET  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An earnings warning by San Francisco's Union
Bank of California raised fears of an epidemic of bad loans among
the nation's banks, causing the stocks of lenders to plunge Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The shocker late Thursday from Union, the No. 2 bank
headquartered in the West, came just hours after another major
regional bank, North Carolina's Wachovia Corp., issued a similar
warning. The twin revelations of mounting loan problems spooked
investors, who already had been worrying that rising interest rates
would end the boom times U.S. banks have enjoyed for the last six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Union's parent, UnionBanCal Corp., plummeted $8.75 to
$19.94 yesterday, a 30 percent drop. The stocks of other major
banks, including San Francisco's Wells Fargo and Co. and North
Carolina's Bank of America Corp., were also hit. The
Philadelphia/KBW bank index of major bank stocks fell 10.1 percent
in the two days ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said signs of credit problems at Union and Wachovia
appear to be the tip of an iceberg that extends widely throughout
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   As interest rates creep up, the longest economic expansion in
U.S. history is beginning to show stresses and strains, they noted.
Now, some large corporate borrowers are having trouble repaying
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had easy credit for an extended period,`` said Sutro &AMP; Co.
analyst Campbell Chaney. ``You had loans that should not have been
made or should have been structured more tightly.``
</P>
<P>
   Union said Thursday that it plans to set aside $70 million to
cover bad loans in the current quarter, seven times more than it
reserved in the second quarter of 1999, amid a jump in delinquent
credits.
</P>
<P>
   Union's case suggests the problem might be broad indeed. In a
conference call yesterday, bank officials said they had written
down nine corporate loans this quarter, spread throughout a range
of industries, including retailing, health care, technology and
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials did not identify the borrowers. But one person
close to the bank confirmed that the largest troubled credit,
representing about one-third of the $52 million in loan charge-offs
that Union expects to take this quarter, is Stage Stores, a Houston
clothing store chain that filed for bankruptcy a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Credit problems appear to be concentrated among the giant loans
that banks make by forming syndicates to spread the risk. Federal
bank examiners are in the midst of their annual review of such
shared loans, and the industry is rife with stories of a regulatory
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said they won't talk about their review until they
have completed it in about a month. But government officials have
been speaking out for months against what they say is a rise in
imprudent lending, especially to corporate borrowers that are
already tapped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a bit of risk out there,`` said David Gibbons,
deputy comptroller for credit risk at the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, in an interview.

 Giants Fans Have Great Expectations _ For Profits  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How bad do you want to see the Giants go up
against the Houston Astros, a team with the worst record in Major
League Baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, there are some Giants season-ticket holders
who think demand for Sunday's matchup is so intense that they're
offering their seats at a markup of more than $200 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The sky-high ticket prices were posted Friday on the Giants' own
Web site  &LR; (www.sfgiants.com), &LR;  where the team recently introduced
an online trading post for season-ticket holders to unload seats
for games they can't attend.
</P>
<P>
   After just one week of operation, this much is clear: Giants
season-ticket holders have a pretty high opinion of the value of
their seats. The majority of tickets offered are going for more
than $100 over the approximately $30 face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just wrong,'' said Bryan Ferreira, information services
manager for a financial services Web site called MetaMarkets.com
and a season-ticket holder himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are paying that kind of money for tickets, that's
definitely an idiotic thing to do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although just about every Giants game on the horizon is
sold out _ thank the new Pacific Bell Park for that _ there are
plenty of other ways for fans to score last-minute seats, and most
are a whole lot cheaper than what's available at the Giants' online
``Double Play Ticket Window.''
</P>
<P>
   Online auction site eBay, of course, offers bargains galore,
including, as of Friday afternoon, a pair of tickets for Sunday's
game for just $49.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the numerous resellers in the Bay Area that offer
tickets for about a 100 percent markup from the face value, which
is still just a fraction of what some of the season-ticket holders
are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred dollars for a pair of tickets?'' asked Susan
Hubley, co-owner of reseller Infield Advantage, which is one of the
few to offer tickets over the Net. ``That's just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   At her site, a $23 Lower Box seat might go for about $40, while
an $18 Upper Reserve might sell for about $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand isn't that great,'' Hubley said. ``There are some games
where we have to eat tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   So what would compel the owner of Field Club, Section 121, Row
K, Seats 9 and 10 to think that his or her tickets for tomorrow's
game are worth $275 apiece on the open market?
</P>
<P>
   Or why would the holder of Lower Box, Section 102, Row 2, Seats
1 and 2 think that anyone would be willing to cough up $220 each
for the tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Tom McDonald, the Giants' senior vice president of marketing,
was silent for a moment when asked these questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free market,'' he finally replied. ``If people want to
try to get these amounts, they're welcome to.''
</P>
<P>
   He added quickly that he didn't think these high-end sellers
would get the prices they're asking. ``But if our customers want to
speculate, that's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The online Double Play Ticket Window was launched June 9. The
idea is to provide a venue for ``charter'' season-ticket holders _
those who ponied up an average $4,000 extra for lifetime rights to
the seats _ to sell off unwanted tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers can have the proceeds credited to future ticket
purchases or can redeem them for Giants merchandise. Or, if they so
choose, they can request that a check be sent at the end of the
season, with the Giants pocketing any interest earned from
investing the funds in the interval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a service we're providing for the people who committed to
the program early,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   In its first week, he said 1,004 tickets changed hands via the
service. The total value of the transactions was not available.
</P>
<P>
   But fully three-quarters of all tickets posted at the site were
at or near the original face value, McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   If so, then a sudden wave of greed overcame season-ticket
holders yesterday because only a precious few seats offered were
for anywhere near the original price.
</P>
<P>
   (Confidential to the owner of Lower Box, Section 115, Row 26,
Seat 7, offering the ticket for Sunday's game for a mere $25.30:
Way to go, dude.)
</P>
<P>
   Extending into July, most seats up for grabs at Double Play are
being offered by their owners for between $100 and $200 over the
face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are posting as high as they can, seeing what
the interest is, and then reposting to sell,'' said Larry Baer, the
Giants' chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, many fans may want to look around before
buying tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all relative,'' said Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for
eBay and longtime Giants fan. ``I guess this is the great thing
about the Internet, that there's so many options available.''

 BLUELIGHT.COM PUTS KMART ON WEB  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's the ultimate Kmart special: free Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   All year, the giant retailer has blanketed its stores with discs
and flyers touting its BlueLight Net service; it stepped up the
campaign this month, sending greeters to stand under a flashing
blue light at Kmart entrances and hand out software.
</P>
<P>
   The objective: Reach out to ``everyday Americans,'' especially
the 44 percent of the population not yet online, and assemble them
into a ready, willing and able audience of Kmart shoppers on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff will come Saturday, with the launch of Kmart's store
in cyberspace, also called BlueLight, after the beacon Kmart used
in the 1970s to identify an aisle with special sales items.
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's No. 2 mass market retailer backing it,
BlueLight has lofty goals and expects to realize them fast. ``If we
can't do $100 million in revenue over the next 12 months, we might
as well all start looking for new jobs,'' said Mark Goldstein,
chief executive of BlueLight, which is run as a stand-alone company
in San Francisco, far from Kmart Corp.'s Troy, Mich., headquarters.
He expects the online store to turn a profit by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart owns 60 percent of BlueLight and is giving the tiny Net
firm access to the resources that come with size: ads in the 72
million newspaper circulars Kmart distributes every week; presence
in its 2 billion direct mail pieces a year; clout in purchasing
from suppliers; and a database of 92 million households and their
buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kmart is definitely shooting to capitalize on all of the
synergies between the stores and the Web site,'' said Ken Cassar,
Internet analyst with Jupiter Communications Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   BlueLight calls its integration with the brick-and-mortar stores
``sticky bricks.'' Customers will be able to return their Internet
purchases to any Kmart store (80 percent of Americans live within
15 minutes of a Kmart); the 2,171 Kmart stores will feature kiosks
where shoppers can call up the Web site to order items that are out
of stock in the store.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the site finishes ramping up this fall, BlueLight
will carry many more items than the average Kmart, which is
constrained by shelf space to about 75,000 products. BlueLight will
offer extra colors, styles and variations of Kmart products and
will have additional higher-ticket merchandise such as big-screen
televisions, digital cameras and above-ground swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Products that overlap with Kmart stores will account for about
one-quarter of BlueLight's inventory. For those products, the
online firm will be able to buy from suppliers at the same prices
as Kmart, which enjoys gross margins in the low 20-percent range.
Goldstein said those margins will allow BlueLight to subsidize
lower prices on other items. BlueLight hopes suppliers will cut it
good deals to impress Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drafting everything Kmart does,'' Goldstein said, using
the bicyclist's term for tailing another rider who acts as a wind
block.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution will be handled at a new warehouse in Memphis,
Tenn., where Federal Express has its hub. BlueLight has invested in
a fulfillment company called SubmitOrder, which will be in charge
of shipping and returns.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kmart, BlueLight is backed by Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia, which bought a 5 percent stake for $13 million; Softbank
Venture Capital, which has invested more than $60 million; and
Yahoo Inc. The Yahoo alliance means that BlueLight ISP users will
see a ``MyYahoo'' page whenever they log on to the Internet; about
a quarter of the page is devoted to a column of links to BlueLight
sales and departments.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy-duty backing doesn't necessarily translate into
success online. In just the past few weeks, online ventures
supported by Disney Co. (Toysmart), Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon unit
(Red Rocket) and Hearst/ Maytag (Brandwise.com, comparison
shopping) have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   And a still bigger question is whether the pricey proposition of
using the free ISP as a Trojan horse to get BlueLight onto
shoppers' PCs will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 2.3 million subscribers have signed up with BlueLight;
1.38 million, or 60 percent, are active users who have logged on in
the past 30 days. BlueLight says its customer acquisition costs are
remarkably low: about $3 to reach each new BlueLight subscriber.
But that excludes the cost of subsidizing their free Net access,
which is about $5 per month per user. That translates into $6.9
million a month right now just to carry people who may never spend
a dime with BlueLight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activity of getting Internet access is a different
behavior than the activity of shopping,'' said Andrew Bartels, an
analyst with the Giga Information Group in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's
not clear to me whether there will be synergy.''
</P>
<P>
   Scale matters: BlueLight's cost per subscriber will go down as
more people sign up. But most PC owners in the United States
already have Internet access. So to grow dramatically, BlueLight
will have to achieve an even more ambitious goal: increase PC
penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart and BlueLight are stepping up to the plate by offering a
very low-cost PC beginning this fall. (Goldstein said they
considered and rejected Internet appliances as too limited in
functionality.) PCs are a new product area for Kmart, which carries
few electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the sweet spot comes, when they attract a person
buying their first computer and get them to sign up for the free
ISP'' _ and then shop on BlueLight, Cassar said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Amazon.com holds the e-tailing crown and is BlueLight's
biggest competitor. But a far bigger one is in the wings. Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., the nation's leading retailer, towers over Kmart with
$165 billion in annual sales versus Kmart's $46 billion; 90 million
shoppers a week versus Kmart's 30 million; and a market
capitalization of $243.6 billion versus $3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wal-Mart's ventures online have been surprisingly
feeble. But it has been moving forcefully this year. It has linked
up with powerful venture capital firm Accel Partners, hired a
respected Banana Republic veteran to head the online arm, set up
offices in Silicon Valley instead of Arkansas to attract top-tier
talent, and linked up with powerhouse America Online Inc. to offer
a low-cost Internet service _ expected to be about $10 a month,
half the price of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart executes very well,'' Goldstein said. ``We don't
underestimate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, BlueLight will move into a new building near
Fisherman's Wharf, but for now, its 110 employees are crammed into
a rabbit's warren of offices near Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in touch with the middle America sensibilities of their
target audience, all the BlueLight employees are required to wear
Kmart-purchased outfits every Tuesday. ``A lot of these folks had
never even been to Wal-Mart or Kmart before,'' said Goldstein,
pointing out that most of the twentysomething dot-com workers had
lived only in San Francisco or New York _ ``not cities where you
grab the essence of what America is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Now once a week they sport bright orange jumpsuits from Kmart's
Dickie's work-wear line, full-camouflage hunting gear complete with
caps, dresses with the tags still on to prove the provenance, or
sometimes just regular khakis and blue shirts, all purchased at
Kmart's bargain prices.

TEXAS A&AMP;M BONFIRE SNUFFED UNTIL 2002 &HT;    By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M University's annual Bonfire
will be canceled until 2002 to allow time to plan a safer, simpler
event, university President Ray Bowen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes doing the right thing involves making a very tough
decision,'' he said at a news conference on campus. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Bowen's view, doing the right thing will mean a drastically
scaled-back Bonfire, much smaller than the 55-foot tower that
collapsed Nov. 18, killing 11 students and one former student.
</P>
<P>
   It will also mean a design by licensed engineers, logs cut by
professionals, a two-week time frame to build it and much more
university supervision of a project that for 90 years has been a
student-run affair.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen's decision came slightly more than six weeks after a
sharply worded report criticized Texas A&AMP;M for being lax in
allowing the Bonfire to grow into a towering, dangerous structure
put together by students with no professional help or oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a Bonfire if it's completely restructured,''
Bowen said. But he also tried to make the point more than once that
even ``if we did not have a Bonfire, we would still have the Aggie
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many students and other Aggie supporters were not appeased by
that, however. Some students vowed to hold a ``rebel Bonfire''
off-campus until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   One A&AMP;M staff member who asked not to be identified, groused:
``I could build something out of Popsicle sticks, but that ain't
gonna make it Bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bowen seemed to get widespread support from alumni groups,
state leaders, faculty members and many of the parents whose
children died in the Bonfire collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonfire, which precedes the annual football matchup with
archrival University of Texas, will be replaced this November and
in 2001 with memorial services.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a task force involving students, faculty,
construction experts and others will design a one-tier ``teepee''
structure that should take far less time to build and won't
endanger lives, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bonfire is relit in 2002 on the same polo field where
the stack fell last fall, it will be professionally engineered.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen announced his anguished decision after months of
consultation with experts, students, ``Aggie Moms'' and others. He
said everyone agreed that the tradition should be continued only if
the participants' safety could be insured.
</P>
<P>
   ``That horrible event took from us 12 fine young people and
injured 27 other young people and inflicted really unspeakable pain
on their families and the ones that were injured,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we think about the Bonfire in the future, understand that
we do this with this one thought in mind: We had this horror visit
our campus,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that unsafe construction practices and faulty design
features don't creep back into the process, the university will
require annual certification by professional advisers. If the
construction in 2002, is ``judged successful by the certification
process, then we will have a 2003 construction,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   The event will remain a student-run, university-sanctioned
``Aggie spirit'' activity.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be the project that in the past has been tackled
at a feverish, adrenaline-pitched pace with some students spending
much of a semester in planning, cutting and building a log tower so
large that it would burn for days.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bonfire will depend on donated logs that are
professionally cut and the ritual is likely to become more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how much yet, but it will definitely cost
more,'' said the president. ``Presumably, the design, the safety
plan, the construction plan would be principally a one-time
investment with improvements over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The university president's decision, which came as a
disappointment to students who will graduate before November 2002,
was supported by the A&AMP;M chancellor and regents, the Faculty
Senate, Association of Former Students and most of the families
affected by the 1999 accident.
</P>
<P>
   Porter Garner, director of the alumni group representing 200,000
former students worldwide, said: ``Our membership is going to be
extremely pleased that Bonfire will eventually continue. The
pre-eminent concern from every former student we've heard from is
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Faculty Senate speaker Bob Strawser said shortening the Bonfire
preparation time from several months to about two weeks ``is going
to make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The elimination of the `cut' (tree-cutting) is a very positive
step. There were many injuries there. That will also significantly
reduce the time that students might be involved in Bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the students will accept it,'' he added. ``They really
don't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowen said he was inclined to permanently cancel the
Bonfire ``the moment it fell,'' he said he was convinced it could
be restructured safely in part by the report of a special
investigative commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the May 2 report, the commission expressed doubt that
students could be equipped with adequate knowledge and skills, but
Bowen said his decision challenges students to ``protect this
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Regents Chairman Donald E. Powell said: ``I think, at the end of
the day, everyone will support his decision, as painful as it may
be to some.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bowen made a ``hard decision'' after ``an extraordinary
amount of listening to the commission, faculty, students and all
others who have an interest in the university. Foremost in his mind
was that something like this will never happen again because of
some decision he had made.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen's announcement also drew the endorsement of Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Lexington, Ky., Bush said the decision
represented ``a very cautious approach, and I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's highest-ranking Aggie in politics, Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry, likewise was supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing all along has been guaranteeing the
safety of students,'' Perry said.

5 NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS FACE DISCIPLINE AFTER PARADE MAYHEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-PARK-CRIME)  
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Friday that as
many as five officers would probably be disciplined for failing to
respond properly to people who complained about a group of men
attacking women in and around Central Park on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Safir also announced seven more arrests in the attacks, which
occurred after the National Puerto Rican Day parade, bringing to 15
the total number of young men arrested after the frenzy of sexual
assaults, including seven who turned themselves in after seeing
their pictures broadcast on television or published in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives have also identified 15 more suspects being sought in
the attacks, in which men poured ice and water on dozens of women,
tore at their clothes and groped their breasts and buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   As detectives continued to hunt for the attackers, investigators
from the department's Internal Affairs Bureau pursued their own
inquiry, looking into complaints that some officers failed to
respond properly to people who notified them of the roving bands of
men. By late Friday, department investigators had questioned more
than 100 officers, mostly supervisors, a senior investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without prejudging, my sense is that we will probably find
four or five police officers who acted inappropriately, while the
vast majority acted appropriately,'' Safir said. ``Those who acted
inappropriately will be subject to discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior investigator said that the Internal Affairs Bureau
had identified three or four officers who they said they believed
had acted improperly, and said they were close to identifying one
or two others. The official said it was possible that one or more
of the officers would face dismissal, but called that possibility
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   One of the police officers who has become a focus of the inquiry
was assigned to a traffic detail and was seen on a videotape on
which a man who is not visible is upbraiding him for failing to
take some action, a senior police official said. But the
investigation has not yet determined whether the officer had failed
to take any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is identification,'' the official said.
``We have to be clear who was where.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior investigator pointed out that if the Internal Affairs
Bureau determines that an officer behaved improperly, the
department would bring administrative charges against the officer,
who would then be tried before an administrative law judge. The
judge's recommendation would be given to the police commissioner,
who makes the final decision on departmental discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said that of the seven victims who reported their assaults
to police immediately after the incident, two complained about the
officers and five praised their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The seven suspects arrested Friday were Julio Delacruz, 22, of
7717 Bergenline Ave. in North Bergen, N.J.; Isaiah Forbes, 18, of
119 Beach 56th St., Queens; Mark Daniels, 21, of 67 Harrison Place
in Irvington, N.J.; Anthony Bryant, 25, of 312 Delancey St. in
Manhattan; Leslie Marcano, 19, of 995 Simpson St. in the Bronx;
Soto Jensen, 16, of 99 Varet St., Brooklyn; and Trevor Britton, 29,
of 1401 East New York Ave., Brooklyn. The police said all would be
charged with first-degree sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I can tell you is there is no pattern here as far as
groups of people who are associated with each other,'' Safir said.
``This appears to be something that happened relatively
spontaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir also urged the other men involved in the attacks to turn
themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   He also thanked the public for its cooperation, saying the
department's release of photographs of the suspects, lifted from 10
amateur videotape recordings, prompted scores of calls to the
city's Crime Stoppers phone line. One tip came from as far away as
Italy, where someone who had been in New York on Sunday sent an
e-mail to the police with what Safir said was helpful information.
</P>
<P>
   The new suspects whose photographs were released Friday had all
been identified by one or more of the 47 victims who the police
said had been molested, and in some cases, assaulted or robbed.  &QL;

 &HT;    Wallace takes fifth pole; win would be nicer
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ When drivers and team owners talk about parity
on the Winston Cup circuit this year, they are definitely not
referring to qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Time trials have been a one-man show, with Rusty Wallace
capturing his fifth pole of the season at Pocono Raceway Friday.
Only one other driver, Dale Jarrett, has won two poles through 14
events.
</P>
<P>
   However, starting the race in first and finishing it there are
different things. Wallace has been able to transform all the No. 1
starts into only one victory (Bristol).
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing the deal, that what's been missing . . . probably the
only that's missing from our season so far,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a stronger team this year than we've had in
years. The engine program is second to none. (Crew chief) Robin
Pemberton and the guys have built probably the best race cars I've
ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to start closing the deal. Winning poles and
leading laps has got to lead to more checkered flags.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Penske-Kranefuss team is enjoying a banner
year. Not only has the No. 2 Ford owned qualifying, it has
dominated the circuit in laps led with 764 _ more than twice as
many as runner-up Dale Earnhardt Jr. (364).
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is also sixth in the Winston Cup points standings, 13
away from cracking the top five. But failing to take advantage of
pole positions is bothering the veteran driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew how to close a race the right way, I would have done
it,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockingham was Wallace's first pole; pit problems caused a
12th-place finish. At Martinsville he led 343 of 500 laps, but was
devastated by a blown tire and questionable pit strategy. At
Richmond, Wallace led the most laps again and finished fifth. He
blew his chances of winning at Dover when he got a stop-and-penalty
for an illegal pass during a restart.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wallace has failed to capitalize on the majority of his
pole positions, he's not apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's always important to start up front,'' Wallace
said. ``Everybody is trying to do all they can for their sponsors,
so it's important when people turn on the TV on Sunday and see the
No. 2 car up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they are going to be able to talking about (my car) a lot
(at the beginning of the race). After the third lap, they might not
_ but I plan on talking about it all day.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary General Kofi Annan Friday certified
Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, opening the way to a
more robust U.N. peacekeeping presence along Lebanon's
often-troubled border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the long road toward peace in the
region, but I hope it will be seen as the beginning of the end,''
said Annan, who promptly departed on a weeklong trip to a
half-dozen countries in the Middle East to discuss ways for the
United Nations to build on the achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The certification was challenged a few hours later when
Lebanon's prime minister, Salim Hoss, contended in Beirut that
Israeli troops still controlled some parts of the border area. He
did not identify the areas or their size, or threaten to withhold
cooperation with the U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general's confirmation of the Israeli pullout to
the Security Council is significant because it credits Israel with
fulfilling an essential condition of Resolution 425, which the
Council passed in 1978. The resolution demanded that Israeli troops
pull out of the territory they had just occupied in southern
Lebanon to create a security buffer zone and now, Annan says,
Israel has done just that.
</P>
<P>
   With that accomplished, the 22-year-old resolution authorizes
U.N. peacekeepers to be deployed across southern Lebanon to help
the Lebanese government restore peace and security in the area and
reassert its lost authority.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the United Nations appeared to be embarking on yet
another peacekeeping operation at a time when its financial and
troop resources are already thinly stretched. As of this month, the
United Nations had 35,469 military personnel and police officers
deployed in 14 peacekeeping operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike another operation being planned for Congo, the
mission in southern Lebanon offers unusually high prospects for
success at comparatively modest physical risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a happy day for Lebanon, but also for Israel,'' Annan
said. ``And it is a day of pride for the United Nations. It shows
that U.N. resolutions, when fully implemented by all parties
working together, can be the building blocks of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoss said in a statement released in Beirut: ``There are
still several Israeli military outposts inside the Lebanese border.
And there are several tracts of Lebanese territory under Israeli
control in a flagrant act of encroachment.'' He did not specify
where the tracts were.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Lebanon's president, Emile Lahoud, warned that
his country might not recognize the U.N. findings if they were
``confined to a fictitious nonexisting line that does not reach the
existing internationally recognized frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general and other officials have repeatedly
stressed that the United Nations is not demarcating the border
between Lebanon and Israel but merely confirming the line to which
the Israelis have withdrawn. This has meant verifying Israel's
pull-back across a frontier imperfectly defined in 1923, with
subsequent small adjustments, according to contemporary maps.
</P>
<P>
   After Annan telephoned Lahoud Friday to allay his concerns, the
announcement went ahead. But the mixed signals seem unlikely to be
clarified before Annan visits Beirut in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   During the inspection of the border, Lebanese officials have
repeatedly expressed reservations, and then supported the U.N.
effort. Some diplomats here suggested that the complaints of Hoss
and Lahoud were in good part for domestic consumption, to assure
the Lebanese people that their government will not cede any border
territory.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat here said that Lebanon was worried that the
Israelis might try to turn the line of withdrawal identified by the
United Nations into their international border, causing the
Lebanese to forfeit some land.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, called
by its acronym UNIFIL, was largely limited to looking on _ and
ducking _ while Islamic guerrillas in southern Lebanon fired
artillery and rockets into northern Israel and the Israelis
retaliated with airstrikes and cross-border raids. The peacekeepers
can now occupy fixed positions and conduct mobile patrols along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Annan confirmed that the peacekeepers' main task now would be to
help the Lebanese government and its armed forces assume their
responsibilities along the border and throughout the area that
Israel has vacated.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general's special representative in the region,
Terje Roed-Larsen, said that the peacekeeping mission would be
expanded to 5,600 troops, from the 4,400 now stationed in southern
Lebanon, in the first two weeks of July.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen, who was entrusted with handling the complex and
politically sensitive verification process, said that the Lebanese
government has already deployed 1,000 soldiers and internal
security troops in the border area.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement, the secretary general said he hoped that
the international community would help Lebanon rebuild its economy
in the south and re-establish ties to the rest of the country.
``This will help move the whole country closer to peace and
stability,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed hope that the successful implementation of the
Council's resolution on Lebanon would encourage others in the
Middle East, ``especially Syrians, Palestinians and Israelis, as
well as Lebanese,'' to move faster in negotiating other peace
treaties based on two earlier Council resolutions, which also
called for Israel's complete withdrawal from occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal from southern Lebanon got under way after
Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, set a self-imposed deadline of
July 7 for Israeli troops to leave. When the Israelis started
pulling out last month ahead of schedule, their allies, the
surrogate Southern Lebanese Army, collapsed, abandoning heavy
weapons and fortifications to the guerrillas and forcing the
Israelis to accelerate their departure.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS WARN PARENTS TO BE VIGILANT ON INTERNET &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE, Wis. _ ``User beware,'' the nation's Roman Catholic
bishops warned parents Friday, adopting a statement on the Internet
acknowledging its benefits but urging consumers use it judiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you find it on the Web doesn't mean it's true,
and just because a site uses `Catholic' in its name doesn't mean it
reflects the teaching and practice of the Catholic faith,'' says
the prelates' 2,500-word statement, ``Your Family and Cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopted with no discussion in a voice vote, the statement
responds to concerns about obscene and ``hate-filled'' material in
cyberspace. Offering everything from stock prices to travel
information, the Internet is becoming ``an invaluable educational
tool'' as government assistance enables more schools to go online,
the statement says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this technology comes at a different kind of
price,'' it says, noting some people feel ``the apparent
anonymity'' of the Internet ``relieves them of responsibility for
their actions.'' Some of the highest traffic is to pornography
sites or to sites purveying hatred, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet use, then, can be a little like visiting the best
theme park in the world and coming across a toxic waste dump,'' the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
   It recommends parents apply the same rules to Internet use as in
the real world, discouraging their children from talking to
strangers and being as safety conscious when children go online as
when they are not at home.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations include using an Internet service provider
that filters access to objectionable sites, spending time on the
Internet with children and guiding them in responsible use of
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Texas bishops applauded the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the technology must come attention to moral, personal and
character values,'' said Bishop James A. Tamayo, auxiliary bishop
of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Curtis Guillory, bishop designate for the Diocese of
Beaumont, said the statement calls on Catholics to evaluate what
they find on the Internet. ``It helps Catholics to view or approach
the media out of their faith experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing principles of good taste, tolerance and civility to
bear on U.S. media _ whether Catholic or secular _ was uppermost in
the bishops' minds during their spring session. In addition to the
statement on the Internet, the prelates adopted three other
statements related to media.
</P>
<P>
   One on protocol for Catholic media stresses that newspapers,
radio, television, Web sites and other media that want to be
considered ``Catholic'' in content should obtain clearance from
diocesan bishops. But compliance with the standard is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Another on civility in media urges journalists avoid allowing
coverage of policy disagreements to degenerate into personal
attacks. It encourages them to respect the ``worth and dignity of
every person,'' check facts, report accurately and not presume to
know a person or institution's motive without evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search for the truth, report the truth, and respect the human
dignity of those about whom you report,'' the statement says,
``whether you find them worthy of praise or blame.''
</P>
<P>
   A third, titled ``Renewing the Mind of the Media,'' asks the 60
million U.S. Catholics to pledge support to encouraging morally
worthy media content and discourage that which is immoral or
demeans dignity.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage a ``more responsible, moral and ethical media,''
individual Catholics are asked to pledge they will take one of 10
actions including: talk with family about responsible media use,
contact a media outlet with praise or complaints, trade one hour a
week using media for an hour in prayer and skip a few movies or
rental videos and use the money saved to help someone in need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep reminding our people that we cannot let the
pervasive culture of the entertainment media make us feel that
being a religious person is somehow unnatural or unAmerican,'' said
Bishop Joseph Fiorenza, leader of the Diocese of Galveston-Houston
and president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.

 &HT;    Camp gives kids summertime blues
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ The neck of his Fender Jazz Bass seems almost
too long for Jason Turner. With his left hand, the 13-year-old
squeezes down a chord for a blues number. He stretches his arm out
as if he were dancing with a partner twice his diminutive size.
</P>
<P>
   Turner may not have reach but he does have rhythm. During a
class on improvisation, he is rhythm. Along with nearly 100 other
summer campers, Turner is learning how to swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I jam by myself,'' said Turner, who lives in
suburban Birmingham and has been playing bass for almost a year.
``I have a drum set in my basement. Sometimes my friend comes over
and we'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   That's music to the ears of Earlie Billups, director of the
11th-annual City Stages Jazz Camp. The professional musicians he
corralled to train aspiring jazz artists are preparing students for
a performance today (12:30 p.m. Atlanta time) at City Stages, a
downtown music festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the future of jazz staying alive,'' said Billups a
professional musician. ``And when I say jazz, I mean real jazz, not
modern jazz, not light jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   This is your grandmother's jazz, Billups said. Dixieland. Blues.
These are the smoking riffs built in the Deep South in the early
1900s. It's the stuff of Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, Miles
Davis, Ella Fitzgerald. It's not Kenny G.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get my drift,'' Billups said.
</P>
<P>
   Bright lights rain down on the jazz beginners sitting in a
theater, where the curtains and chairs are pitch black in a theater
at the Alabama School of Fine Arts. Five sax players sit up front.
Trumpets are in back, guitars and piano on the side, drums in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-grader Andrew Watkins taps the pedal of the bass drum
with his right foot, which is covered by a dirty Asics sneaker. The
stick in his right hand strikes a cymbal, delivering a tin sound.
The stick in his left hand raps the silver rim of a Mapex snare
drum.
</P>
<P>
   They're learning to jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, let's noodle a little bit,'' commands instructor
Willie Thomas, a veteran trumpeter.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble runs through a scale, improvising on a blues
arrangement called ``Bossa for Valerie.'' Find the form, find the
scale, find the rhythm, Thomas tells them. ``It's like having a
computer and finding the password,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Improvisation is something new to the campers. Some are still
learning to read music. So just making it up can be intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said 14-year-old drummer Kristen Suberre,
``because you don't know what you're going to end up playing or if
it's going to sound good.''
</P>
<P>
   In a beginning saxophone class, students stand back to back. One
plays a reedy tone, the other tries to match it. The exercise
develops their musical ear _ a critical sense in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out with a chick, you can stand back to back and
start a relationship,'' said instructor Ralph Lalama, who plays
tenor sax with the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band in New York. ``What's
music? You don't see it. You hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalama's students work on ``Take the A Train.'' The tenors carry
their parts. The altos struggle. There's a semblance of the tune
there, the same way a chalk outline resembles a dead body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're rushing it. You're rushing it,'' Lalama tells his class
of six. ``That whole note, move off that.'' Lalama starts singing
the instrumental: Bop-dee-bop-bop-bee-aaaaaaaa-baaaaaaaaaa.
</P>
<P>
   In a drum class, instructor Newman Taylor Baker works with his
students on a Caribbean island rhythm. Student Chris Rodgers, 17,
is playing too fast, as if he were in New York. ``This is an island
beat,'' Baker says. ``They take their time.''
</P>
<P>
   They work on the beat. Rodgers' snare drum snap is a fraction
off from striking at the same time as the bass drum. He tries
again. Baker closes his eyes and shakes to the groove.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a kid, Baker would play Tchaikovsky as much as he
would jam to the recordings of jazz legends Max Roach and Charlie
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this age, the kids just don't know about jazz, so they're
open,'' Baker said. ``I don't know that they see anything when they
get here, but hopefully they find something when they leave.''

   JACKSON, Miss. _ The legend was that if you touched Robert
Johnson you could feel the talent running through him, like heat,
put there by the devil on a dark delta crossroad in exchange for
his soul. It is why Claud Johnson's grandparents would not let him
out of the house that day in 1937 when Robert Johnson, his father,
strolled into the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, the famous, almost mythical blues man, had come
to Lincoln County, Miss., to see Virgie Jane Smith, a young woman
he had been intimate with, and a son he had never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were living in my granddaddy and grandmama's house,'' Claud
Johnson said, thinking back. ``They were religious people, and they
thought that the blues was the devil's music. People back then
believed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told my daddy they didn't want no part of him. They said
he was working for the devil, and they wouldn't even let me go out
and touch him,'' Johnson said. ``I stood in the door, and he stood
on the ground, and that is as close as I ever got to him. Finally,
he said, `Well, I might as well go on.' He wandered off, and I
never saw him again.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to believe that Robert Johnson came for him that day,
and he has always wondered what would have happened if he had run
across that porch to him, so that everyone would know he was Robert
Johnson's son.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 63 years later, the Mississippi Supreme Court has ruled
that Johnson, a retired gravel truck driver who lives quietly in
Crystal Springs, Miss., truly is the flesh-and-blood of a man so
mythologized that many people do not know where the legend ends and
the truth begins.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after years of legal battles between Johnson and
other, more distant relatives, the state Supreme Court ruled that
Johnson was the son and sole heir of one of the most influential
musicians of the 20th century, and that he could rightfully receive
more than $1 million dollars in music royalties amassed in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I have known that he was my father,'' said
Johnson, whose mother had a romantic fling with Robert Johnson in
1931, resulting in his birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was a famous man, but he didn't live to see his
fame,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would never forget the sight of Robert Johnson, still
a young man at 26 or 27, ``clean-cut,'' and sharply dressed as he
walked into the yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was fortunate,'' Claud Johnson said. ``At least I got to
see him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, and in the broader world of music, Robert
Johnson's name evokes rich, dark and mysterious images of the delta
that gave birth to his music.
</P>
<P>
   Every guitar picker knows the story of how Robert Johnson, just
a raggedy farm worker who wanted badly to play the blues on his old
guitar, sold his soul to Satan at that dark crossroads in
Mississippi, how the devil put fire in his fingers and brimstone in
his throat, fusing him with talent and promising him fame.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone, at least most folks in Mississippi, knows that the
devil is a liar. Some people here blame the devil for Robert
Johnson's demise, saying he tricked him and gave him just enough
fame to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who wrote such blues standards as ``Rambling on My
Mind,'' ``Crossroads Blues'' and ``Me and the Devil Blues,''
produced 41 records, and his haunting, plaintive vocals and guitar
work influenced countless blues and rock 'n' roll musicians. But he
died penniless at age 27 in 1938 in Greenwood. He left no will
because he had nothing to pass on except his music, which few
people seemed interested in at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Guralnik, the author of ``Searching for Robert Johnson,''
(Dutton Books, 1989), said that some have called Johnson the father
of blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so remarkable is not that he struck such an original
chord, but what was new was the way each song was focused in a way
a lot of blues songs aren't,'' Guralnik said.
</P>
<P>
   He was so unappreciated at the time of his death that no one is
even sure where Johnson is buried.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Mike Mills said in his ruling
that it was impossible to get DNA evidence from a body that does
not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, Johnson is buried `down by the highwayside,
so his old evil spirit can get a Greyhound bus and ride,''' the
justice wrote in the ruling, quoting one of Johnson's songs, ``Me
and the Devil Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a body forced Claud Johnson's lawyers to turn to
other means to prove his connection to his father, including, as it
turned out, an eyewitness to his conception.
</P>
<P>
   Claud Johnson's mother, the late Virgie Jane Smith Cain, swore
in a 1992 deposition that Robert Johnson had fathered her child.
</P>
<P>
   That might not have carried much weight in court, but Cain's
testimony had collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   A childhood friend, Eula Mae Williams, testified in a 1998 trial
that she watched Robert Johnson and her friend have sex in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Claud was born nine months later.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson grew up hearing his mother say that he was the son of
the famous blues man, and that made him proud, though he said he
never thought that his father's legend, ``would amount to anything
in money.''
</P>
<P>
   When his mother married a man named Marshall Cain, she insisted
that he take Cain as his last name. But as soon as he was grown, he
legally changed his name to Johnson. ``I got it on my first Social
Security card,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his lawyers, Jeffrey Ellis of Crystal Springs, said that
no one could say that Claud Johnson started claiming his kinship
only after Robert Johnson's recordings became valuable in the
1980s. ``Mr. Claud had been claiming this all his life,'' Ellis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other relatives questioned the validity of his blood ties to
Johnson. Annye C. Anderson, of Amherst, Mass., and Robert M.
Harris, of Annapolis, Md., are the half-sister and grandson of
Carrie Harris Thompson, who was Robert Johnson's half-sister.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson died in 1983 and left the rights to Robert Johnson's
music to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Johnson filed suit in Mississippi seeking to
have himself declared the legal heir and the one entitled to $1.2
million in royalties from the blues artist's recordings.
</P>
<P>
   A trial court ruled in favor of Johnson in 1998, but that ruling
was appealed, leading to the decision on Thursday by the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   James Craig, the lawyer representing the other relatives, said
Friday that he was considering filing a motion for the court to
reconsider the ruling. But he said he did not expect extensive
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also disputed the evidence presented to show Johnson's
parentage. Johnson's birth certificate lists Robert Johnson as the
father, Craig said, but Johnson himself never signed the
certificate. Under Mississippi law, birth certificates for children
born out of wedlock must have the father's signature to be valid
proof of paternity, he said.

`LIEBESLIEDER WALTZER': CITY'S INTIMATE BALANCHINE BALLET SHINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some ballets can be faked. ``Liebeslieder Walzer'' is
not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Without first-rate performers, the ballet is like too much
chocolate cake. But the New York City Ballet presented a shining
performance of this problematic ballet on Thursday night at the New
York State Theater, with finely meshed dancers alert to every
nuance.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part ballet, choreographed in 1960 to music for piano
and voice, does not illustrate its songs about the agonies of love,
delicious and otherwise. Instead, particularly in the first
section, Balanchine suggests the manners of lovers both gallant and
impetuous, experienced and innocent, in a pell-mell suite of
waltzes for four couples confined to an elegant, intimate drawing
room.
</P>
<P>
   The glass doors have blown open in the second section, and the
lovers, the women now in less formal costumes, dart through as if
blown by the wind. Balanchine said that real people populated the
first act. In the second, their souls danced.
</P>
<P>
   An elegiac Kyra Nichols and Jock Soto were one of two central
pairs of lovers. Wendy Whelan and Nilas Martins were the second,
more unruly pair. All that they are is expressed in small details,
like a slight bow of the head or curve of the arm or repeated
pullings away. There is a hint of approaching death when Soto
carries Nichols' body stretched parallel to the floor. But then,
this is choreography filled with subtle, unexpected bits of odd
partnering and staging that prefigure Balanchine's later anarchic
choreographic urges.
</P>
<P>
   Youth laps at the two couples, personified by a mysterious Maria
Kowroski, partnered by an elegantly restrained Philip Neal, and a
lush Jenifer Ringer, new in the role, who danced with an
extra-gallant Damian Woetzel. But all of this comes from the
movement alone. There is no story here.
</P>
<P>
   The score was eloquently performed by the singers Elissa
Johnston, Teri Medley, William Hite and Mark W. Uhlemann and the
pianists Richard Moredock and Susan Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolaj Huebbe and Yvonne Borree, in a role debut, came close to
faking Balanchine's ``Donizetti Variations'' in bold,
larger-than-life dancing that was enjoyable at first but a little
wearing toward the end. Hugo Fiorato conducted.

   Dear Dr. Bombay: I am interested in pursuing MCSE certification.
How do you see the potential breakup of Microsoft affecting the
value of this certification? _ Needs New Career
</P>
<P>
   Dear New Career: You know, I wish everybody would stop running
around like Windows is going to disappear just because some goofy
judge thinks he's more powerful than Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I have some news for you, Judge Doofus: Even if the split
actually happens, all you've managed to do is morph Microsoft from
THE most influential software company in the world into the TWO
most influential software companies in the world. Way to go, pal.
I'm sure that will look good on the ol' resume.

<P>
   Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer training is just about the
most valuable education you can get if you intend to be a
Poindexter. You can spend as much as $7,500 for an intensive course
with guaranteed results, or you can go the cheap route by buying
the study materials and teaching yourself. The bottom line is that
once you pass that test, you shouldn't have any trouble getting a
good job. Well, unless you're a total loser, that is.

   Dear Dr. Bombay: I can't help but suspect that all of these

often do you hear about a virus that targets the Mac? It's as if
the idiots who write the viruses are just trying to discredit all
non-Macintosh equipment. _ Suspicious
</P>
<P>
   Dear Susp: No, these nematodes aren't that smart. A plot like
that would require Machiavellian cunning and insight. All a virus
writer wants to do is to drop a cockroach in our collective punch
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If I were going to write a virus, I'd target Windows PCs not
because I know where all the little security holes are, but because
I'd be striking about 90 percent of the world's computers. I'd get
more press, I'd be cooler, and all the women would yearn for me
tragically. I hit Macintoshes, and who cares? There just aren't
enough of them to make an attack that newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Macintoshes are susceptible to many of the same kinds of viruses
that bedevil PC users: Trojan horses, macro viruses, file-killers
and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   If somebody really wanted, he or she could write a virus that
would attack any specific platform, and the more popular a platform
it is, the bigger a target it is. Just a few weeks ago, some zero
released a virus that attacked a Spanish cellphone network. It not
only clogged up the network's computers the way the Love Bug did,
but it also sent derogatory e-mail to users' phones. What's next?
Palm Pilots? Gameboys? Furbys?

PRESIDENT JOINS EFFORT FOR MUSIC IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A little help from his best friend helped Ishmael
Acevedo slip into the auditorium of his East Harlem school Friday,
one of two New York City schools that President Clinton visited to
express his support for music education and to lobby for billions
of dollars in school construction bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Ishmael, 10, had brought in a yellow slip signed by his parents
that would allow him to participate in the presidential visit. But
as he earnestly explained, ``I ain't have the right tie.''
</P>
<P>
   His best friend, on the other hand, had forgotten the permission
slip but had worn the regulation maroon plaid tie that is part of
the Public School 96 uniform, and he generously gave it to Ishmael.
</P>
<P>
   So while his friend was sequestered with 250 others in the
lunchroom, Ishmael was among four or five dozen lucky students in
the auditorium, sitting just a few rows away as Clinton reminisced
about three of his childhood music teachers and stood by as a music
foundation promised $5 million worth of musical instruments to city
schools over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton charmed Ishmael and the audience of children, teachers
and officials from the Board of Education as he recounted how his
mother had tolerated his squawking on the saxophone until he became
good at it, and how Hillary Rodham Clinton had set up a private
music room for him ``way down a hall'' on the top floor of the
White House, ``where nobody could hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he retreats there to play the saxophone for
15 or 20 minutes and comes out ``full of energy, ready to start
again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of campaignlike stops for the president, who was
not actually campaigning for himself. He was joined at both schools
by Harold Levy, the schools chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never mentioned his wife's campaign for the Senate. But
coincidentally or not, Clinton used his next stop, at PS 130, an
overcrowded school in Queens, to lobby for a $25 billion school
construction bond act that has also been mentioned by Hillary
Clinton in her recent campaign appearances. Her opponent, Rep. Rick
Lazio, has opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   When the president lamented that the House and Senate leadership
had not adequately supported his school financing proposals,
someone in the audience shouted, ``Hillary,'' and Clinton quipped,
``That's not a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would help modernize 6,000 schools
across the country, Clinton said, with much of the money going to
the poorest districts, including $1.5 billion to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent speech came from Mary Minnick, a fourth-grade
teacher who has worked at PS 130 for over 33 years, since, as she
said, Lyndon Johnson was president. When she started, she said, the
school had 400 children, with two classes for each grade, an indoor
play area, a library, a music room and ``even a dental clinic.''
All the students ate lunch at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, it is ``a traffic jam,'' with 900 children, many
housed in portable classrooms outdoors, reading classes in the hall
and music in the lunchroom. There are three lunch shifts, beginning
at 10:30 a.m., and the playroom is long gone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Clinton's appearance in Queens had the tone of a stump
speech, complete with local elected officials, his visit to East
Harlem was a bit quirkier.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education had installed air conditioners in two
rooms at PS 96 for the president's visit, but the auditorium was
still sweltering, because windows were closed for security reasons.
As teachers distributed bottled water, Clinton shared the stage
with the singers Billy Joel and Brian McKnight, in a testament to
the clout of VH1, the cable music station, which sponsored the
event with Viacom, its parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Viacom, Sumner Redstone, whose net worth is
$12.1 billion, according to Forbes magazine, was also there but did
not say a word, letting his money do the talking as the VH1 Save
the Music Foundation announced its donation of $5 million worth of
musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   A student at PS 96, Kelvin Eusebio, gamely told the audience
that his speech had been written for him by an adult, and then
delivered it _ full of big words and bigger sentiments _ with great
polish and flair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton congratulated PS 96, one of the worst-performing schools
in the city, for what he said was a rise in third-grade reading
scores by over 300 percent, to 74 percent of the children reading
above grade level from 20 percent. The improvement for the school
as a whole was much more modest, with 22.3 percent of the students
meeting state and city standards this year, compared with 16
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has known his share of mischief, never met Ishmael
Acevedo, but if he had, he might have identified with this
particular third-grader. Ishmael plays the drums at home and the
trumpet at church, but he said he had not been accepted into the
music program at PS 96, because of his behavior. He tries to
behave, Ishmael said, but his devilish streak keeps getting the
better of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in it, but you have to deserve it,'' Ishmael
explained. ``If there's too much kids, sometimes they choose a kid
that be good.''

RECYCLING COMPANY TRIES NEW APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAZON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tomra Pacific, the operator of recycling centers
typically located behind grocery stores, is converting its centers
to a more customer-friendly concept it calls RePlanet.
</P>
<P>
   The new centers feature extended hours, a cleaner look and two
buy-back machines that automatically recognize containers and give
customers a receipt that can be redeemed inside the store.
</P>
<P>
   They're proving so popular, they are being moved to the front of
the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction has been terrific. It has gone exceptionally
well,'' said Jack Brown, chief executive officer of Stater Bros.
Markets. ``The broader scope of what they take will only make it
more convenient for customers to recycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The more appealing appearance, longer hours and more visible
location have resulted in more volume at the recycling centers
already converted, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the first 10 RePlanet recycling centers brought in 50
percent more materials, said Randy Gusikowski, president of Tomra
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Once converted, the centers will continue to accept the same
materials they previously did. Only containers redeemable through
the buy-back machines will be accepted during the hours the center
is not staffed, though.
</P>
<P>
   Each machine accepts aluminum, glass or plastic and is equipped
with a digital camera that takes 25 snapshots per second. Those
photos are compared with a shape database to determine what type of
container is being returned.
</P>
<P>
   Tomra, a Norwegian company with recycling centers around the
world, entered the California market in February 1998 by acquiring
existing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company then set out to create a new image, Gusikowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that if we could get some centers here in the state,
we believed there was an opportunity to re-engineer some of those
centers and create a concept that was going to be more appealing to
the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gusikowski said Tomra is responding to customer complaints about
short hours, safety and cleanliness by introducing the RePlanet
concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, it wasn't terribly convenient,'' Gusikowski
said. ``Customers were concerned the centers weren't clean and
well-maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   The RePlanet centers are designed with a cleaner, more
professional-looking front end, and the employees are better
trained and held to higher standards of quality and cleanliness,
Gusikowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot project was launched at 10 Stater Bros. stores in the
Inland Empire, and Tomra officials tracked their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``On average, those centers are doing 250 percent more
traffic,'' Gusikowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of material they take in is up by 50 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that if we could provide convenience to people
... they would make recycling part of their regular trip to the
grocery store,'' Gusikowski said.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 75 recycling centers converted to RePlanet, and
Tomra's goal is to have 200 completed by the end of the year. By
the end of 2001, all of Tomra's 400 California centers will be
renovated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a competitive advantage we can have in the
marketplace,'' Gusikowski said. ``Most Californians are so busy,
anything we can do to make it more convenient for them to recycle
helps. It's just one less trip you have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their more appealing look, the centers eventually
will be used for fund raising by community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations will have the ability to receive bar-code tags to
give to members and supporters that they can scan at the buy-back
machines before redeeming their containers.
</P>
<P>
   Any proceeds, instead of being paid to the customer, will be
paid to the organization, Gusikowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have the whole community using the recycling center
as a means to raise money,'' Gusikowski said. ``We can have many
different types of organizations using this center as a means to
raise funds, and it's something that's good for the environment.''

 &HT;    Clinton's influence still looms
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He may not be on the ballot this year, but
President Clinton draws stronger reactions from many voters across
the heartland states than do either Democrat Al Gore or Republican
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because he is a larger-than-life political
figure,'' said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute
of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, 53, took the White House back for the Democrats in 1992
after 12 years of Republican rule. He toned down his party's
liberal rhetoric, ``borrowed'' Republican themes such as welfare
reform and presided over an unprecedented economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   His victories in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania were
crucial to his 1992 election over incumbent Republican George Bush.
Clinton also carried the states in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He also took up with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, got
impeached by the House but escaped conviction in the Senate, and is
working hard now to settle the world's trouble spots _ and create a
statesman's legacy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He remains popular enough, analysts say, to give Republicans
pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Clinton. I wish he could run again,'' said Lynne
Hollins, 35, a barber at Rayfields Friendly Barber Shop in Detroit.
``I like his issues and I know how he's tried to help minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   When the president visited a Columbus elementary school in early
May, admirers lined the streets outside, hoping for a glimpse of
the educator-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very nice,'' said Diane Smoot, a child-care
provider. ``I wish he would run again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution prohibits Clinton from seeking a third-term,
but doesn't prevent critics from tarring Gore, Clinton's vice
president, with the fallout from the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing that went on with Clinton. I personally don't
think it was right,'' said Andrea McLelland, 29, a nurse in Mt.
Clemens, a Detroit suburb. ``That's basically what I know about
Gore. He stood behind the president.''
</P>
<P>
   McLelland, who voted for Clinton, won't vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't cut the mustard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ability to charm the voters has become the standard
against which would-be successors are measured.
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush visited Cincinnati last summer he first
schmoozed amicably with voters at an inner-city black church and
then wooed Republican big shots at a downtown fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Clintonesque without the baggage,'' Alex Arshinkoff, the
Summit County Republican chairman, said approvingly.

MISSING HARD DRIVES FOUND AT LOS ALAMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change `containing' to `believed to contain' in lede.)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A pair of computer hard drives believed to contain
nuclear secrets that had been missing from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory were found Friday afternoon behind a copying machine
under conditions that were highly suspicious, administration
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drives were discovered in a secure area of the New
Mexico laboratory's X Division, where nuclear weapons are designed
and where the drives had been stored. They were discovered Friday
afternoon by an X Division employee, who is now being questioned by
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Officials remained highly skeptical of the circumstances
surrounding the recovery of the hard drives since the area in the
lab where the drives were discovered had already been closely
searched twice, by FBI and Energy Department investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the FBI's criminal investigation of the
security breach was now being intensified in an effort to determine
why the hard drives were removed from a secured vault and how they
could have ended up behind a photocopier. ``They were recovered
under very questionable circumstances,'' said one senior law
enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a lot of inconsistencies here,'' added another
official. ``All of a sudden these things appear, in a place that
had been searched twice.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators now believe that the two recovered drives
are probably the same ones missing since at least May 7, officials
said the FBI was planning to conduct a more thorough examination of
them to make sure, and to determine that they contained the missing
data.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will be checking for fingerprints and other
evidence that might pinpoint who removed them, and the FBI's
computer experts also plan to determine whether the data was copied
or downloaded before it was returned. The FBI now has nearly 60
agents working on the investigation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the computer drives marked a bizarre twist in a
case that had already prompted much criticism over lax security at
Los Alamos, and had led to harsh Republican attacks on Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, who had earlier been mentioned as a
possible running mate for Vice President Al Gore on the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson expressed outrage this week over the security lapses,
especially after it was learned that Los Alamos employees had
waited more than three weeks before reporting the loss of the hard
drives, which reportedly contain some of the nation's most
important nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drives contain data on nuclear weapons and are intended
to be used in emergencies by the government's Nuclear Emergency
Search Team, which is responsible for responding to nuclear
accidents and terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   The data includes information needed by the team to disarm
nuclear devices designed by the United States and other nations,
including Russia. In response to the loss of the hard drives, the
lab's director, John Browne, placed six managers at the lab on
leave, pending possible disciplinary action. The managers include
the lab's head of nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has also asked former Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., a
Republican from Tennessee, and former Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, a
Democrat from Indiana, to conduct an independent review of the
disappearance of the nuclear secrets.

 &HT;    Clinton's influence still looms
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He may not be on the ballot this year, but
President Clinton draws stronger reactions from many voters across
the heartland states than do either Democrat Al Gore or Republican
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because he is a larger-than-life political
figure,'' said John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute
of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, 53, took the White House back for the Democrats in 1992
after 12 years of Republican rule. He toned down his party's
liberal rhetoric, ``borrowed'' Republican themes such as welfare
reform and presided over an unprecedented economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   His victories in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Pennsylvania were
crucial to his 1992 election over incumbent Republican George Bush.
Clinton also carried the states in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He also took up with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, got
impeached by the House but escaped conviction in the Senate, and is
working hard now to settle the world's trouble spots _ and create a
statesman's legacy in the process.
</P>
<P>
   He remains popular enough, analysts say, to give Republicans
pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Clinton. I wish he could run again,'' said Lynne
Hollins, 35, a barber at Rayfields Friendly Barber Shop in Detroit.
``I like his issues and I know how he's tried to help minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   When the president visited a Columbus elementary school in early
May, admirers lined the streets outside, hoping for a glimpse of
the educator-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very nice,'' said Diane Smoot, a child-care
provider. ``I wish he would run again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution prohibits Clinton from seeking a third-term,
but doesn't prevent critics from tarring Gore, Clinton's vice
president, with the fallout from the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing that went on with Clinton. I personally don't

 WASHINGTON: nuclear secrets. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senior Energy Department officials received word of the
discovery Friday afternoon while they were meeting to discuss how
to deal with the crisis caused by the loss of the hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The latest security problem at Los Alamos dates to May 7, when
members of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team discovered that the
hard drives were missing while they were making sure that equipment
stored in the X Division vault was secure as a forest fire raged
near the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   They did not inform Browne for more than three weeks, on the
night of May 31. The Energy Department and the FBI were notified
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that a total of 86 people had access to the vault
where the hard drives were stored, including 26 scientists who
could enter without escorts and remove material without logging it
in or out.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began conducting polygraph examinations of those with
access to the material this week, and officials said three people
had failed as of Friday. It was not known how the polygraph results
were being interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials stressed that it was too soon to draw strong
conclusions about the disappearance and reappearance of the hard
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials speculated that whoever took the drives might
have panicked in the face of a major investigation and dropped them
behind the copying machine in the last day or so. But the intense
scrutiny of the case by the FBI could make it difficult to maintain
a coverup for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to aggressively pursue this serious matter,''
Richardson said in a statement. ``There will be accountability and
disciplinary actions regarding the Los Alamos incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the hard drives was the latest in a series
of security lapses at the highest levels of government, including
at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Los Alamos came under scrutiny following evidence
that China may have stolen nuclear data from the lab. In December,
a former scientist at Los Alamos, Wen Ho Lee, was arrested for
mishandling classified material after it was discovered that he had
downloaded and copied vast amounts of nuclear data from the
classified computer network at Los Alamos into an unsecure network
and onto portable computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is now in jail awaiting trial, and has said that he is
innocent of the charges.

GREAT MATCHUP SURPRISES STEWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Emanuel Steward, Oscar De La Hoya's former
trainer, was surprised he took this fight with Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, the WBC welterweight champion, has been less than
devastating in big fights in recent years and has been criticized
as a result. So what'd he do? He took another one, on Saturday at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still surprised when I think about it,'' Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   And excited. This, Steward said, is a great matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Who does he think will win? He said he's ``straight down the
middle'' but seems to lean toward Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very dangerous fight for Oscar,'' Steward said. ``I
know people are picking him because of the physical thing. They
think his punches are more powerful and he's bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then they say he's more experienced in big fights. Well,
with Mosley's (easy-going) psychological makeup, that's not going
to be a factor. Shane is very calm, very comfortable in this
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he has other things going for him: intensity, desire, hand
speed. That word intensity is important. I wouldn't want any of my
fighters to fight Shane Mosley right now, not even Tommy Hearns in
his prime. He so much desire. He's in that combat mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali had it when he was on top, Tyson had it. Look at him. You
leave Mosley alone for five seconds and the guy's shadow boxing.
That's big.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Oscar can hurt him, that might change things. If he can't,
well, it'll be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Weigh-in: De La Hoya weighed in at 146 pounds on Friday, Mosley
at the 147-pound weight limit.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, who some believe is at a disadvantage because he only
recently moved up to the weight class, probably will weigh
considerably more than De La Hoya come fight time.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said his walk-around weight is about 162, De La Hoya 157.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, De La Hoya was the more antsy of the two
during the weigh-in, as he has been the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   During a final news conference on Wednesday, he tapped his
fingers incessantly on the table in front of him and shadowboxed
before and after the weigh-in. It's as if he can't wait to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, by contrast, seemed to be as calm and cool as ever only
a day before the biggest fight of his life, which many believe has
helped him cope with the magnitude of this event. He stood
relatively still at the weigh-in, only smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Both looked very confident.
</P>
<P>
   Pay-per-view: Promoter Bob Arum has said he expects pay-per-view
buys to exceed $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Others, more realistic, believe the fight could approach the
$760,000 DeLa Hoya-Pernell Whitaker did in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the fight is taking place during the Lakers' run to the
NBA championship hasn't helped, at least not in this town. The
fight has received only a fraction of the coverage it might have
received otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Star-studded: Saturday's fight could break all records for the
number of celebrities expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The fight promoters issued a preliminary list of about 50,
including Dustin Hoffman, Mark McGwire, Will Smith, Denzel
Washington, Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez and Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's no question as to who will receive the biggest
ovation when they're introduced to a crowd expected to exceed
21,000: Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal will be sitting front row, center, according to the
promoter.

SPORTS COLUMN: THEY'RE NOT JUST THROWS IN THE DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 2nd graf with result of game)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre loosely compared it to the year he went
``from hitting .363 to being a babbling idiot.'' That would have
been the 1971 and 1972 seasons, when Torre dropped from the year of
a lifetime to .281, from 137 runs batted in to 81, from National
League Most Valuable Player to ordinary Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not doing what I did the year before,'' he said, relaxing
in the Yankees dugout before settling in for the stress of sending
Chuck Knoblauch back out to second base where he had no throws to
make Friday night as the Yankees lost again, this time by 3-1 to
the Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch showed up, ready and willing, or ready for anything,
which was an improvement on the previous night, when he committed
three painful throwing errors and had a look in his eyes that
convinced his manager it was time for his second baseman to hitch
an immediate ride home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Knoblauch said when asked who the driver was,
which, hopefully, meant he didn't know the name of the appointed
chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   The experience was so discomforting that several Yankees later
called, Knoblauch said, to make sure he didn't do anything rash,
and we're not talking about emptying the refrigerator of fruit to
practice his soft tosses out the window. In his hour of emotional
need, Knoblauch would have preferred to speak to his mother, but
Linda Knoblauch wasn't in and he had to wait for Friday, when she
told him she wished she could give him a hug.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived early in the clubhouse Friday afternoon and received
a group embrace from his close-knit team. Torre told him, ``You're
my second baseman,'' and the core veterans acted as if he had gone
home early Thursday night with an upset stomach, and they all
continued to refute the contention that Knoblauch has become
anything more than an occasional threat to the fans behind first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I throw the ball low, it's not the talk of the town,''
Derek Jeter said. ``If he throws the ball low, all of a sudden,
everyone's bringing it up again. Every player goes through
stretches where they are not catching or throwing the ball the way
they like to, and if they don't tell you, they're lying.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were lying to themselves, if they believed that
Knoblauch's throwing problem, which he struggled through so
publicly and commendably during last season's postseason, was just
going to go away. It wasn't a cycle. This isn't a slump. Torre's
reduced batting average from one season to the next had a little to
do with pitchers and fielders. Knoblauch, to the contrary, is
unable to execute what in better times was the most natural play he
could make on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that happened and then you start thinking
about it and then it consumes you,'' said Torre, hoping again that
the problem is rooted in the flaw of the act.
</P>
<P>
   A sports psychologist I know once told me that the most
difficult aspect of treating athletes is getting them to understand
that therapy is not necessarily the act of correcting the
dysfunction, but getting to the bottom of what caused it. Therapy
is open-ended and nonguaranteed. Athletes by nature are a more
scientific breed, staking their careers on mysteries that can be
solved with mechanics and muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch hinted that he had, contrary to public opinion, sought
some form of off-season assistance, though his later comments
suggested that it might have been along the lines of the 24-hour,
self-help course that baseball ordered for another troubled soul
currently lost in the wilds.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker is in his own league, but Knoblauch, when asked if
he had any knowledge of whether his problem might be bigger than
baseball, said: ``That's something maybe a psychologist or some
kind of professional would know. I can't pinpoint when this all
started, or if there was an event in my life that made this happen.
Maybe these people will have the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Blass and Steve Sax and anyone else who has lived through
something like this don't have them. There is no formula here.
Knoblauch's issues are his own. Only he can solve them. The fans
booed him Thursday night, but they stood and cheered
compassionately Friday night when he led off the home first inning.
He promptly singled into right field and soon turned an ankle
sliding into second. He remained in the game, limping, grimacing.
</P>
<P>
   Fans appreciate tough guys _ the smaller, the better _ and
Knoblauch, optimistically listed at 5 foot 9 inches, was showing
them that he wasn't afraid to come back to the ball park, to face
them and the news media and the meanest ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   If only it was that easy for him to look within himself.

TEXAS A&AMP;M SUSPENDS BONFIRE FOR TWO YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``tragedy'' to ``accident'' in lede.)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In response to the worst accident in the history of
Texas A&AMP;M University, the president of the university Friday
suspended its traditional football bonfire ritual for two years to
allow time to plan a scaled-down, tightly supervised event that
will better ensure student safety.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the university's president, Dr. Ray Bowen,
reverberated across Texas and punctuated a seven-month period of
criticism and Texas A&AMP;M soul-searching after a four-tier stack of
logs nearly 60 feet tall collapsed last Nov. 18, killing 11
students and a former student and injuring 27 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tragedy was a wake-up call for everyone here and everyone
in the country,'' said Bowen in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said the bonfire could resume in the fall
of 2002 provided that students meet conditions established by
Bowen. He said that when classes resumed in late summer, he would
convene a committee of administrators, faculty members and students
to begin reorganizing the event.
</P>
<P>
   Canceling the next two bonfires will allow appropriate time to
plan, Bowen said. He predicted that a smaller, safer bonfire tower
would be built, with increased oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quite optimistic we can create a safe structure,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire, a tradition that began in 1909 at Texas A&AMP;M on the
eve of its football game against its archrival, the University of
Texas, annually draws thousands of people to the A&AMP;M campus about
90 miles northwest of here in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Student crews working with little supervision stacked and bound
thousands of logs felled from nearby forests into a tower shaped
like a wedding cake. The final week of construction, known as Push,
required round-the-clock efforts as students raced to finish in
time to set the stack afire at a pep rally before the game.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a five-member independent commission appointed by Texas
A&AMP;M issued a report saying that design flaws in the log tower were
largely to blame for the collapse. The report also said students
building the tower were inadequately trained, and criticized
university officials for failing to provide adequate supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Friday's announcement was quiet on the A&AMP;M campus.
The academic year ended several weeks ago and most students had
left the campus. Only about a dozen students and faculty members
attended Bowen's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good they're making this decision, though I don't
know about the two-year period of holding off,'' said Justin
Lightsey, 19, a sophomore from nearby Bryan. ``I think it's good
they're making it safer. My parents, though, told me not to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Braus, whose son Dominic remains in physical therapy after
suffering extensive injuries to his arm in the collapse, said she
was pleased with the new safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Braus also said that she did not blame the university for her
son's injury and that she was elated that one of A&AMP;M's oldest
traditions would eventually continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop Christmas trees, you can't stop Easter eggs,''
Braus said. ``These traditions have to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to continue the bonfire tradition has been
enormous. More than 8,000 students have signed a petition
supporting its continuance.

<P>
   Earlier this month, the Texas A&AMP;M Faculty Senate recommended
that Bowen suspend the tradition for at least one year. And on
Wednesday, the Texas Board of Professional Engineers voted to
conduct an inquiry to determine whether state engineering laws were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, an alumnus of the university, endorsed the
new policy. ``He supports the administration,'' said Eric Bearse, a
spokesman for the lieutenant governor. ``The most important thing
is to ensure the safety of the students, and they have put together
a process that puts safety first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the restructured bonfires would differ greatly
from those of recent years, when students spent up to three months
cutting down thousands of trees and then building the tower of
logs. In the future, the event will last only two weeks. The trees
will be donated from companies and students will not participate in
the harvest. Also, Bowen said, the reduced size of the tower will
lessen the environmental damage, a point criticized even before the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, construction will end by midnight, and university
officials will provide continual supervision. A fence will surround
the site and a video camera will record construction. The hierarchy
of the student organization, which had been run by upperclassmen
known as Red Pots and Brown Pots, will be reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   And the unstable wedding cake shape will be abandoned in favor
of a teepee shape used in the 1950s and '60s. Professional
engineers will draft the design and establish the construction
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the bonfire structure would be assessed and
certified every year and that failure to meet the specifications
would result in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't comply, if the rules are broken, there will be
no bonfire the following year,'' said Cindy Lawson, the school's
executive director for community relations.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What does a desperately frustrated Yankees second
baseman have in common with a famous 19th century Russian novelist?
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch may think not much. But in a way, he is in the
same pickle as Leo Tolstoy was as a child, when his brother
challenged him to stand in a corner until he could stop thinking
about white bears.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstoy, legend has it stood in that corner for quite a while,
with white bears _ like the exquisitely maddening image of a
baseball speeding effortlessly to first base _ trooping endlessly
through his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstoy's brush with obsession was trivial, but Knoblauch, who
left a ballgame in frustration Thursday night after his inability
to complete a simple throw to first base resulted in three errors,
has a lot more at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch returned to the team last night and received a
standing ova- tion in the first inning. He fielded one pop-up and
made no throws in a 3-1 loss to the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, sports psychologists surmised Friday, is that an
action that Knoblauch has instinctually performed 1000 times is
suddenly the object of conscious thought. In the past two years,
the infielder who once won a Gold Glove award for his defense, has
been plagued by a rash of throwing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine, suggested Rick Wolff, who worked with the
Cleveland Indians from 1989 to 1994 and now is private practice in
Westchester, consciously analyzing how to place your legs each time
you go down a flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballplayers, by the time they get to the major leagues, know
how to automatically run from home to first, they know how to throw
a ball,'' Wolff said. ``They don't think about that stuff. But when
you start thinking about these things, when you start thinking `How
much pressure should I put into my throw? Should I try to grip the
ball a certain way?' you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as the baseball axiom goes: ``Thinking is stinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the more a ballplayer _ or a golfer or a football
player or anyone else abruptly thrust into obsession _ tries to
stop thinking, the more stubborn the thoughts become.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Wegner, a psychologist at the University of Virginia,
knows a lot about such problems, having become interested in such
lapses of mental controls because of the Tolstoy legend. But he
studies these problems mostly in the laboratory, though he has also
carried his experiments to the putting green. .
</P>
<P>
   Wegner and his colleagues have found that they can ``create an
obsession in a matter of minutes'' just by instructing their
subjects, usually college students, to try not to think about
something _ sex, for example, or an old flame.
</P>
<P>
   And stressful situations, Wegner said, make the struggle for
mental control even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiny little things just grow, mostly by our attempts to stop
them,'' he said. ``It's almost like trying to put it out of your
mind causes it to be put into indelible type.''
</P>
<P>
   Wegner has a reverse strategy for combatting such obsessional
thoughts (and Yankees manager Joe Torre, take note): He tells
people that they should think about _ rather than banish _ the
unwanted thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that the thought gets tired and goes away,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's situation, he said, ``sounds like an extreme case.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that perhaps the infielder should try to throw
badly; after making 100 such throws, he might stop focusing on it
and thereby start tossing perfect strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Sports psychologists who work with major league players have
their own methods, and some said Friday that they were dubious
about Wegner's approach.
</P>
<P>
   But they agreed that ballplayers who have problems like
Knoblauch's are struggling more with their minds than with their
bodies. And while there are famous cases involving other baseball
players _ most notably Steve Sax, another second baseman, and
Mackey Sasser, a catcher _ such difficulties are more common than
fans realize, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying cause and the solution may be different for each
struggling athlete, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, who estimates that three or four major league and college
players falter in similar ways each season, said that his strategy
is to try to get players to focus on something else. ``I call it,
for the lack of a better term, distraction therapy,'' he said,
``meaning that instead of letting them get caught up in paranoia or
gripped by fear, you try to distract them with another thought.''
That strategy was parodied in the movie ``Bull Durham,'' in which
Susan Sarandon made Tim Robbins, playing ``Nuke Laloush,'' a wild
pitcher, wear a garter.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on a stumbling ballplayer are so immense, Wolff
said _ great enough Thursday night to drive Knoblauch from the
stadium _ that some athletes try to hide them. As in Knoblauch's
case, the problem escalates in the glare of media attention and
becomes a label the player often finds it hard to shed. The
ballplayer's teammates, he added, are also under pressure, often
not knowing what to do or how to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say to a guy like that?'' Wolff said . ``Don't
worry about it? No sweat? Take it easy? Deep down in their mind,
they're thinking, `I hope it's not contagious.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Maher, a professor at the Graduate School of Applied
and Professional Psychology at Rutgers University, who also works
with the Cleveland Indians, said that the Cleveland team tries to
spot ballplayers who are having difficulties early on, and work
with them before things get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not a player successfully overcomes his problem often
depends on how strong a support system he has, Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are confused. They are tense. They have to see that the
people who are trying to help them have a plan, and feel
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that last season two Cleveland players _ whom he
declined to name _ started having problems with basic technique.
Maher and other team psychologists began working with the
ballplayers immediately, he said, and successfully headed off
further difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who did not respond to calls asking for comment,
had Knoblauch talk to a team counselor during the playoffs two
years ago, after the second baseman had argued with an umpire
rather than complete a play.
</P>
<P>
   While fans and commentators have speculated that stresses in
Knoblauch's personal life _ his father suffers from Alzheimer's _
might be contributing to his troubles, Maher and Wolff said that in
their experience, there is little correlation between such stresses
and the mental glitches that for a major leaguer can turn every
game into torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rhyme or reason to this,'' Wolff said. ``We all
have stress in our lives, and major leaguers have stress. I've seen
guys who have no care in the world and they say `Rick, I can't make
this play.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sax, who in 1983 as a second baseman for the Dodgers had
difficulties almost identical to Knoblauch's, said he does not
remember being under particular stress at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But he remembers, he said, what it felt like, and can guess at
what Knoblauch is feeling now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the toughest thing I've ever gone through,'' said Sax,
now an analyst for Fox Sports Net's Baseball Today. ``It's
completely unexplainable. It's so awful, and everybody in the world
is watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   When his problem was at its peak, he said, he stood on the field
and prayed ``Please, please don't hit it to me, please don't hit
the ball to me!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when a small white sphere was hurtling in his direction,
he felt sorry for himself. Then he got mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really ticked and I beat this thing,'' Saks said. ``I
didn't turn my back on it. I bit it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he is glad he went through the ordeal. ``It made
me a better person. It put things in perspective and it made me a
better player.''
</P>
<P>
   The following years, he added, were the best in his career,
years when his second-base prayers changed to ``Please hit the ball
to me because when you do, this game is over.''
</P>
<P>
   All Knoblauch has to do, Sax said, ``is to get his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just turn our brains off, we'd be fine,'' he said.

RETURN OF BELCHER CALLED A `LITMUS TEST'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It has taken longer than anticipated, but Tim
Belcher will finally make his 2000 debut tonight for the Anaheim
Angels against the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher had surgery to repair a torn muscle in his right elbow
on Dec. 2, and has spent the past 6 months trying to get the elbow
strong enough to pitch again. Initially the club had hoped to have
him back in the first week of May, but he went through a ``dead
arm'' stage that forced him to stop throwing completely for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia said he's hoping to get up to 100 pitches
from Belcher tonight, which ideally would translate into about six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready,'' Scioscia said. ``I think he's at a point were
he's very confident about the health of his arm and very confident
about his velocity. His command is where it should be. When you get
into a major league game, that'll be the litmus test to see how far
he's come.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher went 14-14 for Kansas City in 1998, and signed a free
agent contract with the Angels for two years (plus a club option)
worth $10.6 million before the 1999 season. But last year, injuries
limited Belcher to 24 starts and a 6-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   Lineup changes: After scoring only three runs in the past two
games combined against Tampa Bay, Scioscia shook up the lineup
Friday. The most notable change was that center fielder Garret
Anderson, whose average is down to .245, was not in the lineup.
Anderson will not start today's game either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the most part Garret has worked very hard to play
himself out of this mini slump,'' Scioscia said. ``But we know he's
not at the level he will end up. Sometimes guys are banging their
head against the wall, and you do plug through it. We've seen Mo
(Vaughn) do it. We've seen Timmy (Salmon) do it. But we've reached
a point where it was time to take a step back.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has played in 150 or more games in each of the
past four seasons, hates to take a day off. And now he's getting
two off in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's different,'' Anderson said. ``That's how he feels. He
definitely feels strong about it. I'll just deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia also said he has considered putting Anderson in a
different spot in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn steps up: One of the young pitchers who has stepped up
and pitched well in the absence of Belcher and other injured
pitchers is Jarrod Washburn. In seven starts, Washburn is 2-1 with
a 3.92 ERA. He has been particularly good in his past two starts,
in which he's allowed only two runs and seven hits in 14 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for his recent success is a new routine
before each game. Washburn had been so keyed up at the start of
games, he had a tendency to overthrow and consequently was wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going out there so excited,'' Washburn said. ``I'm
more under control. I throw a little more in the bullpen and get
more focused and a little less excited going into the first
inning.''

GORE MOVES TO SMOOTH TIES WITH LABOR OVER DALEY'S APPOINTMENT TO
CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore moved quickly Friday to try
to tamp down unrest among labor leaders over his appointment of
Commerce Secretary William Daley, a chief labor nemesis during the
recent fight over the China trade bill, as chairman of his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters that the first person outside of his
campaign circle whom he called with the news on Thursday was John
Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeney said in an interview Friday that he was traveling on
Thursday morning and that he and Gore did not actually speak until
afternoon, long after he had learned of Daley's appointment through
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Others said Sweeney, one of the vice president's most consistent
allies, had been left fuming because he was not alerted in advance.
Sweeney issued a statement saying Daley's advocacy of the China
trade bill and the North American Free Trade Agreement put him
``squarely on the opposite side of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney then accepted an urgent invitation by the vice president
to meet with him Friday. And so Sweeney and Gerald McEntee,
president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees and chairman of the AFL-CIO's political arm, trooped to
Gore's official residence here this afternoon and stayed for an
hour to discuss the Daley appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Daley was not present.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes later,'' Sweeney said. ``Before we talk to the
appointee, we talk to the one making the appointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney described the session as frank and blunt. ``I expressed
concern about what effect this might have on our rank and file,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the selection of Daley was especially disappointing
because it came so soon after the bitterly divisive House vote last
month to normalize trade relations with China. Daley was the point
man for the Clinton administration in advancing the bill over
labor's fierce objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we said yesterday still stands,'' Sweeney said. ``Bill
Daley, in his new position, will need to prove he can fight just as
hard for America's working families as he fought for America's
trade deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said Gore had reflected on ``how unfortunate it was that
this all developed, that the timing was difficult and it happened
very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognized that the communication was not as good as it
could have been,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Gore made any promises to the labor
leaders to make up for this appointment, although Sweeney said he
expected Gore to continue advancing his agenda for working families
and would perhaps ``accelerate'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney also suggested a silver lining to the Daley appointment:
``Maybe we're doing something good as far as getting him out of any
more trade agreements,'' he said with a laugh. Despite the
discomfort of his constituency, particularly in the industrial
unions, Sweeney has remained a staunch Gore supporter. And he
reflects the view of many in labor that the unions will ultimately
be able to overlook the vice president's pro-trade activity because
they are determined to keep the White House in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Aides of Gore said he believed that Daley would be an asset to
the campaign, despite his having crossed swords with labor.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president ``has tremendous confidence in Secretary
Daley, and they had talked about this job before,'' a Gore
confidant said, adding: ``It would be a mistake to take today as a
snapshot of where we will be in November. It's an issue that will
be worked through, but in the end the interests of labor and the
Democratic Party are so consistent with one another that everyone
will be working toward the same goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But the notion that labor has nowhere else to go in the
presidential election infuriates some. The Teamsters union, which
called the Daley appointment a ``slap in the face,'' and the United
Auto Workers have both declined to endorse Gore and are toying with
endorsing Ralph Nader or Pat Buchanan instead. And the United
Steelworkers, which has endorsed Gore, remains detached from his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the assessment mode on the politics,'' said Gary
Hubbard, a spokesman for the steelworkers. ``We've had a lot of
members bailing out from the Democratic Party.''

CONE EXCELS BUT THE YANKEES FALL SHORT
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone pitched three hitless innings last Sunday
against the Mets, a burst of hope in an otherwise dismal season,
until the rains washed his effort away and a deluge of distractions
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa trade rumors ballooned, Roger Clemens went on the
disabled list, and then Chuck Knoblauch bobbled one ball too many
Thursday night and ducked out of the ballpark before the Yankees
stumbled, 12-3, to the best team in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting happily, if not eagerly, off to the side of the
maelstrom was Cone, whose last and only victory in 13 starts this
season was on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night Cone walked into the Yankees clubhouse wearing a
smile that would later fade to a fixed and determined stare on the
mound. With a six-inning performance as dominating as it was
reassuring to the Yankees, Cone proved that aborted outing last
Sunday was not a fluke. He had control, location and confidence.
All that he lacked was the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cone got a no-decision, and even though he set the tone on a
night swirling with redemption, the Yankees lost their second
straight to the Chicago White Sox, this time by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin recorded his 10th victory of the season, and even
though the Yankees had been the only team to blemish his record,
they could not get to him Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees reliever Mike Stanton, who came in for Cone in the top
of seventh inning, got the loss. He put the winning run on base,
when the leadoff hitter Paul Konerko cracked a ball to deep right
that was carrying home run ambitions in thick, humid air. While
outfielder Paul O'Neill snagged it a foot above the wall, he could
not bring it down with him, and Konerko held up on third base. Two
outs and three batters later, pinch-hitter Tony Graffanino singled
him home.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago added an insurance run off closer Mariano Rivera in the
top of the ninth, when he allowed a double to Graffanino and Mark
Johnson singled him home. It was only Rivera's second appearance
since June 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had a good scoring opportunity in the eighth inning.
Baldwin had departed the game after 7 1/3 innings and reliever
Bobby Howry entered the game to face O'Neill, with Derek Jeter on
base with a walk. O'Neill flied to right.
</P>
<P>
   Now with two outs, and Jeter having stolen second, Bernie
Williams drew a 3-2 count. But he looked at an outside fastball
belt high from Howry and was called out on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago came into the game tied with Atlanta for the best record
in the major leagues. The Yankees still led Boston in the East by a
half-game coming into Friday night, but it was hard to tell by the
unsettled clubhouse, with owner George Steinbrenner's expression of
concern and interest in Sosa, not to mention the shaken starting
pitching. After Friday night's loss, they trail the Red Sox by a
half-game.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday night, Cone had been the main culprit, compiling a
1-6 record and a 6.49 earned run average coming into Friday night.
But there was something different about him Friday night, something
that began last Sunday in an outing that may not have counted
statistically, but did count personally.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night he struck out five batters in six innings and gave
up four hits. But he allowed just one run, his fewest since his
6-0, seven-inning victory at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Cone was the second-billed Yankee looking for
redemption, if not absolution, Friday night. Knoblauch, just a
night after his three-error debacle, went 2 for 4 but had just one
defensive chance all night, a pop-up. Yet when Clay Bellinger came
in to replace him in the top of the ninth, Bellinger got the first
ground ball hit to second base.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 41,910 first showered Knoblauch with a rousing
round of applause when he came up to bat in the first inning. But
with little fanfare at first, Cone began the game exactly where he
left off last Sunday _ pitching three hitless innings and retiring
the first 10 batters.
</P>
<P>
   His fastball was sharp, the slider even crisper, and he was
ahead of the hitters all night.
</P>
<P>
   In each of his first five innings, Cone recorded a strikeout,
never facing more than four batters an inning. This was not the
same pitcher who had given up 16 earned runs in his last 161/3
innings and had carried a 6.49 ERA. into this game.
</P>
<P>
   His tough inning Friday night was the sixth. Catcher Mark
Johnson led off the inning with to single to right. Cone, who had
given up 14 walks in his last four starts, allowed his first walk
of the game to Ray Durham and followed by surrendering a bunt
single to Jose Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   But after Frank Thomas lined out to Brosius, Magglio Ordonez hit
a sacrifice fly to left that tied the score, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cone ended the inning by snaring a chopper back to the mound
from Paul Konerko. And that would be his last act in a performance
that not only doubled his last start in duration, but in effort. He
threw 60 strikes in 88 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees' run production consisted of a Scott Brosius home run
off Baldwin, hitting the first-pitch for a shot to left-center
field.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch set the tone for a game. He began the game by
drawing a sympathetic roar when he led off the first inning, as the
fans seemed to be seeing him as something so familiar, seeing him
as human. He hit a bloop single to right, and then on a hit and run
he slid safely yet awkwardly on his left ankle into second base.
But Tino Martinez ended the inning striking out and stranding
Knoblauch at third.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Knoblauch got his first chance, when Paul
Konerko hit a pop fly. Again the fans cheered, hanging signs in
support of their second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs for Cone. And no victories either.

STOCK WINDFALL SIMPLY FORTUITOUS, REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE LAZIO
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENDICOTT, N.Y. _ U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio Friday defended a stock
windfall in a company controlled by some of his contributors as a
good investment that had involved no inside information.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate, said he had made the
investment on the advice of a broker, whom he declined to name, but
not through representatives of Quick &AMP; Reilly, the brokerage in
which he invested. He invested in special securities, known as
options, in the company, whose executives had given Lazio's
congressional campaigns $35,000 since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio reaped a 600-percent gain on the investment in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stocks you get lucky on and some stocks you're unlucky
on,'' Lazio said in an interview in this town a few miles west of
Binghamton after one of four campaign stops he made upstate. Asked
if he attributed his good fortune on the investment to luck, he
replied, ``I would say I think that it was a good company and one
that got batted down, and I thought that was an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of the executives, ``I never had a single discussion
with any of the people I know,'' and their contributions, he added,
had never influenced his votes on the House Banking and Commerce
Committees.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said that his overall stock portfolio showed modest gains
of about 10 percent or 15 percent, and that he had been diligent
about disclosing the financial information required by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty clearly, anyone who looks at my financial transactions,
which are completely disclosed every year, can tell that I am not
somebody who's getting rich on public service,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish I had Hillary Clinton's stock adviser,'' Lazio
said, a reference to his Democratic opponent's success in reaping
$100,000 over 10 months after investing $1,000 in volatile
commodities. Hillary Rodham Clinton was assisted by executives of a
food company that had business before the state of Arkansas while
her husband was attorney general and then governor.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio in fact attributed news reports on the investments in part
to what he called an emerging pattern of negative campaigning by
Clinton. He was asked about the investments after an article
appeared Friday in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said, ``This is an effort by the Clinton campaign to draw
me down in the mud, which I'm not going down to their level on.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's spokesman, called the response from
the Lazio campaign inadequate. ``Instead of pointing fingers,
Congressman Lazio should answer legitimate questions that the story
raises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, in his speech to supporters here, decried two critical
television commercials he said Clinton's campaign was about to
broadcast. But he acknowledged that he did not have proof that the
Clinton campaign had influenced the articles on the options deal.
``That's just my presumption after you see this and that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also noted that the Clinton campaign had a worker known as
a tracker videotaping him at virtually every campaign stop, a
common practice among candidates, but one Lazio called ``cloak and
dagger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened to the Hillary Clinton who was
complaining in the first couple days of this campaign about
negative campaigning. But she has disappeared. I wish she would
come back.''

RUTH RUBIN, 93, FOLKLORIST OF YIDDISH SONGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Rubin, a scholar, collector and performer of Yiddish folk
songs who lugged a tape recorder into hundreds of immigrants'
living rooms in an effort to preserve a vanishing cultural
tradition, died on Sunday in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of the Sarah R. Neumann Nursing Home, she formerly
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first women to become a prominent folklorist, Rubin
was also among the first American scholars to document the culture
of Eastern European Jews, anticipating by decades the Yiddish
revival of the 1970s. Starting in the 1930s, she amassed a
collection of about 2,000 songs _ love ballads, lullabies, songs of
the factories and streets _ still considered unparalleled in its
scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is arguably the most important collection, because it's so
early,'' said Steven Zeitlin, the director of City Lore, the New
York Center for Urban Folk Culture. ``Much of the material dies
with the succession of generations. She was collecting songs from
the people that learned them in the old country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, whose books included ``A Treasury of Jewish Folksong''
(1950) and ``Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish Folksong''
(1963), also performed the songs in concert and on records. Her
studio recordings, first made for Folkways in the 1940s, are
available through the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastern European Yiddish folk song,'' Rubin wrote in the
preface to ``Voices of a People,'' ``reflects vividly the life of a
community of many millions over a period of many generations. In
the songs, we catch the manner of speech and phrase, the wit and
humor, the dreams and aspirations, the nonsense, jollity, the
pathos and struggle of an entire people.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike klezmer music, which was performed primarily by men at
public occasions, the songs Rubin collected flourished in more
intimate, domestic settings _ in the kitchen, over the cradle _ and
were sung almost exclusively by women, a group largely ignored by
the cultural chroniclers of her day.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Irving Howe was writing `World of Our Fathers,' she was,
in a sense, at work on the world of our mothers,'' Zeitlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was born Rifke Rosenblatt in Montreal on Sept. 1, 1906,
the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Bessarabia, in Ukraine. As a
young woman she moved to New York, with its swirling ferment of
Yiddish music, literature and theater, and in 1929 published a
volume of her own poems in Yiddish. In 1932 she married Harry
Rubin, who died in 1971; the couple's only child, Michael, died in
1959. Rubin is survived by a sister, Esther Spivack Marks, of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1930s Rubin began to concentrate seriously on
folklore, going on to study with the eminent Yiddish scholar Max
Weinreich and, during World War II, translating diaries smuggled
out of ghettos and Nazi prison camps. With the end of the war and
the revelation of the extent of the Holocaust, and of its sweeping
destruction of Yiddish culture, Rubin became even more determined
to preserve a piece of what remained by making field recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging her bulky reel-to-reel tape recorder from house to
house in cities in Canada and the United States, she captured
well-known songs like ``Roizhinkes Mit Mandeln'' (``Raisins and
Almonds'') and lesser-known material like ``A Brivele der Maman''
(``A Little Letter to Mama'') and ``Oy, di lumpn /zey zenen
shpionen'' (``Oh, the lumpen / they are spies'').
</P>
<P>
   In the last decades of the 20th century, Rubin's work was a
cornerstone of the Yiddish revival movement. With an older
generation of Jewish singers dying off, young musicians who wanted
to learn Yiddish folk songs turned to her books and records.
Rubin's field recordings are now housed in various collections,
including the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress
and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin earned a doctorate in 1976 from Union Graduate School in
Cleveland, writing her dissertation on the songs of Jewish women.
She received an honorary doctorate from the New England
Conservatory of Music and YIVO's Lifetime Achievement Award, among
other honors.
</P>
<P>
   Although she performed in prestigious concert halls like Town
Hall and the Carnegie Recital Hall, Rubin regarded these
appearances not as recitals but as links in a chain of cultural
transmission she hoped would stretch far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't try and put on any great airs,'' recalled the folk
singer Pete Seeger, a longtime friend who occasionally performed
with her. ``She just sang a song very simply. She was mainly
interested in seeing that the song got out so that other people
would learn it and sing.''

PARK'S DREAM: UNIFIED KOREA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park reminds himself he's a baseball
player first. But he pauses at the news from his native Korea and
hopes for unification.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of family in South Korea got a lot of family in North
Korea,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we'll live together. That's my
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   He's one step closer to realizing his dream. On Friday, South
Korean president Kim Dae-Jung declared ``the danger of war on the
Korean peninsula has disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Park knows the history: Fifty years ago, on June 25, 1950,
Communist and anti-Communist forces, aided by the Chinese in the
North and United States/United Nations in the South, began a war.
It ended three years later at the 38th parallel, or about where it
started.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in South Korea, Park was educated that North Koreans
are poor and don't live in the best Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Korea wants to go to North Korea and help them,'' Park
said. ``We tried, but they don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he met a North Korean baseball player at the Asian Games in
Australia in 1993 and found the man to be ``nice, more than we
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, thousands of miles away, Park hears about the historic
meetings between Kim and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Il. The two
Koreas agreed to pursue peace, economic and other changes, the New
York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Park remains hopeful, but he's focused on playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Roster moves: The impending suspensions stemming from the melee
in Chicago has Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson juggling
his personnel. He has decided he doesn't need 12 pitchers and needs
depth at catcher, so on Friday, the Dodgers sent down pitcher Al
Reyes (who came over from Baltimore in the Alan Mills trade
Tuesday) and recalled Adam Melhuse from Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need 14 positions players,'' Johnson said. ``Also, I feel I
don't have enough innings to keep the bullpen sharp. They're not
overworked at all. Eleven pitchers is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of L.A.'s last five games, three starters went the
distance and the other two went seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Dodgers have Chad Kreuter (though he soon will serve
his suspension), Paul LoDuca, Melhuse and Dave Hansen in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley remains disabled since May 31 with a strained right
oblique muscle. He took some swings left-handed on Friday, but
Johnson said Hundley needs more time.
</P>
<P>
   Olson update: Pitcher Gregg Olson, disabled with April 11 with a
left forearm strain, pitched in a simulated game Friday and felt
better than he did in Wednesday's simulated game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we go from here, I don't know,'' Olson said. ``I'm
staying here, but everybody knows I'm way past chomping at the
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Olson was fine but would wait until Sunday to see
how Olson feels. Olson will throw Sunday, possibly in a cage or in
another simulated game and also will throw in some fashion next
week in Houston.
