<HEADLINE> Pak Apex Court Issues Supplementary Cause list </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court
today issued a supplementary cause list fixing petition hearings
for Tuesday and a 15-member full court bench will hear the cases
regarding the appointment of Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
There was no hearing of any case in the apex court today. The
full court bench was to hear the cases about the appointment of
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as chief justice whereas another bench
headed by Sajjad Ali Shah was to hear the case on the contempt of
court.
</P>
<P>
Submitting his arguments on November 28 in the contempt case,
the prime minister's counsel S. M. Zafar had argued that because
of the judgment of the three-member Supreme Court bench at Quetta,
the status of the chief justice had become disputed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he proposed that all judges of the Supreme Court
should first sit together and decide the matter before other cases
are taken up.

<HEADLINE> NATO Publishes Enlargement Cost Estimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Disputes over enlargement cost
got a muffler today when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
published its own estimate of enlargement cost today.
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic News, the organ of the 16-nation military
alliance, disclosed in today's issue that the minimal cost to be
added to NATO's common budget has been estimated at 1.3 billion to
1.5 billion U.S. dollars over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The cost estimate, approved by the 16 NATO member states last
Thursday by a tacit procedure that expired that day, will be borne
by the 19 countries that will be NATO members by a year from now,
according to the Atlantic News.
</P>
<P>
The NATO estimated supplementary costs are well below those
published earlier and are expected to further defuse rows over
enlargement cost in the coming meetings of NATO defense ministers
and foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The current NATO common budget stood at around 1.8 billion
dollars for 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are expected to spend
3.5 billion dollars more over two years immediately after
accession in early 1999 to improve military capabilities and to
make them compatible with NATO standards.
</P>
<P>
The NATO estimate of enlargement cost came out of two rounds of
on--the-spot investigation in the three invitee countries and the
estimate, based on the investigation done by NATO's two main
military commands, is expected to be approved by the NATO defense
ministers who meet Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the supplementary
cost of enlargement would be minuscule compared to current NATO
allied defense spending which amounts to 440 billion dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
NATO is considering spending 700 million, 266 million and 316
million dollars to extend its communications and air defense
networks in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The amount was described as minimum required to ensure the air
defense and integration of these three countries into the NATO
military structure.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the infrastructure for new member countries are
lower than the original estimate, as the infrastructure is in
rather good shape, the Atlantic News said, though the new members
have to use their own resources to modernize their armed forces
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The United States Department of Defense provided earlier this
year an estimate which put the 10-year enlargement procedure at
between 27 billion and 35 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the United States Congressional Budget Office put
out an even higher estimate of supplementary cost which ran from
60 billion to 125 billion dollars for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. estimates immediately became focus of criticism as
the European countries within the alliance, the three invitees and
the U.S. Congress aired their disagreement and disconsent.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the NATO estimate of enlargement cost is
expected to facilitate the ratification process slated for early
next year in the parliaments of the 16 NATO member countries.

<HEADLINE> US Again Rejects Iraq's Inspection Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
repeated its rejection to Iraq's offer that diplomats and experts
-- but not U.N. weapons inspectors -- be allowed to inspect
President Saddam Hussein's residential areas for U.S.-alleged
hiding weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to accept it," Bill Richardson, U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, told ABC in an interview. "We
think it should be U.N. inspectors that are qualified, that know
what they're doing... not diplomats."
</P>
<P>
Iraq made the offer last week to expose "the lies and
falsification" of the United States, which alleged Iraq had hid
weapons of mass destructions in these presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leaders said they extend the invitation to diplomats and
experts of the nations involved in the U.N. weapons inspections
and the five permanent members of the Security Council, but reject
the entry of the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"We reject the idea of anyone who says that the inspection of
people's palaces is the duty of the U.N. Special Commission," Iraq
said in an statement last week.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Broad-based Government in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi today called for formation of a broad-based government
shared by all groups in Afghanistan, the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of Afghan religious, political and
military figures in Iran's central city of Isfahan, Kharrazi
said that Iran supports any peace-seeking efforts in Afghanistan
by any regional or international body.
</P>
<P>
It was the time to take practical steps to restore a
lasting peace in Afghanistan, he said, adding that "the Afghan
nation, even the neighboring states believe that the crisis in
Afghanistan has no military solution."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that foreign interference in Afghanistan
would get nowhere, voicing Iran's opposition to partitioning of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the Islamic Republic of Iran would use all possible
means at the forthcoming summit of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) to be held in Tehran next week to
resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed to raise fund at the OIC summit for the
homeless people of Afghanistan to ease their sufferings with
regards to the approach of winter season.
</P>
<P>
Afghan religious, political and military figures gathered in
Isfahan this morning to explore ways to end the civil war in
that country.
</P>
<P>
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of Islamic Party
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Vice President Sadeq Parwani, leader of the
Islamic Movement Ayatollah Mohammad Asef Mohseni and hundreds of
other Afghan religious, political and military figures attended
the meeting to discuss ways to restore peace in their war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
The Rabbani government was ousted from Afghan capital city of
Kabul by Muslim military group Taliban in September 1996. Then
most of the Afghan groups formed a coalition front to fight
against the Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban coalition forces announced recently to form
a "broad-based" national transition government within one month
under the presidency of Rabbani based on understandings reached
among various Afghan political factions.
</P>
<P>
The new provisional government will rule the country only for
nine months until a permanent government was elected by the
people.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the meeting, Iran announced Sunday that it
recognizes the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani as
the legal government of Afghanistan and there has been no change
in this policy.
</P>
<P>
IRNA today quoted Iran's special representative on Afghanistan
Alaeddin Boroujerdi as saying that Iran's policy is in line
with the international stand adopted by the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Israeli Troop Pullback Plan Ambiguous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today called Israel's plan
to withdraw troops from the West Bank as "ambiguous" and
"tactical."
</P>
<P>
It does not address the grievances of the Palestinians, and
will not push forward the peace process, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa told the press following meeting with an Israeli envoy.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Foreign Ministry Secretary General Eitan Ben Tsor
briefed him on the Israeli cabinet's decision to pull back troops
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He conveyed to Moussa a message from Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, which Moussa said does not come up with a "specific"
plan.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process cannot be salvaged via proposals that lack
credibility ... especially when it comes to core issues such as
redeployment, settlements," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Israel's cabinet Sunday approved a plan to pull back troops
from the West Bank, but set no date and extent of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has said to reject the plan.

<HEADLINE> Survey Points to Inevitable Change in UK's NHS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Many British people are
reluctantly thinking that change in the National Health Service
(NHS) is inevitable and it is likely they will have to pay to use
the NHS in 10 years time, showed a survey which came out today.
</P>
<P>
The survey published today by the Social Market Foundation
found an "expectation gap" between what the public would like the
NHS to deliver and what they believe it will actually be capable
of providing.
</P>
<P>
A great number of the 2,000 adults surveyed expect fewer
treatments to be available on the NHS and anticipate having to buy
more health care in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
More than half of those surveyed think that within a decade
they will have to pay for ambulance services, hospital out-patient
treatment and intensive care.
</P>
<P>
Although 65 percent think the service should remain available
to all and free at point of use, only 13 percent consider that the
most likely outcome.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Labor government's commitment to "save" the almost
50-year-old and long-underfunded NHS in its existing form, the
survey indicated that few people believe this possible.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Egypt Not to Increase Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will not raise its crude
oil production despite a collective hike in the output ceiling of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Oil Minister
Hamdi el Banbi said today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's oil yield, about 870,000 barrels per day (bpd), follows
a national strategy aimed at preserving reserves and finding new
deposits through attracting more international investments in
prospecting, Banbi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The oil sector has to provide the local market with needed oil
products and at the same time to earn revenues to finance the
implementation of the fourth five-year social and economic plan
beginning July 1 this year, Banbi said.
</P>
<P>
The minister was commenting on an OPEC decision made in
Jakarta, Indonesia on Sunday to increase production quota by 10
percent to reach 27.5 million bpd over a six-month period starting
next January.
</P>
<P>
This was the first major production hike of the organization in
four years, setting off fears across the board that oil prices
might be depressed as a result.
</P>
<P>
But Banbi said Egypt supports the OPEC decision which is
"sound" and will not lead to an ease in crude prices in the world
market. The output rise came with the winter season, when
consumption jumps in Europe, the U.S. and Japan, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister hoped the OPEC members, which account for 40
percent of the world's total oil production, would abide by their
respective quotas in order to keep oil prices and avoid
jeopardizing oil earnings of other oil producers.
</P>
<P>
With proven crude reserves amounting to 3.9 billion barrels,
Egypt, a non-OPEC member state, is the fourth largest oil exporter
in Africa which sells about half its output on the international
market.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Cases Down in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of AIDS-infected
people has declined in Cyprus which has one of the lowest
infection rates in the world, an official from Ministry of Health
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the occasion of the International
AIDS Day, Dr. Dora Papantoniou said efforts to combat AIDS will
continue, and the Ministry will keep up with its enlightenment
campaign, which focuses on the young generation and their sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
According to Papantoniou, from 1986 when starting to record
the AIDS cases, until today, 278 people were diagnosed as HIV
positive in Cyprus, of which 162 were Cypriots and the remaining
116 were foreigners. A total of 34 people have died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the infected belong to the 20 to 40 age group.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry announced that no person was diagnosed as
HIV positive in November.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, there has been an increase in people
infected through sexual intercourse, the health official said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the number of Cypriot children infected, which is
this year's International AIDS Day theme, Papantoniou said there
are only two children diagnosed HIV positive on the island.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark today's International AIDS Day, Health
Minister, Christos Solomis, stressed that it is everyone's duty
to protect children.
</P>
<P>
"It is the family's, the school's, society's, and above all
the state's duty to protect children and provide them with the
necessary knowledge to secure their future," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) commemorated here today the World AIDS Day for the 10th
time.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the World AIDS Campaign, which was launched in
June, is "Children Living in a World with AIDS." The 1997 campaign
theme will overlap with that of the 1998 campaign, which will
focus on the concerns of young people (ages 15-24), WHO said in a
press release here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 8 million children under the age of 15 will have lost
their mothers or both parents to AIDS and approximately 1,600
children are infected with HIV every day, according to an
estimation by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report prepared by the Joint United
Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), over 30 million adults and
children are now believed to be living with HIV infection. That
means one in 100 adults in the 15-49 age group are infected with
HIV.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 2.3 million people died of AIDS in 1997, a
50 percent increase over 1996. Nearly half of those deaths were in
women, and 460,000 were in children under 15.

<P>
BONN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A loss of additional 40,000 jobs
in the construction sector in eastern Germany is expected next
year due to continuing overcapacity in the industry and rising
number of foreign workers, according to a top industry official
today.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the sector would at the same time be reduced by 3
percent, Wilhelm Kuechler, vice president of the Federation of the

</P>
<P>
From 1995 to 1998 in the east, according to him, an estimated
100,000 jobs would be lost in the recession-hit construction
industry, which used to be the economic driving force in the area.
</P>
<P>
The extra loss of building jobs in the east is expected to
worsen unemployment in Germany, which is likely to hit a new

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Government Won't Compromise on Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai today declared the
government would not compromise on the land acquisition program
to resettle the landless black majority.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at a press conference that the government's
program will compulsorily acquire five million hectares of land,
most of which is now owned by about 4,000 white commercial
farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said the land reform program is of national significance
which should not be allowed to fail.
</P>
<P>
"It is a program that is at the heart of Zimbabwe's national
and economic development process for which we cannot compromise
any further," he said, adding, "we achieve a smooth land
re-distribution program in a peaceful and coordinated manner."
</P>
<P>
He said those who objected to acquisition of their property
should lodge their complaints to his ministry, in writing by
December 28.
</P>
<P>
The minister said land acquisition must not be regarded as an
end in itself but must be seen as a means to improve the
efficiency of agriculture and contribute to increasing farm
incomes, the eradication of poverty and the promotion of an
economically, socially and environmentally sustainable path for
agricultural development in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the designation of the 1,503 farms countrywide to be
compulsorily acquired was to rectify historically created
imbalances.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the current occupiers are expected to vacate the
designated farms, Kangai said the government would give farmers
enough time to harvest their crops.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that by July or August next year we will have
finished the legal processes and that after August we will start
the allocation," he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- James Gustave Speth,
administrator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
today urged the international community to act quickly to find
effective and substantial ways and means to save future
generations form the epidemic AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of World AIDS Day, December 1, Speth
said the theme for this year's commemoration of World AIDS Day is
"Children Living in a World with AIDS." The epidemic has affected
children in complex and dynamic ways.
</P>
<P>
Speth said children may themselves be infected with HIV,
acquired before, during or after birth, or through later sexual
and other risk-related activity.
</P>
<P>
The administrator said most of the nearly 3 million children
under 15 who have infected since the beginning of the epidemic
have developed HIV-related illness, the majority of whom have
already died. Of the estimated 1 million children who are
currently living with HIV, more than 90 percent live in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said HIV infection among family and community members may
have both immediate and long-term effects upon children. Children
may be withdrawn form school to assume economic or caring
responsibilities within the family, thereby diminishing long-term
employment prospects and, in turn, ultimately increasing
vulnerability to exploitation and abuse, and therefore to HIV
infection.
</P>
<P>
Speth stressed that in many places, the survival of community
is already threatened by the death of so many young adults and
children, and the elderly have been left without support.
</P>
<P>
He said a spectrum of response is urgently required: from
prevention to care, support and treatment, to programs of
assistance to those surviving the death of a family member, to
programs which address the broader social and economic
implications of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Speth said that if the international community do not act
quickly to find and support appropriate ways and means to respond
to this epidemic, the lives of many future generations will be
bleak, anguish and often brutal. The response must be based upon
hope and respect for human dignity, he added.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Stresses Different Democratic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
today underlined that "democratic experiences are different from
one continent to another, from one country to another and from
one community to another."
</P>
<P>
In his opening address at a conference on democracy, civil
society and governance in Africa here, Salim said that he
personally strongly believes that there are fundamental
democratic principles which are universal and are therefore
applicable to all including African societies.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that "the democratic traditions of a
nation are deep-rooted in its history and social experience and
are different from those of another nation even if they are close
to each other."
</P>
<P>
"If France, Great Britain and the USA which do share common
democratic values have different political systems with different
democratic traditions and modalities, we should not expect
African countries to follow the same democratic arrangements."
Salim stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said "democracy is not a concept which is alien to our
societies," adding that "we will be blind to our history if we
think that the issue of democracy and good governance is new and
that it is a phenomenon which has emerged recently with the
demands of the donors and as a necessary condition for effective
implementation of programs of economic reforms in African
countries."
</P>
<P>
"The anti-colonial struggle of the African peoples for freedom
and dignity was basically a struggle for human and people's
right," Salim point out.
</P>
<P>
He added, "put differently, colonialism and racial oppression
was in theory and practice anti-democratic."
</P>
<P>
"The struggle for freedom and self determination was a
struggle for democracy and good governance as a prelude to
socio-economic development," Salim noted.
</P>
<P>
African politicians, civil servants, researchers and leaders
of professional associations, non-governmental organizations and
civil society groups are attending the four-day conference.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin Welcomed to Mexico City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin was warmly greeted here today by his Mexican counterpart, E.
Zedillo, with both leaders pledging to further ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
A grand ceremony was held to welcome President Jiang at
downtown Campo Marte where red carpets were rolled down, the two
countries' national anthems played and the guard of honor was
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang arrived here Sunday night after an overnight
stopover at Cancun, Mexico's southeastern coastal city. He came
over here from a four-day state visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
He is returning a visit to the trip to China by President
Zedillo a year ago amid signs of closer relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
President Zedillo said at the ceremony that Jiang's visit has
provided an important opportunity for both sides to further
develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that my talks with President Jiang Zemin will
contribute to better economic and friendly relations between our
two countries," Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Mexico and China share the idea of developing
economy and striving for better and closer ties.
</P>
<P>
On his part, President Jiang said that his current visit is
designed to deepen mutual understanding, promote friendship, look
forward to the future and develop cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he will discuss with President Zedillo bilateral
relations and major international issues in a joint effort to
establish ties of cooperation for the next century.
</P>
<P>
"Today both countries are facing the same task of safeguarding
sovereignty, developing national economy and striving for overall
social progress and country modernization," jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that this has laid a solid foundation for better
relations between the two governments and two peoples.
</P>
<P>
China and Mexico established diplomatic relations in 1972 and
bilateral trade grew to 539 million U.S. dollars in 1996 and is
expected to reach 700 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from high-level exchanges, cooperation in science and
technology, culture, law and the military have also born fruits
over the past 25 years and the two sides hold identical or similar
views on many major international issues, the Chinese president
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that his current visit will give a new
push to the development of cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are scheduled to begin their formal meeting
this morning. They are also expected to attend a signing ceremony
at which four agreements on consulate affairs, sports, academic
exchange and agriculture will be inked today.

<HEADLINE> Botswana, Namibia Discuss Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Botswana and Namibian
officials today agreed to set up a joint commission to decide on
a controversial island between their countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a joint meeting held in Katima
Mulilo, capital town of Caprivi Province in Namibia, local press
reported.
</P>
<P>
This follows failure by the two sides to determine ownership
of Situngu Island in Namibia's Eastern Caprivi Province, which
borders Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The meeting brought together officials from the Caprivi
Regional Council and from Botswana's Kasane district.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission will work on boundaries of the tiny
island on the Chobe and Linyati rivers, said John Mabuku,
governor of Caprivi provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Ile said the two sides have also agreed the Botswana defense
force should stop patrolling Situngu and disturbing farmers
cultivating the land.
</P>
<P>
Namibian residents living along the Chobe river opposite the
island have also been asked to report any troop movements to the
Botswana authorities.
</P>
<P>
The 60-kilometer-long island is larger than Kasikili, which
both Botswana and Namibia claim. The case awaits a decision from
the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Last month, farmers from Singobeka in the Caprivi region, who
set up a cattle post and cultivated land on Situngu island, were
ordered to leave by members of the Botswana defense force.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet Jordanian PM in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat is to meet Jordanian
Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali in Ramallah Tuesday, a PNA
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
PNA's Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim said in Gaza today that
Arafat and Majali would discuss Palestinian-Jordanian relations
and the latest political developments of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Topping the agenda is their discussions on the decision made by
the Israeli government Sunday to defer its second-stage troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet on Sunday approved in principle to carry
out the second-phrase redeployment, but would delay its
implementation until a ministerial panel draws up a map of Israeli
interests in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also conditioned the redeployment on PNA's
fulfillment of commitments to fight terrorism, amend the
Palestinian Covenant and reduce the size of Palestinian police
force.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision has drawn criticism from the PNA, and
Arafat has dismissed it as an attempt to avoid implementing the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron accord and its attachments, Israel should have
completed the first and second of the three-phase pullouts by
early September this year, but Israel has postponed the
redeployments due to the dispute over the scope.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has begun a campaign to soliciting
international support to its decision on the redeployment, whose
extent and timetable will be determined by the ministerial
committee headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, Foreign Ministry's Director-General
Eitan Bentsur was dispatched to Cairo Sunday to brief Egyptian
leaders on Israel's decision on further redeployment. Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh and Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Uzi Arad
also traveled to Cairo today to meet with Osama al-Baz, adviser to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
as criticizing the Israeli decision for "creating complications"
because it did not answer the Palestinian aspirations.
</P>
<P>
Like Egypt, Jordan has also been a major Arab mediator in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Israel is also expected
to try hard to win Jordan's understanding.

<HEADLINE> US Supports Closer EU Ties with Turkey, Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States supports
strengthened relations between the European Union (EU) and Turkey,
while fully backing Cyprus' accession to the EU, a U.S. diplomat
said here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus, Kenneth Brill, told reporters after
a meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides that it has been
a long-standing American government policy to support the
strongest possible relationship between Europe and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, Turkey is part of Europe, it's part of the
institutions in which we are a partner with Europe, and that
includes NATO, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE)," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the diplomat said, "It has also been
long-standing U.S. policy to support Cypriot accession to the
EU. We have been working on that consistently."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in 1990. The EU has
decided to start accession talks with Cyprus in spring next year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the European Council summit, which will take
place between December 12-13 in Luxembourg, Brill said it is an
important venue for the Europeans to consider the next steps for
their relationship with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it is obviously an important occasion as regards
the next steps for Cypriot accession, he stressed, adding that it
is important that both of these things move forward.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his views, Brill said that "for the American
strategic perspective and for the European strategic perspective,
it is important that the EU and Turkey have close cooperative
relations." He stressed that this "has nothing to do with Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"We are in a transitional period right now, when these
institutions are moving from the period of the Cold War to the
period of the 21st century. We think that part of that process
should be a deepening of the relationship with Turkey and the
inclusion of Cyprus as part of the EU," he added.

<HEADLINE> HIV Epidemic Far Worse Than Previously Thought: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A new report released
jointly today by the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS)
and the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that infection with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is far common than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
The report said over 30 million adults and children are now
believed to be living with HIV infection -- one in every 100
sexually active adults worldwide -- and if the current
transmission rate holds steady, by the year 2000 the number of
people living with HIV/AIDS will soar to 40 million.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS and WHO now estimate that 5.8 million people were
infected in 1997, at a rate of 16,000 new infections every day.
This includes 590,000 new infections among children, bringing the
total number of children under the age of 15 currently living with
HIV/AIDS to 1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
Because 90 percent of people with HIV live in the developing
countries, where there are few facilities for voluntary testing
and counseling, the UNAIDS estimates conservatively that nine out
of 10 HIV-positive people have no idea they are infected.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 2.3 million people died of AIDS in 1997, a
5 percent increase over 1996. Nearly half of those deaths were in
women, and 460,000 were in children under 15.

week under a phased program to reduce the number of the west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) as stipulated by the Abuja
peace accord, the ECOMOG chief said here today.
</P>
<P>
"A ship is already in Monrovia and it will be joined by
another vessel to bring back personnel and materials," said
ECOMOG force commander Major-general Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has some 6,000 troops in ECOMOG, currently estimated
at 11,000-strong from 10 of the 16 countries that make up the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, a ship has already brought back
non-essential materials of the Nigerian contingent ahead of this
week's pullout.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja accord, which ended Liberia's seven-year-old bloody
civil war, provides for gradual pullout of ECOMOG troops, first
sent to that country in August 1990 to help stop the conflict
started by former warlord Charles Taylor in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement also allows ECOMOG troops to stay in
Liberia for another six months after the elected government was
put in place to help restructure and train the armed forces of
the country.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, Taylor, who was sworn in as president last
August, announced his government intended to re-build the
post-war army by itself, warning that the government would expell
anyone in the high command of ECOMOG that attempted to challenge
or share the constitutional power of the president.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he did not expect anyone in ECOMOG to overstep his
authority and remain in Liberia, adding: "there cannot and will
not be a parallel authority."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that he would not allow ECOMOG to use
Liberia's land as a base for attack the military junta in Sierra
Leone that seized power in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The disagreement between the Liberian government and ECOMOG
has called the attention of ECOWAS chairman, Nigeria's head of
state general Sani Abacha and other west African leaders.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have reportedly taken moves to seek reconciliation
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Last week, some 3,000 Nigerian residents in Liberia returned home,
allegedly to flee the harassment and humiliation from the Liberian
security personnel.
</P>
<P>
However, Malu said the thinning out of the Nigerian contingent
had nothing to do with the reported friction between ECOMOG and
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
"The troops' movement is in line with the ECOWAS peace plan on
Liberia," he stated.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, Benin had also indicated its desire to draw
back its troops from Liberia before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has recently recalled some of its troops under a
rotation plan but sent less to join ECOMOG there.
</P>
<P>
But Malu did not explain why so many Nigerians went back from
Liberia at one time.
</P>
<P>
The ECONMOG commander is in Lagos on his way from Sierra Leone
where he joined the ECOWAS delegation in talks with the junta on
the restoration of ousted civilian government in April next year.
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports, the talks held last week
ended in deadlock.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Up on Steady Asian Markets, Firmer Dow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
extended their early gains today and finished sharply higher,
boosted by Asian markets' rise, Wall Street's opening rally and a
stronger dollar.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London ended sharply higher, sending the FTSE
100 index back above the 4,900-point level to end 90.00 points up
at 4,921.8.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street provided the main driving force as the Dow raced
ahead following a weaker-than-expected economic report.
</P>
<P>
The latest UK purchasing managers' poll showed that growth in
the manufacturing sector hit a seven-month high.
</P>
<P>
Economists said they would not expect a rate hike on the back
of the figures.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index in Frankfurt also surged sharply, breaching
the key 4,000-point level which was last seen a month ago, to
close at 4,068.05, up 118.91 points or 3.01 percent, also boosted
by a firmer dollar, Wall Street gains and stability in Asian
markets.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, French shares finished the session with
strong gains, with the CAC-40 index ending up 59.29 points at
2,918.48.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's rise against the franc and relatively calm Asian
markets all cheered the market. The Bank of France left its key
intervention rate on hold at 3.30 percent, as expected.

<HEADLINE> Hekmatyar Calls for Free Elections to End Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Afghan ousted Prime Minister and
Islamic Party leader Golbuddin Hekmatyar today called for free
elections in Afghanistan to end the ongoing civil war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a session of Afghan religious, political and
military figures in Iran's central city of Isfahan, Hekmatyar
said that the solution to the ongoing Afghan crisis lies in the
convention of free elections and formation of a non-coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that such mechanisms as formation of a coalition
government, supreme council system and merger of northern and
southern fronts are not suitable strategies to the Afghan
intricacy, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar noted that invitation of the factions to the
negotiation table, permanent halt of war, unconditional release of
all prisoners of war (POWs) and agreement on formation of a
temporary non-coalition government comprised of personalities
approved by all serve as preliminaries to arrangement of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's neighbors can help solve the Afghan crisis
through organization of peace conferences and encouragement of the
groups under their influence to bow to holding talks instead of
involvement in war and prevent offering financial and military
assistance to them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the 8th summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference due to be held in Tehran on December 9-11 to seek a
practical solution to the ongoing war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, head of the Afghan Ministry of Religious Guidance,
Endowment and the Hajj Khodadad Erfani announced last month that
the Afghan anti-Taliban coalition forces would form a
"broad-based" national transition government within one month
under the leadership of Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new provisional government would rule only
for nine months until a permanent government was elected by
the people.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan capital of Kabul was captured by Taliban forces in
September last year, but the Taliban regime in Kabul has not
been recognized by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Iran, Afghanistan's neighbor, still consider Rabbani's
government as legal. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi at
the session today also called for the formation of a "broad-based"
government in Afghanistan in order to restore peace in the
war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Stresses UN Firm Commitment in Supporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today reiterated the firm commitment of the United
Nations in supporting the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion to commemorate the International Day
of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, November 29, Annan said
that since the General Assembly of the United Nations decided on
November 29, 1947 to partition Palestine, the United Nations has
been deeply involved in the search for an equitable and peaceful
settlement of this issue.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said the resources of the entire United
Nations family has been mobilized to provide humanitarian and
development assistance, and he pledged to continue these efforts.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said the commemorative event provides an
opportunity to remind the international community that the
question of Palestine, which lies at the center of the
Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East, remains unresolved
despite the many efforts over the years and the undeniable
achievements of the peace process which began at Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that with the signing of the historic Declaration of
Principles on September 13, 1993 and subsequent agreements known
as the Oslo process, Israelis and Palestinians embarked on the
road to mutual reconciliation and negotiated peace. Their courage
must be commended, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said it was reassuring that earlier this year, after a
lengthy delay, the protocol concerning the redeployment in Hebron
was signed. It is now of the utmost to prevent those achievements
from dissipating, and to build on them to fulfill the hopes of all
the peoples of the region for a future of peace, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that regrettably, developments since then have
sparked concern that the peace process is in jeopardy, thus he
appealed to the parties to intensify their efforts to overcome the
obstacles that stand in the way of a speedy return to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent deliberations in the Security Council and
the General Assembly have highlighted the fundamental importance
of respect for the provisions of international law and of full
implementation of the agreements already reached.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed it is also an apparent and urgent need to make
tangible progress towards a comprehensive, just and lasting
settlement based on relevant Security Council resolutions. The
promotion of social and economic development and of cooperative
relationships throughout the region is essential to create an
environmental favorable to a lasting peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said the United Nations will continue to
attach the utmost importance to improving the living conditions in
the Palestinian territories as an essential accompaniment to the
peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Fight Againsy AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, Decemebr 1 (Xinhua)-- Ethiopians today were urged
to unite to fight against the killer disease AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting held here to observe this year's World
Aids campaign which falls on Decemebr 1, 1997, Aberra Kume, head
of Addis Ababa regional health bureau, said that AIDS most often
attacks young adults whose death in their most productive years
of life certainly affect the overall social and economic
development of a country.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is no known cure for AIDS, we can definitely
reduce the risk of contracting HIV infections through several
mechanisms which include, among others, avoiding sexual contact
with multiple partners and the promotion of condom use." he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Ethiopian ministry of health in
collaboration with other governmental organizations and
non-governmental organizations is exerting utmost efforts to
bring about behavioural change among the society particularly the
youth in the fight against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Wedson Mwambazi, representative of
the World Health Organization (WHO) in Ethiopia, said that
"previously AIDS was thought to be the disease of adult men and
women." But he added that "nowadays it is also becoming a disease
of innocent infants."
</P>
<P>
Students drawn from various schools in the metropolis
presented songs, dramas and other literary works at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
This year's World AIDS campaign is observed throughout the
world under the theme "children living in the world with AIDS"
</P>
<P>
A total of 19.433 AIDS cases were reported in Ethiopia in July
1995. However, the actual number of AIDS patients was estimated
by the Ethiopian health ministry to be 350,000. In 1996, the
number of people infected with the HIV virus was estimated to be
1,17 million. Enditiem

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Can't Dictate to ECOWAS, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian general today
rejected the call of Sierra Leone's military junta for the
exclusion of Nigerian troops from the west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) in that country.
</P>
<P>
The junta cannot dictate to the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) troops to be used for the implementation
of a peace plan on Sierra Leone, said ECOMOG force commander
Major-general Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
Pressure, especially military pressure, would be tightened to
force the junta to see the situation with reason, he added.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is mandated by ECOWAS to enforce a sub-regional
sanction against the junta, which has been endorsed by the United
Nations, to force it to hand over power to the civilian
government it overthrew in a coup on May 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace plan signed in October in Conakry,
Guinea, the military regime agrees to step down in April 1998
under the supervision of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
But the junta has kept demanding Nigerian troops be excluded
from the disarming of Sierra Leonean combatants and opposes to
the dominance of Nigerian soldiers in ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
In an official reaction, Malu said the demand was untenable.
</P>
<P>
"If you remove nigerian troops from ECOMOG, which country in
the sub-region will replace them?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has some 6,000 troops in ECOMOG, currently estimated
at 11,000-strong from 10 of the 16 countries that make up ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, a similar demand was made by a Liberian
faction during the implementation of that country's peace plan by
ECOWAS, but eventually those behind the suggestion saw the
futility of their demand.
</P>
<P>
He said it was in the interest of the Freetown military
government for ECOWAS to implement the Conakry peace accord,
which provides for a ceasefire, disarmament and demobilization of
combatants ahead of reinstatement of the ousted government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Jesse
Jackson today said that the new Africa-U.S. relationship is early
in the morning, that is, "a partnership, mutual beneficial trade
relations".
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here this evening, Jackson, U.S.
President Bill Clinton's special envoy for democracy in Africa,
noted that "Africa is a strategic trade partner (of the United
States) for the future."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Albright was
scheduled to visit some African countries this month and
disclosed that President Clinton would pay a visit to Africa in
some time of next year.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy said that his country is importing much oil
from African continent, slightly more than from the Middle East,
adding that Africa's potential as a trading partner and "a
strategic trade ally is enormous".
</P>
<P>
Referring to reforms carried out by Kenya in the past several
years, Jackson stated that "political and economic positive steps
are in the right direction".
</P>
<P>
"Reforms of last three months are heartening", said Jackson,
adding that freedom of assembly and freedom of protest are
hopeful in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the December 29 General Election in Kenya, he
emphasized that Kenya needs "world-class elections in order to
restore its credibility and attract foreign investors."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "if Kenya has a world-class election on
December 29 -- open, free, fair, visible ballot boxes, no
violence -- it will send a signal for the better."
</P>
<P>
Jackson pointed out that there is a deep interest and hope in
Kenya's General Election at the highest levels of the United
States government when he arrived here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. had a growing confidence that Kenya
was on the path to full democracy, adding that "the U.S. has been
favorably impressed by the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group
process."
</P>
<P>
"My government is pleased by the recent decision to register
parties such as Safina", Jackson said, "the move is a clear
indication that free association is a reality in Kenya."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi today held talks with Jackson
and the visiting U.S. special envoy also met with some leaders of
Kenya's opposition parties.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Raising of Iraqi Oil Export Amount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to the Security Council the raising
of the Iraqi oil export amount so that Iraq can buy more supplies
for its people, UN spokesman Eckhard Fred told reporters in
today's noon brief.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman did not provide a figure of how much the
secretary-general had proposed to increase.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan said the 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil that Iraq is currently allowed
to sell over every six months to buy food and medicine for its
people is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, under
sanctions since 1990, are urgent, drawing on surveys showing that
children are underfed and underweight and life expectancy is
dropping among adults.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report of the U.N. Children'd Fund, the
one-year oil-for-food program has not made an appreciable dent in
the well-being of infants under five years of age.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which was started to implement last
December, allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil every
six months to purchase humanitarian supplies under strict UN
supervision with contracts approved by a Security Council's
sanctions committee.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy to Discuss Accession Talks with Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Commissioner of the
European Union (EU) for External Affairs Hans Van den Broek
arrived in Cyprus today to discuss with the government and the
Turkish Cypriots on the country's accession talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, Van den Broek said that EU members
and the European Commission have attached great importance to
seeking ways the Turkish Cypriots are represented in the entry
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We all hope obviously that the membership (of Cyprus in the
EU) will benefit both communities of the island," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island, submitted in 1990 its
application to the European Union for full membership, and the two
sides will begin to negotiate the issue early next year.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish Cypriots have opposed the decision, and walked
out of the negotiations with the government to resolve the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has proposed the Turkish Cypriots join
the delegation for the entry talks.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek came here one week before an EU summit, which is
believed to discuss the enlargement issue concerning Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is not optimistic that the way of participation
by the Turkish Cypriot can be formulated during his two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and a Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third of the island following a
failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> No-Confidence Motion Against Netanyahu Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel Knesset (Parliament)
today rejected a motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu by a vote of 50 to 45.
</P>
<P>
The motion was tabled by the left wing party Meretz, which
charged that Netanyahu has failed in advancing the Oslo peace
process and there was nothing new in the government decision on
the further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid said that " there are no negotiations
and no peace. Meretz will only support steps which has already
agreed on with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the
U.S. Administration. Unilateral Steps by the Israeli government
are not for real peace and have no chance."
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU to Play Larger Role in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Envoy to
the Middle East Miguel Angel Moratinos said today that the
EU will announce its new Middle East policy at next month's
European summit aimed at further strengthening its role in the
deadlocked peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, he
told the news conference that EU enjoys a common viewpoint
with Lebanon which stresses the importance of a stronger and
larger role played by EU in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the objective of his visit to Lebanon, the second
in less than one month, is to make preparations for the summit in
which some change will be made to the European traditional Middle
East policy.
</P>
<P>
"The EU role in the Middle East should be presented in
politics, culture and economic fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the EU and the U.S. roles are
complementary. The parties concerned in the peace talks
simultaneously demand the U.S. mediation as well as the EU's.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos who arrived in Lebanon on Sunday for a two-day visit,
also held talks with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berry.

<HEADLINE> German Envoy: Presence in Chinese Market Vital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's ambassador to China
Konrad Seitz has said that a strong market position in China is
vital for German large companies to keep their global
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German General Anzeiger newspaper
today, Seitz said that China has already become the largest market
in the world for many industrial products, in particular capital
goods.
</P>
<P>
Taking power plants as an example, Seitz said the demand in
China alone already amounts to 25 percent of the world total. The
annual Chinese demand for the digital telephone exchange systems
is also larger than the combined demand in western Europe and
North America, he added.
</P>
<P>
For German transnational companies like the electronics giant
Siemens, a strong market position in China will help to reduce the
unit development costs of their products and will hence enhance
their competitiveness even on the European market, Seitz noted.
</P>
<P>
As a major success achieved by German companies in China, Seitz
referred to Volkswagen AG, which has invested 3.4 billion marks
(1.9 billion U.S. dollars) in China so far and has managed to
boost its market share in the country to over 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
This represents an unbelievable comeback for Volkswagen when
compared with its dwindling market shares in Asia forced by the
Japanese competitors in the 1960s and 1970s, Seitz said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the problem that small- and medium-sized German
companies are reluctant to take risks in China, the German
ambassador pointed to the reality that many smaller German
companies do perform successfully in China currently and it is
often true that they can do business there much easier than large
companies.
</P>
<P>
Seitz also dismissed the notion that the China-bound massive
investment is taking numerous jobs out of Germany, saying that by
setting up factories in China, German companies can boost the
exports of German-made machines and supplies parts, which means
more jobs at home.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FTC Revises Interpretation of "Made in USA" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Under the high pressure from
the Congress and labor groups, the Federal Trade Commission(FTC)
decided today that products bearing the "Made in USA" label must
be produced almost entirely with U.S. labor and materials.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. commission proposed in May that companies could use
the "Made in USA" label if a product had more than a small amount
of foreign content and labor. Under that proposal, merchandise
with as little as 75 percent U.S. parts would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
The FTC suggested that easing the standard would give the
country's enterprises the flexibility to compete worldwide while
ensuring consumers were not deceived.
</P>
<P>
However, the suggestion was strongly rejected by government
officials and organized labor. They argued it would encourage
corporations to send jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
The attorneys general of 16 states jointly asked that the "Made
in USA" label be allowed only on products with at least 90 percent
U.S. content.
</P>
<P>
The FTC also said most of more than 1,000 written comments it
has received since May strongly supported the current 50-year-old
standard. The FTC voted 4-0 today to continue requiring that
claims of U.S. origin be substantiated by evidence that a product
is "all or virtually all" made in this country.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after two years of study, including a
two-day public workshop and requests for public comment.
</P>
<P>
The FTC said that although there is no "bright line" to
establish when a product is "all or virtually all" made in the
United States, it would consider several factors.
</P>
<P>
These include first, "the final assembly or processing of the
product must take place in the United States". Other factors will
be the portion of the product's total manufacturing costs that are
attributable to U.S. parts and processing and how far removed from
the finished product any foreign content is.
</P>
<P>
In a policy statement to be published Tuesday in the Federal
Register, the commission said that when a "marketer makes an
unqualified claim that a product is "Made in USA," it should...
possess and rely upon a reasonable basis that the product is in
fact all or virtually all made in the United States."
</P>
<P>
The standard applies to all products advertized or sold in the
United States except for those governed by specific legislation.
For instance, country-of-origin labeling of clothing is generally
governed by the Textile Act.
</P>
<P>
Marketers will continue to make qualified U.S. origin claims,
such as "Made in USA of U.S. and imported parts" and "80% Made in
USA," as well as claims about specific processes or parts and
comparative claims.

<P>
OTTAWA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 0.2 percent in September following a pause in August,
Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Combined with a strong gain in July, this raised production 1.2
percent in the third quarter, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Robust wholesale trade, which rose 1.9 percent, accounted for a
large portion of the GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing and wholesaling accounted for about 45 percent of
the overall gain for a third consecutive quarter, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of machinery and equipment, notably computers and
software packages, remained high in September.
</P>
<P>
Sales of grain, beverages, drug and tobacco products and
construction materials also contributed significantly to the
advance, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Talks to Arafat Over Phone on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today told Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat that Israel's decision to pull back troops
from the West Bank is an "opportunity" for pushing the peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
The decision is "an opportunity to promote the peace process,"
said Netanyahu while Arafat on the plan over telephone, according
to a statement issued by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone call to Arafat, Netanyahu asserted that
"following the consolidation of the cabinet decision on this
matter, it is important that the two sides speak to each other in
order to make progress in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the call after his cabinet approved Sunday in
principle to carry out the second of the three-phase troop
redeployments stipulated under the Hebron accords signed last
January. But the cabinet did not spell out the extent and
timetable for implementing the pullout, adding the details would
be determined by a ministerial panel headed by Netanyahu and
includes ministers of foreign affairs, defense and national
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government also conditioned the implementation of the
second redeployment on the PNA's fulfillment of its commitments,
including fighting terrorism, amending the Palestinian Covenant
and reducing the size of Palestinian police forces.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision to further defer the second redeployment,
which should have been finished in early September, drew strong
criticism from the PNA. Arafat told a Fatah meeting Sunday night
that the Israeli decision was an attempt to avoid implementing
the signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat dismissed the decision as
"being too vague, too little and much too late."

<HEADLINE> Blair Sets up Commission to Reform Voting System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair today ordered the forming of a commission to prepare for a
referendum on replacing first-past-the-post system with
proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
An Electoral Reform Commission will be set up to decide on an
alternative system for electing the lower House of Commons which
would be pitted against first-past-the-post in the plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
The commission has one year to produce a "proportional" system,
which would be more fair to small political parties.
</P>
<P>
The commission's terms of reference require it to "observe the
requirement for broad proportionality," Interior Minister Jack
Straw said in answer to a parliamentary question.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be chaired by Lord Roy Jenkins, a former
European Union Commission President, who has just stepped down
from the leadership of the Liberal Democrats in the upper House of
Lords.
</P>
<P>
But Blair's official spokesman said the prime minister remained
personally "unpersuaded" of the case for proportional
representation.
</P>
<P>
"We will take a view on how to respond to the commission's
recommendation when it is made," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Youths Play with Sex Despite Known </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Although many young people in
Nigeria are aware that having unprotected sexual intercourse
could expose them to sexually-transmitted diseases and AIDS or
could result in unwanted pregnancy, they still engage in unsafe
sex.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion of a survey by the Society for Family
Health (SFFH) in six of the 36 states across the country on the
eve of the second World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
According to Zacch Akinyemi, AFFH's research and communication
manager, the respondents of the survey said they had to engage in
sex for sexual pleasure and financial gains.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted among adolescents aged between 13 and 19
years, also revealed that most of youths still believed they
could not contract AIDS even if they engaged in unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
"Many think unsafe sex can be equated with unprotected sex,
while still many others do not believe pregnancy can occur at the
first sexual encounter," he said, quoted by the News Agency of
Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, more than 70 percent of the 2,256 youths
interviewed got their knowledge about adolescent sexuality from
their peers, mothers, television, the media and siblings, in that
order.
</P>
<P>
The study further showed that the age for being initiated into
sex had fallen from around 16 to 14 years, Akinyemi said, adding
that till around 19 years, more boys were sexually experienced
than girls generally.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, most youths use contraceptives only
when they have casual relationships and the number of partners
maintained by each youth ranges from one to 25.
</P>
<P>
More than one fifth of girls interviewed have had at least one
pregnancy terminated although it could be argued that some
reported miscarriages could in fact be induced abortion, the
research manager said.
</P>
<P>
For suggestions on how to redress the situation, the youths
said parents should be educated to answer all their children's
questions on sexuality while a newsletter on the research
findings could be established to advise parents on how to go
about this.
</P>
<P>
The youths called for drama and television shows to X-ray the
problems of unwanted pregnancy and unsafe sex, while counsellors
should be appointed from their peers who are sexually
experienced.
</P>
<P>
The respondents said condom should be made available and
accessible, booklets on sexuality provided free, educational
programs should employ sexually-active persons to deal with
youths insecurities.
</P>
<P>
The youths agreed that making public, the high percentage of
abortion among teenagers could make positive change.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Still Rejects UNSCOM Inspection of Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf today reiterated Iraq's stance that it
would not allow U.N. weapon inspectors to enter any Iraqi
presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said at a news conference that "all presidential sites
enjoy the diplomatic immunity and cannot be inspected. They have
nothing to do with the mission of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said Iraq's invitation to teams from
countries with representation in the U.N. Security Council and
the special commission to visit the presidential sites "stand
sound and valid" and can be implemented at any moment.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf criticized the United States for manipulating the
UNSCOM, saying that "the Americans have to be made to realize
that the special commission is no longer a political tool in
their hands."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Security Council to recompose the special
commission in a balanced way "exactly as Iraq has suggested."
</P>
<P>
Iraq required in early November that the permanent members of
the Security Council send equal numbers of staffs to the special
commission to avoid the domination by a single country.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring an early end to the U.N. sanctions, the
Iraqi Revolution Command Council decided on November 26 to invite
representatives from the 20 countries that take part in the
U.N. inspection teams and experts or diplomats from the 15
U.N. Security Council members to inspect sites in Iraq under
suspicion of hiding weapons of mass destruction, like chemical or
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has so far not allowed U.N. arms inspection teams to
enter its presidential sites.

<HEADLINE> U.S., World Bank to Back Rescue Program for South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) --The United States and the
World Bank said today they would join a rescue package for South
Korea under the right conditions, but declined to reveal how much
money they could offer.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President Bill Clinton told reporters he was willing
to offer U.S. funds for the effort if Seoul reached an agreement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that included tough
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"I favor a strong agreement with the IMF that would actually
restore financial stability and confidence in South Korea,"
Clinton said. "If such an agreement could be made, then I would
favor the United States participating."
</P>
<P>
Clinton avoided answering questions about how much aid the
United States might contribute to an IMF-led aid package. Korean
media reports suggested the United States and Japan might
contribute in a total of 20 billion U.S. dollars to an overall 55
billion dollar aid package.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank spokesman Graham Barrett expressed
today that the bank had also been approached for help and expected
to join the rescue deal.
</P>
<P>
"We want this to be a substantial contribution, and a quick
one," he said. "We are working very intensively with the (South
Korean) government and the IMF, as the lead institution on this
issue."
</P>
<P>
It was reported the international bail-out package for South
Korea might be for a record-breaking 55 billion dollars, even
bigger than the rescue program for Mexico which was totaling some
50 billion dollars in 1995 and much bigger than Indonesia's 40
billion dollar deal. The United States, the main figure in the
1995 Mexico bailout, contributed 3 billion dollars to the
Indonesian rescue deal.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Protect Us Against HIV/AIDS," Cry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian children appealed to
the society for their protection against HIV/AIDS and demanded to
live in circumstances without the deadly epidemic.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony held in the five-star Pomodzi Hotel in the
capital this evening to release the book HIV/AIDS in Zambia
compiled by Ministry of Health and Central Board of Health,
dozens of Zambian children made performances to express their
concern over the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
They asked their fathers and mothers not to leave them as
orphans and begged the responsible politicians to take effective
measures to protect them.
</P>
<P>
"Fathers, mothers and politicians, please protect us and save
us. We want parents! We don't want HIV/AIDS!" cried one
eight-year old boy during a performance, which aroused warm
applause as well as tears among several hundred adult audiences.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, which is designed to commemorate the 1997 World
AIDS Day, attracted several Zambian political elites including
Finance Minister Ronald Panza, Health Minister Katele Kalumba as
well as visiting U.S. congressman Elijah Cummings.
</P>
<P>
In a moving speech, Cummings called on the Zambians to behave
themselves and look after their children carefully in order to
prevent the "innocent and vulnerable group" from falling victims
of the horrible disease.
</P>
<P>
"We must be one in protecting the children," the black
congressman shouted with his fist raised in the air and tears
rolling down his face.
</P>
<P>
In their separate speeches, both Panza and Kalumba stressed
the urgent need and expressed the Zambian government's unwavering
determination to fight against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS is a social, economic, political as well as cultural
problem, which, if not be contained, will certainly neutralize
the country's efforts to develop its economy and to eradicate its
general poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to the book released this evening, Zambia is
undergoing one of the worst HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world and
20 percent of the adults have been infected with HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The book graphically pointed out the serious consequence of
AIDS deaths to men and women in their childrearing ages. That is
the increase in the number of orphans.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the number of maternal and double orphans in
Zambia would rise quickly from 20,000 in 1990 to over 500,000 in
2000 and to more than one million in 2010, which will become a
serious social problem and place a heavy burden on the future
governments.

LAGOS, december 1 (Xinhua) -- The press and cultural cousellor

are being harassed in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Counsellor J. Sabato-wiah was quoted by the News Agency of

reportedly fled harassment and humiliation from security

</P>
<P>
Sabato-wiah said the people who did not want good relations

arrests of a few Nigerians staying illegally in Liberia to
forment trouble.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Liberians could not forget so soon Nigeria's
contribution to the resolution of the Liberian crisis, the envoy
restated his government's assurance to foreigners that the
country was open to anybody wishing to conduct legitimate
business there.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Egypt Goes All Out to Support Tourism  (by Hou Jia) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has reduced air fares,
scrapped entry fees and beefed up security in an all-out campaign
to buoy up the flagging tourism stricken by a recent terrorist
attack on foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir, the national carrier, halved the price tags of all
domestic flights while the Ministry of Transport and
Communications removed dues on landing or take-off at Egyptian
airports and berthing at its ports.
</P>
<P>
The series of decisions were reviewed by Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri and several cabinet ministers who met today to weigh
the negative effects of the November 17 massacre of foreign
tourists in the southern Egyptian attraction of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Information Minister Safwat al-Sherif
told reporters that Egypt will cancel all additional dues imposed
by local administrations on visits to tourist areas and any other
tourist activities.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, is making intensive
diplomatic efforts at embassy and consulate levels to capitalize
on "international understanding of the truth of the phenomenon of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The government advised private tourist and hotel companies to
go ahead with their promotion and marketing and refrain from doing
anything untoward. Today's ministers' meeting warned of license
withdrawal for those who try to lay off employees or manipulate
prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank, in a report on supporting and
easing the burden of the tourism sector, said Egyptian banks have
agreed to continue financing tourist projects and to defer for
three months the payment of installments owed by tourist
establishments and projects.
</P>
<P>
These measures have came hand in hand with a tougher and
comprehensive security plan on the heels of the carnage in Luxor,
about 500 kilometers south of Cairo, where six gunmen in black
police uniforms shot dead 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians
before they were gunned down by the police.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, Egypt has carried out a massive
reshuffle in the security and police forces, reportedly involving
some 300 people, to shore up people's morale.
</P>
<P>
Within two days in office, the new interior minister, Habib Al
Adly, unveiled a "water-tight" security plan enlisting the help of
the military in maintaining security in tourist sites and
administering tougher penalties on abuses of police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Admitting a security slip-up in Luxor, President Hosni Mubarak
said accused foreign governments of giving shelter to fugitive
Egyptian militants and in fact encouraging their operations in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The government on November 27 issued a list of 14 leading
Egyptian Islamic militants allegedly masterminding violent acts
and urged the international community to work collectively to deny
them any safe haven.
</P>
<P>
The appalling killing of foreign tourists dealt a severe blow
to Egypt's lucrative tourism industry, wiping out the hope to
attract up to 4 million visitors this year. Thousands of
foreigners have canceled their trips after the Luxor slayings, the
worst in the country for years.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become a 3.5-billion-dollar-per-year industry and
one of the main supports of the country's economy. Statistics show
every foreign tourist spends an averaged 1,000 dollars in Egypt
and brings about job opportunities for four Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
With much fewer foreign arrivals, tourism revenues are
estimated by experts to dwindle by some 2 billion dollars next
year, eventually snowballing to shave off some 6 billion dollars
from the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Hard hurt will be those 5-8 million Egyptians directly or
indirectly employed in the tourism sector as job opportunities
have been scarce in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Moves Up in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. construction
spending picked up by 0.1 percent in October, the fourth
consecutive month without a decline, the Commerce Department said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The increase to a record high seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 605.5 billion U.S. dollars came in the wake of a 0.4 percent
advance in September, the department noted.
</P>
<P>
The growth in October was led by a 0.7 percent increase in
residential construction to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
265.6 billion dollars. Single-family construction rose 1.1 percent
to an all-time high while apartment building shot up 5.7 percent
to the highest level in nearly 10 years. But remodeling spending
declined.
</P>
<P>
Government construction increased 0.6 percent to a rate of
139.1 billion dollars. The growth was contributed by public
housing and redevelopment, schools, hospitals and at military
bases offset declines in spending on government offices, streets
and highways and water supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
Non-residential commercial construction fell 1.2 percent, which
representing the third monthly drop in a row, to a rate of 160.7
billion dollars. A decline in spending at factories, private
hospitals and hotels and motels more than offset gains for
offices, private schools and churches.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Egypt Goes All Out to Support Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has reduced air fares,
scrapped entry fees and beefed up security in an all-out campaign
to buoy up the flagging tourism stricken by a recent terrorist
attack on foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir, the national carrier, halved the price tags of all
domestic flights while the Ministry of Transport and
Communications removed dues on landing or take-off at Egyptian
airports and berthing at its ports.
</P>
<P>
The series of decisions were reviewed by Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri and several cabinet ministers who met today to weigh
the negative effects of the November 17 massacre of foreign
tourists in the southern Egyptian attraction of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Information Minister Safwat al-Sherif
told reporters that Egypt will cancel all additional dues imposed
by local administrations on visits to tourist areas and any other
tourist activities.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, is making intensive
diplomatic efforts at embassy and consulate levels to capitalize
on "international understanding of the truth of the phenomenon of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The government advised private tourist and hotel companies to
go ahead with their promotion and marketing and refrain from doing
anything untoward. Today's ministers' meeting warned of license
withdrawal for those who try to lay off employees or manipulate
prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank, in a report on supporting and
easing the burden of the tourism sector, said Egyptian banks have
agreed to continue financing tourist projects and to defer for
three months the payment of installments owed by tourist
establishments and projects.
</P>
<P>
These measures have came hand in hand with a tougher and
comprehensive security plan on the heels of the carnage in Luxor,
about 500 kilometers south of Cairo, where six gunmen in black
police uniforms shot dead 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians
before they were gunned down by the police.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, Egypt has carried out a massive
reshuffle in the security and police forces, reportedly involving
some 300 people, to shore up people's morale.
</P>
<P>
Within two days in office, the new interior minister, Habib Al
Adly, unveiled a "water-tight" security plan enlisting the help of
the military in maintaining security in tourist sites and
administering tougher penalties on abuses of police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Admitting a security slip-up in Luxor, President Hosni Mubarak
said accused foreign governments of giving shelter to fugitive
Egyptian militants and in fact encouraging their operations in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The government on November 27 issued a list of 14 leading
Egyptian Islamic militants allegedly masterminding violent acts
and urged the international community to work collectively to deny
them any safe haven.
</P>
<P>
The appalling killing of foreign tourists dealt a severe blow
to Egypt's lucrative tourism industry, wiping out the hope to
attract up to 4 million visitors this year. Thousands of
foreigners have canceled their trips after the Luxor slayings, the
worst in the country for years.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become a 3.5-billion-dollar-per-year industry and
one of the main supports of the country's economy. Statistics show
every foreign tourist spends an averaged 1,000 dollars in Egypt
and brings about job opportunities for four Egyptians.
</P>

from the gross domestic product.

Hard hurt will be those 5-8 million Egyptians directly or
indirectly employed in the tourism sector as job opportunities
have been scarce in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi FM Urges UN Sanctions Committee to Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf said today that there should be several changes in
the procedures of the U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said at today's news conference that it would be
unacceptable for Iraq to accept "the same defects and the same
problems and the same delay practice" as what had happened in the
first and second phases of the implementation of the oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that all the permanent members of
the Security Council except the United States "have new ideas
and new suggestions."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the United States for obstructing the approval
of contracts signed by Iraq with other countries under the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
"As for the other sectors," he added that "there should be
idea of what we have suggested, as long as it is included in the
plan of distribution."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether Iraq would reject an extension
to the third phase of the oil-for-food program if the Security
Council maintained the current format, Sahhaf said that "we have
received commitments that it would not be the same."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "for sure, we will reject, we will
reject if they come again with the same kind of resolution."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan today reportedly urged the
Security Council to consider raising the amount of oil revenue
Iraq can spend on food and medicine in a bid to ease the
suffering of the Iraqi people due to the U.N. imposed sanction.

<HEADLINE> Syria Holds Seminar on Combating AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Syria held a seminar on
combating AIDS under the theme of "Let Us Safeguard Our Children
From AIDS" to mark the World AIDS Day today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Syria's Minister of Health
Iyad el-Shatti said that Syria is exerting efforts to implement
health programs to prevent AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He said that only 151 AIDS cases have been found in Syria,
including 54 foreigners, and no more than 11 cases reported this
year.
</P>
<P>
Syria is closely monitoring the deadly disease, and conducts
250,000 tests annually, Shatti said, adding that 192,000 tests
have been undertaken in the last nine months compared to 153,000
in the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the blood kept in Syria's blood banks is
absolutely free from pollution.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that Syria has adopted the strategy of
the World Health Organization of preventive measures against AIDS,
which lie in correct practices, right customs and traditions, and
a healthy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the infection of the disease is made possible
only through unsafe sex relations, blood transfusion and injection
with polluted needle.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Director of the Office of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Damascus Nihad Qanawati described AIDS
as a grave threat not only to adults but to children as well.
</P>
<P>
She said 3 million children under 15 have been diagnosed to
contract AIDS, and that about 1,000 of them died every day last
year.
</P>
<P>
She asserted that UNICEF will spare no efforts in combating
AIDS, particularly among children threatened by AIDS and suffering
from the disease.

<HEADLINE> Panel Calls for U.S. National Security Transformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A congressionally chartered
panel today called on the Pentagon to cope with new threats in the
21st century, paying more attention to defending U.S. cities
rather than just being prepared for two wars in other regions.
</P>
<P>
"Our interests will be challenged in new ways," said Philip
Odeen, Chairman of the nine-member National Defense Panel. "We may
have to cope with new or changing regional threats. Some of these
new challenges may differ markedly from those we plan for today."
</P>
<P>
The 94-page report, "Transforming Defense: National Security in
the 21st Century," said that the U.S. military, which has
protected the nation's interests in the past, may not be able to
solve the future problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States is likely to have to cope with
penetrations of its information systems, mass destruction, and
attacks against U.S. cities and satellites.
</P>
<P>
The Panel calls for a comprehensive reshaping of the skills and
capabilities of the armed forces to adapt the U.S. forces from the
Cold War era to the security threats that are likely to face
America and its allies 20 years from now. It urges that the
process begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
"This transformation must be undertaken as a part of an overall
reassessment and redesign of our national security structure,"
said Odeen. "The challenges we face do not follow traditional
bureaucratic or geographical boundaries. They go beyond today's
national security structures and require the interaction of local
and national domestic agencies, non-governmental organizations,
traditional allies, and new international partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Panel suggested that the American forces should make
greater mobility, precision, speed, stealth and strike ranges
while sharply reducing their logistics and support "footprint."
</P>
<P>
"All operations will be increasingly joint, combined (with
allies), and interagency," added the group.
</P>
<P>
The Panel said that the Pentagon should devote 5 billion to 10
billion U.S. dollars a year to developing the new strategy through
experimentation with new weapons and warfighting concepts.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Pentagon should move away from its
familiar assumption that the armed forces must be able to fight
two major regional wars at the same time. It said the two-war
strategy is becoming an obstacle to long-term change.
</P>
<P>
The Panel agreed with the Pantegon's suggestion to shrink the
current force levels and close additional military bases in order
to finance weaponry development.
</P>
<P>
Congress created the National Defense Panel a year ago at the
same time it instructed the Pentagon to review military programs
through 2005. The panel was asked to provide an alternative view
of the Defense Department's "Quadrennial Defense Review" and to
take a longer-range look at defense needs.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department was not immediately commenting on the
report.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China and Mexico signed
here today a number of agreements on cooperation in various
fields, a sign of ties expansion between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his Mexican counterpart E.
Zedillo witnessed the inking of four documents at the presidential
residence.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the agreements on cooperation in consular affairs,
sports, social science and agriculture, have opened "new areas for
cooperation" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before witnessing the signing of the documents, the two leaders
held "cordial and friendly" talks, with both agreeing to expand
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed satisfaction at the progress of
bilateral ties over the past 25 years and agreed to establish
cross-century partnership of overall cooperation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that through joint efforts by both sides the
historical relations of friendship and cooperation will develop in
every aspect and be further consolidated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Sunday on the second leg of his four-day
state visit which will last until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's large entourage, which includes Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Foreign Trade and Economic

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Threatens Zambia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian finance minister Ronald
Penza said here today that although Zambia's macro-economic
stabilization is being achieved, the HIV/AIDS epidemic threatens
people's expectations for a high standard of living.
</P>
<P>
To mark World AIDSs Day which falls on December 1, Penza said
"a bold and innovative process is taking place in Zambia to
restructure our economy and to expend our social infrastructure.
Clearly, a stable and growing economy fuels social development
and facilitates the provision of quality goods and services."
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the next millennium, Zambians can realistically
aspire to a standard of living considered to be a human right in
richer countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, these expectations are now threatened by the HIV/AIDS
epideic. AIDS is a relentless killer that has the potential to
sabotage the economic and social gains achieved during the past
few years, he said when he launched the book "HIV/AIDS in Zambia:
Bakcground, Projections, Impact and iIterventions".
</P>
<P>
He said the economic impact of HIV/AIDS is difficult to
predict, but it is evident that widespread sickness and mortality
of the productive segment of the population are affecting the
operation of economy.
</P>
<P>
AIDS related illnesses and deaths to employees treaten this
objective by both increeasing costs and reducing revenues for
companies in his country, Penza said.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is attacking the most productive segment of Zambia's
population, primarily people between 15 and 49 years of age and
nearly 20 percent of the adult population is infected with HIV,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that the number of maternal and double orphans
will rise to over 500,000 in the year 2000, and to more than one
million in 2010.
</P>
<P>
However, Penza said there are opportunities to control and
prevent the spread of AIDS. "We are not helpless victims of the
epidemic, but that we have the power to control our destiny," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Today activities including marches, rallies and performances
were held across the country to mark the World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
At the rallies speakers called on Zambians to change the
behaviour to protect themselves and the children from AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Devaluation Not Necessarily Means Competitiveness: HK Seminar  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the short run, these asset price decreases will be painful
for some, but they will help reduce cost pressures for the economy
as a whole, Fung argued.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "the regional currency swings may affect business,
they do not necessarily threaten Hong Kong's competitiveness,"
Fung continued.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's long-term competitive advantages are actually
undervalued. Hong Kong is a premium product. You pay more - but
you get more," Fung concluded.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary for Trade and Industry Tam Wing-pong offered
similar views from the government's perspective.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar offers the sort
of stability or security for the local economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If your currency fluctuates from time to time, the willingness
of investors will naturally be affected in the long term," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of other currencies in the region was not
designed to improve competitiveness, instead it was out of
economic concerns, Tam remarked.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that Hong Kong's competitiveness has
not significantly diminished in the wake of the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
According to him, it would be fatal if Hong Kong tries to
compete on cost, but "Hong Kong can compete on other areas where
its competitiveness lies."
</P>
<P>
First of all, Hong Kong is sitting at the doorstep of a huge
economy with almost boundless opportunity, which gives the city a
unrivaled advantage to play as a bridge for the two-way traffic
between the Chinese inland areas and the other part of the world,
Tam pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Resilience of the economy and the top-caliber business people
are another two strengths making Hong Kong competitive, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Enright, a visiting professor at Hong Kong
University, agreed that although Hong Kong has felt the contagious
effect of the regional crisis, that "doesn't necessarily mean a
decline in competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
On the strategy to foster medium- and long-term
competitiveness, the scholar suggested focusing on issues such as
education and training, infrastructure and environment.
</P>
<P>
It is very important for Hong Kong to make moves that are
difficult or impossible to copy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for Swedish Investment, Stronger Baltic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia President Boris
Yeltsin said here today Swedish investments should not be
discouraged by the West's exaggeration of Russia's bureaucracy,
corruption and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is on a three-day visit beginning today. His visit,
the first by a Russian head of state since 1909, is expected to be
dominated by Baltic security and trade.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Swedish news agency TT, Yeltsin called on
Swedish businessmen to invest more in Russia, saying the
proportion of bureaucracy, corruption and organized crime has been
considerably overestimated by Western media.
</P>
<P>
He told the news agency that cooperation between countries
around the Baltic Sea and above all relations between Sweden and
Russia will be on the top of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Sweden and Russia has intensified since 1991 with
Russian statistics listing Sweden as its seventh largest foreign
investor in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A number of business representatives were among Yeltsin's
entourage of about 200 people. He is due to meet Swedish Prime
Minister Goran Persson later today and sign about eight bilateral
agreements on various issues including economic cooperation, trade
and combating crime.
</P>
<P>
Also topping Yeltsin's agenda will be Russia's relationship
with the Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
He said his country is sincerely interested in building
good-neighborly relations with the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly proposed to provide a security guarantee
to the Baltic region in an attempt to dissuade the three Baltic
countries from seeking entry into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Yeltsin praised Sweden for its policy of
neutrality and non-alignment, saying that would only strengthen
the European security system.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, a neutral country in the Baltic since the early 19th
century, says it would stay out of any military alliance but would
continue its cooperation within NATO's Partnership for Peace
program -- a cooperation program with former eastern bloc
countries and other European non-NATO countries on regional
defense.

<HEADLINE> Irish Shoppers Urged to Boycott UK Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Irish shoppers have been urged
to boycott British produce after Welsh famers' action against meat
imports from the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
About 500 Welsh farmers blockaded the port of Fishguard early
today, forcing back to Ireland six trucks carrying what they said
were cheap beef imports.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Press Association reported that the farmers stood in
front of the entrance to the southern Welsh port for two hours
after a ferry arrived at 1 am from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 Welsh farmers blockading the Irish port of Holyhead
Monday threw a truckload of Irish beef-burgers into the sea.
</P>
<P>
Irish truckers' leader Jimmy Quinn was quoted as saying, "The
action was a deliberate attempt to sabotage the Irish meat export
trade."
</P>
<P>
Quinn, of the Irish Road Haulers Association, said that he was
very disappointed with the Welsh farmers and he asked Irish people
to avoid UK goods.
</P>
<P>
The Welsh farmers were reportedly seeking an urgent meeting
with Welsh Secretary Ron Davies to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
British beef farmers' incomes have plunged since the discovery
of link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and its
brain-wasting human equivalent, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD).

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- NATO military chiefs were
reassured Tuesday about the safety of Russia's nuclear weapons when
they met here for their year-end ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman told the press that the NATO nuclear planning
group was briefed about the status of Russia's tactical nuclear
forces and was reassured that Russia was devoting efforts and
resources to safeguard its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the United States have established a reciprocal
exchange between their strategic force commanders. A senior U.S.
strategic commander, who has recently visited Russian nuclear
installations, briefed the NATO military chiefs.
</P>
<P>
The issue concerning nuclear weapons safety will be discussed
for the first time in Wednesday's NATO-Russia Permanent Joint
Council (PJC) meeting, which will be held in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, quoted
participants at the nuclear planning group meeting as saying that
the dialogue between NATO and Russia will foster increased
transparency and improve understanding of the role of nuclear
weapons in the security strategies of NATO and the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
He said the outcome of the nuclear discussion at the PJC
meeting would be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
NATO strategists agreed that nuclear forces continue to play an
essential role in NATO strategy and their fundamental purpose is
political.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said that nuclear forces are expected to help
preserve peace and prevent coercion and war.
</P>
<P>
During today's defense planning committee meeting, NATO
military chiefs reaffirmed their determination to ensure the
effectiveness and coherence of individual and collective military
capabilities to fulfill the full range of NATO missions.
</P>
<P>
As for a justification for non-Article V missions, the defense
planning committee agreed that it must be sufficiently flexible to
meet the demands of a changing and more complex security
environment.
</P>
<P>
Article five of the North Atlantic Treaty calls for military
action only when one or several members of the alliance is under
attack, which the treaty defines as an attack against all NATO
members.
</P>
<P>
NATO is shifting its strategic focus from defense of members'
territories to defense of members' common interests threatened by
crises that have been triggered by nationalism, ethnicity,
religion, social-economy or environment.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers are slated to discuss later today the
issue of whether and how to maintain the SFOR forces in the former
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to make the Dayton peace
accord last.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Formally Tenders His Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- President Farooq Leghari has
formally tendered his resignation soon after addressing a news
conference here this evening, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 23-word resignation letter has been sent to Speaker of the
National Assembly Ellahi Soomro, they said, adding Leghari left
his office
for residential quarters of the Presidency immediately after
signing the
letter.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, who assumed his office as president four years ago,
told a crowded news conference here this evening that he received
today a summary to disqualify Chief Justice Sajjad and appoint the
senior most judge of the Supreme Court as the next Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing president said he had no option but to sign it.
But, instead, he decided to quit.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to resign for the supremacy of the judiciary
and the constitution of the country," Leghari said, adding an
official announcement of his resignation will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
The nerve-wracking tussle between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and Chief Justice Sajjad reached its climax today when Sajjad
suspended this morning the 13th amendment to the constitution
passed by the two houses of Parliament in April, which clipped the
presidential power to dismiss an elected government.
</P>
<P>
However, minutes after Sajjad's order, a rival 10-member bench
of the Supreme Court declared his order invalid because he has
been under suspension.
</P>
<P>
Leghari's resignation also came hours after his meeting with
the powerful Chief of the Army Staff Jahangir Karamat, who has
been acting as the mediator in the four-month-old confrontation
between the government and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Supreme Court issued the conflicting
orders today, Karamat also met with Prime Minister Sharif earlier
in the day.

<HEADLINE> EU Committed to Limiting Nuclear Proliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today
pledged its commitment to the prevention of nuclear weapons
proliferation during a meeting in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union started negotiations with the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on three additional nuclear safeguard
protocols.
</P>
<P>
The protocols include one for the 13 non-nuclear weapon EU
member states, one for France and one for Britain. The latter two
are nuclear-weapon member states.
</P>
<P>
The protocols are designed to improve the international nuclear
non-proliferation regime and to increase security worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The initiative of the European Union is unique in that it
constitutes the negotiation of protocols both for nuclear weapon
and non-nuclear weapon states.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide a basic and important reference for the
continuation of peaceful nuclear cooperation activities in the
union and elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
European Commission Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan, EU
commissioners Christos Papoutsis and Hans van den Broek all
welcomed the negotiations as a further demonstration of the
union's will and commitment to the prevention of nuclear weapon
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Papoutsis is in charge of the union's nuclear agency Euratom
Supply Agency, and van den Broek is responsible for external
relations.
</P>
<P>
Ensuring a strong non-proliferation regime is one of the
European Union's key common foreign and security policy
objectives. The union and its member states attach great
importance to the strengthening of IAEA safeguards.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Papoutsis said: "The union will play a
considerable role in the implementation of several measures under
the new system.
</P>
<P>
"The dual assurance of the application of both Euratom and IAEA
safeguards in our member states is clear evidence that nuclear
energy is used in the union in a framework of impeccable
non-proliferation credentials," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang welcomed today the endorsement by the meeting of the finance
ministers held in Kuala Lumpur to develop a market-based approach
to address the intermediation problem in the region, reports
reaching here from Kuala Lumpur said.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asia Nations Plus Six (Australia, China, China's Hong
Kong, Japan, South Korea and the Unites States) today, the finance
ministers agreed that "there is an urgent need to develop a deep,
liquid and mature debt market in Asia to address the
intermediation problem. Ministers strongly endorsed the
initiative to develop a market-based approach to mobilize private
sector resources."
</P>
<P>
"While the authorities in the region are preoccupied with fire
fighting, we should not lose sight of the need for fire
prevention. Developing a market-based approach to address
intermediation problem is the right way forward," said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
"I felt encouraged by the warm support I got this morning from
other finance ministers on Hong Kong's suggested approach," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will host the first meeting of technical experts to
explore these ideas with the assistance of international financial
institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tsang also shared the meeting consensus on the need to
strengthen domestic financial systems and to foster closer
collaborative efforts on financial regulation and supervision.
</P>
<P>
"We are all for more vigilant monitoring of domestic banking
systems. The Hong Kong experience has shown the value of sound
prudential standards in helping to withstand external shocks to
the banking system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on, Tsang welcomed the undertaking by the International
Monetary Fund to examine how "below the line" hedging activities
of domestic activities should be monitored.

<HEADLINE> Cost, No Decisive Factor in Competitiveness: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- It would be fatal if Hong
Kong tries to compete on cost, but Hong Kong can compete on other
areas where its competitiveness lies, a local official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Some people are concerned that Hong Kong has become more and
more expensive, which casts doubt on how it could sustain economic
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the argument, Deputy Secretary for Trade and
Industry of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Tam
Wing-pong pointed out: "Hong Kong has always been expensive, at
lease since our economic development really started to take off."
</P>
<P>
"Unless we try to disrupt the market economy theory which we
hold on to so dearly, we cannot expect land price or labor cost in
Hong Kong to come down dramatically to match those in developing
economies," he told a seminar on Hong Kong's competitiveness,
organized by the American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"We would have died as early as the mid 1970s had we attempted
to do so," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "I have been told by my business friends that cost is
 seldom the sole decisive factor for any important business
decision," Tam noted.
</P>
<P>
He commented that Hong Kong can compete on other areas where
its competitiveness lies.
</P>
<P>
First, Hong Kong is sitting at the doorstep of a huge economy
with almost boundless opportunity, which gives the city a
unrivaled advantage to play as bridge for the two-way traffic
between China and the other parts of the world, Tam pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Hong Kong has built up in past two decades strong
economic fundamentals so "we could weather whatever economic
turmoil well". "The resilience of our economy keeps us
competitive," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The recent financial crisis will serve as a good example in
that Hong Kong is always well prepared for the worst to happen and
to confront it head-on, he continued, and quoted Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa as saying that Hong Kong will be the first one to
bounce back when the crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
Tam also praised the top-caliber business people as another
strength Hong Kong owns.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is regarded as among the most competitive economies
in the world. Free market, infrastructure and business friendly
environment, free trade, rule of law and human resources are major
factors for Hong Kong's competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Macao Reports 161 HIV-Positive Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Macao has reported a total of 161
HIV-positive cases, of which 11 have developed into full-blown
AIDS disease and seven died.
</P>
<P>
The Va Kio newspaper quoted Joao Claro, director of the Macao
Public Health Department, as saying that 118 of those who were
found HIV positive were women.
</P>
<P>
The number of HIV-positive cases dropped annually after 1993
when 40 cases were found. The number was 33 for 1994, 29 for 1995
and 21 for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Claro said that 113 people who tested HIV positive were Thai
nationals. Others were Portuguese and Vietnamese nationals.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases were contracted through heterosexual means,
he said, adding that there were also 13 cases contracted through
homosexual means, and one case through blood transfusion. But he
did not reveal where the blood transfusion took place.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report said that of those tested HIV positive, 99
were between the age of 20 and 29, and three were under the age of
19.
</P>
<P>
Macao started to track down people of HIV positive from
1986. The test targets female workers in entertainment companies
and massage parlors, blood donors, people ready for recruitment to
the guard forces, pregnant women and those voluntarily asking for
tests.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief Justice of Pakistan's
Supreme Court Sajjad Ali Shah has not resigned from his office
following the stepping down of President Farooq Leghari, sources
close to him said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Justice is not prepared to talk with the press, to comment
on the President's resignation," said his aide in an telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said, "there is no truth in the report that the
Justice was resigning."
</P>
<P>
The Justice would be attending the court on Wednesday as usual.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Farooq Leghari announced that he would step
down for the larger interests of the country.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, who assumed his office as president four years ago,

senior most judge of the Supreme Court as the next Chief Justice.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Devaluation Not Necessarily Means Competitiveness: HK Seminar (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Devaluation of the Hong Kong
dollar, in the wake of the plunge of many other Asian currencies,
does not necessarily mean competitiveness, business executives,
scholars and government officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Attending a seminar entitled "Global Competitiveness -- the
Hong Kong Debate", they argued that Hong Kong's competitiveness
relies on its uniqueness that is unrivaled in the region.
</P>
<P>
There has been great volatility in the financial markets
throughout Asia, sending the currencies of Thailand, Malaysia and
Indonesia, among others, plummeting, said Victor Fung, chairman of
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
Against this regional backdrop, there have been some voices
calling for reconsidering the link between the Hong Kong dollar
and the U.S. dollars, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The voices claimed that lowering the prices through devaluation
would boost competitiveness, by bringing local prices into line
with those of neighboring Asian economies, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
However, "instant cost-cutting through devaluation is no quick
fix for competitiveness", Fung stressed, warning the process is
also with dangerous side effects.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than increasing competitiveness, devaluation erodes an
economy's standard of living. Devaluation makes countries poorer,
requiring them to export more just to maintain the same level of
imports," he said.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation does not even necessarily translate into lower
prices, since the threat of inflation may do away with the entire
benefit of devaluation in the first place, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar has held steady in the regional turmoil,
backed by the huge reserves of the city and the determination of
the government to maintain the U.S. dollar link.
</P>
<P>
Rather than adjusting to external pressures through currency
values, Hong Kong is doing so by correction in asset prices, Fung
noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the short run, these asset price decreases will be painful
for some, but they will help reduce cost pressures for the economy
as a whole, Fung argued.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "the regional currency swings may affect business,
they do not necessarily threaten Hong Kong's competitiveness,"
Fung continued.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's long-term competitive advantages are actually
undervalued. Hong Kong is a premium product. You pay more - but
you get more," Fung concluded.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary for Trade and Industry Tam Wing-pong offered
similar views from the government's perspective.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar offers the sort
of stability or security for the local economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If your currency fluctuates from time to time, the willingness
of investors will naturally be affected in the long term," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of other currencies in the region was not
designed to improve competitiveness, instead it was out of
economic concerns, Tam remarked.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that Hong Kong's competitiveness has
not significantly diminished in the wake of the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
According to him, it would be fatal if Hong Kong tries to
compete on cost, but "Hong Kong can compete on other areas where
its competitiveness lies."
</P>
<P>
First of all, Hong Kong is sitting at the doorstep of a huge
economy with almost boundless opportunity, which gives the city a
unrivaled advantage to play as a bridge for the two-way traffic
between the Chinese inland areas and the other part of the world,
Tam pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Resilience of the economy and the top-caliber business people
are another two strengths making Hong Kong competitive, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Enright, a visiting professor at Hong Kong
University, agreed that although Hong Kong has felt the contagious
effect of the regional crisis, that "doesn't necessarily mean a
decline in competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
On the strategy to foster medium- and long-term
competitiveness, the scholar suggested focusing on issues such as
education and training, infrastructure and environment.
</P>
<P>
It is very important for Hong Kong to make moves that are
difficult or impossible to copy, he said.

the letter, but the Libyan media said that it was on bilateral
relations since the cooperation in oil exploration and production
between the two countries has resumed over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Libya have remained deadlocked
since the 1989 explosion of a DC-10 passenger plane of the UTA air
company of France over Niger. France suspected that Libya was
involved in the bombing of the plane, in which all 170 people on
board were killed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the French national employers' group CNPF said
on Monday that French enterprises intend to invest in Libya, which
has been under international sanctions since 1992 for its alleged
implication in the bombing of a Pan-Am Boeing passenger plane over
Lockerbie in 1989 and the UTA plane explosion.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the trade volume between
France and Libya in the first eight months this year amounted to
228 million U.S. dollars, and in 1996 was 280 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said on September 24 that the relations between his
country and France are "excellent" and that Libya has been fully
cooperating with France in the investigation of the UTA bombing.
</P>
<P>
France sent to the United Nations Security Council on November
7 the report on the result of an investigation by the French judge
Jean-Louis Bruguiere in Libya on the UTA bombing.
</P>
<P>
France recognized that Libya responded to a great part of its
requests during the investigation, although the responses were not
satisfying "on all the points," said the foreign ministry
spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal Mine Showing Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- One of China's
better-known coal mines, the Kailuan Coal Mining Administration,
has been showing a profit for the past three years, and has been
setting a good example for state-owned enterprises nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The administration in Hebei province in northern China was
running in the red for eight years before 1994. However, the
situation began to change after it started allowing its 19
subsidiary mines to make their own business decisions in 1993, in
such areas as production, operation, materials purchase,
marketing, personnel and wages.
</P>
<P>
Another major change was the use of a flexible personnel
system. The administration has 127,000 workers, who are now
divided into three groups: coal production, other business, and
rear-echelon service, making the administration a more modern,
market-oriented enterprise to meet customer demand.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the mine has been using modern technology to
increase output, and profits of Tangshan Mine, one of Kailuan's
subsidiary, have increased 36 percent annually since 1992, when
more modern technology was introduced.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Peace Good for Regional Development: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The realization of peace and
the ensuing political stability in Angola would benefit the
all-round development of the southern African region, a U.N.
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the U.N. observation group in Angola David
Wimhurst, who is ending his 18-month mission in the country, said
a resources-rich Angola will give a boost to the development of
southern Africa, once political stability there is realized.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the difficulties, peace process will get a
satisfactory result, he said, adding that the work must be done
to re-establish government institutions in the areas controlled
by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), and to disarm its army.
</P>
<P>
Also important is to turn UNITA's radio station into a
non-party commercial station and move UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
into Luanda, as stipulated in the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed in
1994.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the implementation of the peace agreement
would surely be accomplished by the end of January 1998 when the
U. N. Angola observation group is scheduled to finish its mission
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan President Decides to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari said here today he has decided to resign in order to end
the ongoing constitutional crisis involving the executive and the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
While announcing his resignation, he said that the
constitutional crisis "is self-created, unnecessary and hurtful"
to the nation.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to resign for the supremacy of the judiciary
and the constitution of the country," Leghari told a news
conference this afternoon, adding an official announcement of his
resignation will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, who assumed his office four years ago, announced his
resignation hours after his meeting with the powerful Chief of the
Army Staff General Jahangir Karamat, who has been acting as the
mediator in the confrontation between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said he "has no other option but to resign from the
Presidency" because he declined to disqualify the Chief Justice as
required by the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad day for Pakistan and for the constitution,"
Leghari told the crowded news conference at the Presidential
House.
</P>
<P>
"I will not dissolve the National Assembly, I will not do this
again in my life," he said. "If I will, I can do it in seconds."
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to resign for the supremacy of the institution
and the constitution of the country," said Leghari, who dissolved
the government led by then prime minister Benazir Bhutto in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
The nerve-wracking tussle between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and Chief Justice Sajjad reached its climax today when Sajjad
suspended this morning the 13th Amendment to the Constitution
passed by the two houses of the Parliament in April, which clipped
the presidential power to dismiss the elected government.
</P>
<P>
However, minutes after Sajjad's order, a rival 10-member bench
of the Supreme Court declared his order invalid because he has
been under suspension.

WASHINGTON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

not a spy.
</P>
<P>
-- In the nine months since Dolly the lamb was cloned from a
cell taken from an adult sheep, there has been an enormous change

are conducting experiments with human eggs that lay the groundwork
for cloning.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- At a U.N. meeting in Kyoto, Japan, which was discussing a

unrealistic and ineffective.

<P>
-- A congressionally chartered panel of defense experts called
for the Pentagon to put greater emphasis on defending U.S.
territory against such threats as electronic sabotage, terrorist
strikes, missile attack and the use of chemical or biological

<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Hours after announcing an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund on a support package for South Korea, the government
said a final accord hadn't been reached, knocking the country's
jittery markets lower and raising fears Seoul is resisting crucial
financial reforms.

<HEADLINE> US Agrees to Cooperate With Manila in Cleaning Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed to
cooperate with the Philippine government in removing toxic wastes
in its former military bases of Clark and Subic, the northern
Philippines, a senior Philippine official said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expression of willingness to cooperate was in response
to an earlier Manila proposal for a joint task force to address
the recurring toxic waste issue once and for all, Foreign Affairs
Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put forward by Philippine Foreign Affairs
Secretary Domingo Siazon to U.S. State Secretary Madeleine
Albright late last month when they met in Vancouver, Canada,
during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Severino said the U.S. response "is a big leap towards the
final resolution" of the toxic waste issue, which the U.S. had
denied since its withdrawal from the two bases in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. Subic Naval Base and the former U.S. Clark Air
Base reverted to the Philippines in 1992 and were later converted
to special economic and industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
The presence of toxic waste contaminated sites in the two bases
has been confirmed by both Filipino and American environment
activists.
</P>
<P>
But Washington repeatedly denied the toxic waste issue and
refused to accept any obligation in dealing with such an issue.

<HEADLINE> OIC Expert Meeting Opens in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The expert meeting for the
eighth summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC)
was inaugurated this afternoon by a representative of the OIC
Secretary General Izzidine Al-Iraki.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, head of meeting, Iranian
Deputy Foreign Minister for International affairs Mohammad Javad
Zarif stressed that the Islamic countries should strengthen the
unity and cooperation among them under the new conditions after
the cold war.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Islamic countries are facing various
problems such as "the occupation of Jerusalem" by Israel, the
issues of the Palestinians, Afghanistan and Bosnia-Herzegovina,
which should be solved collectively by the Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
With unity among the Islamic countries, Zarif said, the
Muslim world can reach the goals of peace, tranquility and
development and promote bilateral, multilateral and regional
cooperations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that experts from the OIC member states
would coordinate with each other to work out the resolutions and
statements for the OIC summit to be held here on December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 experts from 54 OIC member states attended
today's session and soon after the inaugural ceremony they
started to discuss the agenda for the OIC ministerial meeting
and some 150 resolutions for the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>

countries, the stalled Middle East peace process and economic
cooperation among OIC members would be on the top agenda of the
OIC summit.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pragmatic Changes in Australia's Asia Policy (1)  by Jiang Guocheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 has seen
Australia begin to abandon its image of following the steps of
some Western powers in dealing with other parts of the world,
particularly Asia, and encourage deeper US engagement with Asia
for the stability and prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issue, Australia has adopted a
down-to-earth approach and refused to join those Western countries
in using the issue as an excuse to defame some selected developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Australia refused to cosponsor a resolution at
the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, put forward
by some European countries and supported by the US, which
unjustifiably criticized China's human rights record and
intentionally ignored rapid social and economic progress China has
made during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Australia undertook a dialogue with China on the human
rights issue in August on the basis of equality and mutual
respect, which Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer later
described as satisfactory and conducive to the relations between
Australia and China.
</P>
<P>
In the interest of its own and other parts of the world,
Australia has also devoted great efforts to persuading the US to
have better ties with Indonesia, Australia's largest neighbor and
the largest Muslin nation in the world, and gave up its
confrontation with the country over the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
A rift between Indonesia and the US came to a head in June,
when Jakarta, angered by US congressional criticism of its human
rights situation, canceled plans to buy nine F-16 fighter aircraft
and pulled out of a US-sponsored military education program.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the United States in late June, Australian
Prime Minister John Howard called on his host to drop its
confrontational attitude towards some Asian countries on the
human rights issue, saying its human rights concerns should be
addressed through dialogue in a broad relationship, not through
confrontation with Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
He said the US Administration's commitment to deeper engagement
with China and its disavowal of notions of containment and
confrontation were "central to the region's future stability."
</P>
<P>
The continued US engagement in Asia was not only crucial for
the region, but also in its own interest, as 40 percent of US
trade now occurs with East Asia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Australia went a step further. It had tried to influence US
thinking on Indonesia by sending a high-level team to Washington
for talks in mid-September to act behind the scenes to help mend
the rift.
</P>
<P>
Mending the rift was also high on the agenda of Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan in October when they met with their US counterparts
during an annual Australian-US ministerial meeting in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Downer urged the US to improve its ties with Indonesia and said
there was strong support from Australia for a strong and effective
relationship between the United States and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan attacked American congressional critics of
Indonesia's human rights record, saying some people in Congress
are always complaining about human rights. "We are of Asia. Our
economic well-being is as tightly bound with Asia as our defense
and security interests. Above all else this is our region. These
are our friends and neighbors," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Calls for Mine Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China's Labor Ministry and the
State Economic and Trade Commission has called for greater safety
measures in mines after a series of gas explosions have rocked the
industry, saying that serious attention should be given to this
matter.
</P>
<P>
This year there had been 12 serious incidents. In November
alone, there were four serious gas explosions. On the 4th, an
explosion at Yueliangtian Mine in Guizhou province killed 43
miners. On the 13th, an explosion at Pansan Mine in Anhui province
killed 89. On the 27th, explosions at Xie'er Mine in Anhui killed
45 and an explosion at Jiaoping Mine killed 28.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of the accidents was a lack of attention to
safety details, the ministry says, and lax management.
</P>
<P>
The incidents have had serious consequences for reforms,
development, and stability, and must be investigated and cadres
who were responsible for them must be dealt with in accordance
with state laws and regulations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pragmatic Changes in Australia's Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another example of Australia's pragmatic foreign policy change
is its decision to send Foreign Minister Alexander Downer to the
swearing-in ceremony of the Provisional Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on July 1, 1997 in
support of China, as Downer's US and British counterparts chose
not to attend.
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that Australia's policy change springs
from realist calculations of Asia's current and potential
significance to Australia, but it also reflects Australia's desire
to show the seriousness of its eagerness to integrate with Asia.
</P>
<P>
With about 60 percent of its goods and services export going to
Asia, Australian economic growth, job creation and the standard
of living for average Australians are closely linked with Asia's
sustained stability and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It is only natural for Australia to move closer to Asia, even
sometimes it means to distance itself to some extent from its
traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
"The days are long gone when an Australian prime minister
waited for London or Washington to decide what he did," the prime
minister declared in June when he announced the decision on
Downer's representation at the HKSAR Provisional Legislative
Council swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that the Australian government has also taken
practical actions over the past several months to help Asia
overcome the financial crisis which hit Thailand, Indonesia and
some other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia has already agreed to provide one billion US dollars
towards an international bailout of Thailand negotiated by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and could be called on for
another one billion US dollars to top up a loan package for
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Australia's participation in the IMF rescue
package on  November 28, Downer said, "We are right in there
helping, thereby proving for the first time in many years that we
are no fair-weather friend. In fact, proving we are a partner and
a neighbor for the long haul."
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that Australia's effort for deeper
engagement with Asia is driven primarily by economic factors, and
was made after it strengthened its political and military ties
with the United States and Japan since the Howard government came
to power last year.
</P>
<P>
As Australia's white paper on foreign relations put it,
"Australia's alliance with the United States is an asset both
redefined and strengthened by the end of Cold War."
</P>
<P>
The document, which was released in August, went on to say that
"the success of key Australian security and economic objectives is
greatly influenced by the economic strength and political
influence of the United States."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, how far the Howard government will go in following
its pragmatic Asia policy remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
Australia's policy change in the first half of this year
prompted US Ambassador to Australia Genta Holmes in June to call
on Australia and the United States to work together to minimize
the "differences and tensions which will emerge."
</P>
<P>
But with Sino-US relationship back to normal and improving, it
is less likely that there would be such a difficult position in
which Australia has to choose between Asia countries and the
United States. Chances are high that Australia's current pragmatic
Asia policy will go on in the near future.

</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
reshuffled his cabinet here today, demoting his vice president
and defense minister, the first since his re-election last year
in a bid to heighten efficiency and avoid corruption.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held in the State House, Chiluba declared
that Vice President Godfrey Miyanda becomes the Minister of
Education and he was replaced by former Mines Minister Christon
Tembo.
</P>
<P>
The other reshuffle arrangements are as follows: Home Affairs
Minister Chitalu Sampa becomes Defense Minister while former
Labor Minister Peter Machongwa has been moved to the Home Affairs
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Works and Supply Keli Walubita becomes
Foreign Affairs Minister while professor Lawrence Shimba, the
incumbent there, goes to the Ministry of Science, Technology and
Vocational Training.
</P>
<P>
Enock Kavindele who has been at the ministry has been
transferred to Commerce, Trade and Industry to fill the vacancy
left by Alfeyo Hambayi who goes to the Ministry of Environment
and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
Former Education Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye becomes the
Minister of Mines.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba has also replaced the army commander Nobby Shimbeye
with major general Mumbi While Zambia Air Force Commander Ronald
Shikapwasha, who would retire, has been replaced by S. Kayunbei.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the reshuffle is designed to "reinforce and
rejuvenate the cabinet", and replace the "unaccountable and
unqualified" persons.
</P>
<P>
"From time to time, I need to look at the government and see
how it operates, to see some people maybe have stayed too long to
be accountable, too long to feel that they are appointed," said
the president.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba described the shake-up of the government as
"necessary" for better governance.
</P>
<P>
This cabinet major shake-up took place after some army
officers staged a coup on October 28, but the coup was smashed by
government forces just five hours later.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba declared a 7-day state of emergency the next day, and
parliament extended it by three months early in November.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Government Takes Care of Blind People: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
always attached great importance to helping blind people in the
country, senior Vietnamese officials told a regional meeting on
the blind which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the two-day regional meeting of the World Blind Union
(WBU), Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs Minister Tran Dinh
Hoan said "Vietnam Blind Association (VBA) will get more
experience in expanding the association's activities, taking care
of the blind, and helping to rehabilitate them and improving their
education."
</P>
<P>
In a separate address to the meeting, VBA Chairman Dinh Thuyen
said that during the past five years, the VBA, with help from the
government, has granted 25.5 billion Vietnamese dong (about two
million U.S. dollars) worth of loans to help more than 26,000 blind
people set up and develop businesses.
</P>
<P>
The association has also decided to start an illiteracy
eradication program for the blind to enable them to integrate more
easily into the community.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that international organizations have
assisted nearly one million Vietnamese blind people with
rehabilitation, job creation and improvement of their cultural
lives.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the organization's eight members in the
Pacific and the east Asian region attended the meeting, which
aimed to help blind people to exchange and draw experience from
the regional blind associations' activities.

<P>
The VBA has established bilateral relations with 26 national
blind unions throughout the world since it joined the WBU in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Stresses Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma has pointed out that environmental protection will
continue to be an important part in the government's social and
economic programs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on "Biodiversity of the Eastern Arc
Mountains" which opened Monday, the vice-president appealed to
the international community to support Tanzania in its efforts to
curb environmental pollution and degradation.
</P>
<P>
Juma said his office has already prepared a draft of the
national environmental policy, which would ensure sustainable and
rational use of resources to meet the basic needs of the present
generations, according to today's Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Juma commended the Tanzania Forestry Research Institute
(Tafori) for its achievements in the conservation of Tanzania's
biodiversity and called on the international community to lend
more support in capacity building.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Finnish Ambassador to
Tanzania, Ilari Rantakari, said that his country will support
Tanzania in conserving natural resources, including the Eastern
Arc Mountains.
</P>
<P>
He said mountains are important as water sources of various
rivers, like Ruvu, Pangani, Kihansi, Wami, Ruaha and Rufiji.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president stressed the importance of community
participation in environmental management and conservation
programs.
</P>
<P>
Juma said that environmental degradation in Tanzania is
closely tied to poverty, because much wood has been used for fuel
and construction. Under such circumstances, he noted, environment
campaigns must raise people's awareness of choosing alternative
energy sources and building materials.
</P>
<P>
The conference is jointly sponsored by Tafori, the University
of Dar es Salaam and the Sokine University of Agriculture.

PARIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called on the European Union (EU) to reform its institutions
before the enlargement of the union takes effect, according to Agence

Chirac made the statement at a joint press conference with

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has approved a technical assistance of 450,000 U.S. dollars
to Nepal for improving the country's rural electrification, said a
news release issued today by the bank.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance will assist Nepal's National
Electricity Authority (NEA) in identifying potential rural
electrification schemes and preparing preliminary designs of these
schemes for future implementation, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a very low national electrification ratio of only 14
percent, and most of the people with electricity service live in
urban areas. Only four percent of the rural population have access
to power, the news release noted.
</P>
<P>
The total generating capacity of the NEA will double over the

Kali Gandaki "A" Hydroelectric Project of 144 megawatts in 2000
and several other smaller hydropower projects, said the news
release.

LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain today announced the

holocaust that occurred during World War II; they also contributed
one million pounds to the fund.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by British Foreign Secretary Robin

gold seized by Nazis from European countries invaded during World
War II and the Jewish people.

gold. But I still believe it is right that Britain should
contribute to the fund. So I am pleased to announce that Britain
will be contributing one million pounds (about 1.7 million
U.S. dollars)," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary also urged all the participants to help
"ensure that the unbearable tragedy of living through the
Holocaust is not compounded by an old age marked by the fear and
sadness of poverty."

"We must let them know that the international community is not
indifferent to their plight," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 65,000
Tanzanian children are infected every year with HIV which causes
AIDS, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally in Dar es Salaam to mark the world
AIDS day Monday, Tanzanian Premier F. Sumaye said the children
are infected by their mothers especially during delivery and

</P>
<P>
To date, Tanzania alone has about 300,000 orphans who have

speech, read by Minister for Finance Daniel Yona.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 1,000,000 children are estimated to
have been infected with HIV in the world, Sumaye said.
</P>
<P>
He said about 90 percent of HIV carriers are found in the
developing countries and 70 percent of people with HIV carriers
are in the sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, at least nine million children in the
world will have lost their mothers because of AIDS, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Urged to Pass Tax Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged Congress to finally pass the Comprehensive Tax Reform
Package (CTRP) and a new oil deregulation law to strengthen
investors' confidence in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the Legislative-Executive Development
Advisory Council, Ramos said the quick passage of the two bills
will assure local and foreign investors that the government is
consistent in its economic policies and reform program.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said foreign investors still regard the Philippines as a
"good investment destination" in Asia despite the regional
currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
But they also raised concern over the protracted passage of the
two important bills, he added.
</P>
<P>
These foreign investors who are searching for a good investment
destination can be drawn into the Philippines by putting in place
a stable policy environment, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
The CTRP bill, which is designed to improve the government's
fiscal position by boosting its tax revenues, has been blocked in
the Congressional Bicameral Conference Committee due to
differences over the level of income tax relief.
</P>
<P>
The old oil deregulation law, which took effect in February
this year, was nullified by the Supreme Court last month which
declared the oil industry liberalization law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the government withdrew its huge subsidy to the
oil industry, and the country's three major oil companies were
allowed to adjust oil prices freely.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Grain output in China for 1997 is
expected to be the same as last year, according to the Agriculture
Ministry, which announced at a national agriculture conference
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
It added that there will be record high grain reserves as well,
and a balance between supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
It said that there will be more cotton this year, but output of
oil-bearing crops will drop a bit. Sugar output will increase a
little, and meat, eggs, milk, aquatic products, and vegetables
will increase sharply.
</P>
<P>
Added value of rural enterprises will be up 18 percent
from last year. And farmers' incomes will grow by 4 percent, when
adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng has said that the good harvest will contribute
to healthy economic development and a sound environment. He says
that basic rural policies should be stablized next year, and rural
reforms increased, and is urging the use of science and education
in developing agriculture for better rural businesses, improved
production, and better lives for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that agricultural added value should increase by 4
percent in 1998, and grain output stay at this year's level, while
farmers' incomes should increase by more than 5 percent. To do
this, the country should maintain the size of planted areas,

<P>
SOFIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to meet the
requirements on joining the European Union (EU), Bulgaria will
adopt a 12-year compulsory education system in place of the
current 11-year system.
</P>
<P>
This change is provided for by an education law amendment
passed by the government Monday, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, to take effect in 1998, also stipulates that a
child must be seven years of age to enter the first grade and a
6-year-old child also can attend primary school with the consent
of the parents.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to send their children under the age of 16 to
school would be fined 100,000 Leva (240 U.S. dollars), according
to the amendment.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's present secondary education system, all

<P>
DHAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government today
signed a historic peace treaty allowing limited self-rule by the
tribal people in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), in a bid to end the
25-year-long insurgency in this country's southeastern parts.
</P>
<P>
The treaty came on the seventh day of the seventh-round talks,
initiated by the present government early this year with
Parbattaya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), the political
wing of the pro-independence armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
A beaming Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina witnessed the historic
moment as Chairman of the National Committee Chief Whip Abul
Hasanat Abdullah and PCJSS Chief Santu Larma signed the accord
this morning.
</P>
<P>
She sought the cooperation of all, including the opposition
parties, for implementing the treaty, saying while in power, the
opposition too had held 13 rounds of talks with the PCJSS to
restore peace in the hills.
</P>
<P>
Larma said, "We are going to establish a new life." The people
in the hill region would live in peace, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad and Chief of
Army Staff Lt. Gen. Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman hailed the signing of
the peace accord and urged everybody in the country to back the
document.
</P>
<P>
The preamble of the accord said that the government and the
PCJSS reached the agreement "within the constitutional framework
keeping full and firm allegiance to Bangladesh's territorial
integrity and sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have recognized the necessity to preserve the
characteristics and develop the region considering the CHT as a
tribal inhabited area," the peace accord said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 15-page agreement, a 22-member Chittagong Hill Tracts
Regional Council (CHTRC) will be created, which will be elected by
the members of the three hill district councils for a term of five
years.
</P>
<P>
The CHTRC will be headed by a tribal person with the status of
a state minister and its Chief Executive will be a public servant,
preferably a tribesman, who will be a joint secretary of the
government.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the council will be from non-tribals and three
seats will be reserved for women, the accord said.
</P>
<P>
The CHTRC would oversee employment, in which the tribals would
be given priority, as well as local development, education, health
and revenue.
</P>
<P>
The CHTRC will coordinate the general administration, law and
order and development activities in the three hill districts and
deal with the tribal laws and social justice.
</P>
<P>
The three hill district councils would be elected for a term of
five years and two-thirds of their members would be tribals. A
tribal chairman would head each of the three district councils,
which will control local affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, temporary camps of the army and
other security forces in the hill tracts will be closed down, but
three cantonments and three border forces garrisons would remain.

<P>
NANNING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A 898.7-km railway from
Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province to Nanning, the capital
of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, officially opened to
traffic today, providing a sea outlet in remote parts of
southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The railway is expected to promote industrial, agricultural,
and service trade development along its length and to help 15
million poverty-stricken people, a fifth of China's poor.
</P>
<P>
It is also a principal part of the Central Government's policy
of May, 1992 for a land, air, and water transport network in
southwestern China. The 1.5 million-sq.km. area it covers has a
population of 200 million in Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and
Guangdong provinces, and Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
It has half of China's hydropower resources and a large part of
its reserves of 11 types of minerals. Guizhou has 12.1 billion
tons of high-quality coal reserves, and annual coal output will go
from 8 million tons now to 20 million tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The network is expected to increase the phosphate ore and
non-ferrous metal transport in Yunnan from 10 million tons to
15 to 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua says that the network will get the
east coast to help the western interior and reduce supply
shortages of raw materials and help restructure industry.
</P>
<P>
The network's Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Kunming, and
Guizhou-Kunming railway lines have already been completed, and a
highway linking the cities of Chengdu, Chongqing, Guiyang, Nanning
and Zhanjiang cities is being built.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has spent two billion yuan on a project that will allow
1,000-dwt ships on the 845-km water course between Nanning and
Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in the south. Four
port cities on the Beibu Gulf are also expanding cargo handling
capacities.

<HEADLINE> WHO Discloses Second Case of New Flu Virus Strain in Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A second case of human infection
with influenza strain A (H5N1), known to infect only birds before,
has been found by China's Government Virus Unit (GVU) in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, the World Health Organization
(WHO) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of the laboratory specimen is now being sought
from the WHO Collaborating Center on influenza at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA, said WHO.
Results are expected to be available within the next week.
</P>
<P>
The second suspected case of influenza A (H5N1) involved a
two-year-old boy who developed fever in early November and was
then admitted to hospital. A nasopharyngeal aspirate taken during
his stay in hospital was positive for influenza A (H5N1). The boy
recovered quickly and was discharged.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations, however, have not indicated that
the second case is related to the first one, confirmed in August
1997, the WHO added.
</P>
<P>
The first incidence of influenza A (H5N1), which beforehand had
only been known to infect birds, was in a three-year-old boy who
died in Hong Kong in May 1997 of Reye Syndrome during an acute
respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
The Reye Syndrome, involving the central nervous system and the
liver, is a rare complication in children who may have ingested
salicylates (e.g. Aspirin). It occurs mainly in children with
influenza type B and less frequently in children with influenza
type A or chickenpox.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that the infection has spread widely in
the community or that there has been human to human transmission,"
emphasized Dr. Daniel Lavanchy of the WHO Division of Emerging and
other Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control.
</P>
<P>
"The WHO will maintain its surveillance and monitoring
activities, and assistance to national health authorities, to
ensure that, should additional cases occur, they will be rapidly
investigated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the first incidence of human infection in May 1997, the
Chinese Ministry of Public Health has increased influenza
surveillance measures. In the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, possible sources of exposure to the virus are being traced
and the Chinese Ministry of Public Health is liaising closely with
the WHO and WHO Collaborating Centers in Atlanta, London of the
United Kingdom, Melbourne of Australia, and Tokyo of Japan,
according to the WHO.

TOKYO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Borussia Dortmund beat
Brazil's Cruzeiro 2-0 to win the third straight title of the
Intercontinental Championship for Europe here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The underdogs Cruzeiro settled in quickly and staged a series
of attacks begging a goal in the opening ten minutes, only seeing
their attemps blocked by Dortmund goalie Stefan Klos with majestic
diving saves.
</P>
<P>
After earlier front-line raids of their opponents, Dortmund
made a fierce contest with the quick Brazilians in an expected
aggressive game with a handful of free-kicks.
</P>
<P>
When the relentless Brazilians found themselves in the off-side
traps, the Germans struck ahead at last.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Moeller's free-kick in the 34th minute found Stephane
Chapuisat, who cut through down to the right. Michael Zorc, who
was unmarked in the left, collected Chapuisat's cross and drove
home a left-footer from close range.
</P>
<P>
After the break, the two sides played even with both sides
squandering a dozen of scoring opportunities until defender Vito
was flashed a second yellow in the 77th minute and Cruzeiro had to
played with one-man down on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
The Europen champions popped up their firepowers ten minutes
later and matchmaker Moeller looped over Cruzeiro's goalkeeper
Dida, who stopped Decheiver's powerful left-footed half-volley.
</P>
<P>
But Dortmund did managed to make benifit from the advantage of
the number of players on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Sousa intercepted for a low pass to Moeller in the left
flank. Joerg Heinrich toed the ball to the right corner of the net
from Moller's center before Dida tried to block the shot when six
minutes left on the clock.

China has developed two qualification tests for certified
public valuers since 1995, and now has 4,960 licensed certified
public valuers. That number is expected to reach 10,000 by the end

MACAO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Macao's imports and exports
increased in the first nine months of this year, resulting in a
trade surplus of 275 million patacas (about 34.81 million
U.S. dollars) compared with a deficit of 363 million patacas
(about 45.95 million dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department show that the value of export goods between January
and September was 12.709 billion patacas (about 1.61 billion
dollars), up 11.4 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports during that period reached 12.434 billion patacas
(about 1.57 billion dollars), up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a trade surplus of 275 million patacas was
recorded. It was the first surplus in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Of the exports, 85 percent were textiles and garments,
whose exports saw an increase of 19.2 percent.

<P>
Exports of most non-textile goods, including machinery and
equipment, footwear and cement, dropped.

States and the European Union (EU). The export value to the U.S.
rose by 23.1 percent and that to the EU 14.4 percent.
</P>
<P>

goods (up 6.9 percent), fuel and lubricant oil (up 8 percent) and
consumer goods (up 0.1 percent).
</P>

AMMAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A United States civil delegation
that just visited Iraq has called for an end to the seven-year-old
sanctions on Iraq to ease its people's suffering.
</P>
<P>
"The most dangerous mass destruction weapon you can use today
is economic weapon and many children (in Iraq) are dying from this
weapon rather than from atomic bombs," said Bert Sacks, head of
the delegation, at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here Sunday after an eight-day visit to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We want a complete ban of use of economic weapon if it takes
lives," said Sacks, who together with three other delegation
members are from the Chicago-based Voices in the Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
Delegation members said the sanctions imposed by the U.N. after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait now deprived the Iraqi people of a
constant and sufficient supply of medicine and food.
</P>
<P>
The delegation spelled out food allotments by the Iraqi
government for its people. Each person can only get 2.25 kilograms
of flour, 625 grams of rice, 31 grams of salt, 680 grams of baby
milk plus a little bit of tea and edible oil every month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major fruits and vegetables like orange, eggplant
and cucumber as well as cheese were completely out of reach for
the Iraqis, said delegation member Joe Eito.
</P>
<P>
Children were the major victims of short supply of humanitarian
goods and "a million children (in Iraq) are malnourished," said
Sacks at a press conference held before the U.N. Development
Programs (UNDP) building here. "What possible justice are there?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
Delegation members showed a number of photos featuring
malnourished or sick Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
Delegation member Randall Mullins told Xinhua that there was a
very limited medicine supply in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In light of such a situation, the delegation took 220 kilograms
of medicine to Baghdad which included Aspirin, Ultracillin,
Pectolyn Pediatric, Colfed Expectorant and Brufen Pediatric
Syrup, said Mullins, adding these medicines were not available for
the Iraqis under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Delegation member Dan Handelman showed a bottle of murky water
taken from the Basra Hospital, five hours' drive form
Baghdad. Doctors there said that the water was for patients'
drinking but in fact it was totally undrinkable, Handelman said.
</P>
<P>
Sacks said the electricity and sewage systems destructed during
bombing in the Gulf War were beyond restoration. There was a
six-hour-long power cut every day due to the limited capacity of
electric generation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his delegation would leave for Amsterdam this evening
for another press conference on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions can only be lifted only when the
U.N. verifies that all mass destruction and biological weapons in
Iraq are destroyed. A U.N. inspection team is now working in
Baghdad for this purpose.

<HEADLINE> HK's Status as International Financial Center Unchanged: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center has been well preserved after the
handover, with limitless potential in the longer term on the basis
of China's sustainable economic growth, experts told an
international seminar here today.
</P>
<P>
While many other regional markets have stumbled as a result of
the recent currency and stock turmoil, Hong Kong's market systems
and regulatory structure have served it well, they said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Second Conference on International Financial
Centers, Prof. Y. C. Jao from the University of Hong Kong said
that both the Central Government of China and the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government value the city's
role as an international financial center, which is explicitly
affirmed in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being ranked among the top three international
financial centers in the Asia-Pacific Region and the top nine in
the world, Hong Kong's role as an international financial center
has become more varied and multi-faceted around the handover, said
the academic.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of state-owned enterprises on China's
mainland, which was high on the agenda of the 15th Congress of the
Communist Party of China, has highly positive implications for
Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, since
Hong Kong is the premier fund-raising center for these
enterprises, he added.
</P>
<P>
Another speaker at the conference, Jon Anda from Morgan Stanley
Asia, examined Hong Kong's position as a financial center against
the backdrop of the recent Asian financial crisis, which exerted a
contagious effect on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He listed Hong Kong's competitive edge as a financial center as
the following: the strategic position as a service center for
China, an open market with free flow of information, the excellent
infrastructure, a sound banking system and the stable currency
outlook.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's competitive edge, he added, is supported by a
strong market and regulatory framework, which served it well in
the regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Trading, execution and settlement systems at both exchanges and
clearing houses have withstood the test of high volumes and
extreme volatility, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's regulators have also withstood the public pressure,
that arises in any market crisis, to take interventionist
measures, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of any market crisis, investors return to
fundamentals," the investment banker noted.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are many challenges ahead, the current
environment represents a tremendous opportunity for Hong Kong to
consolidate and build upon its position as a regional and
international financial center," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was sponsored by the International Financial
Centers Association, the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund. The first such meeting was held in Shanghai, China, in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Successful In Controlling Spread Of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has been successful in
controlling the spread of AIDS, with only 8 new cases reported
this year, according to the Municipal Bureau of Health.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Lin Wenyi says that all of society should be made
aware of the need to prevent the spread of the deadly disease in
Beijing because it is an international city with frequent contact
with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The city has spent more than eight million yuan (about one
million US dollars) on prevention and public awareness programs
since 1988, Beijing Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Bureau of Health says that the city has had 189
HIV/AIDS cases since 1985 when the first one was discovered in the
city, 59 of them foreigners, 75 from other parts of the country,
and 55 local residents.
</P>
<P>
The first AIDS case contracted through parental transmission in
the city, and the first case of infection among drug addicts, was
reported this year. Among the newly-reported cases, the ratio of
gay males is increasing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China has 168 AIDS patients and 8,277 infected with HIV, more
than 70 percent of whom contracted the disease while using drugs.

<HEADLINE> International Financial Centers Conference Opens In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Second Conference on
International Financial Centers opened here today, bringing
together financial specialists and policy markers from all over
the world to explore issues related to Asian markets today and
next century.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is reform, transition and
consolidation of Asian financial centers to meet competition and
challenges in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"Along with the rapid growth of Asian economies, especially
over the recent years, we have witnessed both the achievement of
continued successes and the emergence of new challenges," said
Zhang Shengman, vice president of the World Bank, in his opening
speech at today's conference.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that on the one hand, emerging Asia capital
markets continued its trend toward robust growth, and on the other
hand, some Asian economies are making painful adjustments to cope
with the recent currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The financial jitters first occurred in Thailand in July, then
spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, and in mid-October swept
the North East Asia countries like Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has thrown life ropes to
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea to help bail out their
battered economies with multi-billion-US dollar rescue programs.
</P>
<P>
"While local in their origin, these issues have attracted the
close attention of both specialists and policy-makers throughout
the world," said the World Bank official, who believed that "the
conference can hardly be more timely and useful."
</P>
<P>
Participants in the two-day conference are expected to discuss
such topics as capital flows and financial integration in the
globe, reform of China's financial system, Hong Kong's role as an
international financial center and the Asia currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank president James D Wolfensohn and the IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus both wrote letters to wish the
conference a success.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the International Financial Center Association,
the World Bank and the IMF, the first such conference was held in
Shanghai, China, three and half years ago.

<HEADLINE> Free Capital Flow Should Go On: IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary
Fund (IMF) official said here today that promoting free flows of
capital still makes sense despite the Asian currency crisis that
put some economies into a downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
"Notwithstanding the recent financial turmoil, the shared
belief of our members remains that the capital account
liberalization should be promoted," said Shailendra J. Anjaria,
director of External Relations of the IMF when addressing the
Second International Financial Centers Conference that opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
The regional financial crisis that first began in Thailand in
July where substantial macroeconomic imbalances occurred, then
spilled over into Southeast Asia, and most recently spread to
Northeast Asia economies like South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Among many other reasons, the huge and rapid outflow of capital
is blamed for causing the financial turbulence in this part of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official disagreed and told the participants of the
conference: "Movements in international capital are more often a
symptom, rather than a root cause, of financial turmoil."
</P>
<P>
He cited Hong Kong and Singapore to say that the economies with
the most open capital accounts were not where the crisis
originated, instead, they are the economies that have so far
seemed most able to withstood the regional instability when it has
reached their shores.
</P>
<P>
Anjaria analyzed the benefits and risks of capital account
liberalization, which channels resources more efficiently to their
most productive uses and at the same time poses challenges to
policy makers and embryonic banking systems.
</P>
<P>
Benefits outweigh costs, he remarked. "Capital markets are
generally the messenger, but not usually the bad news," said
Anjaria. "We should not shoot the messenger just so as to overlook
the bad news."
</P>
<P>
The official acknowledged that the recent crisis reminded
people of the risks, to which no country is immune. "In the long
run however no country can afford to cut itself off from the
international capital markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the liberalization should be introduced in
an orderly manner, backed both by adequate national policies and
by a solid multilateral system for surveillance and financial
support.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the lessons from the Asia currency turmoil, he
suggested that a country should have swift reaction to warning
signals by taking timely action, enhance transparency of economic
policies and data, and establish a sound banking system.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Customs Warn of Home-brewed Wines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs warned
local drinkers to stay away from untaxed, home-made alcohol after
its officers raided a shop selling bottled wines and wine-making
equipment here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During their raid of a "cellar" in Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon,
officers found it had been selling for several months
"do-it-yourself" brewing kits and its own wine, made on the
premises and Canadian-made kits which included ingredients,
equipment and instructions.
</P>
<P>
It is the first ever case of home-brewed wines being seized in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 liters of dutiable bottle wine, 200 liters of
fermenting materials and several pieces of equipment, including
blenders, filters and glass vats, were seized during the raid.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Customs and Excise Department's Prosecution,
Intelligence and Investigation Bureau, Senior Superintendent
Gregory Wong Pui-sham, said the raid came after a report last
month on the shop by local English-language newspaper South China
Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal to make wine or any alcohol without license,
regardless of whether it is for your own consumption or to sell,"
Wong was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Customers of the shop had the choice of making the wine at home
or leaving their brew at the shop to be looked after by staff
during a 28-day fermentation period, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The five persons arrested during the raid and released later on
bail, face a maximum of one million HK dollars (0.12 million U.S.
dollars) in fines and two years' imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Organ Donations Badly Needed in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Organ donations are
needed to save the lives of more than 1,500 people awaiting
kidney, heart or liver transplants, South Africa's Organ Donor
Foundation (ODF) said.
</P>
<P>
Transplant programs in the country's nine transplant centers
were running into serious difficulty because of a shortage of
donors, ODF spokesman Jaoqui Thomson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was because of lack of urgency, misconception and lack of
awareness and religious constraints, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of patients with kidney failure were unable to be
accepted on hospital dialysis programs because of distance and
frequency of visits, and more than 10 people a week were sent
home, waiting to die because of lack of space on dialysis
machines.
</P>
<P>
Costs of keeping a person on dialysis were three times that of
a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
Need for kidney transplants was remarkably high in the black
community with the incidence of end stage renal failure, three
times higher than in the rest of the population because of a
high incidence of severe hypertension, said Thomson.

<HEADLINE> Manila Looks for Possible Sources of Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today gave orders to the National Irrigation Administration (NIA)
to undertake a thorough survey of all rivers in the Philippines to
harness them as water sources to mitigate the effects of the El
Nino weather disturbance.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here, Ramos stressed the urgency of tapping
rivers as water sources to irrigate farmlands.
</P>
<P>
"Look at all the rivers in the Philippines for harnessing as
water sources for a variety of purposes -- water supply, hydro for
power generation, but especially for irrigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued by the presidential
office this afternoon, Ramos urged the NIA through the Department
of Agriculture to survey the rivers in the country because of the
worsening effects of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
El Nino refers to the abnormal warming of sea surface
temperatures in the South Pacific, which erupts every two to seven
years and causes severe flooding and drought.
</P>
<P>
The 1982-1983 El Nino, the worst one in 100 years, caused 13
billion U.S. dollars in damage and killed 2,000 people in the
world.
</P>
<P>
However, experts warned that the current El Nino, which began
in March, could be among the most severe in this century.
</P>
<P>
The worst effect will be felt over the next few months and
possibly extend into 1998 -- beyond its usual Christmas time peak,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said his department is
stepping up cloud-seeding operations to induce rains around Angat
Dam in Bulacan, which supplies waters to the Manila area.
</P>
<P>
"We are working jointly with the Philippine Air Forces in an
attempt to augment as soon as possible the water in Angat Dam," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Airplanes have also been deployed to critical regions to carry
out cloud-seeding operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight months, El Nino has unleashed severe
drought in parts of the Philippines. In the Northern Philippines,
rainfall has been below normal since May, affecting major rice and
corn growing areas.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippine capital of Manila, the Metropolitan Water
Works and Sewerage System started Monday to reduce water supply by
12 hours. Normal water supply in the capital will not resume until
July next year due to the El Nino phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Soccer Squad Seeks Venables' Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is looking forward to
signing former England coach Terry Venables to head its squad for
the World Cup finals in France next year.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted Nigerian Football Association chairman
Colonel Abdulmumuni Aminu as saying that he was ready to offer the
job to Venables, whose Australian side missed out on the World Cup
after losing to Iran last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We will meet Terry as soon as possible," Abdulmumuni said.
"If Terry says yes, the job is his providing the salary he would
want is reasonable."
</P>
<P>
Abdulmumuni will be in Marseille for Thursday's World Cup draw
and is reported to be coming to London to talk with Venables.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the defending Olympic champion, has been without a
manager since Frenchman Philippe Troussier quit.
</P>
<P>
Venables is under contract with Australia until next July and
has been offered a contract extension.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that he believed Hong Kong will enjoy
long-term stability and prosperity with an expected economic
growth of 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Mexican newspaper "The Sun," Jiang
said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has taken
effective measures to stabilize the Hong Kong dollar following the
recent fluctuations in the Hong Kong financial market.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived in Mexico on November 29 for a four-day
state visit, said that Hong Kong's basic economic indicators have
been good thanks to its abundant foreign exchange reserve, strict
financial regulation and sound fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong's return to China in July this year, Jiang
said, its relations with the inland areas have been very close.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's role as a bridge between China and the rest of the
world will be further enhanced, he added.

<HEADLINE> India's Currency Continues to Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua)-- India's currency rupee
continued its down trend today when it dropped close to 40.00
against the U.S. dollar in the local foreign exchange trading
market.
</P>
<P>
The rupee opened weaker today at around 39.30/40 per U.S.
dollar after Monday night's free fall in the market nervous about
the lack of intervention of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). At
around 11:00 local time, it slumped to 39.85 against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the slump to political turmoil in the
country and heavy bank and corporate demand of U.S. dollars in the
market.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the rupee, however, recovered substantially
on reports of the RBI's coming out with a package of measures. It
was trading around 39.45/55 against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
RBI today announced a package of measures to arrest further
fall of the rupee against the dollar. the measures include raising
cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 0.5 percent, doing away with the 10
percent incremental CRR on non-resident rupee deposits and
suspending facilities granted to authorized dealers to offer
forward dollar contracts.
</P>
<P>
RBI also kept in abeyance the schedule of CRR reductions
already announced and enhanced the interest rate on fixed rate
deposits for Wednesday from 4.5 percent to five percent.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China is Mexico's All-Weather Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that China is an all-weather friend of
Mexico and is willing to establish a cross-century partnership to
further all-round cooperation with that country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a state dinner given in his honor by
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. The Chinese president arrived
in Mexico on November 29 for a four-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that President Zedillo said in Beijing last year
Mexico was a trustworthy friend of China, Jiang said, "Today I
want to tell Mr. President that China is Mexico's all-weather
friend."
</P>
<P>
In his toast, Jiang said that since China and Mexico
established diplomatic ties 25 years ago, the two countries have
increased exchanges of high-level visits and expanded cooperation
in the fields of politics, defense, economy, trade, science and
technology, culture, parliamentary affairs and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates Mexico's support to its efforts in
safeguarding national sovereignty and in reunifying the country,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a solid foundation for developing friendly relations
and cooperation between China and Mexico," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Zedillo said in his toast that his country
has been promoting its relations with China with unprecedented
efforts.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of China's role at the United Nations Security
Council, saying China represents the voice of the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said that Mexico has identical views with China on many
major international issues and both countries are willing to work
together for a more equitable international order.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang's state visit will help forge a firm and
lasting strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and Mexico all maintain that all
countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal
and should work together for the establishment of a new just and
equitable international order.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries can learn from each other because we both
have rich resources and a huge market, we both face the task of
developing national economy and improving the living standard of
the people, we both are striving for development in accordance
with our national conditions, and we both have accumulated our own
experience in national-building," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to build a cross-century partnership of
all-round cooperation with Mexico, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
As China and Mexico are two major developing nations across the
Pacific, developing a long-term, all-round and stable relationship
of friendly cooperation between the two countries is not only in
their fundamental interests, but also helps promote peace and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, he
said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Rejects Taiwan's Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Two major demands from
Taiwan in negotiating its future ties with South Africa are
"untenable" , Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
NZO made the statement at a press conference in the
headquarters of the African National Congress (ANC) in
Johannesburg, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said, Taiwan had asked to maintain its "symbols, flag and
name" at whatever premises their representatives continue to
occupy after 1997.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela announced last November
that his country would relinquish its diplomatic relations with
Taiwan in favour of the People's Republic of China at the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately that would mean maintaining its current
status," Nzo stressed, giving an overview of achievements by the
ANC-led government in international relations during the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Taiwan also wants to keep open its
three consulates in South Africa, a position that could only
apply when diplomatic relations existed between countries.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between South Africa and Taiwan on the nature of
their future relationship have been protracted, but agreement had
to be reached soon, Nzo said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slumps to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slumped
to a new four-year low as worse-than-expected domestic data
compounded the threat of a second wave of Asian currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Australian dollar finished the session at 67.83 U.S. cents,
from 67.88 U.S. cents late Monday.
</P>
<P>
It had fallen to 67.38 U.S. cents in overnight trading - the
lowest level since December 1993 - following the release of the
latest domestic current account figures.
</P>
<P>
Today's release of retail sales figures provided more bad news
for the local currency in a market which is looking increasingly
negative.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade fell 0.2 percent in October from September, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said. Market expectations
had centered on a rise of 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ABS also said building approvals rose 3.7 percent to 12,153
units in October. Economists had on average expected a rise of 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank foreign exchange dealer Nick Volanakis said
the market was very disappointed with the retail sales figures.
</P>
<P>
IBJ Australia Bank senior foreign exchange trader Darrin
Stewart said those figures, combined with the continuing adverse
outlook from Asia, drove the Australian dollar to its new low
overnight.
</P>
<P>
"This outlook is going to remain for the next few weeks, if not
months. The Australian dollar is going to suffer from the fallout
of the Asia crisis because we are talking about trade and that is
where the concern is," Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
At today's close, the Australian dollar finished at 87.07
against the Japanese yen from 86.69 Monday. It was at 1.2046
German marks, from 1.1980 Monday.

<P>
COLOMBO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has decided to spend
more than 20 million U.S. dollars to rehabilitate the main
petroleum facilities in Colombo, which were damaged in an
explosion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The China Huanqiu Chemical Engineering Corporation (HQCEC) and
the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) signed the contract for the
emergency rehabilitation project here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The HQCEC won over all the other 86 international bidders to be
the sole contractor of the project.
</P>
<P>
The value of the contract is 21.8 million US dollars.
Meanwhile, the CPC is also planning to build infrastructure
facilities related to the project, putting the overall cost to
around 50.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the Chinese company is to build some new
oil tanks while rehabilitating other tanks that were damaged in
the explosion on October 20, 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, HQCEC President He Lishan assured the
Sri Lankan side that his company will finish the project ahead of
schedule with high quality and low cost.

to improve fuel distribution. A mini-terminal will be built at
Sapugaskanda, near Colombo, to this effect.

<HEADLINE> Former Boxing Champion Dies after Falling into Coma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Edwin Rosario, former boxing
champion, died Monday night, just months after a comeback fight
that he said would mark the end of his cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
A local TV report said the 34-year-old boxer died of a drug
overdose, but Rosario's Wilfredo Vazquez denied, saying "he was in
good health and strong but, sadly, he died tonight."
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the cause of death would not be known until
an autopsy was performed.
</P>
<P>
Promoter Felix Zabala said Rosario was training for a January
fight in Miami and had passed drug tests administered by the
boxing commissions in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Rosario complained of illness on Monday night and never waked
up in his sleep before his parents found him in a coma. He died
before receiving any medical care.
</P>
<P>
Rosario was one of the world's top boxers in the 1980s. His
wife divorced him for his cocaine addict.
</P>
<P>
In June, he staged a comeback in his hometown of Bayamon,
knocking out Maurice Patterson in four rounds, followed by a
third-round stoppage of James Moody in Miami. The two victories
pushed his career record to 40-6 with 35 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
Rosario stopped Akinou Hiranaka for the WBA junior-welterweight
crown in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Alberto Parreira, who took
Brazil to its fourth World Cup success in 1994, is set to sign
with Saudi Arabia for the World Cup finals next year.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Brazilian is expected to earn an estimated half
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"They are still discussing the final points of the contract,
but it should be sealed in the next few weeks," said an Asian
football official.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Saudis sacked their Portuguese coach Eduardo
Vingada after his side's narrow 1-0 victory over Qatar in a World
Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by German Otto Pfeister, who guided the Saudis
to the World Cup finals in France next year.
</P>
<P>
But Pfeister, who is in charge of the Saudi Olympic team, was
seen as an interim coach for the Saudi squad.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Parreira took the Saudis to the Asian
championship and it would be his second term of head of the Saudi
squad.

HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the 307
schools in total in Hong Kong will use Chinese for teaching all
academic subjects in the next two years, progressing each year to
a higher level, according to a press release available here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 100 secondary schools will continue
teaching in English in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) in the coming academic year, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Vetting Committee, set up in October, announced that the
100 schools met the requirements for using English as the medium
of instruction.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, there were calls for more mother-tongue
teaching in secondary schools, aimed at helping students learn
more effectively.
</P>
<P>
All this showed that the SAR government has paid great
attention to school teaching in both Chinese and English, with the

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua)-- Sixty people were gunned down
by a private army of landowners in Lakshmanpur Bathe village of
Bihar state in eastern India late Monday night, Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is the worst-ever mass killing in Bihar state since 1988
when 42 people were killed by ultra-left activists in
Dalelchak-Baghora village.
</P>
<P>
About 300 members of the outlawed private army Ranvir Sena with
firearms swooped on the Lakshmanpur Bathe village around 22:30
local time and indulged in killing for nearly two hours in
gruesome culmination of the running feud between landowners and
ultra-left activists.
</P>
<P>
The village is suspected to be sympathizer of the outlawed
ultra-left outfit, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Before the massacre, a number of clashes between the two groups
had been reported from the region.
</P>
<P>
Home commissioner and director general of police from the
divisional and district headquarters have rushed to the spot.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Slightly Higher on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Share prices moved in a
narrow range on the Singapore market today with the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials gaining 3.07 points to close at 1697.26.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices finished higher on random
institutional buying of selected blue chips. Gains were
liquidity-driven as cash-rich fund managers hunted for stocks to
park their money in, they observed.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned that the market was far from seeing a
turnaround, as uncertainty prevailed in the region amid confusion
over the bailout package of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume increased to 161.97 million units, valued
at 349.4 million Singapore dollars (about 218.38 million U.S.
dollars). Advances overtook declines by 182 to 152, while 284
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 12.32 million units. It was followed by
Rekapac which had 9.57 million shares traded. Inno-Pacific was
next with 8.52 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1.1 dollars to finish at 23.1 Singapore
dollars. The Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) Foreign
and the United Overseas Bank (UOB) Foreign increased by 85 cents
each to end at 10.8 and 10.7 Singapore dollars respectively. The
DBS (Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) Foreign gained 60 cents
to close at 15.8 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 2.1 dollars to end at 41.1 Singapore dollars. Hume
fell by 1.13 dollars to close at 1.75 dollars, while Asean Fund
was 30 cents lower finishing at 8.7 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australia Releases National Defense Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia released its
national defense policy here today, foreshadowing extensive
upgrading of its armed forces to make it more capable of defending
national interests beyond the coastline.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the review of Australia's strategic circumstances,
Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said the document went a step
beyond previous reviews in which it detailed a rigorous set of
priorities for force development.
</P>
<P>
The top priority for the Australian Defense Force (ADF) is
maintaining the ability to operate smarter than any likely
adversary, exploiting information technology to allow Australia's
small forces to be used to maximum effect, said the review, titled
"Australia's Strategic Policy".
</P>
<P>
That includes intelligence, surveillance communications and
command systems.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has already approved 5 billion
Australian dollars (3.5 billion US dollars) worth of spending to
improve existing capabilities and to acquire new capabilities
including up to seven of the long-awaited airborne early warning
and control aircraft, rather than four previously proposed.
</P>
<P>
The second priority is for development of capabilities to
defeat threats in maritime approaches, including upgrading of
guided missile frigates and submarines.
</P>
<P>
The third priority is the ability to strike at hostile forces
through retaining an upgraded F-111 fleet in service to the year
2020. It will be equipped with longer range stand-off missiles.
But the government has ruled out acquisition of long-range
Tomahawk missiles.
</P>
<P>
The fourth priority is development of land capabilities. Army
units will get more wheeled armored vehicles and a helicopter fire
support and reconnaissance capability.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the current defense budget, plus likely savings
from the defense reform program, would allow modernization of
existing equipment.
</P>
<P>
But it would not make it possible in the medium term to develop
major new capabilities such as new fighters or warships.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed our strategic geography dictates that we should plan on
more pro-active operations which focus on defeating attacks in our
maritime and air approaches before they reach Australian
territory."
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the review identified no immediate threats and
confirmed that Australia was one of the most secure countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
This year's defense budget was one of the very few that escaped
axe by the Australian government eager to eliminate its budget
deficit.

<HEADLINE> Bushfires Leave 2 Australian Firefighters Dead, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Two Australian firefighters
died and two were injured today as 200 bushfires fanned by strong
winds burned out of control across New South Wales (NSW) state and
licked at Sydney's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
At Lithgow, west of Sydney, two people lost their lives in a
fire which swept over the coalmining town, the Australian
Associated Press quoted police and Rural Fire Service spokesmen as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The fire was currently burning on both sides of the Great
Western Highway and homes on the northern side of the town had
been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Dry and hot summer weather was blamed for the bushfire.
</P>
<P>
NSW Bush Fire Services acting assistant commissioner Mary Anne
Carmichael said two firefighters had been injured at the Pilliga
fire west of Coonabarabran, in the northern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
The Rural Fire Service said the country towns of Coonabarabran
and Lithgow and the Sydney suburbs of Menai, Lucas Heights,
Thornleigh and Normanhurst were emerging as the worst trouble
spots as more than 130 fires continued to burn around the state.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight aircraft were in the air and 4,500 firefighters
deployed statewide to battle the blazes.
</P>
<P>
On Sydney's southern fringe, two major fires and numerous spot
fires were threatening homes in the Sutherland Shire and another
blaze was out of control near the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
In northern NSW a huge fire was continuing to menace the towns
of Coonabarabran and Narrabri.
</P>
<P>
The fire had burned out 180,000 hectares of bushland and had
been close to being controlled until fresh outbreaks today.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Questions U.S.-backed African Peace Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state, General
Sani Abacha Monday faulted the proposed African conflict response
initiative which is being sponsored by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Although some African states have already chosen to
participate in the training program, Abacha said, it would have
been more far-reaching if the initiative is managed by the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Without the participation of Nigeria, he noted, such an
initiative would be fatally-flawed and inappropriate, considering
Nigeria's outstanding role in both sub-regional and global
peace-keeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
Abacha made the comments in Abuja while opening a conference
on "military democracy and security in sub-Saharan Africa."
</P>
<P>
"I can not say that Nigeria would necessarily have accepted
the proposal, but it does seem inappropriate in view of our role
in ECOMOG (west African peace-keeping force) and long history
of peace-keeping under the U.N. auspices, that we have not been
invited to join the discussion on it," he was quoted by The
Guardian newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abacha noted that Nigeria's vision for the peace and security
of the sub-region and the rest of the sub-Saharan Africa is a
strong, resilient, confident and assertive multi-national
regional peace-keeping force such as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The concept of an African high command, he continued, had been
mooted for decades, resulting in a litany of reasons why it is
not practicable. But recent experience has shown that
sub-regional efforts, as in west and central Africa, might
provide a better answer.

SHIJIAZHUANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Farmers on the outskirts
of Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province, are
getting access to benefits such as old age insurance, minimum
living guarantees, medicare, disaster relief loans which were
previously enjoyed only by urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The local government has raised the poverty line from 120 yuan
per month in 1996 to 140 yuan this year. Farmers living under this
poverty line will be given an extra allowance. More than 400
people living below the poverty line on the outskirts of
Shijiazhuang have received allowances.
</P>
<P>
So far, 230,000 farmers in the city's suburbs have participated
in the old-age insurance system with premiums totaling 22 million
yuan; and 519 people aged 60 or above have received 170,000 yuan in
old-age insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
About 190,000 of the 200,000 farmers in the suburbs have bought
medicare insurance.
</P>
<P>
Disaster relief loans also are available. In August of 1996, a
devastating flood struck the city's suburbs. The local government
offered 1.2 million yuan in relief funds and 100,000 kilograms of
relief grain to 5,000 disaster victims.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 2 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN finance ministers
and their counterparts from China, Japan, South Korea, Australia,
the United States and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
today agreed to work together towards a successful conclusion of
the WTO negotiations in financial services to enhance the
soundness of financial systems.
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed ASEAN's firm commitment to the
liberalization of financial services and to tabling offers before
the deadline of the conclusion of the negotiations in the WTO
(World Trade Organization), according to a statement issued here
today after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to support measures to strengthen the financial
resources and institutional capabilities of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank (WB) and Asian Development Bank
(ADB) working with the international regulatory bodies,
particularly in the areas of strengthening banking and financial
systems and deepening capital markets.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that there is an urgent need to develop a
deep, liquid and matured debt market in Asia to address the
intermediation problem.
</P>
<P>
They endorsed the initiative to develop a market-based approach
to mobilize private sector resources with the intermediation of
the international financial institutions to assist adjustments in
this region.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the ministers warmly welcomed the initiative of
Hong Kong to convene the first meeting of technical experts with
the assistance of international financial institutions to discuss
these ideas as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also endorsed and agreed on the rapid
implementation of the Manila Framework as a constructive step
towards promoting financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers noted in this regard that Japan would convene a
meeting of finance and central bank officials early next year to
carry forward the initiatives under the Manila Framework and work
closely with the IMF, WB, ADB and the international regular
bodies.
</P>
<P>
They noted the importance of sound, consistent and transparent
policies to promote efficient markets and emphasized the need for
greater transparency of capital markets and such efforts should be
implemented on a global basis and endorsed the IMF initiatives on
this matter.
</P>
<P>
They also recognized the need for enhancing and coordinating
supervision and prudential regulations given the importance of
raising prudential management in the private sector to enable them
to cope with the issues in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
They urged the IMF members to agree on early ratification of
the new arrangements to borrow and the agreement to increase IMF
quotas reached in Hong Kong recently.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also urged the IMF to work expeditiously towards
the establishment of a new quick disbursing short term facility.
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed the preliminary findings of a study carried
out by an IMF task force on the role of hedge funds in the recent
crisis in Southeast and Northeast Asia and looked forward to
receiving the full report.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the IMF to expand the scope of the study to
examine the structure of the global financial markets and short
term capital flows, including the impact of hedging activities on
the banking sector as well as the impact and implications of
technology on capital flows.
</P>
<P>
They recognized that in addressing the current financial
crisis, there was an equal urgent need for a balance between short
and long term measures to restore confidence.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in addition to the Manila Framework,
the focus on policy should also be on developing market-based
solutions to address the intermediation problems in the region.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also focus on strengthening domestic financial
systems to the deepening of financial markets and closer
collaborative efforts on financial regulations and supervision.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also noted that the process of surveillance
provided a mechanism for economies to identify areas that required
technical assistance to enhance the capacity of their domestic
financial systems to meet the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
They expressed support to strengthen training programs for
financial supervisors and urged closer collaboration among
international and regional training providers towards that
objective.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed support for South Korea's effort to put in
place a program of economic policies and structural reform to
restore financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the ministers were briefed by WB
officials on its perspective on recent events in Southeast and
Northeast Asia and the measures that would need to be undertaken
to restore confidence in those economies.
</P>
<P>
The WB also affirmed its support for the implementation of the
Manila Framework.

-- Bernard Kouchner, the State Secretary of Health, is working on
a plan on the treatment of drug addicts through new therapeutical
approach which allows the controlled distribution of heroin, a
therapeutical use of cannabis and an increase of the sites which
sell methadone, a potent narcotic analgesic drug which is used to
relieve severe pain. France has been carrying out a repressive law
against drug addicts since 1970, which punishes all drug addicts by
making all of them criminals or delinguents and allows judges to
give therapeutical injunctions.
</P>
<P>
-- The Spanish Supreme Court gave a severe verdict against 23
leaders of the Herri Batasuna (HB), the political wing of the Basque
separatist movement ETA, sentencing them all to seven years in
prison. The verdict cannot but revive the tension in the Basque
region of Spain. Inigo Iruin, one of the defense lawyers of the
convicted, said that he will resort to the Constitutional Tribunal
of Spain and the European Tribunal of Human Rights in protest of the
verdict.

born of foreign parents in France the right to obtain French
nationality at the age of 18, as long as they have lived in France

<P>
Turkey's Defense Industry Executive Board is scheduled to meet
December 9 to choose the project partner, local newspaper Daily

ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentary Secretary
Zaffar Ali shah said here today that the suspension of the 13th
Amendment to the Constitution is "illegal" and "unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement soon after a three-member bench headed by

When issuing the order, Sajjad Ali Shah said that Pakistan is
on the brink of a "constitutional breakdown." He said that it is
necessary to suspend the 13th Amendment.

<P>
However, another bench of the apex court headed by Justice
Saeed Uzzman Siddiqui rejected the order and suspended the

<HEADLINE> Arab World to Support China, G77 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and other Arab
countries will support the position of China and Group 77
countries to delay reducing greenhouse gas emissions till 2000 at
the world environment conference in Kyoto, Japan, the country's
Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Lebanese Environment Minister Akram Shuhayyeb,
leader of a United Arab delegation to the conference, as saying
that Lebanon and the Arab countries are against the U.S. proposal
to trade in emission rights.
</P>
<P>
"We are also calling for industrialized nations like the
U.S. to pay compensation to developing countries who will be most
affected by climate change, caused by the large emissions from
well-developed countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
As agreed in Bonn last October, he said, there will be one
united position for the developing countries. "We do not believe
countries like Lebanon or Egypt that contribute to 0.001 percent
of emissions must adhere to the same policies or cut backs as
industrial nations," Shuhayyeb said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the position of China and G-77, joint
implementation on emission cutbacks should only start after 2000,
"because if developing countries cut back now, it will leave some
poor countries without electricity, which is unfair," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the an important suggestion from the United Arab
delegation was that "agreement of the protocol or any other
legally binding clauses must be endorsed unanimously and not by a
majority vote."
</P>
<P>
The 10-day conference kicked off Monday, which is expected to see a
bitter war of words among delegates from all over the world on how
to curb the growing global warming trend.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the U.S. has recently announced a shift
in policy, declaring that it would consider setting different
targets levels for different countries instead of a uniform rate
among the 34 affected countries.

<HEADLINE> Historical Evidence of Chinese Sovereignty over Islands on South China Sea Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of a large number
of relics on Xisha Islands on the South China Sea has proven
China's sovereignty over all the islands on the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
A survey in April 1996 of 18 islands, 4 shoals, and 4 atolls of
Xisha Islands found 1,300 relics on land and nearly 500 relics
in the sea in eight different spots.
</P>
<P>
"Many items were left from ships that sank there, to the north,
east and west of the islands, on a line from central China to the
south," Song Xinchao, an official from the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics, said at the Conference on Archaeological Findings
held here recently.
</P>
<P>
The relics mainly consist of pottery and porcelain, the oldest
of them dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the archaeological discovery proves that
Xisha Islands were first discovered by the Chinese, who have
developed the South China Sea region since the Tang Dynasty, at
the latest, and provides irrefutable evidence that Xisha
Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Most of the relics came from Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and
Jiangxi provinces, according to their design.
</P>
<P>
Underwater archaeological work was a major part of the study,
Song said, and many stone sculptures, pieces of pottery and
porcelain from the Ming and Qing dynasties were found during the
survey.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Once Robust Czech Economy Suffers Down Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Once acclaimed as a tiger among
the region's economies and the symbol of a new Central Europe, the
Czech economy has taken a sharp downturn this year to face
unprecedented difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The tiger, if it really has ever been, rose to its paws after
successive years of economic recession in 1991 through 1993, when
the gross domestic product (GDP) was down by 14.2 percent, 6.4
percent and 0.9 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
After the initial pains believed to be brought about by the
country's economic transformation, the Czech economy returned to
the growth path in 1994, resulting in a 4.8 percent GDP growth in
1995 and a 4.4 percent growth in the year after.
</P>
<P>
However, beginning early this year, the overall economic
performance has retreated from what was considered the relatively
better off state among Central and East Europe nations, the growth
lost its momentum, and problems, micro and macro, showed up.
</P>
<P>
As indicated by official data, the Czech Republic's economic
growth this year will be no more than 1.8 percent, or less than
half of the government's earlier projection, and much lower than
that of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia or other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of the year, while the country's
manufacturing sector grew by only 0.5 percent over the same period
of 1996, its construction sector shrank by 0.5 percent and the
inflation rate climbed to two digits to stay at 10.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the republic's foreign trade deficit is likely to
reach 139 billion crowns (about 4.21 billion U.S. dollars), or 5.7
percent of the GDP, by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
And already recognized, by popular standards, as an alarming
high is its public sector foreign debt of total 21.2 billion
dollars, which is equivalent to 43 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate of 4.8 percent has
been an all-time high. And huge budgetary deficit, together with
decreased foreign reserves, has driven the historically strong
crown down by more than 20 percent, to the current exchange rate
of 33 crowns for 1 dollar.
</P>
<P>
Facing up with such a grave situation, the Czech government
adopted a series of economic austerity measures, first time in
April and again in May, including increasing government revenues,
cutting spendings and curbing foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
But so far none of these measures have appeared to be working
as expected.
</P>
<P>
The worsening economy has increasingly alienated the Czech
people and further undermined the country's political stability,
resulting in the resignation of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and
his cabinet on November 30.
</P>
<P>
Behind the Czech Republic's economic decline are a number of
causes.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it's the inadequate economic guidelines and policies
to be blamed. The Klaus administration, a strong advocate of
market economy, relied too heavily on the so-called "market force"
and gave up too much in exerting macroeconomic controls.
</P>
<P>
While the framework of a market economy was in place, a series
of facilitating measures were lagging behind, and legislative and
judicial efforts were too weak to check the rise of economic
crimes, such as graft, embezzlement and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
To make it worse, over a dozen of banks went bankrupt, leading
to the confusion on the capital and financial market.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the government didn't have a clearly defined
industrial policy, the physical and financial infrastructure was
obsolete, many economic sectors still stayed in the shadow of the
old production system, and microeconomic mechanisms were prone to
numerous problems.
</P>
<P>
While the government claims that the private sector now account
for 85 percent of the GDP, analysts point out that a sizable
proportion of the country's big businesses are still under the
state control, and deep-rooted problems of the economic structure
are yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
As industrial restructuring has been progressing rather slowly,
business managers are more inclined to take short-term measures to
boost performances and invest little in technical renovation
programs. As results, their products often lack of competitiveness
and are hardly marketable overseas, and over one-third of all
industrial enterprises are reporting losses.
</P>
<P>
Seven years after embarking on the market economy path, the
overall Czech economy is still below what it used to be before the
transformation period. In the industrial sector, the output in
1996 was only 82 percent of the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
To walk out from the economic difficulties and regain the
momentum for growth, economists here said, the Czech government
has to give priorities to speeding up the renovation of the
country's state businesses, specialized banks and social security
systems.

<HEADLINE> Justice Ajmal Takes over Control of Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Justice Ajmal Mian, the
second most senior judge in Pakistan's Supreme Court, has taken
over the administrative and judicial control of the apex court.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member bench of the Supreme Court led by Justice Saeed
Uzzaman Siddiqui today ordered the President to appoint Justice
Ajmal Mian as acting Chief Justice for being the most senior judge
and in the meantime directed Mian to discharge duties of the Chief
Justice including constitution of the benches.
</P>
<P>
"Pursuant to the judicial order passed on December 2, 1997, by
a bench of this court comprising ten learned judges, I order the
fixation of roster from December 3, 1997," said an order signed by
Justice Ajmal Mian directing Registrar of the Court for
compliance.
</P>
<P>
The order came after a three-member bench headed by Chief
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah suspended the 13th Amendment to the
Constitution restoring the presidential powers to dissolve the
National Assembly and dismiss government.
</P>
<P>
However, minutes after the order by Sajjad, the rival 10-member
bench headed by Justice Siddiqui overturned the ruling, upholding
the constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
the rival bench at the same time also ordered the suspension of
the appointment of Sajjad Ali Shah as the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The government-judicial tussle, which has lasted for more than
three months and has intensified in recent weeks, has virtually
put Pakistan in an unprecedented constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Bar Association of the Supreme Court has expressed its
support to the suspension of the 13th Amendment of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
the Bar Association of the apex court in a statement today
accused the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of splitting
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
However, Parliamentary Secretary Zaffar Ali Shah said the
suspension of the 13th Amendment is "illegal" and
"unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
The move by Sajjad Ali Shah was aimed at creating "chaos" in
the country, Zaffar added.
</P>
<P>
The order by the three-member bench said, "There is complete
breakdown of the constitutional machinery and it appears that the
government is not being run according to the provisions of the
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
But the rival 10-member bench rejected the order and suspended
the appointment of Sajjad Ali Shah as the Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which was passed by the
two Houses of the Parliament in April this year, took away the
powers of the President to dissolve the National Assembly and
dismiss government.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bar Association of the
Supreme Court has expressed its support to the suspension of the
13th Amendment of the Constitution by a three-member bench led by
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali shah.
</P>
<P>
The Bar Association of the Supreme Court made a statement

</P>
<P>
However, another bench of the apex court headed by Justice

appointment of Sajjad Ali Shah as the Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which was passed by the
two Houses of the Parliament in April this year, took away the
powers of the President to dissolve the National Assembly and
government.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment repealed some controversial items, or the
notorious 8th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
The 8th Amendment was passed in 1985 during the marshal law by
late president Zia ul Haq. It stipulates that the president has
the powers to dissolve the National Assembly when the president
feels it is not working under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the 8th Amendment of the Constitution, the president also
has the power to dissolve a government when he feels it is not
working in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, there are altogether four elected governments which
were dissolved by the president under the 8th Amendment of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif assumed the premiership in February this year
after staying more than three years in the opposition when his
Pakistan Muslim League (N) won a landslide victory in the national
elections.
</P>
<P>
Taking the advantage of an overwhelming majority in the
National Assembly as well as in the Senate, the government passed
the 13 Amendment of the Constitution, depriving the president of
the powers to dissolve the National Assembly and government.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Push OIC Summit to Create Common Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- In order to improve economic
cooperation among the Islamic countries, Iran will push the
forthcoming summit of Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC)
to create an Islamic common market.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see this common market created and hope
that agreement in this regard will be reached during the OIC
summit," Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs
Mahmoud Vaezi was quoted today by local daily Iran News as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite various difficulties, Iran hopes the
issue of Islamic common market will be discussed at the eighth
OIC summit due to be held here on December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the OIC summit, Iran has decided to hold
an Islamic trade fair in Tehran as a measure to push the OIC
members to consider the issue of Islamic common market.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair was aimed at preparing grounds for the
formation of the Islamic common market, executive director of the
trade fair Akbar Nematollahi said last month.
</P>
<P>
He said that a dozen of countries as well as the Islamic
Development Bank and some U.N.-afflicted institutions will take
part in the fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair will be held on December 4-15 in five sections,
including industry and mines, agriculture and cattle breeding,
industrial and scientific research section, culture, arts and
communications, and trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic countries enjoy about 70 percent of the world's
energy reserves, 30 percent of world's natural gas reserves, 70
percent of phosphate resources and 42 percent of world oil
exports, according to Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
However, Vaezi noted that the OIC members were facing serious
difficulties to form the Islamic common market, one of them is
that the OIC members are not all at the same level of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"We are also aware that a mere agreement (at the OIC summit)
will not necessarily result in the actual formation of such a
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the Islamic countries would hopefully reach
a consensus regarding the issue of Islamic common market through
various meetings at the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi also cited the European Common Market as an example,
saying that the European Common Market is still pursuing its
objectives despite the existing conflicts among its members.
</P>
<P>
Iran, during its tenure as the OIC chairman following the OIC
summit, will endeavor to translate the summit's decisions into
practical measures, bringing the stances and points of view of
the member states closer together, he added.

NAIROBI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways won a 52.9
percent increase in its before-tax profit for the first half of
the current fiscal year starting from March, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The national carrier earned a before-tax profit of 821 million
Shillings (13.7 million U.S. Dollars) between March and
September, compared with 537 million Shillings (nine million
Dollars) over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The company posted a turnover of 5.75 billion Shillings during
the six months compared to 5.08 billion for the same period last
year, which represented a 13.2 percent increase, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The earnings per share improved from 80 cents in the first
half of last year to 1.17 Shillings from March to September, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, the company's revenue
estimatedly rose to 5.7 billion Shillings (89 million U.S.
Dollars) from five billion Shillings (78 million Dollars) in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, revenue from passenger ticket sales increased by
12.8 percent from 4.01 billion Shillings to 4.53 billion
Shillings while cargo generated 662 million Shillings, up 6.8
percent from 620 million Shillings from March to September in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The airline made a gain of 186 million Shillings on foreign
exchange movement from March to September due to the rapid
depreciation of the Shilling against the hard currencies as a
result of political unrests in the country ahead of general
elections set for December 29.

ANKARA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is considering to upgrade
its aged F-5 fighters and will appoint a foreign company next week
to do the job.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Defense Industry Executive Board is scheduled to meet
December 9 to choose the project partner, local newspaper Daily
News today quoted senior officials from the General Staff as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi are expected to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A board's meeting held in mid-October favored Israeli and
Singaporean companies in the project which involves 48 F-5 planes.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, however, reacted strongly to the result, saying that
the project should be given to France as Paris is a key supporter
of Turkey' European Union membership bid.
</P>
<P>
France, a co-producer of the Airbus planes, was disappointed
with Turkey's recent decision to buy 26 Boeing 737 aircraft from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Western countries supply nearly 80 percent of the arms of the
Turkish armed forces, a strong power in the region, official

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Aid Kenya in Speeding up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will provide
Kenya a credit of 1.4 billion Shillings (24 million U.S. Dollars)
next year to help speed up the privatization of government-owned
institutions, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The faster pace of privatization will free funds formerly tied
up in non-performing assets while reducing the drain on the
treasury by those parastatals, said Ian Knapp, leader of the team
in charge of privatization and civil service reform at the bank's
Nairobi office.
</P>
<P>
Privatization would play a big role in poverty alleviation
since the privatized institutions are much more productive
without being a burden on public funds, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As many as 159 enterprises have already been privatized in
Kenya which has a total of 207 government-owned institutions.
</P>
<P>
For the further move, the privatization of the Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (OBTC) is expected to be the
biggest of all and may be launched soon after the elections set
for December 29.
</P>
<P>
The partial divestiture of the government from Kenya
Commercial Bank will also take place next year, with the
government further reducing its 60 percent shareholding by an
additional 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
A recent study of ten of the privatized companies has showed
that the number of employees rose by 120 percent while their
salaries shot up by 170 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports also jumped by 380 percent while all other indicators
pointed to an across-the-board improvement in performance, the
study showed.
</P>
<P>
The burden on Kenya's exchequer arising from sustaining
parastatals dropped sharply from 2.25 billion Shillings (38.6
million Dollars) in 1992 to about 500 million Shillings (8.6
million Dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Systematic Defects Blamed for Mashaal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Fundamental defects were
found in the functioning of Israeli secret intelligence Mossad by
Israeli Knesset (parliament) committee investigating the Mashaal
Affair, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Knesset committee on secret services
finished on Monday the first stage of its investigation into the
bungled assassination of Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal,
which was carried out by Mossad on September 25 in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The committee issued a statement saying that the
decision-making process in the government's upper echleon was
faulty, and that nobody involved in the planning of the affair had
warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that carrying out an
attack in Jordan could have serious diplomatic ramifications.
</P>
<P>
"So far, significant deficiencies were noted in the functioning
of the bodies involved. Some of the problems identified by the
committee are fundamental and have accompanied activities -- at
all levels -- for a period of time," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee recommended that at this stage there is
no need for action to be taken against anyone involved in the
affair.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of this stage of its work, the committee is
convinced that changes should be considered in some fields of
operation, but there is no place for drawing personal conclusions
against those involved," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
It added that "the committee will continue to examine
wide-ranging aspects of this issue. It will make its conclusions
and present the principal recommendations in a classified report."
</P>
<P>
The botched attempt in Amman soured Israel's relations with
Jordan. Two Israeli agents were taken prisoner, and in return
for their release, Israel had to free Hamas founder Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin and dozens of other Palestinian and Jordanian
prisoners.

<HEADLINE> China Has Stepped Up Anti-doping Battle, Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- China has stepped up the
anti-doping campaign through clear stipulation, tight check and
harsh penalty, Chinese sports official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have increased greatly the number of drug checks in the
year of 1997," said Professor Yang Tianle, member of the Chinese
Olympic Committee's Medical Commission and co-founder of the
Beijing Drug-testing Laboratory which is sanctioned by the
International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
In swimming alone, 576 tests, including 397 out-of-competition
checks, had been taken from January 1 to October 30 this year and
none turned out positive, said Yang, also member of the IOC
Medical Commission.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Chinese swimmers had taken 293 drug tests, with 153
conducted out of competition, China's leading drug fighter said.
</P>
<P>
The 24 IOC-sanctioned labs in the world had done a total of
3,757 tests on swimmers in 1996 and as Yang predicts, this year's
total remains that many.
</P>
<P>
"In the number of tests on swimmers, few countries can compete
with China in the year of 1997," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Australia, hailed as vanguard in the battle against drugs,
registered 220 tests on swimmers from July 1996 to June 1997, with
102 done out of competition.
</P>
<P>
In the sports as a whole, 3,349 doping checks, including 1,733
flight tests, had been done on Chinese athletes in the past 10
months and the numbers for 1994-1996 had risen from 1,292 to 1,914
and to 2,080 last year, the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
The numbers of flight tests for 1994-1996 were 526, 708 and
1,115, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that China's percentage of positive case was lower
than international average mark. "In 1995, seven out of 1,000
cases were positive, the rate lower than 1.37% internationally,"
he said. "We got 0.5% in 1996 against 1.63% internationally and
0.63% in 1997."
</P>
<P>
Australia recorded 1.14 in the percentage of positive case in
1996, with Japan at 1.28, France 4.06 and Canada 4.32, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Yang stressed that China welcomes flight tests on Chinese
athletes by world sports ruling bodies.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome out-of-competition drug checks by international
federations, but double standard must not be applied," he said.
</P>
<P>
Doping charges against Chinese swimmers surfaced during
October's Chinese Eighth National Games which saw two world
records tumbled in the pool.
</P>
<P>
Australian swimming head coach Don Talbot accused Chinese
swimmers of taking drugs, inviting criticism from both the
Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) and the International Swimming
Federation (FINA).
</P>
<P>
John Coates, AOC president and one of Australia's two IOC
members, said that Talbot's charge was groundless.
</P>
<P>
FINA general secretary Gunnar Werner noted that Australians'
allegation against Chinese came out because they felt threatened.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little surprised about Don Talbot. Usually he is very
balanced. Maybe he is under pressure from the other coaches in
Australia," Werner told an Australian radio on October 21.
</P>
<P>
Yang was indignant with the smear campaign kicked off by a few
coaches.
</P>
<P>
"You can't sling mud at athletes who have achieved good
results," he said. "Before you have evidence, you had better keep
your mouth shut."
</P>
<P>
Shi Kangcheng, other member of the Chinese Olympic Committee's
Anti-doping Commission, refuted the charge that China encouraged
systematic doping.
</P>
<P>
"The allegation of systematic doping is sheer fabrication," he
said. "China only has systematic anti-doping."
</P>
<P>
For those caught dopers and coaches held responsible, harsh
punishment is unavoidable, Shi noted.
</P>
<P>
"The whole club will be banned for one year if it registers two
positive cases," he added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Centennial Commemoration Honoring Rewi Alley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 500 Chinese and foreign
personages gathered in the Great Hall of the People here today to
mark the 100th Birth Anniversary of Rewi Alley, a famous New
Zealand writer, educator and social activist.
</P>
<P>
Alley came to China in 1927. Since then, he had lived in the
country for 60 years before he passed away 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
After his death, late Deng Xiaoping once wrote of
Alley: "Eternity to the Great Internationalist Fighter". Premier
Li Peng, in his inscription for today's commemorative meeting,
described Alley as "A Man of Lofty Merits and A Glorious Example",
while Vice-Premier Qian Qichen referred to Ally as "A Loyal
Fighter and An Ambassador of Friendship".
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
and member of the Central Committee Secretariat, attended the
commemorative meeting. Prior to the meeting, he met with a New
Zealand delegation of noted figures, led by former
Governor-General Paul Reeves, and members of Alley's family.
</P>
<P>
Hu praised Alley's outstanding contribution to the Chinese
revolution and the nation's construction, as well as his unique
role in promoting understanding and friendship between the peoples
of China and New Zealand, and among the people throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
The centennial meeting was sponsored by the Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. Association
President Qi Huaiyuan, Reeves and members of Alley's family
reviewed Alley's glorious life.
</P>
<P>
Alley joined other foreigners and patriotic Chinese in
establishing the Gung Ho Movement in Shanghai in 1937, at the very
beginning of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against
Japanese Aggression.
</P>
<P>
He later served as general-manager of the Association of
Chinese Industrial Cooperatives established in Wuhan in 1938. Over
3,000 cooperatives across China provided badly needed uniforms,
blankets, weapons and ammunition for soldiers at the front.
</P>
<P>
In response to Alley's suggestion, the Association of Chinese
Industrial Cooperatives resumed activities in 1983, following some
30 years of inactivity. The association proceeded to establish
more than 200 industrial cooperatives to promote the growth of
China's socialist economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Since the 1980s, China's
Guangdong Province has found more effective ways to protect its
wildlife by establishing special organizations at different levels
in charge of wild life protection.
</P>
<P>
The province is home to 117 wild animals that are under state
protection, and has 100 species of endangered rare plants, and 130
animal breeding centers.
</P>
<P>
It has set up 28 nature reserves measuring 187,000 hectares in
all, or 1.05 percent of the province's total area.
</P>
<P>
These reserves have done a great deal in promoting wildlife
protection, research, education, and international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has made March 20 to 26 the time of its annual "Bird
Festival" and "Love Birds Week" and has made November the month of
publicizing wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 cases of illegal selling of rare animals have
been dealt with since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Making Greater Profits out of Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- If you want to make more money
out of corn, you could do worse than studying the method of the
Lianfa Company in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
By wrapping a head of corn in a plastic coating and freezing
it, the company kept the freshness and extended marketing time by
a few months, and managed to sell half a pound of corn at 3.5 yuan
(0.42 US dollars), about the same as the price of pork. The usual
price for the same amount of corn is 0.6 to 0.7 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lianfa, of Zhengzhou City, sold eight million head of corn from
the 1996 autumn harvest wrapped in this way in big cities like
Guangzhou and Tianjin during the Spring Festival last year.
</P>
<P>
The company has grown over 333 hectares of corn this autumn for
greater profits.
</P>
<P>
And, the good thing is that the cost is minimal, since the
wrapping costs only 0.08 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Merge Exchange Rates in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Paul Ogwuma, Governor of the
Central Bank of Nigeria has revealed that the official and
autonomous foreign exchange rates of the local currency Naira
would be unified next year, according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure you that by next year, we should have a
unified exchange rate of the Naira," the country's number one
banker said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under Nigeria's dual exchange rate system, all government
transactions with the Central Bank are retained at the official
exchange rate of 22 Naira to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all other commercial transactions depend on the
autonomous foreign exchange market introduced in 1995 for the
green back at a rate which has remained at an average of about 82
Naira to one dollar this year.
</P>
<P>
But it turns out that the target beneficiaries of the scheme,
namely, the industrial sector, has become the ultimate loser, as
the people who buy foreign exchange at the autonomous market are
only interested in reselling at higher rates at the black market,
or parallel market as it is called locally.
</P>
<P>
This subsequently gave rise to public criticisms of the dual
exchange rates and calls for their merger.
</P>
<P>
The expected unification of the two rates and a liberalized
trade and exchange system would ultimately lead to the full
convertibility of the Naira, said the Central Bank governor.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government plans to stabilize the
exchange rate at 75 Naira to one dollar by gradual strengthening
of the local currency at the foreign exchange autonomous market
where the Central Bank sells dollar to other commercial banks
once a week.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate at the market hovered between one dollar for
80 Naira between 1995 and early 1997 but later depreciated to 85
Naira. The current rate stands at 79 Naira to one dollar.

BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said today that mutually beneficial Sino-Singaporean cooperation
is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and is
conducive to peace, stability and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark during a meeting with Singaporean Senior
Minister Lee Kuan.
</P>
<P>
Li extended a warm welcome to the Singaporean minister and
noted that China and Singapore established diplomatic ties seven
years ago. He pointed to the fact that bilateral relations have
witnessed substantial development, and noted increasingly active
cooperation and exchanges in various fields, as well as fruitful
results in economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li also pointed to the financial turmoil which has hit
Southeast Asia this year, and stressed that China will continue to
strengthen reciprocal cooperation with nations in the region,
including Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said the current situation will require concerned countries
to strengthen communications and coordinations in order to raise
friendly cooperation to a new plateau.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lee said the fact that he discovers new
achievements in China's economic construction and new progress in
the social undertakings with each successive visit to the country
is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Various east Asian countries are facing severe difficulties
derived from the financial crisis, while China has maintained a
stable economic situation and avoided any harmful effects,
according to Lee. This demonstrates that Chinese leaders have
correctly handled policies and are truly deserving of
congratulations, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier briefed Lee on the success of the 15th
National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and the nation's
reform and opening efforts.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that construction of the industrial park in Suzhou,
the largest cooperative project between the two governments, is
progressing smoothly due to the efforts of both governments.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government attaches great importance to
building the park and will continue to offer its full support for
the project. Li also expressed hope that the two governments will

<HEADLINE> Establishment of Crocodile Farms Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
should cooperate with the international community in establishing
crocodile farms in buffer zones so as to protect both the river
reptile and people, said a wildlife official.
</P>
<P>
The official was commenting on the measures being taken by the
Sumbawanga District Council to kill crocodiles which made
frequent attacks on local residents.
</P>
<P>
Hashim Mbonde, director of Hambo Crocodile Farm, said last
weekend that he has been issued a permit by the district council
to kill about 200 crocodiles in Lake Rukwa as one of the measures
to check the growing threat of crocodile attacks, The Guardian
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"To solve the problem, the government, in collaboration with
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO), should encourage the local people to start crocodile
farms," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Through cooperation with the international community, the
government could successfully establishing crocodile farms
instead of hunting them.
</P>
<P>
He said the hunting of crocodiles could endanger the species
whose population is put at 150,000.
</P>
<P>
"The number of crocodiles in Tanzania is declining, thus the
hunting exercise could make the species perish," Mbonde warned.
</P>
<P>
According to him, countries with big number of crocodiles
agreed in 1990 to encourage local people to start crocodile
farms.
</P>
<P>
The FAO is to cooperate with countries concerned to launch
crocodile farms but so far only five farms have been established
in Tanzania. They are in Dar es Salaam, Ifakara, Rukwa and
Rufiji.
</P>
<P>
Young crocodiles should be taken from the reserves in buffer
zones and be domesticated, said the wildlife official, adding
that within three years, the problem of crocodile attacks will be
resolved.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Bar Association Supports Chief Justice Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bar Association of the
Supreme Court has expressed its support to the suspension of the
13th Amendment of the Constitution by a three-member bench led by
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali shah.
</P>
<P>
The Bar Association of the Supreme Court made a statement
today, accusing the Government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of
splitting the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
However, Parliamentary Secretary Zaffar Ali shah said the
suspension of the 13th Amendment is "illegal" and
"unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
The move by Sajjad Ali Shah was aimed at creating "chaos" in
the country, Zaffar added.
</P>
<P>
An order issued earlier today by the three-member bench headed
by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah said, "there is complete
breakdown of the constitutional machinery and it appears that the
government is not being run according to the provisions of the
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
However, another bench of the apex court headed by Justice
Saeed Uzzman Siddiqui toppled the order and asked to suspend the
appointment of Sajjad Ali Shah as the Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which was passed by the
two Houses of the Parliament in April this year, took away the
powers of the President to dissolve the National Assembly and
government.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment repealed some controversial items, or the
notorious 8th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
The 8th Amendment was passed in 1985 during the marshal law by
late president Zia ul Haq. It stipulates that the president has
the powers to dissolve the National Assembly when the president
feels it is not working under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the 8th Amendment of the Constitution, the president also
has the power to dissolve a government when he feels it is not
working in accordance with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, there are altogether four elected governments which
were dissolved by the president under the 8th Amendment of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif assumed the premiership in February this year
after staying more than three years in the opposition when his
Pakistan Muslim League (N) won a landslide victory in the national
elections.
</P>
<P>
Taking the advantage of an overwhelming majority in the
National Assembly as well as in the Senate, the government passed
the 13 Amendment of the Constitution, depriving the president of
the powers to dissolve the National Assembly and government.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process Increases Polarization in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Oslo peace process has
widened the gap between sections of Israeli population, a
polarization that weakens society and undermines its ability to
achieve peace with its neighbors, a survey published today said.
</P>
<P>
The research, published by local English daily The Jerusalem
Post today, was conducted by Dr. Tamar Hermann and Professor
Ephraim Yaar of Tel Aviv University's Steinmetz Center for Peace
Research on the relations between secular and religious
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The research was also based on the August and October's "Peace
Index" findings, which reflected the Israeli society's attitude
toward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The study, which surveyed 504 people with a 4 percent margin
of error, showed erosion in relations between secular and
religious Israelis in the wake of the Oslo peace process since
it began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A total of 47.6 percent of secular Israelis and 59.1 percent
of religious Israelis said they believed the peace process has
caused a "distancing" between the two sections of the Israeli
society.
</P>
<P>
The findings showed an evenly divided society on the Oslo
process, as 55.6 percent secular respondents favor the Oslo
accords, while 59.1 percent of those observant religious oppose
them.
</P>
<P>
It also found that 70 percent of those polled believe the
influence of the religious political bloc is too strong;
surprisingly, about 60 percent of the religious respondents agree
with this view.
</P>
<P>
The current Likud-led rightwing-religious coalition is under
heavy influence of the religious parties, which oppose making
major concessions according to the widely-accepted "land for
peace" principle, which is the corner-stone of the Oslo
process.
</P>
<P>
Since the Likud government came to power in June last year,
the peace process has been in deep trouble, leading to
increasing tensions with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven percent of those polled termed themselves
"right-wingers," 32 percent "left-wingers," and 20 percent
someplace in between the two, while 7 percent said they belonged
to neither of the two camps.

<HEADLINE> Maritime, Aerospace Exhibition Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Langkawi
International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) Exhibition opened
today in Malaysia's northern resort island Langkawi.
</P>
<P>
This year's six-day event, including an aerospace exhibition
and a maritime exhibition, has drawn the biggest-ever number of
participants with 903 companies from some 40 countries and
regions, reports monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
During the show, there will be aerial displays by several
aircraft manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that several memorandums of understanding of
billions of ringgit (about 3.5 ringgit equal to one U.S. dollar)
will be signed during the show.
</P>
<P>
Opening the exhibition, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad expressed optimism about Southeast Asia's aerospace
industry which had been growing at the same accelerated pace as
the region's economy prior to economic setbacks in July.
</P>
<P>
He said the manufacturing of aircraft and components has
advanced a lot since 1991 when the first LIMA, now the world's
largest air and maritime show, was held in the scenic resort
island, some 500 kilometers north from here.
</P>
<P>
Many Southeast Asian countries are now producing small aircraft
and components for big commercial airplanes, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said with depreciating currencies now, the region was going
to be more attractive for the production of high quality
components at lower cost, particularly labor-intensive composite
items.
</P>
<P>
Some countries in the Asia-Pacific region are now actively
negotiating joint ventures to produce regional jets and commercial
aircraft, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that by 2014 the demand for aircraft by Asia-Pacific
countries was estimated at 3500, or one quarter of the world's
requirement of 15,000 with a value of 400 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said though the region's currency depreciation reduced
purchasing power, everyone was convinced that the region's
resilience would make the present problem temporary.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader stressed that there was no arms race in
the region but old equipment needed to be replaced with more
modern ones as areas of defense responsibility widened.

HEFEI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province
expects its economic growth rate for 1997 to once again exceed the
national average of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The shift in the nation's economic development focus from

<HEADLINE> UNDP Reviews Gender Advancements in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Poverty eradication is
one of the main challenges to advancing women's political and
economic empowerment in Africa, a spokesman for the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is still the main focus of the Ugandan UNDP program,
spokesman Wilson Kwamya told the UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa
(RBA)'s regional gender round-table being held in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
However, Kwamya said, much progress on gender issues had been
made in Uganda since the fourth World Conference on Women held in
1995 in Beijing, China.
</P>
<P>
Political empowerment for women had been aided by reserving
some seats in parliament for women and affirmative action was
being applied so that more women could enter university.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was reviewing its laws relation to marriage,
particularly customary marriage, to see how inequalities for
women could be addressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
An umbrella group of special interest women's groups, the
National Association of Women's Organizations, had also been
formed.
</P>
<P>
The round-table meeting focused on progress made in women's
political and economic empowerment in Africa and attempted follow
up on commitments made at the Beijing world conference.
</P>
<P>
A five million U.S. dollar RBA gender pilot program had been
set up to target the greatest obstacles to gender equality and
equity in Africa, particularly the lack of women's access to
formal power and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aimed to formulate an overall work plan and to
ensure the cohesiveness of the program which would operate in
partnership with local governments, agencies and civil
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving gender equity is pivotal to achieving sustainable
human development. Sub-Saharan Africa still faces critical
challenges in order to level the playing field for women and
men," said David Whaley, UNDP's resident South African
representative.
</P>
<P>
UNDP representatives from the 12 African countries involved in
the RBA program made presentations on Monday, which included
Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Mozambique and
South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nankun Railway, which
entered operations today, has brought great change to the once
isolated lives of ethnic minority groups in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the railway created tens of thousands of jobs
for local residents in southwestern Guizhou Province, and enabled
more than 520,000 people escape poverty during the 1993-1996
period, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
"The Nankun Railway embodies the hopes of over 700,000 ethnic
people for a better life. The railway project has also expedited
the construction of highways, water supply facilities and power
plants," according to Huang Kangsheng.
</P>
<P>
Members of 30-odd ethnic groups living in the region account
for more than 40 percent of the local population. The region has
remained economically backward due to adverse geological factors
and inadequate transportation systems, with the average annual
income for the local residents standing at slightly over 400 yuan
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The region has designed a blueprint for the accelerated
development of mineral, agricultural and tourism resources near
the line. Large-scale construction of highways and various other
infrastructure facilities is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Constantly improving transportation conditions in the area are
attracting an increasing number of foreign investors. The contract
on establishing a Sino-Canadian coal mine involving a total
investment of 250 million US dollars was signed recently. A gold
mine in the area has also attracted investors from the United
States and Canada.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentary Secretary
Zaffar Ali shah said here today that the suspension of the 13th
Amendment to the Constitution is "illegal" and "unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement soon after a three-member bench headed by
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah issued an order to suspend the 13th
Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The move by Sajjad Ali Shah was aimed at creating "chaos" in
the country, Zaffar added.
</P>
<P>
When issuing the order, Sajjad Ali Shah said that Pakistan is
on the brink of a "constitutional breakdown." He said that it is
necessary to suspend the 13th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
However, another bench of the apex court headed by Justice
Saeed Uzzman Siddiqui rejected the order and suspended the
appointment of Sajjad Ali Shah as the Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
The three-member bench headed by Sajjad Ali Shah is now hearing
a petition on the case of the contempt of court against Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Farooq Leghari, who is now having a
meeting with Chief of the Army Staff General Jahangir karamat, has

SHANGHAI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite the fact that
communicating via telephones or fax machines is quicker and much

nation by sending an average 14 letters during the first seven
months of 1997.

The 575-odd post offices in the city, one of China's economic
powerhouses, completed transactions valued at nearly 500 million

Each facility serves an average area of 8.9 sq.km., and offers

Local officials attributed growth in postal transactions to
expansion of the service network and improved infrastructure.

For example, the Pudong International Airport is constructing a
mail handling center, a business building providing comprehensive

<HEADLINE> White House Seeks Conservative Views on Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Faced with complaints that
President Bill Clinton's dialogue on race is one-sided and closed
to his critics, the White House revealed plans on Monday to meet
with conservatives later this month to seek their views.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry made this announcement just
before the first town hall meeting on race, following the drive
launched by Clinton in June. It is to be held Wednesday in Akron,
Ohio, in a bid to fend off concerns that the forthcoming session
would just be a forum for friendly views.
</P>
<P>
Though admitting that participants were chosen on
recommendations from a university and local officials, McCurry
said there was no plan to insulate Clinton from people with
differing views.
</P>
<P>
So far, the only conservative publicly tapped for Clinton's
initiative is Abigail Thernstrom, co-author of a book arguing that
blacks are progressing faster and Americans' racial attitudes are
much more accepting than usually believed.
</P>
<P>
Thernstrom and two other authors were asked to facilitate the
Akron discussion, which will focus on racial attitudes among
American youth.
</P>
<P>
A consultant for Clinton's Race Advisory Board cautioned Monday
that Clinton's efforts for racial harmony face a high risk of
failure if the Akron meeting has too much happy talk, according to
an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
"There's a great tendency in all of this to try to focus on
areas where we are most likely to find common ground. If that
becomes a preoccupation, then the initiative will not succeed,"
said Christopher Edley, who is also a law professor at the Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
A mayor or a school board member struggling with a racially
divided community would need solid advice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Edley said he voiced his concerns to the White House, and
suggested aides pursue input from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman McCurry said Clinton wouild likely "have a further
session with exactly those kinds of people" eventually. But he
wanted the Akron meeting to involve authors "who would stimulate
the kind of conversation the president wants."

<HEADLINE> Proposed Carbon Tax Can Cause 20 Billion U.S Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) stated that it's members could lose
some 20 billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue as a result of the
proposed measures to reduce global greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
According to an OPEC statement issued here Monday after the
conclusion of the organization's 103d ministerial meeting, OPEC
wanted compensation for loss of revenue that could be caused by
the carbon tax proposed at the International Climate Meeting being
held this week in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which is available today, reiterated the OPEC's
position concerning the Third Conference of the Parties (COP3) to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
in Kyoto, which gathered together representatives of more than 150
nations on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Like the other nations sharing this small planet, the statement
said, OPEC members countries have an interest in a clean, healthy
and harmonious environment.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize a global responsibility to future generations who
have a right to inherit a sound and sustainable world," it added.
</P>
<P>
Thus, OPEC believes that certain steps may need to be taken to
avert the possible consequences of man-made (anthropogenic)
climate change. But as the group of developing countries that is
most dependent upon fossil fuel, it is concerned that the
legitimate right to economic developing, shared by all developing
countries, is under threat from the mitigation measures that may
come under discussion at the Kyoto meeting.
</P>
<P>
"OPEC unreservedly supports the case for more scientific
research into the global climate system," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China is Mexico's All-Weather Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that China is an all-weather friend of
Mexico and is willing to establish a cross-century partnership to
further all-round cooperation with that country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a state dinner given in his honor by
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that President Zedillo said in Beijing last year that
Mexico was a trustworthy friend of China, Jiang said. "Today I
want to tell Mr. President that China is Mexico's all-weather
friend."
</P>
<P>
In his toast, Jiang said that since China and Mexico
established diplomatic ties 25 years ago, the two countries have
increased exchanges of high-level visits and expanded cooperation
in the fields of politics, defense, economy, trade, science and
technology, culture, parliamentary affairs and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
China highly appreciates Mexico's support to its efforts in
safeguarding national sovereignty and in reunifying the country,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Mexico maintain that all countries, big or
small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal and should work
together for the establishment of a new just and equitable
international order, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries can learn from each other because we both
have rich resources and huge markets, we both face the task of
developing national economy and improving the living standard of
our people, we both are striving for development according to our
own national conditions, and we both have accumulated our own
experience in nation-building," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to build a cross-century partnership for
all-round cooperation with Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
As China and Mexico are two major developing nations across the
Pacific, Jiang said, developing a long-term, all-round and stable
relationship of friendship and cooperation is not only in their
own fundamental interests but also helps promote peace and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India, Pakistan Trying to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- After decades of rivalry,
both India and Pakistan have come to realize that it is time for
them to change their attitudes.
</P>
<P>
This year, the 50th after their independence in 1947, has
witnessed great efforts by the two arch rivals to try to improve
their bilateral ties and enhance economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries in March resumed their
foreign-secretary-level talks, stalled for about three years, in
New Delhi, capital of India. Since then three rounds of such talks
have been held, in New Delhi and in Islamabad, capital of
Pakistan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides discussed all bilateral issues
of mutual concern including the Kashmir issue and reportedly
reached some consensus.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of the talks was said to be warm and cordial and
both sides have time and again expressed their desire to continue
their peaceful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Then Indian Foreign Minister I. K. Gujral, who is now caretaker
prime minister, and his Pakistani counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan held
informal talks here on April 9 to further push forward the
rapprochement process between the two countries. They agreed that
the two countries should draw lessons from the past 50 years of
confrontation and resolve their disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
In the past 50 years, the two countries have suffered a great
deal of money and personnel in their confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Since division in 1947, India and Pakistan have gone to war
three times over the dispute of Kashmir and religious issues.
Skirmishes were often reported along the actual control line
between the two countries in Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries finally realized that development was
their most important task in the face of a changing world after
the "cold war."
</P>
<P>
Gujral said on February 26 while addressing a seminar on
"South-South Perspective" that "a global arms race has depleted
resources available for development without serving the cause of
peace and security for any country in the long run."
</P>
<P>
"We must be able to concentrate on the task of improving the
living standards of our own people and build a progressive and
economically vibrant India," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani leaders expressed similar views.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad
on March 16, Gohar Ayub Khan said that India and Pakistan had
"both realized the importance of bilateral discussions if they are
to witness a stable future."
</P>
<P>
"Has anybody sat down in India or Pakistan to calculate how
much they have spent on defense since 1948 and how long we
continue doing this?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"We can compete, India and Pakistan, on an economic front," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with an Indian TV program on June 6, Pakistan
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said, "This is not the time to fight.
We must learn from our past mistakes and should analyze what all
we have gained or lost. We fought wars and spent so much on
defense budget instead of concentrating on the development of both
nations. We have only suffered by adopting a path of
confrontation. It's high time we should change our attitude."
</P>
<P>
In their first-ever meeting in recent years in Male, capital of
the Maldives, on May 12, the two prime ministers, Gujral and
Sharif, reached several agreements on improving bilateral
relations. The agreements included setting up joint working groups
to specially deal with all their disputes, establishing hot lines
between the two prime ministers to timely consult each other and
discuss urgent problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Again they met for the same purpose in New York on September 24
and in Edinburgh, Scotland, on October 25. In their meetings, they
expressed the desire to continue their dialogue no matter what
difficulties and ups-and-downs would come across in their way
ahead.
</P>
<P>
The rapprochement process between the two countries has been
widely welcomed and supported by the two countries' public
opinions, which have also been building up for the improvement and
normalization of relations between the two South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
At its third session in India's Calcutta city, the
Pakistan-India People's Forum for Peace and Democracy called on
the two governments to sign a comprehensive treaty for lasting
peace in the region. A declaration of the meeting attended by
leading citizens of the two countries urged the two governments to
begin working to realize the aspirations of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
It may take time for India and Pakistan to normalize their ties
because the two countries are still widely divided over their
disputes, especially the Kashmir issue. But one thing is certain:
the leaders of the two countries want to solve their differences
through dialogue.

different views on the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), there were not any "rifts" or
"conflicts" in the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Primakov proposed that Russia and Bulgaria should seek common
interests and further bilateral relations on the basis of mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova said her Russia visit will be conducive to
discussing political and economic issues and in seeking
resolutions in conformity with bilateral interests.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, once the Soviet Union's closest ally, has forged
closer ties with Western Europe since 1989.
</P>
<P>
On October 3, Bulgaria hosted a meeting of defense ministers
from southeast Europe and the United States. They discussed how to
reform their armies to prepare them for NATO membership, and how
to work together to reduce regional tensions.
</P>
<P>
Russia protested that it was not invited, but Sofia said that
as Russia was not in southeast Europe and had no plans to join
NATO, it did not qualify for an invitation.
</P>
<P>
In earlier October, the two countries failed to agree at talks
in Sofia on prices and terms for delivery of Russian natural gas
to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian foreign minister arrived here today on a working
visit aimed at bridging the gap between the two countries and
paving the way for Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov's
forthcoming Russian tour.

<HEADLINE> NASA Decides on Second Spacewalk to Test Station Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Two astronauts aboard the
space shuttle Columbia will make a second spacewalk Wednesday to
test equipment to be used for building an international space station.
</P>
<P>
The United States National Aeronautic and Space Administration
(NASA) made the decision today after the American astronaut
Winston Scott and his Japanese colleague Takao Doi were hindered
from doing so in their first spacewalk last Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be NASA's last spacewalk before next summer when
construction on the international space station begins.
</P>
<P>
NASA said it was necessary for astronauts to have all the
spacewalking experience before building the space station.
</P>
<P>
In their seven-and-a-half-hour spacewalk, Scott and Doi had no
chance to lift an extendible, 3.5 meter crane and a free-flying
robotic camera as planned.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they had to grab, with hands gloved, the Spartan
science satellite which was malfunctioning after its November 21
release from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
Later they worked with the crane and a large, batterylike
object, and conducted some other station experiments.
</P>
<P>
Columbia's 16-day mission is scheduled to end with a landing
at Cape Canaveral, Florida Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, astronauts on Columbia were locked in the
shuttle by a jammed hatch and failed to test the crane.

<HEADLINE> Italy Likely to Meet Euro Deficit Ratio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy is likely to meet the 3
percent deficit to GDP ratio this year required for entry into the
euro area.
</P>
<P>
The figures released today by the Treasury showed that the
country's financial deficit is 78 trillion lire (45 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first 11 months this year, 43 percent less
than the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deficit ratio and inflation rate specified in the
Maastricht treaty are regarded as two prerequisites for entering
the economic and monetary union in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Italy's financial deficit accounted for 6.7 percent of the GDP
in 1995. Through cutting public spending and other austerity
measures, the government expected to bring it down to or within
the specified limit.

<HEADLINE> India's Major Newspaper on Country's Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- India's major English
newspaper The Hindustan Times said in an editorial that with no
political party being able to muster enough support so far, the
president's efforts seemed to be running out of options.
</P>
<P>
"With arithmetic remaining steadfastly uncooperative, President
K.R. Narayanan's efforts to install an alternative government in
place of Inder Kumar Gujral's seven-month-long government seem to
be running out of options," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Bharatiya Janata Party (the biggest opposition in the
country), which has so far remained an interested onlooker of the
unseemly wrangles between the United Front and its outside
supporter (the Congress), now feels that it deserves another
chance. There is more wishful thinking than logic to its claim,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
"As for the United Front and the Congress, all permutations and
combinations offer no hope but each side feels that the other
would have no option but to support it. The longer Mr. Narayanan
takes to form his judgment, the greater the chances of attempts by
major parties to engineer splits and defections to close the
number gap between minority and majority," it added.
</P>
<P>
"The President also has the discretion to go beyond the claims
of rival groupings to think of other combinations. Going to the
people should continue to be the last option," it said.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Port Under Closure Threat for Tips Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's largest port
Chittagong is under the threat of closure as a dispute between
port master stevedores and dock workers over tips worsened.
</P>
<P>
Port sources said today that the master stevedores have decided
to stop employing dock workers from December 4 if the workers do
not withdraw their present "go-slow" tactics by December 3.
</P>
<P>
The dock workers started their "go-slow" tactics on November 10
following a decision by the master stevedores to stop giving
"speed money" (tips) to them which had long been paid.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong port has been constantly troubled by labor
disputes or trade issues, hampering the national trade badly. More
than 35 days of activities at the port have been suspended this
year due to non-cooperation by the dock workers and strikes called
for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign feeder operators are considering imposing
congestion surcharges in the backdrop of the fresh congestion
created at the port due to the tips dispute, which has also caused
the port's productivity to fall to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, congestion surcharges have been imposed by
frustrated foreign feeder operators over a dozen times.

<HEADLINE> Largest University Links in Commercial Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 1 (Xinhua) -- California State University
(CSU) plans to bring data, voice and video infrastructure up to a
present day technology baseline on its campuses through
partnership with four high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
University officials said the plan aims to "meld technology and
intellect to provide ubiquitous telecommunication services, to
improve education, and do so with a reasonable rate of return."
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, called California Educational Technology
Initiative (CETI), a company will be formed between CSU and the
firms of Microsoft, GTE, Fujitsu and Hughes.
</P>
<P>
Pouring 300 million U.S. dollars into building and maintaining
computer and telephone networks, the new company will be the
exclusive provider of all the campuses' baseline technology,
ensuring students and professors easy access to high-speed
communications networks by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The company will also gain access to a potential market of more
than a million customers, including students, professors, staff
and CSU alumni. A contract is to be signed this month.
</P>
<P>
With a total enrollment of 337,000 students and 37,000 faculty
and staff, the 22-campus CSU is the world's largest university
system. Almost 1.7 million people have graduated from CSU campuses
since 1960.
</P>
<P>
The working capital of 36 million dollars for the initiative
will come from the commercial partners. The commercial team will
lease the infrastructure to CETI or the CSU through a financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
Bonds will be sold for 180 million dollars to finance the
balance of the infrastructure and CETI will sign loan documents
and the commercial partners will guarantee any loans required.
</P>
<P>
The company hopes to generate revenues as high as 3 billion
dollars over 10 years by selling services such as computer
support, pager accounts and Internet access to the public.
Whether or not students would be charged for Internet and computer
access has not been worked out, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
The CSU leaders view the arrangement as a creative solution for
a university facing deep cutbacks in state money and
ever-increasing numbers of students. The CSU-San Francisco
president Robert Corrigan told a local newspaper:"As a president
who can't get the money either from the students or from the
state, I'm driven into working with the corporate sector."
</P>
<P>
But many professors and students feel worried about the
possible corporate takeover of academia, says the San Francisco
Chronicle. Some are wary that the corporations would dictate
things like course requirements, the usage of software and
hardware and the publication of course materials.
</P>
<P>
Others are afraid of being forced to cede control over the
university's educational direction to high-tech companies. Student
leaders are concerned that students are treated in the plan as
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not Optimistic Over Kyoto Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia hopes the United
Nations climate change conference in Kyoto, Japan, will reaffirm
the 1992 Rio commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but
says it will opt for "reasonable" solutions if the meeting is
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said here
Monday before departure for the Kyoto meeting that due to the
apparent deadlock among some countries over the target for gas
emission reduction, Indonesia was taking a "realistic" stance to
the 10-day conference.
</P>
<P>
"We base ourselves on our own national interests which conform
to (global) climate stabilization programs, so we have no problem
at all with the Rio commitment," official sources today quoted
Sarwono as saying.
</P>
<P>
The problem now lies with the lack of international unity on
establishing allowable levels for greenhouse gas emissions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The international conference on climate change began in Kyoto
on Monday with the aim to set limits for gas emissions and
determine which gases are to be included.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia sticks to the 1992 Rio commitment to reduce emissions
to the 1990 level by 2000, with carbon dioxide, methane and
nitrousoxide among the gases which must be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono hoped that all parties will adhere to the 1992 Rio
commitment.
</P>
<P>
However, Sarwono was not upbeat about the outcome of the
conference, saying that "even if the conference succeeds in
getting a consensus, it will be a compromising one, softer than
the Rio commitment."
</P>
<P>
More than 150 countries are taking part in the conference to
tackle the myriad of thorny issues to reach an agreement,
hopefully a Kyoto Protocol, to combat the threat of global
warming.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Seek to Join MIGA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will apply to join the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in a bid to
protect Thai investments from running high risks, a local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda discussed the
matter on Monday in Malaysia with Lorin Weisenfeld, an executive
of MIGA, the Nation said.
</P>
<P>
MIGA is a World Bank affiliate which provides guarantees on
investments against currency transfer risks, contract breach
risks, and assets expropriation risks.
</P>
<P>
Joining the international body will make Thai investments safer
against foreign exchange losses, especially in other Southeast
Asian nations that are seeing a currency turmoil, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The body also provides guarantees on other risks, like war and
civil disturbances, it said.
</P>
<P>
To be a MIGA member, Thailand will have to enact related laws
governing MIGA activities in Thailand and contribute 4.5 million
U.S. dollars to the body.
</P>
<P>
MIGA currently has 128 full members, including Malaysia, the
Philippines and Indonesia, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> China, Mexico Agree to Forge Trans-Century Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and his Mexican counterpart, Ernesto Zedillo, today
agreed that China and Mexico should establish a partnership of
all-round cooperation crossing into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reached the agreement during their talks here
at the presidential residence. They maintained that such a
relationship is of great importance in enhancing the overall
strength of developing countries, and in establishing a new
international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Zedillo also agreed on four points for advancing
China-Mexico ties, including increasing exchanges of high level
visits and promoting political cooperation; enhancing economic and
trade cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit;
conducting all-round cooperation and strengthening friendship, and
cooperating closely and supporting each other on international
issues, particularly strengthening their coordination and
cooperation in the United Nations and in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two leaders reviewed the development of
China-Mexico relations in the past 25 years and spoke highly of
the growth of economic and trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president noted that with concerted efforts by both
sides, bilateral economic and trade ties have been gradually
promoted while exchanges in the fields of science and technology,
culture, defense, parliament and law enforcement have increased.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that they needed to explore new avenues
of economic cooperation and further open their markets.
</P>
<P>
Having exchanged visits within a year, the Chinese and Mexican
heads of state have established a close working relationship and
personal friendship, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China and Mexico, as two developing powers that
carry weight, and as members of APEC, enjoy political stability
and economic development and bear a major impact on regional and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The broad common ground shared by the two countries is a solid
foundation for the further development of their friendly relations
of cooperation, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said China is playing an increasingly important role in
the international arena and Mexico is willing to establish closer
ties of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Mexico and China would increase consultation and
coordination on international issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Zedillo that China supports Mexico's proposal for
holding a special session of the United Nations General Assembly
on drugs next year. China attaches great importance to cooperation
with other countries including Mexico in this field.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to send relief goods to Mexico's tornado-hit
areas to help residents there rebuild their home at an earlier
date, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said Jiang's on-going visit will bring Mexico-China
relations into a new stage of development.

construction materials, auto parts worth millions of baht from
Thailand stranded at Mae Sot district, local newspapers said

<HEADLINE> Thailand 11 Months' Inflation Rate at 5.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- As a result of the weakening
baht, higher value-added tax and rising production costs,
Thailand's inflation in the first 11 months of this year rose by
5.5 percent as compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in November, 7.6 percent higher than the
same month of last year, was the highest this year, according to
business economics department deputy director-general Vithun
Tulyanond.
</P>
<P>
Vithun said it was unusual for inflation to rise towards the
end of a year, adding that normally prices remain stable in the
last few months of a year as it is the season when more
agricultural produce is supplied to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The unseasonal inflation increase has caused concern that the
government will have to make more efforts if it wants to keep the
inflation rate below its targeted 6 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, the price of high-speed diesel in
November was 32.30 percent higher than it was before the baht was
floated on July 2, with unleaded gasoline up 28.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco and alcoholic drinks were also among those commodities
which saw high price hikes due to an increase in excise tax and
the higher price of fuel oil.

<HEADLINE> Thai Plan for Export Industries' Recovery in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Industry Ministry has
drawn up a five-year plan for the recovery of export-oriented
industries, hoping that the country will be back on track toward
global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, the ministry will offer loans to those
industries with good prospects, especially exporters, to help them
regain the edge in terms of production costs, according to
Industry Minister Somsak Thepsuthin.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will focus on upgrading machinery and development
of the processed food sector, which relies on local raw materials,
the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Loans will be used to improve food hygiene, which is an
important factor for export.
</P>
<P>
Other industries standing to benefit are jewelry, leather
goods, decorative products, vehicles and electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Weapons Provision Does Not Reflect Hostility: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said the large number of weapons being imported into
Southeast Asia does not reflect any feelings of mistrust or
hostility among ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing expenditure on defense or weapons should not be
seen as an arms race," Alatas said here Monday at the Parliament,
sources at the Parliament disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report raised at the Parliament by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), East Asia
and Saudi Arabia are the biggest annual arms consumers in the
world, while Indonesia and Thailand are among the biggest
importers of weapons, spending approximately 700 million U.S.
dollars. Third biggest importer is Singapore with a total of 400
million U.S. dollars and Malaysia is fourth with imports of 350
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASRAN) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that to properly understand the IISS report, "we
should be aware that every country has different motivations and
considerations in their defense expenditures."
</P>
<P>
He admitted some ASEAN member countries have recently
modernized their armed forces to improve their high-tech
armaments, and to improve their ability to deal with pirates and
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Arms development in the ASEAN region is considered neither
offensive nor defensive against other countries, said Alatas. The
single most important principle of the ASEAN security agreement,
he said, is to maintain regional security in comprehensive ways.

VIENNA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The new director-general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohammed El Baradei,
assumed his office here today, taking the place of Hans Blix who
had held the post for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The new chief was elected by a conference of IAEA's Board of
Governors in July, 1997 and recognized by its General Conference
later.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful use of atomic energy, Baradei said, was sure to
develop in the future.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1957, IAEA aims at enlarging the contribution
atomic energy makes to peace, health and prosperity throughout the
world, and ensuring that its assistance, provided or requested
under its supervision or control, was not used in such a way as to
further military purposes.
</P>
<P>
In January, 1984, China joined the IAEA and its Board of
Governors and signed, with 37 other nations, the Convention on
Nuclear Safety at the 38th conference of the IAEA in September,
1994 in Vienna.

Los Angeles, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Growth rate in
U.S. manufacturing sector slowed slightly in November, the
National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) reported

NAPM said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 54.4 in
November from 56.0 in October, although November marked the 18th
consecutive month of manufacturing growth.

<P>
An index above 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is
generally expanding while a rate below 50 indicates it is
contracting.
</P>
<P>
However, the manufacturing employment increased to 53.5 in
November from 52.4 in October, marking the 9th consecutive month
of job growth in manufacturing sector, said NAPM, whose members
include purchasing managers at more than 300 industrial companies
across the United States.

about the future of the U.S. economy, which continued to grow in
November for the 79th consecutive month.

<HEADLINE> OPEC's Basket Oil Price 18.8 U.S. Dollars Per Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries (OPEC) Rilwanu
Lukman said here last night that the basket price of the cartel's
oil in the world market is about 18.8 u.s. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The basket price, he said, indicated that the cartel's decision
to increase its production ceiling to 27.5 million barrels per day
(bpd) would not influence the world oil price.
</P>
<P>
Delegations of the OPEC countries at their 103rd conference
that ended here Monday, decided to increase their production
ceiling from 25.033 million bpd to 27.5 million bpd at the first
half of next year.
</P>
<P>
Lukman, who was reelected at the meeting as the organization's
secretary general for the second time, admitted many parties were
worried about OPEC's offensive decision to push up its production
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
However, considering that OPEC's actual production in 1997 was
more than 27 million bpd while its world market price remained
stable, he believed that the oil price would continue to remain
stable at about 18 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The estimation was based on the organization's analysis that
the coming winter would be too cold and the world's demand for oil
in the first half of 1998 was believed to increase about 1.5 to 2
million bpd, he added.
</P>
<P>
But Lukman reminded each of the cartel's member country to
respect their own individual oil quota.
</P>
<P>
The six-day conference was attended by oil ministers from the
11 OPEC members. They are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- NBA superstar Michael Jordan
is giving hints that the 1997-1998 season may be his last.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Chicago Bulls, strggling for their sixth NBA crown in
eight years, have started with a lackluster run of 9-7 with
Scottie Pippen sidelined with injuries and demanding a trade,
Dennis Rodman inconsistent and Jordan unhappy with the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Complaining about the present situation of the Bulls, Jordan is
sending a message that his farewell is near, at least to the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, following the murder of his father, Jordan made his
first retirement and began playing baseball, only to return to the
Bulls in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
"My purpose for coming back has always been to support Scottie
Pippen, as well as Phil Jackson (head coach) as well as the team;
whatever way we all can prosper from that. (Pippen) feels as
though that can't happen for him right now," said Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can do anything to change those feelings. I
think that's something that he has with management and that's made
some deeper scars than what can be healed at this point," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Looks to Alternative National Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Cabinet has
seconded a bill allowing young men to undertake an alternative to
military national service.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Georgi Ananiev said after a Monday cabinet
meeting that under the bill, alternative non-military service
would be performed in the interests of the public by young men
unwilling to serve in the army as envisaged by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Young men who do not want to fulfill their military service are
expected to submit applications to a yet-to-be Central Commission
for Alternative National Service, under the Ministry of Labour and
Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, which would be completely independent from the
military, would decide whether applicants had decided to take up
an alternative service out of their own choice, or because of
other pressure.
</P>
<P>
It was proposed that alternative service was double the time of
military service, the Defense Minister said. Such was the practice
in France, Greece and Hungary, he said.
</P>
<P>
A youth could perform the alternative national service in
various branches of the national economy, the social sector and
Civil Defense as well as posts in the armed forces which did not
require the bearing of arms.
</P>
<P>
They would draw wages equal to those paid for military service,
said Ananiev.
</P>
<P>
The bill also envisages penalties for alternative service
evaders. The Penal Code is expected to be amended in compliance
with the new law.

<HEADLINE> Coal Mine Programs to Receive Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Construction of new coal mines
in eastern and central China, like Shangdong and Anhui, will
receive development priority from the central government,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Coal-supplying bases in Shanxi, Shaanxi, western Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region and Guizhou will also be developed, a senior
State Planning Commission (SPC) official said yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Coal resources are rich in these western provinces, which
transport coal to coastal areas, mainly by rail.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongxun, deputy director of the commission's Transportation
and Energy Department, said China is expected to produce 1.42
billion tons of coal this year, climbing to 1.48 billion by the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The construction scale, or the annual production capacity, of
State-owned coal mines is between 600,000 tons and four million
tons, Li noted. Meanwhile, the scale of open-cut coal mines is
three million to 15 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Outlined in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the
government allocates annually three billion yuan (360 million
U.S. dollars) to coal enterprises as low-interest assistance.
</P>
<P>
A sustainable development policy is being adopted within the
coal industry, in an effort to reduce ash and sulphur emissions.
</P>
<P>
Construction of power plants is being encouraged near coal
mines, coastal ports and railway hubs, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
China's installed capacity will be 290 million kilowatts and
electricity generation will be 1,400 billion kilowatts per hour by
2000, Li predicted.

<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Charity organizations'
representatives gathered here Monday to discuss the way of
combining China's long tradition of benevolence with a modern,
efficient and transparent charity system.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, attended by representatives from 70
charities from 29 of the country's provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions, is the first national training session
arranged by the China Charity Federation (CCF) for its members,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It is important for local managers to know more about how
modern charities should perform, said CCF Chairman Cui Naifu.
</P>
<P>
The CCF aims to push its members to launch more local charity
schemes next year. Personnel training is the key to solving the
problems that arise when non-profit organizations are trying to
share small portions of the work which used to be done by
government, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
The first non-governmental charitable organization was
established in Shanghai in 1993, with the CCF being set up one
year later as the country's first and largest national,
non-governmental, non-profit-making institution.
</P>
<P>
A training agreement has been concluded between CCF and the
Community Chest in Hong Kong, a member of the US-based United Way
International.
</P>
<P>
A pioneer group of 60 pension fund managers and 20 charity
organization staff will receive theoretical and practical training
next year in Hong Kong.

</P>
<P>
In a videotaped message to participants in a ceremony organized

signs of success, but HIV is affecting more and more young people.
</P>
<P>
"So this year let me send a special message to young Americans:
Only you have the power to keep yourselves safe," the president
said.

<P>
"Life expectancy, which has been steadily on the rise for about
three decades will drop to 40 years or less in nine sub-Saharan
countries by the year 2010 mainly because of this disease," USAID

children will have lost their parents worldwide to AIDS.

<HEADLINE> China's First LPG Terminal Goes Into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The first refrigerated
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) terminal in China went into
operation yesterday in Taicang of Jiangsu province, a city near
the metropolis of Shanghai, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The LPG terminal, which consists of two 31,000-cubic-meter
refrigerated tanks, is expected to supply 500,000 tons of LPG
annually to the customers in the middle and down stream areas of
the Yangtze River and the coastal areas in east China.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the country's rapid economic growth, China has
become the fastest expanding LPG market in the world in recent
years. Currently, 40 percent of its LPG demand relies on imports.
</P>
<P>
China imported 2.33 million tons of LPG in 1995 and 3.55
million tons in 1996. The figure is expected to be 6.83 million
tons by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The operator of the terminal is the Huaneng Amoco Clean Energy
Company, a Sino-US joint venture. Huaneng shares 52.5 percent in
the venture.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the LPG terminal was kicked off in
February 1996. Its total investment is 29.9 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company has reached an agreement with Jiangsu Huayou
Changjiang Liquefied Gas Company, a special sales company
affiliated with China National Petroleum Corporation, to run the
business together, said Wang Shijun, general manager of the
Company.
</P>
<P>
The terminal imports LPG by large ships from abroad, and 70-80
percent of its volume will be loaded into vessels for distribution
along the Yangtze River, while the remaining 20-30 percent will be
loaded into trucks and bottles for distribution to nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to sell 300,000 tons in 1998, 400,000
tons in 1999 and 500,000 tons in 2000.
</P>
<P>
After additional investment, the company can enlarge its annual
capacity from its current 500,000 tons to one million tons.
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to become a leading LPG importer,
distributor and marketer in China, said Thomas King, deputy
general manager of the company.

the preparation of the World Cup finals in France next year in an
interview with the Fegallo.
</P>
<P>
The president, who will attend the draw ceremony of the 1998
World Cup finals to be held in Marseille, France on December 4,
took a rosy picture of the finals success.
</P>
<P>
The soccer chief crowned the soccer premiere competition with
the title " high-tech World Cup" , thinking that France's advanced
technology will make the event a great success.
</P>
<P>
Havelange praised the automatic metal fence as a "technical
wonder", which will rise up in case of emergency to separate
pitches from spectators.
</P>
<P>
FIFA has demanded that the fence around playgrounds as a
security measure should be removed to show respect to players'
personality.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the modification to games rules, Havelange held
strongly against footballers' scooping act and opposed the way
videos are used to judge matches.
</P>
<P>
The president said that in the coming finals every team has the
possibility of carrying off the palm, thinking that the form of
each team and chances are also deciding factors.
</P>
<P>
Havelange also expressed his regret that during his tenure
Africa failed to win a bid to host the World Cup, hoping that his
predecessor would offer a chance to the continent.
</P>
<P>
The president, who held the post for 24 years, is expected to
retire in June next year.

Speaking at the 52nd Session of U.N. General Assembly on the

obligations, remove obstruction and resume talks at an early date
on the basis of the relevant U.N. resolutions and the principle of
"land for peace" to push the peace process forward, he said.

Ambassador Qin said Israel should refrain from enforcing
closure on the self-rule areas or freezing revenues of the
Palestinians at will.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries should undertake more obligations and carry
out at an early date the commitment they have already made so as
to facilitate early economic recovery and development in the
Palestinian self-rule areas, he said.

<HEADLINE> German Private Banks Have Share in Nazi Gold: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The gold robbed by German Nazis
from eastern European Jews between 1942 and 1945 had been partly
transferred by the Nazi German central bank to the country's
private banks, German television reports said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the ARD television network, the new foundings were
achieved after the first examination of the microfilms found in
Vienna last week, which included some photocopies of original
documents and files of the Nazi central bank -- Reichsbank.
</P>
<P>
The gold, worth about 1.4 billion German marks (790 million
U.S. dollars) today, was addressed to the Deutsche Bank and the
Dresdner Bank, Germany's two largest commercial banks, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar leaped to a
more than 5-year high against the Japanese yen Monday as traders
worried about more bad news will emerge from Japan's battered
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency advanced in early trading after Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a parliamentary hearing
that Tokyo will do everything possible to protect bank depositors
and customers of securities companies.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's testimony initially supported the yen, but the
dollar then jumped as traders began interpreting the remarks as a
harbinger of further failures after three Japanese financial
companies collapsed last month.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 128.91 yen, up
from 127.82 late Friday, after peaking earlier at 129.32. It was
the U.S. currency's highest level against the yen since 129.33 on
May 29, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also rose against mark and settled at 1.7771 marks
from 1.7645 late Friday, having reached its highest point since
October 22.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has gained 7 percent against the yen in last month
amid a serious slump in Asia's financial markets. It has exceeded
several levels once considered dangerously high by traders who
were worried that Japanese or U.S. officials would intervene to
halt the dollar's progress.
</P>
<P>
A stronger dollar exacerbates the countries' trade gulf by
making Japanese goods cheaper overseas and American products more
expensive in Japan. Traders said 130 yen now seems to be the
dollar's limit before government officials step in to sell dollars
and support the yen.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:
1.4316 Swiss francs, up from 1.4263; 5.9475 French francs, up from
5.9035; 1,741 Italian lire, up from 1,727; and 1.4229 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.4233.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6846 U.S. dollars, down from
1.6886 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Gold Conference to Be Held in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from some 40
countries will attend an international conference on Nazi gold in
London on 2-4 December to discuss unresolved issues on millions of
dollars of gold seized during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, the participants, including
diplomats, historians and non-government organizations
representatives, would focus on where the gold came from, what
happened to it and what steps taken to compensate victims.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has indicated that Britain
wants a new fund established to assist needy victims of Nazi
persecution.
</P>
<P>
"Britain has proposed that the remaining gold be used to set up
a fund to compensate individual Holocaust victims and their
families, particularly those who so far have received little or no
compensation for their suffering," Cook was quoted as saying in a
Foreign Office statement.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the conference will give a decisive push to our
proposal and that other countries will be encouraged to support
it," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Tripartite Gold Commission, set up in
1946 and run by Britain, the United States and France, has
restored most of the looted gold to its rightful owners and today
some 60 million U.S. Dollars worth of gold remains to be
distributed.
</P>
<P>
The Tripartite Gold Commission has always maintained that all
of the gold it is holding was looted from the central banks of
countries occupied by the Nazis. But Jewish groups have strongly
argued that between five to 10 percent of the gold belonged to
private victims.

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports Cyprus's EU Membership Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said today that the divisions of Cyprus should not be
regarded as a barrier over the country's bid to join the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the House of Commons early today, Cook said: "We
want to see the maximum pressure for an end" to the 23-year-old
division of the island.
</P>
<P>
However, Cook stressed that Cyprus had a "very sound" case for
membership and ruling out its EU membership would weaken the
pressure that could be exerted for a settlement of the island.
</P>
<P>
The former British colony became independent in 1961 and the
island's Turkish and Greek communities have locked in fierce
disputes and armed conflicts over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is due to open negotiations with the EU next year after
Britain takes over the rotating EU presidency in January, but
leaders of Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus have expressed
strong opposition to the Nicosia government's application to join
the EU and even threatened to integrate with Turkey if accession
talks go forward.
</P>
<P>
In order to strike a balance, Britain has proposed to invite
all would-be EU members including Turkey to attend an
international conference on EU enlargement next year.
</P>
<P>
On Greek's opposition to inviting Turkey to the conference, Cook
said: "Fourteen EU member states have expressed no opposition. It
will not surprise members to know that Greece has reservations."
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary reaffirmed that Britain favors
the EU Commission's plan to open negotiations with Cyprus and five
east European countries -- Slovenia, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and
the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls Israel's Pullout Decision "Step in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Monday called Israel's decision to withdraw its troops from more
parts of the West Bank "a step in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"We view the Israeli government's decision in principle to
move forward with the further redeployment as a step in the
right direction," State Department spokesman James Rubin told a
regular briefing. "Now we are going to have to look at the
details and see how far it goes."
</P>
<P>
Rubin's remarks came as the Israeli government proposed on
Sunday to carry out one further redeployment in the West Bank
but the government set no scope or precise timetable.
</P>
<P>
According to agreements between Israel and the Palestinians,
Israel undertook to make three pullouts from mostly rural areas
of the West Bank before a permanent peace deal with the
Palestinians by mid-1999. The Sunday's proposal was the second.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli government set up a list of conditions the
Palestinians must meet before even one soldier moves out.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told reporters that the United States always believed
that the agreements between the two sides "should be
implemented", which includes the further redeployments.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters if the Israeli proposal on further
withdrawal met with Washington requests, Rubin said he could not
go into details of something that remained the subject of
intensive consultations.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary of state (Madeleine Albright) has said she
believes there should be a greater sense of urgency on the part
of the parties to move the peace process forward," Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Washington has requested Israel to do something "significant
and credible" in pushing the peace process forward, which surely
includes the pullout of the Israel troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said what Washington was going to do was to "press very
hard behind the scenes and, when necessary, publically to make
clear the importance of the peace process, the importance of
moving."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe today dismissed press reports that western allies are
seriously considering to move the headquarters of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) from Brussels to Bonn.
</P>
<P>
"There are no serious talks about the issue," Ruehe told
reporters in Bonn today.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report of the German news magazine Der
Spiegel, an increasing number of NATO members are pleading for a
NATO move to Bonn due to the worn-out NATO building in Brussels as
well as Belgium's failure to provide an appropriate additional
building for NATO in preparation for its planned enlargement in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The notion could be reinforced given the prospect that there
would be a redundance in office buildings in Bonn after Germany
completes its capital move to Berlin in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Der Spiegel also reported that NATO General Secretary Javier
Solana was expected to discuss the issue with foreign ministers of
NATO members even before Christmas and to make a decision next
Spring.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Wishes France to Become "World Cultural Center" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today expressed his wish that France will become "the cultural
center of the world" which he said once was for nearly seven
centuries through its sciences and culture.
</P>
<P>
"This should be our ambition, this is a question of political
will," said Chirac at a ceremony of the Academy of Sciences of
France for rewarding a medal to the Belgian biologist Jozef Schell.
</P>
<P>
Chirac called on French scientists to contribute more in the
field of modern technology, the fight against infectious diseases
and the control of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled the "principles that France, with the
European Union, will defend tomorrow at the Kyoto" international
conference on control of emission of greenhouse gases, which began
today in the ancient Japanese city.
</P>
<P>
"At the present rhythm (of increase of pollution), our
children risk to live in a disfigured world," he added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Secretary General to Visit France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Javier Solana will make a
visit to France from Wednesday evening, during which he will hold
talks with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted sources at the NATO
headquarters in Brussels as saying today that Solana will also
attend a plenary session of the Western European Union on Thursday
and will meet with French Defense Minister Alain Richard.
</P>
<P>
France's full reintegration into the NATO integrated structure
is suspended because of its failure to have the Americans give up
a key military command seat in the southern wing of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
France gave its green light to the NATO plan of expansion to
central and eastern Europe at the Madrid summit in June, but
refused to return to its integrated military command structure,
from which it withdrew in 1966.
</P>
<P>
So far the NATO allies have not presented any new proposals for
helping France reach a compromise with the United States over the
Naples-based Southern Command of NATO, which wishes to take over.
