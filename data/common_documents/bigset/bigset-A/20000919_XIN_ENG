<HEADLINE> China Eximbank Helps Fund Myanmar's Largest Hydropower Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of
China (Eximbank) today signed an agreement with Myanmar's state-
run electric power company to approve 1 billion yuan (120 million
US dollars) worth of export seller's loan to help it build a
gigantic power station.
</P>
<P>
The loan undertaken between the Myanmar Electric Power
Enterprise and the Yunnan Machinery and Equipment Import and
Export Co. (YMEC) in southwest China's Yunnan Province is the
largest export seller's credit the Eximbank has issued to the
midwest region.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zilin, governor of the bank, said the loan was approved to
support Yunnan's exports. YMEC is a supplier of power-generating
equipment for the Panglang Hydro-electric Station, which is the
largest hydro-power project in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, Eximbank has approved 60 million yuan (7.2
million US dollars) of loans for the project.
</P>
<P>
To be installed with 280,000 kilowatts of generating capacity,
the Panglang power station will be responsible for one-third of
the electricity supplied to Myanmar when it is commissioned in
2003.
</P>
<P>
A 160 million-US dollar contract was clinched by the YMEC with
the Myanmar power enterprise in 1998 to become its machinery
supplier. It was China's largest export of complete sets of hydro-
power equipment to southeast Asian countries, and also Yunnan's
largest foreign trade project.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Court For the First Time Uses Internet For Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Second
Intermediate People's Court today used the Internet to get and
check evidence when hearing an Internet related copyright
violation and unfair competition case.
</P>
<P>
The accuser, the tonight.com.cn, said that the accused, three
Beijing-based IT companies, violated its copyright by establishing
links with its database without permission, and hurt its business
by selling their services at a price below cost.
</P>
<P>
The accused argues that the accuser's accusation is lacking in
evidence and they did not make any violations.
</P>
<P>
In order to find and check evidence, the judge asked to show
the relevant videos and use the Internet, which is believed to be
the first time in China for a court to use the Internet as a way
of gathering evidence.
</P>
<P>
After today's trial the judge decided to continue the trial to
the next day.

TIANJIN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- An air express mail service
supervision center, set up by Tianjin Custom, opened today, which
is supposed to greatly promote the express mail business in
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>

"We hope to provide better express mail services through
setting up this supervision center," said a custom official.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, two other express mail service
centers will soon be set up in the city.

<P>
URUMQI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China will invite more foreign
experts to the country's vast western regions the next year,
according to Wan Xueyuan, head of the State Bureau of Foreign
Experts Affairs here today.
</P>
<P>
The move is to meet the need of the current "develop the west"
strategy made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
"We will allocate more funds to the west for key construction
projects and pillar sectors to attract more talents from outside."
</P>
<P>
According to Wan, experts majoring in agriculture, management
and bio-sciences are especially needed.
</P>
<P>
There are about 80,000 foreign experts coming to China every
year.

<HEADLINE> Hero Mother Giant Panda Gives Birth To Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A female giant panda gave
birth to twins in the early morning, yesterday, at the Giant Panda
Protection and Research Center located in the Wolong Nature
Reserve in south China's Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
This has been the sixth time that the giant panda has given
birth. Since 1995, the giant panda, coded as No.1 in the center,
has given birth to 11 babies among which 10 have survived.
</P>
<P>
"It has given birth to three twins," said a research fellow
with the center. "Last year it became world famous by giving birth
to triplets."
</P>
<P>
"We all call her 'hero mother,'" he added.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda No. 1 is described as "very strong" and weighs
100 kilograms. On April 1 she copulated with a male giant panda
for 23 minutes, and for 16 minutes with another male giant panda
the other day, both times much longer than the average mating time
of three minutes for giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of this year the Wolong Nature Reserve has
welcomed 11 new giant panda babies, a historic high compared with
the previous years.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Making "Dangerous Option": Magazine (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article blames the Taiwan leader for his activities to
prevent Taiwan business people from investing in the mainland,
blocking direct trade, mail and transport services across the
straits, delaying the stationing of mainland journalists in Taiwan,
sabotaging inter-city exchanges between Kaohsiung of Taiwan and
Xiamen of the mainland, turning a deaf ear to the August 28
announcement by a Taiwan-based party to establish the so-called "
temporary government of the Taiwan State."
</P>
<P>
On the current military policies of the Taiwan leader, the
article notes that some people in Taiwan have feared that his pro-
independence activities may lead to an "inevitable crisis of war."
</P>
<P>
It also ridicules the Taiwan authorities' attempts to gain
membership of the United Nations and their "dollar diplomacy." In
his recent overseas tour in central America and Africa, the Taiwan
leader spent 250 million U.S. dollars in exchange for five medals,
three live sheep and two live chicken, it says.
</P>
<P>
The article says that what's more dangerous is that the Taiwan
leader openly said he would "loudly" say, "Taiwan is a sovereign
state," which brings to light his stubborn adherence to the
separatist stance of "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
The article reiterates the mainland's constant and clear
positions for reunification, its maximal sincerity for the
prospects of peaceful reunification, and its firm determination
and necessary preparations to stop all separatist activities
including "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
The recent separatist remarks by the Taiwan leader are very
dangerous and could not help arousing the high vigilance of the
entire Chinese people, it warns.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Leader Making "Dangerous Option": Magazine (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The latest issue of the
Beijing-based magazine Cross-Straits Relations carried an article
accusing the Taiwan leader of making a "dangerous option" with his
recent separatist remarks.
</P>
<P>
On August 17 and August 28, the Taiwan leader repeated his
statement that reunification is not the only option for Taiwan,
and on September 1, he stressed that there are two, three or even
an indefinite number of options for the future of Taiwan,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
These remarks have drawn serious attention from in and outside
Taiwan and the public opinions put it that the claim that
reunification is not the only option means that "Taiwan
independence" is also one of the options, which may bring about "
unmanageable danger," the article says.
</P>
<P>
While the one-China principle is being accepted by more and
more people in Taiwan, the Taiwan leader's option is that one
China can not be regarded as a principle and could only be made a
topic and an issue to be "dealt with in the future," it says.
</P>
<P>
It also accuses the Taiwan leader of denying the consensus on
the one-China principle reached by the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that in fact, the Taiwan leader is
refusing to accept the one-China principle and resisting the
reunification between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> First Pediatric HIV/AIDS Clinic Laid Foundation in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's President
Festus Mogae Monday laid foundation of the Baylor Children's
Clinical Center for Excellence, the first clinic exclusively for
children suffering HIV/AIDS in the South African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"Extending care and support for children is a priority in
curbing the HIV/AIDS pandemic," said Mogae at a ceremony in the
construction site in Gaborone, capital of the country, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Botswana is one of the countries suffering the highest HIV/AIDS
infection rate in the world. Around 66,000 children have so far
been orphaned by the deadly disease in the country, according to
statistics by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It will cost 10 million U.S. dollars to build the clinic, which
is a fruit of cooperation between the public and private sectors,
as well as Botswana's government and international donors, said
officials.
</P>
<P>
The clinic, upon completion, will be able to give care and
support for HIV-infected infants and children, and offer training
for health-care providers in Botswana and surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
The clinic will also boast telemedicine capabilities, which
will give health care professionals and patients access to
pediatric specialists around the world.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Seeks International Help in Solving Refugee Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government Monday
has appealed to the international community to help solve the
current refugee crisis involving its citizens, reports reaching
here from Monrovia said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Internal Affairs Minister Maxwell Poe was quoted by
the reports as saying that the international community should
intervene to bring back its citizens completely and safely from
neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Poe, also chairman of a special cabinet committee on the
refugee crisis, said the refugees' situation were worsening as the
Guinean government refused to provide necessary assistance to make
possible for them to return to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Guinean authority began evacuation of refugees of Liberia and
Sierra Leone last week following a speech by President Lansana
Conte, accusing them of helping Guinean dissidents, who launched
cross-border attacks from Liberia into Guinea's border areas
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Liberia said lately that many of its refugees had suffered
harassment and insults by Guinean police on their way back.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Guinea is hosting about half a million
refugees of Liberia and Sierra Leone who fled the civil wars in
the 1990s.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Women's Still Dominate Archery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean women archers
remain the outstanding performers in the individual women's
competition at the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
All three South Korean archers will again feature in the
morning session on Tuesday in the individual top 16 elimination
matchplay.
</P>
<P>
The original field of 64 archers has now been cut to 16 archers.
By the completion of hte day's competition the medalists will be
determined.
</P>
<P>
The top 16 and quarterfinal matches will be the last
opportunity for competitors to break the Olympic record for the 18
arrow match. The record is currently held by Nasaridze Natalia of
Turkey with a score of 168, which Kim Soo-Nyung of South Korea
equaled in Sunday's competition.
</P>
<P>
The archery matchplay format involves one archer shooting on
each target. Arrows are shot in ends of three arrows, with
shooting to alternate between the two competitors in the match.
Each match is individually timed with a maximum of 40 seconds
allowed to shoot each arrow.
</P>
<P>
The order of shooting is determined by a disc toss directly
before the start of the match. The archers on the right hand
target calls the toss and the winner is offered the choice of
shooting first or second.
</P>
<P>
A tie breaking "shoot-off" is conducted if the scores are equal
at the completion of a match. The tie break is conducted
immediately and on the same targets used for the match. A single
arrow is shot in turn by each archer. The archer with the highest
scoring arrow is declared the winner of the match and shooting
continues until the tie is resolved.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Army Deploys in Jezzine in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese army units entered the
district of Jezzine on Tuesday for the first time since the now-
defunct Israel's ally South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia abandoned
the enclave 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Units of 50 soldiers attached to the 11th Lebanese army brigade,
based in Sidon, 40 kilometers south of Beirut, began taking up
positions in military barracks and posts previously used by the SLA
militia in the town of Jezzine and its environs, New Oriental radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jezzine is the former headquarters of the pro-Israeli militia.
The troops, backed by armored vehicles, deployed to three strategic
sectors in the district.
</P>
<P>
The SLA abandoned the positions in June 1999 when the militia
began tightening its front lines in the months before Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese soldiers, who have been stationed at Homsyeh, near
Jezzine, since 1985, will deploy in the region. They have been
strengthened with additional troops and armored cars, police
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The deployment in the Jezzine area is to be reinforced in the
next few days with additional ground forces and permanent
checkpoints, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government had been procrastinating on the Jezzine army
deployment for more than a year because Syria was reported to be
opposed to the move. The reversal of stance was partly attributed
by the press to the change of regime in Syria, Lebanon's
uncontested power broker.
</P>
<P>
The Jezzine move was apparently designed by the Beirut
government to reassure donor nations of its intention to establish
its authority over the entire zone in south Lebanon which was
vacated by Israel in May.
</P>
<P>
The donor nations interested in rebuilding south Lebanon's post-
withdrawal infrastructure have delayed a conference tentatively set
for October until after a new government in Lebanon was formed
toward the end of next month as a result of the recent
parliamentary elections.

<P>
GAZA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat Tuesday evening expressed regret over the Israeli decision
to unilaterally suspend the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli move violates the recent agreement between the two
sides, Erekat said. "It is a clear trifling with the peace process
and an indication of Israel's lack of seriousness," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a member of Palestinian negotiating team in the
final-status talks, Hassan Asfour, said the Israeli decision proves
the policy of procrastination adopted by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to
the United Nations Nasser Al-Qudwah expressed "deep regret" over
the decision.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat chaired a meeting of the
Central Committee of the Fatah Movement, the mainstay of the PLO,
in the West Bank town of Ramallah Tuesday afternoon. The meeting
focused on the political situation after suspension of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday the office of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
declared the suspension of talks with the Palestinians due to what
it called Palestinians' lack of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks on the final-status issues were
resumed on Sunday in Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Barak Backtracks on Suspension of Talks with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Tuesday evening retracted his earlier decision to suspend the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Barak's office said that the talks between
Israeli negotiator Gilad Sher and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb
Erekat will be resumed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The contacts that are aimed at checking whether there is a
basis for the renewal of formal negotiations will continue
tomorrow," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is a continuation of the meetings that took place
at the beginning of this week and after such a meeting did not take
place today," it added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, a source in Barak's office who insisted on
anonymity announced that Barak had decided to halt the peace talks
with the Palestinians because they lack readiness to make key
compromises.
</P>
<P>
"The Israel side will take a time-out from the talks from the
very day, and Israel will use the time-out for internal
consultation," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Israel has reached the limit of its flexibility
in the negotiations, while the Palestinians did not reciprocated
Israel's good intentions, which is the main reason for the
suspension of the talks.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear why the prime minister reconsidered his
decision so dramatically and in so short a time. But it was widely
believed that the United States, a sponsor of the Mideast peace
process, had put pressure on the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Barak cancelled the talks between Palestinian chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat and his Israeli negotiator Gilad Sher Tuesday
afternoon. "They told me there would be no meeting tomorrow, or the
day after," said Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Sher also told reporters that until Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is ready to make critical concessions, the talks will not
move forward.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Erekat, his colleague Mohammed Dahlan on the
Palestinian side and Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
and Sher on the Israeli side had been the major negotiation channel
between the two sides since the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit attended by Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton in July failed to reach any agreement due to significant
gaps over the fate of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Barak and Arafat met with Clinton separately
on the sidelines of the United Nations' Millennium Summit in New
York, but the talks also failed to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Erekat and Sher resumed their talks in Jerusalem last Sunday to
keep momentum of the peace talks, but Barak told his cabinet Monday
that despite the continuation of the contacts, "there has been no
noteworthy progress and no movement is visible in the position of
the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
"So it continues to remain unclear whether we have a partner for
peace," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Barak's referring to "internal consultation" on Tuesday,
analysts believed, may indicated that the prime minister decided to
abandon the peace talks for a while and began his uphill task to
restore his coalition's parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which now controls only one-third seats in the
120-member Knesset (parliament), is in dire need of a majority to
survive no-confidence motions when the Knesset reconvened at the
end of October after the summer recess.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Purchase 20 Airbus Planes From Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- In a fresh move to show its
defiance over the United Nations embargo, Iraqi Airways has decided
to buy a total of 20 Airbus passenger planes from Europe, a source
at the Iraqi state company said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The company will focus on the issue during its coming talks with
an European delegation representing the Airbus company. The
delegation is expected to arrive in the Iraqi capital at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
To make preparations, the Iraqi Airways will send 30 pilots to
attend two training courses to be held in India and Malaysia next
month, some other pilots will be dispatched to the United Arab
Emirates to receive similar training courses, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 engineers from the Iraqi Airways have already undergone
courses on the maintenance of Airbus planes, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Right now there is only one passenger plane in Iraq. All the
other 30 planes of the Iraqi Airways are now stranded in Jordan,
Iran, Libya and Tunisia, and will not be allowed back until the
embargo is lifted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq holds that the no U.N. resolution bans civil flights and
claims that the air embargo has been unilaterally imposed by the
United States and its allies, who insist that all flights must get
prior permission from the United Nations Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Russia, who deems unnecessary to get the authorization of the U.
N. committee to fly to Iraq, has declared that it will resume
regular civil flights from Moscow to Baghdad some time next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- An Iranian official announced on Tuesday that the
private sector will soon be authorized to establish small
industrial banks, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The private banks must have the endorsement of the Central Bank
of Iran, and the Bank of Industry and Mines (BIM) will provide them
with initial capitals, according to Farhad Ryazat, head of planning
of the BIM.
</P>
<P>
He said small-scale industries are the best way to create jobs
and the BIM will provide industrialists with 60 percent of initial
capitals, up to 2 billion rials (some 243,900 U.S. dollars),
required for setting up industrial units.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The balance of payments for August posted a 7 million
U.S. dollars surplus, bringing the total balance for the first
eight months to a 25.5 million U.S. dollars surplus as compared to
a 31.1 million deficit for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has traditionally posted a large trade deficit, which
has been offset by large capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
Debt-servicing costs and the salaries of public employees
account for about 80 percent of public spending, limiting the
government's capability to control the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- As many as 11 new projects with foreign investment
totaling 466 million U.S. dollars were approved during the past
three months, including five projects with total foreign capital,
the local newspaper Riyadh reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed in a press statement issued recently
following the meeting of the board of directors of the General
Investment Authority, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The five pure foreign projects were invested by companies from
India, Iran, Syria and Kuwait, and the joint ventures were invested
by companies from Saudi Arabia, China, Italy, South Korea and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia last year announced a package of legal reforms to
encourage foreign investment and diversify sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The reforms allow foreign investors to own industrial companies
and property and improve the system of local sponsorship for
foreigners doing business in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Officials of the Inspection and Security Section of
the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Department of Ports and Customs
(DP&AMP;C) have destroyed 15 tons of various fake, parallel, prohibited
and other illegal types of goods.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the official news agency on Tuesday,
that the destroyed items, including books, video tapes, compact
disks and alcoholic beverages, were seized during routine
inspections during the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The huge pile of illegal items were destroyed at a garbage dump
of Dubai Municipality at Al Ghusais in the presence of
representatives from both Dubai Police and Dubai Municipality,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- the United Arab Emirates' Abu Dhabi Municipality
has awarded a 23 million dirhams (6.28 million U.S. dollars)
contract to Metito, an international water and wastewater treatment
company.
</P>
<P>
The company will build three new sewage treatment works in the
towns of Baaya, Sila and Ghuwaifat in the western region of Abu
Dhabi, reported the official news agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The works now under construction will meet the demands of the
10,000 residents of Baaya and Sila plus the 1,000 residents of
Ghuwaifat, according to a report in the report.
</P>
<P>
The two-year contract includes the design, supply, construction,
commissioning, handing over, operation and maintenance of the
mechanical and electrical works for the two treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
To build the three plants, Metito will use its standardized
design which was developed through more than 40 years experience in
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The government-owned Fujairah Refinery Company
(FRC) in the Northern Emirate of Fujairah of the United Arab
Emirates resumed production early this month, after two and a half
years of shutdown, according to a recent report in the Middle East
Economic Digest (MEED).
</P>
<P>
FRC resumed production at the rate of 52,000 barrels per day
(bpd).
</P>
<P>
With a nameplate capacity of 105,000 bpd, the refinery is being
operated by the U.S.-based Petrofac International, under an
agreement with the FRC.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the local government, the FRC is owned by the
multinational Glencore International and a group of financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Needs 11.3 Million Dollars for Emergency Assistance to Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Tuesday that it required 11.3
million U.S. dollars for its emergency assistance to the drought-
stricken Horn of African countries.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF said in a statement that so far it received only 212,
000 U.S. dollars in confirmed pledges.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, 10.5 million people in Ethiopia are
affected by the successive years of drought, of whom 1.7 million
are children under 5.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that more than 300,000 Ethiopians have been
displaced due to the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 Ethiopian returnees have arrived from Eritrea, the
majority of whom are children, pregnant or lactating women, the

<HEADLINE> Moldova Calls for Better U.N. Strategies in Preventing Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Foreign Minister Nicolae Tabacaru of
Moldova took the floor at the general debate of the 55th General
Assembly session, which is scheduled to conclude Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It has become obvious that U.N. mechanisms and strategies for
dealing with threats to stability are inadequate," he said. "They
need to be strengthened, not only to resolve conflicts and
conflict situation but, more important to prevent them."
</P>
<P>
"From this perspective, the Republic of Moldova fully supports
the (U.N.) secretary-general's efforts to direct the U.N.'s
strategy towards conflict prevention," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Though the international community, in particular
international organizations, undertake systematic efforts aimed at
resolving conflicts, we should recognize that these efforts
sometimes are short of reaching the proposed goals," he said. "
Currently, on the European continent alone, we witness a number of
unsolved conflicts and potential crisis-generating situations."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was echoing appeals by leaders of other
countries at both the September 6-8 Millennium Summit and the
current General Assembly session for strengthened U.N. mechanisms
to prevent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has given a top priority to
the conflict prevention, but the United Nations, a nonprofit body,
fully relies on its member states for financial and political
support in carrying out its ambitious programs in the fields of
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that the settlement of an on-going conflict
requires incomparably bigger political, financial and moral
efforts than needed at the stage of conflict preventing," he said.

<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's exports of industrial goods reached 447 million
U.S. dollars in the first five months of the current Iranian
calendar year (starting March 20), up 31.6 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Industrial exports hit 99.5 million dollars last month, showing
an increase of 35.1 percent compared with the same period last
year, said a report issued by the Industries Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Iran's major industrial export items include chemicals,
electrical products, electronics, textiles, non-ferrous minerals,
cement, plaster, construction stones and handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey and the Netherlands have agreed to further
boost their existing cooperation in agriculture, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed in The Hague on Monday by Turkish
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Husnu Yusuf Gokalp and
his Dutch counterpart Laurens Jan Brinkhorst.
</P>
<P>
The agreement foresees intense cooperation in vegetal
production, livestock breeding, veterinary, plant health, fishery
and rural development.
</P>
<P>
Within the scope of the agreement, a working group will be
formed and it will convene once a year to technically evaluate the
developments in the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources
Cumhur Ersumer met with Iranian and Russian envoys separately here
Tuesday to discuss energy-related issues.
</P>
<P>
Ersumer discussed with Iranian ambassador Ambassador Seyid
Muhammed Huseyin Lavasani the Turkey-Iran natural gas pipeline
under construction and electricity purchase by Turkey from Iran.
</P>
<P>
He and Russian ambassador Alexander Lebedev focused on the
Turkey-Russian energy commission meetings to be held on October 17-
20, and other energy-related issues.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco's Agricultural Exporters Society said it lost
roughly 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in the European Union (EU) markets
as a result of the low exchange rate of the euro and high energy
prices over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The society said Morocco's agricultural exports to France
decreased by 17 percent and 19 percent to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The society, which comprises vegetable, fruit and citrus
exporters, pointed out in a statement that its exports to the EU
were estimated at 130 billion dirhams (13 billion dollars) since
1996.
</P>
<P>
The society called for devalue the currency so as to keep a
reasonable edge in international competition and change the dirham
pricing basket in which the euro accounts for 50 percent, the
dollar 30 percent, sterling 10 percent and yen 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Inter-Arab investments rose from 2.2 billion dollars in
1998 to 2.4 billion dollars last year, according to a recent
economic report released by the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese, Egyptian and Sudanese quotas of
these investments remarkably hiked up over the recent five years,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that service and tourist sectors came first among
the diverse investment sectors, followed by industry, agriculture
and trade.
</P>
<P>
The increase in inter-Arab investments was ascribed to reform
programs in most of the Arab countries, privatization and the role
of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Among obstacles still impeding the flow of investments are
restrictions of some Arab countries, particularly regarding the
entry of some private investments in a number of sectors,
incomplete infrastructure, shortage of skilled technical labor,
lack of dispute-settlement mechanisms, restricted capital movement
and imposed exchange rates.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official on Tuesday
accused neighboring Turkey of blocking Iranian goods from entering
the country on their way to European markets, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish customs officers have intensified their controls on
trucks carrying Iranian goods into Turkey, said Sadeq Najafi, head
of commerce department of East Azarbaijan province abut on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The official said that trucks carrying Iranian non-oil exports
have to cross Turkey on their way to European states.
</P>
<P>
Turkish customs officers and border guards are creating problems
even for foreign trucks carrying Iranian goods, Najafi claimed,
adding that if the issue is not solved, Iranian on-oil exports
would face severe problems.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted reliable sources as saying that currently
over 800 trailers and trucks are waiting in long queues for
permission to cross Turkey en route to Europe.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, however, why the Turkish customs have
intensified their control on the entry of Iranian goods.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Truckers End Protest over Fuel Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli truckers and bus
drivers ended their highway clogging Tuesday afternoon after
reaching an agreement with the government on fuel price hike.
</P>
<P>
Israel Road Transport Board (IRTB) said in an announcement that
it decided to end the protest due to the positive outcome of the
meeting with Finance Minister Avraham Shochat and acting Transport
Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers promised to adjust the fuel prices once a
month rather than twice a month accordingly, which could be
acceptable to the truckers, it said.
</P>
<P>
The highway clogging by the truckers, which began Tuesday
morning after the failure to reach an agreement with the
government Monday night, disrupted road traffic -- the country's
200-kilometer-long coastal highway from Haifa in the north to
Ashdod in the south was totally congested.
</P>
<P>
IRTB Chairman Gabi Ben-Haroush, who organized this highway
protest, threatened earlier in the day that IRTB's truckers would
block the country's seaports on Wednesday if the government still
refused to reduce fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
No cargo transport has been handled on Tuesday and daily cost
for this could be several million U.S. dollars, port authority
said.
</P>
<P>
IRTB has members of some 15,000 heavy truck drivers and 4,000
bus drivers. Over 90 percent of cargoes are transported by trucks
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Due to the oil price increases in the world, the ministries of
finance and transport decided to increase fuel prices from
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The price of diesel fuel has been increased by 13 percent to 2.
41 shekels (0.60 U.S. dollars) a liter. Since the beginning of
1999, diesel price has been increased by nearly 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
During their Monday night meeting, Finance Ministry officials
said that the price hike does not depend on the government but on
oil prices in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Haroush said that the truckers have been unable to absorb
the increases in the prices of fuel and the transport industry is
facing a collapse.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is only the beginning of industrial action and
that if no efforts are made to improve conditions in the trucking
industry, the protests would spread to other parts of Israel.

<HEADLINE> International Bodies Urged to Press Israel to Quit Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid Tuesday called on world and regional
organizations to support Arab stand by pressuring Israel into
completely withdrawing from Syria's Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The league's assistant secretary general, Ahmad Ben Helei, told
reporters that Abdel-Meguid sent letters to leaders of
international organizations, including the United Nations,
reiterating the pan-Arab forum's demand for an Israeli pullout from
the strategic plateau.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
War. Damascus demands Israel withdraw to the borders before the war
broke out, which would give Syria access to the Sea of Galilee,
Israel's major water source. The Jewish state refuses to retreat so
far.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also urged Israel to stop continued occupation of
Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
Observers said this was apparently referring to the Shebaa farms
area which was not included in Israel's May withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Although Lebanon has now accepted that Israel has pulled back to
the "blue line" drawn by the United Nations, it still has
outstanding border disputes with Israel over the farms.
</P>
<P>
Israel says it captured the 25-square-kilometer land from Syria
in the 1967 war, in which Lebanon was not involved, and that their
future will be decided in talks with Damascus. Beirut, backed by
Syria, says the region belongs to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief urged Israel to release all Lebanese
prisoners and detainees, stressing that the continued detention of
prisoners violates international law and human rights charter.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid's letters were addressed to the U.N., the
Organization of African Unity, the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Arab Maghreb Union,
the International Committee of the Red Cross, the U.N. Commissioner
for Human Rights and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges U.S. to End Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The solution to the Iraqi
issue is that the United States must stop the decade-old embargo on
Iraq, an Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright saying that the end of embargo is in Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's hands, the spokesman said, "The solution is that
U.S. President Bill Clinton gives an order to totally lift the
embargo on Iraq," the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old embargo on Iraq, has lost its "legitimate
justifications" and must be stopped now, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been the major force behind the embargo, triggered
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also accused the U.S. of helping the Zionism
(Israel) achieve its "illegal objectives."
</P>
<P>
The latest flare-up between Iraq and the U.S. came amid U.S.
warnings that Iraq faces grave consequences if it dares to threaten
the security of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We have made it very clear to Saddam Hussein that he should not
seek to pose a threat to his neighbors and his people as he has
done in the past," U.S. Defense Minister William Cohen said
recently.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. has expressed that it will maintain its
hard-line policy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the U.N.
General Assembly on September 12, Albright condemned Iraq's refusal
to accept the U.N. Resolution 1284, and Iraq's efforts "to preserve
at all costs its capacity to produce the deadliest weapons humanity
has ever known."
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to do all we can to ease the hardships faced
by Iraqi people, but we must also defend the integrity of this
institution, our security and international law," she said
</P>
<P>
The tension between Iraq and its tiny neighbor Kuwait, under the
protection of the U.S., rose in recent days. Iraq accused Kuwait
of "stealing" its oil near the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border for years, and
threatened to take "necessary" measures to protect its oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has flatly refused the accusation and expressed that it
welcomes a neutral body to inspect the oil field near the border,
where Kuwait has been accused of depleting Iraqi oil resource by
drilling oil wells in a joint border zone.

<HEADLINE> Russian Transport Minister to Make Direct Flight to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Minister of Transport
Sergei Frank will soon make a direct flight from Moscow to Baghdad
at the invitation of his Iraqi counterpart, local media said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The visit will reflect Russia's efforts to stop the "
illegitimate embargo" on Iraq, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian oil delegation, who made a
direct flight from Moscow to Baghdad last Sunday, concluded its
two-day visit to Iraq on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arnold Baker, head of the Russian delegation, said the visit has
been "fruitful" and "positive," he was quoted by the official Iraqi
News Agency (INA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Baker held talks with senior Iraqi officials
such as Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, Trade Minister Mohammad
Mehdi Salah and Minister of Housing and Construction Maan Abdallah
Sarsam.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a key ally and the largest trade partner of Iraq, has
been stepping up its efforts to break the air embargo, unilaterally
imposed on Iraq by the United States as claimed.
</P>
<P>
Russia holds that it is unnecessary to get the authorization of
the United Nations Sanctions Committee to fly any civil flights to
or from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baker has been reportedly said that the Russian oil delegation
did not ask permission from the U.N. Sanctions Committee to make
the flight to Iraq, but just notified it.
</P>
<P>
One day after the Saddam International Airport was reopened on
August 18, a Russian plane made a direct flight from Moscow to
Baghdad, the first since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, to show its
solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Russia has declared that it will resume regular civil
flights to Iraq next month.

<HEADLINE> Angola Gets $17 Million Donation for Clearing Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This amount of money has been used to support the mine-clearing
actions around the country, including the land surveying, training
the mine-clearance professionals, launching awareness campaigns
against mines and other mine clearance activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in spite of the on-going civil
conflicts, the mine clearance activities continued from 1999 to
May, 2000, as some 10 square kilometers of land have been cleared
from mines and some 15,000 mines were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The money was donated by the European Union, Canada, Denmark,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Holland, Norway, Sweden and the
United States, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of funds, the Angolan National Institute of
Removal of Obstacles and Explosive Engines (Inaroee), set up by
the Angolan government in 1995, is facing difficulties for
continuing their operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Angola is among the countries with the highest rate of planted
landmines, as a result of the over-25-year civil war between the
government troops and the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi. It was
reported that in the country with a population of 12 million there
are some 11 million landmines laid in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda seeks repatriation of her children from Italy. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, September 19 (Xinhua)--The Rwandan Government has
strongly demanded the repatriation of her children taken in 1994
by the Italian government and other countries, the Rwandan
Minister of Foreign Affairs Andr Bumaya said while meeting with
the Italian envoy to Rwanda, Luigi Napolitano, Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The children were flown out of the country without the
permission of their parents, so their parents should be given back
their rights and responsibility," Minister Bumaya told the Envoy.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Rwanda News Agency, Bumaya said
that Italy hosts more than 70 Rwandan children."I requested the
Italian envoy to Rwanda based in Kampala, Uganda to avail this
information to the Italian government to implement that demand
with an immediate effect," Bumaya told RNA.
</P>
<P>
It is said that an estimated 30,000 Rwandan children have been
living in European countries like Italy, France, Belgium, as well
as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Congo Brazaville, who took
them during 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
During the Annual Conference on Children's Rights in Kigali
last August, the first Lady Janet Kagame, called on those
countries to immediately repatriate those children. "We are
grateful to those that saved them from being massacred, but we
remind them that their country and parents miss them and need them
back home," Janet Kagame said. She added that, it is the right of
every child to live with or maintain contact with his or her
parents if separated.

<HEADLINE> IMF Cautions Zimbabwe not to Damage Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Tuesday called up Zimbabwean
government to carry out the land reforms in a lawful and
transparent way, to avoid damage to its agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Neuhaus, IMF's African regional director, said in a
magazine article published here on Tuesday that there are concerns
that the land resettlement exercise, if not carried out in a "
lawful and transparent way", may damage food security in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Zimbabwean government's resolve to acquire more
than 3,041 white farms under a "fast track" program, Neuhaus
warned in the latest issue of the country's "The Farmer" magazine
that the move might bring about "disastrous consequences for
agriculture and the economy".
</P>
<P>
There could be a production decrease of some crops like tobacco,
he warned in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no change in the IMF's position on the land
program, which remained that it be clearly planned and implemented
in a transparent and lawful manner.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Bans Meat From S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Namibia Tuesday banned
all pork and pig products from South Africa, while Botswana is
considering following suit, South Africa's Agriculture Minister
Thoko Didiza said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's ban would apply to animal products like that of the
pigs, goats, sheep and cattle, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Namibia made the decision, apparently in response to an
outbreak of foot and mouth disease on a pig farm in South Africa
last week.
</P>
<P>
South Africa itself has also banned movement of any
agricultural produce from the quarantine area in KwaZulu-Natal
midlands of the country.
</P>
<P>
South African government had warned that spread of the disease
out of the area could result in a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
Foot and mouth disease is an international trade sensitive
disease and failure to contain it to a small area could result in
many countries imposing bans on agricultural exports from South
Africa, the minister warned Monday.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Railway Inflicts Heavy Losses on Mozambican Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The prolonged paralysis of
Mozambique's Sena railway line, linking the port of Beira and
inland coal mines, has inflicted heavy losses upon its economy,
Mozambican newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Not a single train has moved on the line over the past 17 years,
resulting in an annual loss of some 31.5 million U.S. dollars upon
the country's ports and railway authorities, the newspapers quoted
Chairman of the Mozambican Railway Corporation Rui Fonseca as
saying lately.
</P>
<P>
Fonseca called on the government to put on the renovation of
the line high on its agenda, but warned that the land mines along
the line would be a serious hindrance for the proposed work.
</P>
<P>
The railway line was completely sabotaged by the apartheid-
backed Renamo rebels during the country's civil war period.

ADDIS ABABA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian displays at the
Hanover-2000 Expo in Germany have so far attracted more than 1
million visitors since July, an official said here Tuesday.

The expo has provided Ethiopia with an excellent opportunity to
redress the tarnished images attached to the country for decades,

He said that the Ethiopian pavilion at the expo, with displays

<P>
The Ethiopian show has also proved an effective instrument in
changing the bad images of drought and famine the country has been
identified with.
</P>
<P>
The unfavorable images attached to Ethiopia, especially the war
between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the famine crisis, have prevented
many foreign tourists from visiting Ethiopia, which has a 3,000-

MAPUTO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government and

11.25 million U.S. dollars in aid to support fishing industry in

The money would be used in three districts in the country's

Fishing is the main source of income for population in these

He added that the government was also negotiating with other
donors to launch similar projects in other areas of the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sees Financing for Development More Important in Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Alwi Shihab, minister for foreign
affairs of Indonesia, said while enormous financial flows have
characterized the global financial system, the basic problem for
majority of the developing countries is that they are not in a
position to benefit from such flows and must instead depend on
official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, the official development assistance has sharply
declined for the past years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Another area which is closely associated with financing for
development is the issue of the indebtedness of the developing
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The heavy debt often seriously undermines their development
efforts particularly in this era of globalization, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, he noted, the numerous debt strategies and
initiatives employed over the years have failed to resolved this
problem.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he expressed the hope that the forthcoming
international high-level event on financing for development to be
held in 2001 will address these two issues.

<HEADLINE> DU Weapons Can Cause Lasting Sufferings, Yugoslav Envoy Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told a press conference here that the NATO
dropped 50,000 missiles containing a total of 10 to 15 tons of
depleted uranium, a kind of highly radioactive material, during
its 78-day air strikes on Yugoslavia, beginning on March 24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav diplomat cited a February 7 letter from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said, "I can confirm that DU was
used during the Kosovo conflict."
</P>
<P>
During the air strikes, NATO fired some 50,000 DU bombs on
around 100 densely populated locations in Kosovo, a Yugoslav
province, and southern Serbia in the Balkan country, which is 1,
100 times more than the permissible level of contamination, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The use of depleted uranium weapons represents a grave breach
of the basic principles of international law because they cause
unnecessary suffering and excessive injury, beyond the point used
for military purposes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The use of this type of ammunition is absolutely inhumane,
both in terms of immediate effects and the contamination that
cannot be limited in time and territory, which represents a crime
against humanity," he said.
</P>
<P>
DU is radioactive and chemically toxic waste product of the
nuclear industry. With a half-life of 4.5 billion years, DU has
lasting effect and its chemical and radiological toxicity cannot
be reduced, he said. If inhaled or ingested through water and food,
it cannot be removed from the body, acting as a quiet killer.
</P>
<P>
At the conference on DU and cancers, held in London on July 30,
1999, the participating scientists confirmed that DU shells can
cause serious illness, including cancer.
</P>
<P>
"Armies and governments of NATO countries are aware of the
dangers arising from depleted uranium," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Government gives to its troops protective clothing,
afterwards stored in depots for dangerously contaminated materials,
while on June 30, the Netherlands withdrew its soldiers from the
international peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Italian and German soldiers use imported food and water, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, no one can escape the effects of breathing in the air.
In addition to local population, international civilian and
security presence, humanitarian and nongovernmental organizations
workers are also exposed to DU dust in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has warned its officials in Kosovo that the
water supply may be contaminated, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The same weapon was used in the Gulf War 10 years ago,"
Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
Depleted uranium, used in military shells, has been linked to
Gulf War syndrome and spiraling levels of cancer and birth
deformities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the New York-based International Action Center, 50,
000-80,000 U.S. Gulf War veterans are concerned and 39,000 have
been dismissed from active service. Some 2,400 to 5,000 have died
up to now.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, reports on some 251 families of veterans of the
Gulf War living in the U.S. state of Mississippi were published in
the United States, saying that 67 percent of the children of these
families were born with congenital deformities: their eyes, ears
or fingers are missing or they are suffering from sever blood
diseases and respiratory problems.

<HEADLINE> UN Not Sure If World Economic Growth Can Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Despite healthy signs in the world economy this year, large
imbalances in growth, external payments and capital flows remain,"
said the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (
UNCTAD). "With adjustment of these imbalances falling on monetary
policy alone, a smooth correction is not guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
In its trade and development report, 2000, UNCTAD said that the
world economy pulled itself back from the brink last year, largely
due to unexpected events, including the continued strength of the
US economy.
</P>
<P>
The United States continued its longest period of expansion in
modern history, helped both by massive capital inflows, short and
long, and by new technologies, according to the UN agency. But
economic growth above four percent and imports rising by 12
percent are now unsustainable. Events of the 1970s and 1980s
showed how abruptly the willingness of overseas investors to hold
dollar-denominated assets can disappear.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD said that Europe stumbled last year as differential
growth performance inside Euroland complicated the search for a
common monetary stance and the European Central Bank (ECB)
struggled to find an independent policy position against the
backdrop of closely integrated global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, Japan picked up in 1999, helped by recovery in East
Asia. However, UNCTAD cautioned, private spending remains fragile,
leaving a lot hanging on exports and public spending although
prospects look healthier still this year.
</P>
<P>
"Growth in both Europe and Japan is vulnerable to any hike in
US interest rates and a sharp slowdown in that economy," UNCTAD
said in the report. "Recent US experience holds important policy
lessons for reducing unemployment in Europe and managing the
budget deficit in Japan."
</P>
<P>
As for developing countries, UNCTAD said that Asia was the big
success in 1999 with growth exceeding five percent. The big
economies of India and China, where growth was around seven
percent, performed above average. Policy makers across the region
will be following China's WTO accession talks very closely.
</P>
<P>
Conditions deteriorated in Latin America in 1999, with per
capita income contracting for the first time since 1990, according
to the UNCTAD report. However, Mexico, with close links to the US
economy, bucked this trend, and some of the smaller Caribbean
economies posted healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
Africa also saw growth stagnate in 1999, UNCTAD said. Weak
prices for some commodities, political conflicts and the weather
proved too much of a burden across many parts of the continent.
But UNCTAD noted some positive signs in north and east Africa,
where growth was above the regional trend, and the worst appears
to be over in Nigeria and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> French Enterprises Make Record Benefits in First Half of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Twenty largest French
enterprises have made a record amount of benefits in the first
half of this year due to a strong global economic growth, the new
economy, heavy investments in stock markets and a weak euro.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics published on Tuesday said that the 20 top
enterprises of France made 86.9 billion francs (11.6 billion U.S.
dollars) of benefits in the first six months of this year, which
almost equals those registered in the whole year of 1999.
</P>
<P>
France Telecom made a net benefit of 25 billion francs (3.2
billion U.S. dollars) due to its development of the internet, and
the Total-Fina-Elf oil group won 22.3 billion francs (2.9 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts said a strong economic growth around the world, a
strong domestic demand in France and a favorable situation for
exports have marked the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
But French enterprises are also faced with a series of problems
such as the rise of prices of oil and other primary materials and
increasing pressure from the working class asking for a better
sharing of the economic fruits through a raise of salaries,
experts said.

UNITED NATIONS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Tuesday that a way should be found so as to
break the impasse and get Iraq to cooperate with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan, who held talks Monday with
Mohammed Said Kazem Al-Sahaf, minister for foreign affairs of Iraq,
said the Iraq-U.N. relationship must move forward.
</P>
<P>
"We did talk about the Iraq-U.N. relationship. We did talk
about moving forward. We did talk about the implementation of (U.N.
resolution) 1284, which they (Iraqis) still do not accept," the U.
N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"I had a very useful discussion with him on the U.N.
relationship on the ground, the oil-for-food, the humanitarian
aspects," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We should find a way to breaking the impasse and get Iraq to
cooperate with the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was not evident in my talks with the foreign minister that
Iraqis would let inspectors back in, said the U.N. chief, adding
that "but in this life I don't think one can say never or forever.
"
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq has been suspended since
December 1998 when the United States and Britain launched military
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1284 in
December 1999 which created a new U.N. weapons inspection regime
for Iraq called the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission to resume the work.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has so far barred it from returning, reiterating that
lifting sanctions is the precondition for the U.N. weapons
inspectors to return.
</P>
<P>
According to the relevant U.N. resolutions, sanctions against
Iraq cannot be lifted until the country is clarified to be free
from weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> IMF Predicts 4.7 Percent World Economic Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest edition of "World Economic Outlook" said that the
global growth rate in 2000 is 0.5 percentage points higher than it
projected in May this year. The improvement is backed by the
continued strength of the U.S. economy, a robust expansion in
Europe, a nascent -albeit still fragile- recovery in Japan and
stronger economic fundamentals in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report took note of the consolidation of the
recovery in Asia, rebounds from last year's slowdowns in Latin
America and the Middle East, as well as improved activity in
Africa. IMF said the economy of transition countries is expected
to register a second year of solid growth, underpinned by much
better than expected performance in Russia, while some countries
continue to experience serious economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Robust world trade expansion also contribute greatly to the
solid economic growth, with annual trade volume, goods and
services included, forecast to increase by 10.0 percent this year
and 7.8 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
With GDP growth projected to increase in all major regions of
the world, the global economy is expected to continue to
strengthen, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The document continued that "although headline inflation rates
have risen in response to higher energy prices -- and inflationary
pressures are a concern in some cyclically advanced countries,
including the United States and the faster growing countries in
Europe -- underlying inflation in most advanced economies remains
relatively subdued."
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out there are still some potential
risks ahead. IMF in the three main currency areas, particularly
the euro and the U.S. dollars, are poising a continued risk to the
global expansion. It also cautioned the uneven pattern of GDP, and
the associated imbalances in their external current accounts,
including a record deficit in the United States reflect the
current economic conditions.

PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- France said on Tuesday that it
is closely following the situation on the border between the west
African state of Guinea and two of its neighbors, Sierra Leone and
Liberia, after gunmen attacked border villages this month.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Bernard Valero said

keeping close contacts with the 3,500 French nationals living in
Guinea.

<HEADLINE> EU Energy Chief Says No to Fuel Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Member states must resist the temptation, amid demands from
certain sectors of the economy, to reduce taxes," European Union
Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio said.
</P>
<P>
"That would be tantamount to admitting the OPEC (Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries) were right and would run counter
to the energy and transport policies of the European Union," the
commissioner added.
</P>
<P>
Several EU member states, including France, Britain, Belgium,
Germany and Spain, had waged ferocious road protests against ever-
rising oil prices and fuel prices. Angry truck and tractor drivers
set up road blockades and demanded government reduction on fuel
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The French and Belgian authorities already agreed to introduce
some tax-cutting measures while de Palacio warned that the
European Commission, the executive branch of the 15-nation bloc,
would take legal action against member state governments if their
measures to support truckers and farmers contravene the EU rules.
</P>
<P>
"In certain instances, I have serious doubts about the measures
agreed," she said, "the commission will have to take action if
these measures are infringing community law."
</P>
<P>
Germany on Tuesday criticized other EU member states for giving
in to demands for fuel tax cuts from protesting truck drivers and
farmers.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been urging the OPEC to increase
production so as to reduce oil prices. As much as 75 percent of
the oil consumption in the EU member states depends on imports and
the percentage is calculated to rise to 85 percent by the year
2020.
</P>
<P>
Though the OPEC last week decided to increase oil production by
an additional 800,000 barrels a day, the oil prices still kept
rising on international markets.
</P>
<P>
October crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to a
new high of 37.15 U.S. dollars a barrel on Monday. Except for a
brief high of 34.37 dollars a barrel in March, the price Monday
was the highest since oil prices surged in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seem determined to fluctuate within a band
of above 30 U.S. dollars a barrel and it entered that band in
February this year following an uninterrupted rise since December
1998 when the crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel.

<P>
ATHENS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite the continued rise in
fuel prices in Europe, Greece Tuesday rejected the demands for
fuel tax cuts and wage increase to lower incomes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with Greece's Development Minister
Nikos Christodoulakis, Greek Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos
Papantoniou said that there were no room for fuel tax cuts.
</P>

Greece had a strong economy that had nothing to do with the
situation in the previous two oil crises in 1973-74 and 1979-80,
the minister said.

<HEADLINE> EU Blames Market Excess for Further Euro Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on
Tuesday blamed excessive activities on international exchange
markets for the continued fall of its single currency that hit a
new low again.
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that excessive activities on the markets have caused
the further decline of the euro," Gerassimos Thomas, monetary
spokesman for the 15-nation bloc, said.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers from the Group of Seven are scheduled to
meet over the weekend in Prague, the Czech Republic, to discuss,
among other things, the ever weakening euro.
</P>
<P>
Yet hectic sellings by skeptical traders further pushed the
euro down to its eighth record low in 10 trading days. The single
currency hit a fresh record low of trading at one time for 0.8487
U.S. dollars on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated at a value of 1.17 dollars on January 1 last year,
the euro has devalued by more than a quarter as of now.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the continued fall of the euro, the
spokesman said that the European Commission, the executive body of
the union, just did not have an economic or a technical analysis
on the situation yet.
</P>
<P>
The EU official offered an explanation for the continued fall
of the euro from the fact that huge quantities of investment was
moved from Europe to the United States, where the economy has been
enjoying a faster growth.
</P>
<P>
But Gerassimos said there could be no stop to the introduction
of the single currency in that it was "already there since January
1 of 1999" though financial specialists suggested on Monday that
the further fall caused a viability crisis of the introduction of
the euro.
</P>
<P>
Critics are challenging the credibility and viability of the
single currency that has been used as the accounting units in 11
of the 15 EU member states. Euro coins and banknotes will enter
into circulation on January 1, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Condemns Killing of U.N. Worker in Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Security Council also called for "the immediate release" of
another U.N. staff abducted in the Sunday attack.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a statement to the press by the
council president for the month of September, Moctar Ouane of Mali.
The statement came at the end of the closed-door consultations by
the 15-nation body.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the council very strongly condemned this
intolerable attack, which caused many civilian casualties, and
deplored in particular the murder of the local representative of
the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council president issued the statement after the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in Geneva Monday that
Mensah Kpognon, the head of the sub-office of UNHCR, was killed
Sunday by unidentified gunmen and another UNHCR staff member,
Sapeu Laurence Djeya, was abducted in the same attack in southeast
Guinea, near the border with Liberia.
</P>
<P>
In another statement issued by his spokesman, Annan said Monday
he "strongly condemns this senseless violence against humanitarian
workers, and appeals to West Africa leaders to do whatever they
can to secure the release of Ms. Laurence Djeya," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the council associated themselves with the
secretary-general's appeal for better protection of humanitarian
workers in the region and called for the immediate release of Ms.
Djeya," the council statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the council expressed their deep concern about
the humanitarian situation of the refugees in Guinea and the
border population," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The killed man, a Togolese national, is the fourth UNHCR staff
member murdered this month. The three others were killed in a pro-
Indonesian militia attack in West Timor on September 6.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based U.N. agency said it is calling on aid workers
worldwide to hold marches on Thursday to protest the abduction and
recent killings of UNHCR staff.
</P>
<P>
Many Guineans were killed and a lot of houses burnt down in the
attack, which began early Sunday morning, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 460,000 refugees in Guinea -- about 330,000
of them Sierra Leonean and some 126,000 Liberian. Most of the
refugees in the Macenta area are Liberian, UNHCR said.

<HEADLINE> Regional Integration Best Way for African Development: IMF Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Regional integration can offer "
the best way" for the economic and social development of Africa, a
senior economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
African countries have "less favorable geographical set-ups"
for industrialization and economic development, Pierre van den
Boogarde said ahead of the opening of the third session of African
trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
"Regional and continental integration is the best way for Africa
in its drive for industrialization," van den Boogarde told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The IMF economist was in Cairo to attend the two-day African
trade meeting, which was to discuss inter-Africa trade, regional
economic integration and globalization of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Van den Boogarde pointed out that Africa's trade volume accounts
for a small proportion of the world's total, standing at about 2.8
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Production capacity building is the urgent task in the African
countries' efforts to expand trade with the rest of the world and
deal with challenges facing the continent in economic
globalization, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF has been closely following and offering help to
Africa's economic development. It assists the continent's efforts
for macroeconomic stabilization, reduction of foreign debts and
poverty, and regional economic integration, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the current meeting of African trade ministers is "
important and useful because it allows the continent to speak more
and more in the international trade forum in one voice."

DHAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament has
agreed to fully support Bangladesh's projects in land reclamation
and information technology, a project for creating self-employment
for the poor and homeless and arsenic mitigation, according to the
United News of Bangladesh Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to give you full support in these projects," Jouquim
Miranda, president of the Committee on Development of Cooperation
(CDC) of the European Parliament, told Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A CDC delegation, led by its president, called on the prime
minister at her office and discussed with her socioeconomic and
political issues.
</P>
<P>
The delegation specially showed their interest in the next
general election in Bangladesh and wanted to know whether
Bangladesh would allow international observers during the polls.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely we will allow international observers during the
next election, which will be held under a neutral, non-party
caretaker government," the prime minister said, adding, "We
suggested that a fair election monitoring alliance be established
for overseeing the elections."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said her party had a long struggle for the
restoration of democracy in the country, because it believes that
without democracy peace cannot be established and without peace
development is not possible.
</P>
<P>
She mentioned various development projects undertaken for the
welfare of the people and said that these projects have benefited
millions of deprived people.
</P>
<P>
The delegation members told the prime minister that they have
already visited some projects of the government.
</P>

They promised to extend their total support to these projects,
saying the European Union is ready to give all-out support for
these projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An international conference
began here Tuesday to review the Vietnam of the 20th century and
discuss its future development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss topics such as the role of Vietnam'

revolutionary cause, the August 1945 Revolution, the two
resistance wars for national independence and unification in 1945
and 1975, world views on Vietnam's revolution, changes in Vietnam

renovation process.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Manh Cam

<P>
On Vietnam's development in the 21st century, Cam said, "The
next century will see the Vietnamese people's great achievements
in their national development and defense."

In August, the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages
dropped to 8.03 percent from the average rate of 8.15 percent the
month before. But August's rate was still considerably higher than
the 7.94 percent average rate on 30-year mortgages in August 1999.

<HEADLINE> France Promises to Help Italy Investigate 1980 Plane Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- France on Tuesday promised that
it will help Italy investigate the cause of an Italian passenger
plane explosion that occurred over the Mediterranean Sea in 1980,
in which 81 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac made the promise to visiting
Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato during their meeting at the
Elysee presidential palace, said French presidential spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
"Chirac promised that France would be ready to cooperate fully
and without reservation with the Italian judicial authorities,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Amato said he hoped that France would continue cooperating with
Italy on the issue, after several rogatory commissions set up by
France to investigate the accident did not reach any definite
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The DC-9 passenger plane owned by the Itavia air company was
hit on June 27,1980, over the island of Ustica near Sicily by a
bomb or a missile fired by a NATO country fighter, according to
the Italian resources.
</P>
<P>
Two Libyan planes were reportedly chased at that time by a U.S.
or French fighter, which could have mistakenly fired at the
Italian plane after the Libyan planes followed its route.
</P>
<P>
France has always denied any involvement in the catastrophe.

LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle United have signed
Zaire-born striker Lomana Tresor Lua Lua from second division
Colchester United for 3.16 million U.S. dollars, officials said on

</P>

Colchester manager Steve Whitton said the club had reluctantly

this season.
</P>
<P>
Whitton said: "Bearing in mind the possible abolition of the
transfer system, I felt the time and the fee were right and
recommended acceptance to the board."
</P>
<P>
The European Union has proposed scrapping the transfer fee
system under which players move from club to club in favour of
giving footballers the same right as other workers in Europe to
choose their employers at will.

<TEXT>
<P>
Earth-shaking changes have taken place in China during the past
five years, the article points out. China now is able to provide
enough food and clothing to its 1.2 billion citizens, and gone are
the days when general agricultural and industrial products were in
short supply.
</P>
<P>
With a sound agriculture, the rural economy has grown steadily.
The rapid development of the industrial economy enables the
gradual improvement in the performance of state-owned enterprises,
and the goal for loss-incurring large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises to become profitable by the end of the year will be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
The article also mentions China's remarkable achievements in
infrastructure construction, the gradual formation of a national
social security system and the great achievements in the re-
employment of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
During the five years, says the article, China has made
breakthroughs in economic restructuring and reforms of state-owned
enterprises, the housing system and government organs, as well as
in financial, science and technology, educational, medical and
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
"China also made a big step forward in its national
reunification cause during the five years," the article says,
referring to the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland
respectively in 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The accomplishments in the five years have laid a solid
foundation for China's future development, says the article, which
calls on the nation to make even greater achievements in the
coming tenth five-year plan period (2001-05) under the leadership
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at the core.

<HEADLINE> Autumn Trade Fair Opens in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Nanjing Autumn Trade
Fair opens today at the Nanjing International Exhibition Center in
this capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Qian Qichen and two vice-chairmen of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), Wang Zhaoguo and Jing Shuping, attended the
opening ceremony with about 3,000 participants.
</P>
<P>
The five-day fair, sponsored by the Jiangsu Provincial
Government, attracted 1,500 foreign businessmen from 51 countries
and regions. More than 1,000 investment projects were opened for
overseas investors at the fair, ranging from infrastructure,
agriculture and high-tech to service industries, and one-tenth of
the projects need investment of over 10 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Various activities will be held during the fair including an
international agriculture cooperation fair, a cross-Strait high-
tech industry development seminar and private business trade talks
for high-tech development.
</P>
<P>
The high profile fair's aim was to invite investment. Nanjing
has been committed to strengthen its status as an important city
along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River open to the outside
world. Some 5,418 overseas-funded enterprises were set up in the
city, with total contractual overseas funding standing at 7
billion US dollars and actually used funds totaling 3.58 billion
US dollars last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
the People's Daily, is to deliver a commentator's article tomorrow,
heralding the great achievements China has made in its ninth five-
year plan period (1996-2000) and describing the five years a "
great milestone" for the country's development in all fields.
</P>
<P>
"It is another harvest season, and the Chinese people from all
ethnic groups are excited by the great achievements they have made
in the past five years and are looking forward to the bright
prospects with joy and confidence," the article says.
</P>
<P>
The past five years have proved to be very crucial to China's
reform and development -- the hardness, the difficulty as well as
the great achievements are all very rare in history, it says.
</P>
<P>
During this period China has achieved its second strategic goal
of modernization by doubling its per capita gross domestic product,
basically eliminating poverty and largely improving the living
standards of the people, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to establish a modern enterprise system has been
stepped up and a socialist market economic system has taken shape
initially during the "great five years," it says.
</P>
<P>
Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis adversely affected
China's economic growth, China at last succeeded in controlling
inflation and achieving an economic soft-landing. The Chinese
government has also taken measures to effectively expand domestic
demand, which invigorates economic development and ensures the
success in achieving the goals set for the ninth five-year plan
period.
</P>
<P>
Judging from a global perspective, China's accomplishments in
the five years' economic development are hard-won, the article
says.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
socialists called on Tuesday for decreased dependence on oil and
encouraged use of alternative energies.
</P>
<P>
"This oil price crisis has hit us earlier than we expected. It
is not only a very good opportunity to assess our dependence on
oil products, but also an excellent chance to encourage the use of
bio-diesel and other renewable energies in the transport sector,"
said Eryl McNally, the spokesperson of the European Parliamentary
group of the Party of European Socialists.
</P>
<P>
Eryl McNally made the statement at a European Parliament
session held by the energy committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
EU socialists suggested that hydrogen fuels be encouraged as
well as the development of electric-powered vehicles. "Another
area worth investigating is the use of natural gas, which is more
economically and environmentally friendly," added McNally.
</P>
<P>
Several European Union member states including France, Britain,
Belgium, Germany and Spain had launched large-scale protests
against rising oil and fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
As much as 75 percent of the oil consumed by EU member states
depends on imports. The percentage is expected to rise to 85
percent by 2020.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Traditional Medicine Wins Favor in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- For Kerri, a 23-year-old
Australian college student, Chinese traditional medicine is more
charming than the glorious opening ceremony of the Olympic Games
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
She left Sydney last Friday along with 16 other classmates at
Victoria University for Liaoning College of Chinese Traditional
Medicine in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
They will begin their two-month internship at a hospital
unveiled today and jointly set up by the two universities.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum signed by the two universities, an
exchange program will start between Chinese teachers and
Australian students, starting this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in simple Chinese, Kerrie said she will continue her
four-year study of Chinese acupuncture and massage.
</P>
<P>
"I'm fascinated by Chinese traditional medicine," she said. "I
hope I can carry it forward in Australia by practicing in my
clinic after my graduation."
</P>
<P>
Her schoolmate, Cristine, said an increasing number of
Australians are turning to Chinese traditional medicine and
massage when they are ill.
</P>
<P>
Another fellow, Udi, has practiced Chinese massage for five
years and has cured his nephew with Chinese traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
"I always dreamt of being a competent pediatrician treating the
poor kids with Chinese acupuncture one day," he said.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that since it was adopted by
universities in Australia in 1993, Chinese traditional medicine
has attracted thousands of Australian students.
</P>
<P>
Among the 600 graduates from the Chinese Traditional Medicine
Department in Victoria University, 99 percent are Australians.

During his visit to the six countries, Li met with presidents,
parliament leaders and prime ministers of the countries,
exchanging views with them on bilateral relations as well as other
issues of common concern.
</P>

Li also had wide-ranging discussions with people from various
walks of life in the different countries, including personnel from

developing steadily since China established diplomatic ties with
them, the spokesman said, adding that Li's visit was a major step
toward pushing forward China's friendship and cooperation with the
countries.

<HEADLINE> Much of Ancient Inscriptions on Bones, Shells Related to Droughts: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Much of the 3,000-year-old
inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells of the Shang Dynasty (
16th century to 11th century B.C.) unearthed in China were found
to be related to the most dry period of the past six millenniums
in northern China, a large seminar was told today.
</P>
<P>
Hong Yetang, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
explained that about 3,000 years ago, when the characters were
widely used, dry condition may have exerted such great influence
on ancient agriculture and social life that even much of the
inscriptions were devoted to divination and praying for rain.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the present-day Chinese characters are
evolved from the characters on the bones and shells, one of the
earliest characters in the world.
</P>
<P>
Based on the results of his research into the record of peat
cellulose, Hong said northern China has undergone six dry and warm
periods during the past six millenniums, and the period between 1,
450 B.C. and 1,000 B.C. is the most dry one, which coincides with
the Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ongoing annual academic meeting of the Chinese
Association for Sciences and Technology, Hong said the peat
cellulose gathered from Jilin Province, northeast China, precisely
indicated the change of droughts and rainfalls in ancient northern
China.
</P>
<P>
Hong said his conclusion on the climate coincides with those
drawn from many records, such as the growth rings of woods in
western America, Europe, equatorial eastern Africa, and sediments
in the Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
Droughts and rainfalls are related to the cycles of the
activity of solar macula, he said.
</P>
<P>
Solar radiation leads to change in the volume of clouds, then
change of air temperature, the oceanic state of the heat, the
interaction between oceans and the atmosphere, and all these
result in global change of drought and rainfall, said Hong.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's top diplomat in Cairo
on Tuesday hailed a Chinese-proposed forum as an important means
for the strengthening of cooperation with African countries.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting of the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum in
Beijing will be "one of the most important event in the process of
economic cooperation" between the two sides, Tanzanian Ambassador
Muhammed Mzale told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China has proposed African ministers of foreign affairs and
trade meet on October 10-12 in its capital with their Chinese
counterparts to discuss prospects and ways of intensifying
cooperation in the new era.
</P>
<P>
Mzale expressed his country's readiness to take part in the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate very much the Chinese initiative to hold such a
forum for us to seek new means of strengthening cooperation," he
said prior to the opening here of the third session of African
trade ministers to discuss inter-African trade, economic
integration of the continent and globalization of the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
"China is a partner which can offer, and is still offering" in
the field of trade with Africa, Mzale stressed, speaking highly of
China's long-standing close cooperation and good trade relations
with African countries, Tanzania in particular.
</P>
<P>
While blaming developed countries for failing to open up
markets, Mzale called on African countries to expand trade among
themselves so as to "acquire a better position in trade" with non-
African states.
</P>
<P>
In line with this thinking, Tanzania keeps cooperation with
other African countries by joining regional groups and signing
bilateral trade agreements, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet on Tuesday
appointed Piromsakdi Laparojkit to be the new secretary-general of
the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet believes that Piromsakdi, who is currently deputy
secretary-general of the National Economic and Social Development
Board, a state planning agency, will be tough enough to deal with
the energy crisis threatening the country, according to a news
release after the weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, sources claimed earlier that the cabinet had hesitated
to choose Piromsakdi, a Harvard graduate, who opposes the
privatization of state-owned businesses while the cabinet's energy
sector reform plan calls for privatizing the state-owned energy
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Piyasvasti Amranand, former NEPO secretary-general, served the
state energy agency for two consecutive terms and thus can not
hold the position again according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally in Thailand, the bureaucrat reshuffle in state
agencies including NEPO is to be completed in September so that
the new heads can begin work in time for the start of the new
fiscal year,which starts on October 1.

NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Sustained heavy dollar
demand from companies and importers sent the rupee crashing to
historic lows of 46.25/28 against the U.S. dollar in early intra-
day deals at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (FOREX) market Tuesday
on growing concerns over rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Nervousness crept into the FOREX spot trade as companies and
banks turned panicky and rushed to cover dollar positions, taking
a heavy toll in the rupee value, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said increase in global oil prices and fresh incidents
in Gulf countries have put considerable pressure on the rupee,
resulting in a sharp fall in the currency's value.

<HEADLINE> UN Report: Hikes in Interest Rates Major Cause of Damage During Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Most of the damage incurred
during the Asian crisis was a result of interest rate hikes -- not
currency declines, the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development(UNCTAD) said in a report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Although the crisis in each country had its own
characteristics, there is still little doubt that the extremes of
collapse and recovery, for the most part, were due to misguided
policies," UNCTAD said in its year 2000 Trade and Development
Report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the initial policy response was
unnecessarily severe and the expectation that tight monetary
policies could quickly stabilize the situation was incorrect.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, UNCTAD said, monetary tightening aggravated
the crisis by deepening the debt deflation process set off by
speculative attacks and resulted in reduced output and employment.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the hike in interest rates proved to be much more
damaging than currency depreciation, causing serious dislocations
in corporate and financial sectors," UNCTAD said, "The economies
only bounced back when policies of austerity were reversed and
governments were allowed to play a more positive role."
</P>
<P>
Since neither the depth of crisis nor the speed of recovery
were anticipated even by those responsible for policy, UNCTAD
warned against excessive exuberance, despite the fact that the
speed of recovery in the region over the past year has been
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD outlined the following points as major reasons for
concern:
</P>
<P>
-- Recovery has been accompanied by only limited corporate
restructuring, and the health of the financial system continues to
rely on public intervention in credit mechanisms;
</P>
<P>
-- Exports are unlikely to continue at their recent pace, and
public deficits and debt have been on the rise in most countries
that were seriously hit by the crisis;
</P>
<P>
-- The recovery so far has been supported by favorable
conditions in the world economy which are susceptible to change.
</P>
<P>
"A fundamental lesson of the financial crisis is surely that
excessive reliance on foreign resources and markets leaves growth
prospects vulnerable to external shocks," the U.N. agency
concluded, "Greater attention also needs to be given to domestic
sources of growth, such as rising wage shares and higher social
spending."

<HEADLINE> EU Blames Excessive Activities for Euro's Further Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Tuesday blamed excessive market activity for the further fall of
the euro that hit a new record low.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that excessive activities on the markets have caused
the further decline of the euro," said Gerassimos Thomas, monetary
spokesman of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the continued fall to lack of economic or
technical analysis on the situation by the European Commission,
the executive body of the EU, and to the growing movement of
investment from Europe to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the single currency would be introduced as
planned, although an American monetary specialist said on Monday
that the further fall caused a viability crisis for the euro.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers from the Group of Seven are expected to
meet over the weekend in Prague, Czech Republic, to discuss, among
other things, the weakening euro.
</P>
<P>
The euro hit a record trading low of 0.8487 U.S. dollars on
Tuesday. Inaugurated at a value of 1.17 dollars on January 1,1999,
the euro has deflated more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Critics are challenging the credibility and viability of the
euro, which has been the single currency in 11 of the 15 EU member
states. Euro coins and banknotes will enter into circulation on
January 1,2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool striker Michael Owen
believes his club will be unable to challenge champions Manchester
United for another two seasons.
</P>
<P>
20-year-old Owen Tuesday said: "I believe Manchester United are
the best team in the league.
</P>
<P>
"Our (Liverpool's) aim is Champions League football. If, by the
end of the season, we have done that then we will have taken
another step.
</P>
<P>
"If we can keep making progressive steps then we may get there.
Maybe give us a couple of years. At the moment, United are still
ahead of the rest of us."
</P>
<P>
Liverpool ranked fourth in the premier league table with 10
points and have lost one of their five matches this season.
Manchester United topped the table with 14 points.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Cameroon Join U.S. and Italy in Top Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Cameroon joined
Italy and the United States in the quarter-finals of the Olympic
men's football tournament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria - gold medal winner in Atlanta four years ago - needed
a point against Italy, who had already qualified, in their Group A
clash to ensure their progress and gained precisely that.
</P>
<P>
The Super Eagles took the lead six minutes before half-time
with a penalty from captain Garba Lawal after Victor Agali was
hauled down by Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiati.
</P>
<P>
But Azubuike Oliseh was dismissed on the hour for bringing down
Ighli Vannucchi on the edge of the box and four minutes later
Roberto Baronio - the Italian skipper - volleyed home via a
helpful deflection off Gbengq Okunowa.
</P>
<P>
The Italians will now meet the runner-up from Group B in the
quarter-finals at Sydney but coach Marco Tardelli is wary of their
switch to the host city.
</P>
<P>
The United States defeated Kuwait 3-1 to qualify as winners of
Group C on goal difference after Cameroon could only draw with the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
They next meet the second-placed side in Group D - to be
revealed Wednesday but either Japan, Brazil or South Africa - for
a place in the last four.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal star Lauren fired Cameroon ahead against the Czech
Republic in the 12th minute but Lukas Dosek equalised with a
quarter of an hour left after Daniel Bekono had failed to hold on
to a stinging free-kick.
</P>
<P>
Fancied to do well by many before the tournament, the Czechs
finished winless from their three group matches.
</P>
<P>
The quarter-finals take place Saturday evening.

<HEADLINE> Italian Coach Worries FIBA Rule Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- It is a confused feeling for
Italian coach Bogdan Tanjevic to see the introduction of a 24-
second shooting clock, which is to be adopted by the International
Basketball Federation next year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid people will just shoot from outside all the time,"
said Tanjevic at a press conference after the Italy's 61-93 defeat
to the United States Dream Team at the Olympic basketball
tournament here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Slow paces and low scores have dragged the popularity of FIBA
style basketball in the world. Scores in games between close
rivals can hardly get over 70 points as European Champion Italy
beat Olympic Bronze medalist Lithuania 50-48 and world champion
Yugoslavia downed it runners-up Russia 66-60 in man's basketball
competitions at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The world basketball ruling body FIBA has considered to change
the situation by dividing the current two halfs of 20 minutes game
into four quarters of 10 minutes and shorten the shooting clock
from 30 seconds to 24 to the international competitons in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the 24 clock since our players don't have the
passing skills as the NBA players have." Tanjevic said through a
interpreter."So people can hardly find the right positions and
have to shoot in a hurry."  But the European champions tutor also
see the active side of the new rules, which can attract more fans
by high scores faster paces.
</P>
<P>
"However, this is something we have to learn very quickly."
Tanjevic said. "If adopt it well, it will improved our passing
skill and add more interests and thrills in our games."

<HEADLINE> Origin of Chinese Palaces Found (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists
recently declared that they have found the origin of Chinese
palaces in a Neolithic site.
</P>
<P>
Removing two-meter thick of earth accumulation, archaeologists
unearthed the ruin of a 5,000-year-old building in Qin'an country
in west China's Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
It could be the ancestors of Chinese palaces, archaeologists
said.
</P>
<P>
The original look of the building is nowhere to find, but
people can still tell its splendor from the main pillars,
measuring 80 centimeters in diameter, and the thick and solid
walls remained.
</P>
<P>
Situated at the center of a Neolithic site called Dadiwan, the
building is half-way up the hill and overlooking an ancient
riverbed.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of a main room, two side rooms, a front room and a
back room, the building is as large as a basketball field.
</P>
<P>
According to the ashes of about 10 centimeters thick in a large
pit in the main room, archaeologists further mapped out a picture
that ancient tribe leaders met regularly in the building, and
around the fire to keep themselves warm.
</P>
<P>
The main room was divided into nine sections by eight pillars.
The number nine is always an auspicious and sacred figure
representing supreme power.

<TEXT>
<P>
Even though the wood pillars were already destroyed by fire,
the earth layer covering the pillars surface remain intact. This
proves that prehistoric residents have rendered their greatest
efforts to protect this building, which cost them dearly, said
archaeologists, pointing to it as the earliest proof of China's
fire proof history.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the rooms is a 40-centimeter-thick wall made of
grass and earth. Noticing the 142 pillar holes lined in the wall,
archaeologists deduced that prehistoric people in the first step
added earth to the surface of the pillars and then wrapped them
tightly with fences.
</P>
<P>
When the earth dried up, the fences were taken away and mixture
of grass and earth were filled into the pillars.
</P>
<P>
It is amazing that this building method shares similarity with
modern building technique.
</P>
<P>
What is more surprising is that the floor is as flat and bright
as that made of cement nowadays. With a pressure testing machine,
archaeologists found out that its intensity reaches that of cement
of grade 120.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that many of its features are found in
traditional Chinese wood structures for the following 5,000 years,
and therefore the building provides important clues to studying
the origin of Chinese architectures.
</P>
<P>
It has fully demonstrated that the art of architecture existed
as far back in primitive society, which is far back than common
people expect, they said.
</P>
<P>
Dadiwan is the earliest Neolithic site yet found in China,
where the earliest color pottery and earliest rice were unearthed.

<HEADLINE> Importance of Internet Management Stressed at China Science Conference </HEADLINE>

<P>
XI'AN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The importance of Internet
management reform was emphasized by a senior China Internet
regulatory official at the annual conference of China Association
of Science and Technology, currently underway in this capital of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
In a report delivered to the national conference today, Hu
Qiheng, director of China Internet Information Center, said China'
s dramatic growth of Internet use in recent years has been propped
up by the strong development of telecommunications and IT
industries. The economic growth has continuously spurred the
demand for information and data.
</P>
<P>
However, the Internet applications in China are still at an
initial stage with more "bulletins" than useful content, said Hu,
who is also an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
She attributed many of the problems to the disintegrated
management of Internet content providers.
</P>
<P>
The reform of Internet management and people's awareness will
be more important to the continuous development of the Internet in
China than the advance of equipment and the design of software
programs, the expert said.

<P>
HANGZHOU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Wu Bangguo has
urged the local governments concerned to place more importance on
the relocation of people affected by the mammoth Three Gorges
Hydraulic Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement of some residents of Chongqing Municipality,
where the main part of the Three Gorges project is located, to
other parts of the country is related to how smooth the whole dam
project has proceeded and the social stability in the Three Gorges
area as well as the interest of the migrants, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu made these remarks today at a meeting in Jiaxing, in east
China's Zhejiang Province, to study the current experiment of
relocating some of the Three Gorges residents to other areas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by officials from concerned central
and local government departments. During the meeting, the vice
premier and other officials visited two local villages that have
accepted migrants from the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
The dam project, which started in 1993, has entered its second
phase of construction, the vice premier said. He also said that
all the programs involved in the project are proceeding smoothly
and according to schedule, with sufficient financial support and
good quality.

Over 60,000 people will be relocated in 2001 and 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wen urged the migrants to work hard and respect local
traditions where they now live, while these places should regard
the reception of the migrants as a way of supporting the Three
Gorges Project which belongs to all the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He also urged that procedures should be strictly followed to
check who qualifies to be relocated, so as to prevent the
resettlement of those who are not qualified for it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official pledged to severely punish those who
have embezzled and misused special funds for the resettlement of
the affected people.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Tries To End Trucker's Highway Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Avraham
Shochat and acting Transport Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak called
for another meeting Tuesday with truckers in a bid to end the
disruptive highway blockade.
</P>
<P>
The block launched by truckers to protest against high fuel
prices has thrown the country's only coastal highway from Haifa in
the north and Ashdod in the south, about 200 kilometers, into total
congestion since Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Two large convoys of Heavy trucks and buses are moving 40
kilometers per hour along the national highway.
</P>
<P>
As planned by Israel Road Transport Board (IRTB), one convoy set
off from Ashdod Port and other from Haifa's Central Bus Station,
moving vis-a-vis. When they reach the end of their routes, the two
convoys will turn around and retrace their steps at the same speed.
</P>
<P>
IRTB Chairman Gabi Ben-Haroush, who organized the highway
protest, told the Israel Radio that IRTB's truckers will block the
country's seaports on Wednesday if the government still refuses to
reduce the fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
No cargo has been transported Tuesday, which will lead to a
daily loss of several millions U.S. dollars in the country where
over 90 percent of its cargo were transported over land by trucks,
port authority said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli truckers and bus drivers began clogging highway early
Tuesday after they failed to reach an agreement with government
officials Monday night over fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Due to the soaring oil prices in the world market, the
ministries of finance and transport decided to raise fuel prices on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Up by 13 percent this time, the diesel fuel will be 2.41 Shekels
(0.60 U.S. dollars) a liter, doubling the price two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The police authority said it recognizes the trucker's rights to
organize a legitimate protest, but the police would not hesitate to
take legal actions against those truckers who break the law.
</P>
<P>
IRTB has members of some 15,000 heavy truck drivers and 4,000
bus drivers. Ben-Haroush said that the truckers have been unable to
absorb the price increases and the transport industry is facing a
collapse.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is only the beginning and that if no efforts
are made to improve conditions in the trucking industry, the
protests will spread to other parts of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Barak Defends Negotiation Stands on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Tuesday defended his stands on Jerusalem in the recent
negotiations with the Palestinians for a final peace deal, saying
that he does not believe in "the peace of ostriches."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Barak stressed that any peace
agreement with the Palestinians would have to include Jerusalem,
and a real peacemaker would not run away from the thorniest issue
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in which there is no discussion of Jerusalem is the peace
of ostriches in which you stand with your head in the sand," Barak
stated.
</P>
<P>
"I am a big believer in the peace of the brave...I don't believe
in the peace of ostriches," added Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak was responding to attacks leveled by the opposition
parties that he had made too many compromises on the issue of
Jerusalem at the Camp David summit in July with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
At the ill-fated summit, Barak had offered the Palestinians
limited control over parts of the Arab East Jerusalem Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast war. But the Palestinians, which want
the eastern section as the capital of their future state, insist
total Israeli withdrawal from the part.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have restored their direct peace talks this week,
but no progress has been reported.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is now facing an uphill task to restore his
majority in the Knesset (Parliament), which will end its summer
recess at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Barak's coalition, having ruled by a majority in the 120-member
knesset, owned only 40 seats for now after the quit of three right-
wing partners ahead of the Camp David summit in protest at the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak once hoped that the major opposition Likud party, led by
hawkish Ariel Sharon, could join his government.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon told Israel Radio Tuesday that the possibility
is near zero. "He (Barak) is ready to give up on nearly everything
without getting a thing in return, and more seriously, without
bringing about the end of the conflict," said Sharon.

<HEADLINE> African Trade Ministers Meet on Free Trade, Globalization EDS-updates with details, quotes from OAU official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- African trade ministers met here
Tuesday to deal with issues such as inter-African trade and
economic globalization with a call for more efforts in enhancing
regional integration.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the ministers will review the
performances of Africa's regional economic communities (RECs) and
seek ways of promoting inter-African trade by implementing the
recommendations made at a meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, in 1992 on
creating a common African economic group.
</P>
<P>
RECs have a critical role in expanding inter-regional trade and
strengthening regional economic cooperation and integration,
Lawrence Agubuzu, assistant secretary-general of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), said at the opening session Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts for regional economic integration need to be
doubled to boost inter-African trade which continues to be a dismal
10 to 12 percent of the continent's global trade," Agubuzu said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are also expected to discuss the results of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Seattle, the
United States, last December, and the new partnership with the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
They will further dwell on the results of the 10th session of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held in
Thailand in February and U.S. proposals for trade and development
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros
Ghali has said that the meeting was aimed at forging a unified
African stance to meet the challenges in view of the economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU continues to hold the belief that Africa can only
respond to the challenges of economic globalization and trade
liberalization by effectively developing inter-African trade
through regional cooperation and integration," Agubuzu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called for "high priority" attached by African leaders to the
implementation of the Abuja treaty on establishing the African
Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
The previous two sessions of African trade ministers were held
in Zimbabwe in 1998 and Algeria in 1999 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The meeting on Tuesday was organized by Egypt in cooperation
with the OAU.

MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The First International
Conference of Asian Political Parties ended here Tuesday with
participants committing to work cooperatively for economic
prosperity, good governance and peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our aims are to build mutual understanding, confidence and
fellowship among Asia's political organizations, to seek political
consensus though consultation and the sharing of national
experience, and to develop political strategies in common to
achieve peace and economic prosperity for all our peoples," the
conferees declared in a declaration adopted at the end of the two-
day conference.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 50 political parties in 20
countries in the region attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian Declaration 2000, they said to attain stability in
Asia, which is absolutely essential to regional development, they
reaffirmed their adherence to the proven principles of state
relationships, such as respect for each other's independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and respect for the right
of every state to determine its own political, economic and social
systems in an interdependent world.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their support for global initiatives on arms
control, disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear and other
weapons of mass destruction.

revitalization of regional economic growth in the aftermath of the
East Asian financial crisis. We support further reform to improve
corporate governance, prudential regulation, and banking
supervision."
</P>
<P>
"We regard eradicating mass-poverty from our national societies
as the greatest challenge to Asia," they said. "We urge our
governments to follow responsible fiscal and monetary programs for
the benefit of all, the poor in particular."

<P>
They also urged rich countries to increase their involvement in
meeting the development needs of poorest countries, particularly
in the areas of trade, physical infrastructure, human resources,
institutional development, and technology transfer.

<HEADLINE> Manila Dismisses French Criticism of Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Tuesday dismissed French criticism of his country's
assault on the Abu Sayyaf rebels holding 19 hostages, including
two Frenchmen, a TV report said here.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to talk to him and he has no business interfering
in our affairs," Estrada was quoted by ABS-CBN TV station as
saying when asked to comment on French President Jacques Chirac's
criticism of the assault, which began on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac could not contact Estrada and had sent a message of
disapproval through the French Embassy in Manila and through a
Philippine diplomat in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The assault launched by Philippine government troops has
entered its fourth consecutive day but none of the 19 hostages
held by the Abu Sayyaf group has been rescued or released.
</P>
<P>
The 19 hostages include one American kidnapped in the southern
Philippine city of Zamboanga in late August, two French TV
journalists held captive in July when trying to interview the
original Sipadan hostages and 13 Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sees Brighter Prospects in Trade With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Tuesday
that there would be better opportunities for the country and Iraq
to build closer trade and investment ties when economic sanctions
against Iraq are lifted.
</P>
<P>
To further enhance trade ties between the two countries, a
total of 17 Malaysian companies have agreed to take part in the
Baghdad International Trade Exhibition scheduled for November 2000,
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said in a
statement here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on Malaysia-Iraq trade was held on September 17 in
Baghdad during a four-day visit of a Malaysian trade and
investment mission to Iraq from September 14, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, bilateral trade between Malaysia and Iraq has been
conducted under an oil for food (OFF) program.
</P>
<P>
Up to the seventh OFF program, the value of bilateral trade
between Malaysia and Iraq amounted to 324.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
And under the eighth phase of the OFF program from December
1996, Iraq has extended purchase contracts worth 103.4 million
dollars to Malaysian companies.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government pledged to increase the level of Malaysia-
Iraq trade under the OFF program by committing itself to diversify
the range and to increase the volume and value of imported
products from Malaysia, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate joint investments by private-sector organizations
from the two countries, Malaysia and Iraq agreed to sign an
investment guarantee agreement as soon as possible, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso ended at a
new record low against the U.S. dollar Tuesday amid prospects of
another oil price hike and the prolonged hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The peso closed 45.875 to the dollar, weaker than Monday's
close of 45.82,the lowest recorded closing level.
</P>
<P>
"The peso continued to be affected by (prospects of higher) oil
prices. And then, there are still the country's political problems,
"said a dealer from a European bank.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said domestic oil refiners are set to raise
again oil prices as crude prices in the world market have
increased to 36.88 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Domestic petroleum prices have been raised six times this year
with the last increase of 45-47 centavos (one peso has 100
centavos)per liter implemented last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military is on the fourth day of its assault on
the Muslim bandit group Abu Sayyaf which still holds 19 foreign
and Filipino hostages in the southern Philippine island of Jolo.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian and Indonesian
police have extended their joint exercises, which for the past 18
years covered only the sea especially in the Straits of Malacca,
to cover land as well from this year, a police officer said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was in compliance with a Malaysia-Indonesia General Border
Committee directive, Internal Security and Public Order Director
Abdul Hamid Mustapha told reporters in Sarawak, East Malaysia,
after opening a Malaysia-Indonesia police exercise there,Bernama
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The new approach was aimed at reducing unnecessary tension,
forging closer rapport and understanding and expediting response
at the common border area in particular, the police officer said.
</P>
<P>
Districts police chiefs from Sarawak and Indonesia are present
to act as observers at the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Abdul said joint patrols by Indonesian and Malaysian marine
police have brought the piracy menace under control although 34
cases have been reported so far this year compared with only 20
for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian and Indonesian police had been mired in a controversy
over the detention of four Sarawak businessmen by Indonesia for
alleged timber theft early this year, who were released last month
following diplomatic and other initiatives by both sides to
resolve the case.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Promotes Linguistic Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Municipal Assembly of
Maputo, capital of Mozambique, has adopted unanimously the
principle of promoting the use of local languages in municipal
business, the independent newsheet "Metical" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Any Maputo citizen who wishes to address a proposal or a
complaint to the municipal bodies may do so in his or her mother
tongue ( provided an interpreter is available).
</P>
<P>
The municipality will bear the costs of providing translators
for the main vernacular language spoken in the city, Ronga. Anyone
who either cannot speak the country's official language,
Portuguese, or who simply feels more at ease speaking to city
officials in Ronga will be encouraged to do so, and it will not
cost such citizens anything at all.
</P>
<P>
Ronga now becomes a working language for the municipal bodies
while previously the only working language was Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly saw this move as a contribution towards promoting
Mozambique's linguistic heritage, hoping that other municipalities
would adopt similar policies and pay for translations for the main
languages spoken in their areas of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
There is no single dominant national language in Mozambique.
The most widely used language was Macua in the 1997 census, in
which 26.3 percent of Mozambicans, mainly living in the north,
took it as their mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
This linguistic mosaic has made it impossible to establish any
single African language as an official or working language for the
entire country. But at the municipal level it is much easier to
identify one or two dominant languages and give them similar
status to Portuguese.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Win Fight for Better Life for Citizens: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos has declared that his government will finally win the
fight for a better life for the Angolan people because it
represents the interests of the people, the official news agency
Angop reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Making the statement at an inaugurating ceremony for a monument
in memory of the country's first president Agostinho Neto on
Sunday, Santos urged the Angolans to respect the national
liberation and the country's independence.
</P>
<P>
The civil war and the fight for a better life for the people
will be won by those who are positive, those who want a well
constructed and reconciled Angola which could be able to ensure
the well-being of the Angolan population, he said.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the endless war as the main obstacle to the
improvement of the citizen's life, Santos said the most important
task for the Angolan government is to "solve the people's problems
".
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that, in this struggle, there are obstacles to
overcome and one of them is the war. While our government builds,
the armed opposition destroys and we have been in this struggle:
build and destroy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Day-4 Roundup: Dutchman Hoogenband Breaks Second World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Before the hosts took the
men's 4x200m freestyle relay in world record, it was the Dutch
wonder boy Van den Hoogenband who started the night off with an
unbelievable swim, breaking his second world record in the 100m
freestyle semifinals Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Six world records were outdated from the swimming pool, the
cycling track and weighlifting platform on Tuesday, the fourth-day
competitions of the Millennium Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband, who set the 200m freestyle world record of
1:45.35 on Sunday, clocked 47.84 seconds, erasing Australian
Michael Klim's mark of 48.18 set up in the lead-off leg of
Australia's winning 400m freestyle relay on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Breaking the 48 seconds, making history, I'm so happy," Van
den Hoogenband said. "I was feeling very tired. I only got six
hours of sleep last night. Hopefully, I will get more sleep
tonight and beat 48 seconds again."
</P>
<P>
In the day's last swimming final, Ian Thorpe paced the hosts to
a large lead as they broke the world record to win the 4x200m
freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
The Australian quartet of Thorpe, Michael Klim, Todd Pearson
and William Kirby won in one minute 7.05 seconds, beating their
own world mark of 7:08.79 set in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. foursome of Scott Goldblatt, Josh Davis, Jamie Rauch
and Klete Keller finished second in 7:12.64, with the Netherlands
in third in 7:12.70.
</P>
<P>
Tom Malchow won the United States' sixth swimming gold from the
men's 200m butterfly, beating his own Olympic record for the third
time.

<HEADLINE> Minibus to Retreat from Beijing Traffic System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua)-- Over 1,700 buses are scheduled
to replace the minibuses that scurry about the city's streets as
one of Beijing's action to improve the air quality and regulate
the traffic system.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 of theses buses run on natural gas, said Wang
Xinsheng, assistant manager of the Beijing Public Traffic
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Appearing in Beijing in 1985, the minibuses were soon very
popular among people because of their convenience.
</P>
<P>
Though the minibuses were used to solve the problem of vehicle
insufficiency, regulating the operation of the minibus system now
has become a pressing task of the Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
Minibuses are also a source of pollution, producing large
amounts of gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,800 minibuses in Beijing at present, or 0.26
percent of the total vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, traffic violation cases by
minibuses amounted to over 52,000, accounting for 2.5 percent of
all such cases, local statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
"We call them the 'street killer,'" said Wang Junying who takes
a bus to work everyday.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government has decided to cut down the amount of
minibuses to about 1,000 and restrict them to operate on 48 routes
in Beijing's suburbs. From now on, no new minibuses are allowed
where there a lot bus traffic already.

<HEADLINE> HK Works to Enhance Awareness in Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Stephen Selby, director of
intellectual property, said here Tuesday that education would
remain a major priority in the work of the Intellectual Property
Department (IPD) of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the findings of the second "Survey on Public
Awareness of Protecting Intellectual Property Rights", Selby said
the IPD would maintain its efforts in publicity and education.
</P>
<P>
"The survey shows that our education efforts have started to
have an effect. Although the changes are not dramatic, the survey
shows that our message is getting through to our target audience,"
said Selby.
</P>
<P>
Based on the survey's findings, Selby said that nearly 60
percent of the respondents agreed that buying counterfeit or
pirated goods was an immoral action. Most people still cite cheap
prices as the incentive for buying pirated and counterfeit goods.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see that a majority of
respondents were aware of what sort of situations infringe
intellectual property rights. There was also an increase in the
number of people aware of the laws to protect intellectual
property rights in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Selby said that electronic media, particularly television
advertisements, were most effective in disseminating information
on intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that IPD would implement some new strategies in the
coming year, such as a TV feature series and radio programs.
</P>
<P>
This survey was the second annual survey commissioned by the
IPD. The first one was conducted in June last year. It aimed at
exploring the degree of public awareness in intellectual property
rights and at evaluating the effectiveness of existing promotion
programs.

<HEADLINE> 29th Landsat Ground Station Operations Meeting Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) --The 29th Landsat Ground
Station Operations Working Group Meeting (LGSOWG) was held here
Monday and will last for five days.
</P>
<P>
Present were more than 30 representatives from 12 countries
including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and
China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the participants will propose a summary
report on the running and management of landsats in their own
countries. They will exchange advanced technology and managing
experience on landsats, which is believed to be helpful for the
participants to learn more about each other in the situation of
the ground station.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that China has hosted such a meeting since
it joined the US International Landsat Ground Station Network in
1982.
</P>
<P>
US landsats are the most widely-used remote sense satellites in
the world and the major information source for the application of
remote sense in China.
</P>
<P>
More than a decade ago, Chinese ground stations could only
receive the No. 5 Landsat. However, it now owns advanced producing
and operating systems on ground resource satellites, capable of
receiving nine satellites including LANDSAT5/7 of US, ERS1/2 of
Europe, SPOT1/2/4 of France and RADARSAT of Canada.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Most Drug-addicts in Beijing Unmarried: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Most of the drug-addicts in
the Chinese capital of Beijing are youngsters and unmarried people,
according to a latest survey by the Public Security Bureau of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted on 200 heroin users of a drug
rehabilitation center affiliated to the public security bureau,
shows that some 69 percent of the respondents are youngsters aged
between 18 and 35, and some 56 percent of the respondents are
unmarried.
</P>
<P>
The 200 respondents had been randomly selected among the
rehabilitation center's 800 heroin users.
</P>
<P>
Experts here indicate that young people are vulnerable to
narcotics because they like searching for excitement.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the jobless and self-employed people
are easy targets of drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
China now faces a grim drug situation, with more than 680,000
drug addicts by the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Issues New Rules on Practicing Qigong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The State General
Administration of Sport (SGAS) recently issued "The Provisional
Administrative Methods on Qigong", in a bid to ensure the healthy
development of the traditional Chinese sport.
</P>
<P>
Qigong, or the Deep-Breath Medication, is a traditional Chinese
sport and a component of the Chinese culture, but in recent years,
some people have been making illegal profits, spreading
superstitious ideas under the name of practicing Qigong, according
to the SGAS.
</P>
<P>
These problems have severely affected the normal practice of
Qigong and been detrimental to the interests of the people, it
said, stressing that the authorities are determined to crack down
these harmful activities and encourage healthy Qigong.
</P>
<P>
The new rules have been stipulated by revising and improving an
existing document entitled "Administrative Methods on Qigong"
issued by the former State Physical Culture and Sports Commission
(SPCSC) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The new document comprises a general principle and eight
chapters to govern various aspects concerning the practice of
Qigong.
</P>
<P>
Local government departments in charge of physical culture and
sports are responsible for administering and organizing Qigong
activities, according to the document, which also have specific
regulations on the setting-up of Qigong-practicing stations and
demands that all Qigong coaches must meet the qualification after
strict training and examination.
</P>
<P>
It makes it clear that the official sports departments are the
authoritative administration of non-government groups engaged in
Qigong, while these groups should act as a bridge between the
official sports departments and Qigong practitioners.
</P>
<P>
"The Administrative Methods on Qigong" and "The Methods on the
Appraisal of Technical Grades of Physical-Training Qigong (Trial)",
which were issued by the former SPCSC in February 1998, were
abolished upon the issuance of the new methods.

<HEADLINE> IT Enabled Services to Be Out of Tax in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
Tuesday said all Information Technology (IT) enabled services
would be exempted from the Income Tax within two weeks and a
working group to tap potential of women in IT would be set up
within the same time frame.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the "India IT enabled services 2000 Conference"
here, organized by the National Association of Software and
Services Companies (NASSCOM), Information Technology Minister
Pramod Mahajan said since the finance minister had promised
exempting all IT enabled services from Income Tax net, there would
not be any problem in implementing it.
</P>
<P>
Currently only a few IT enabled services units can claim tax
exemption under 80 HHE of the Income Tax Act.
</P>
<P>
IT enabled services have been identified as the IT opportunity
for the new millennium. These services are a strategic and
imperative fit for India as they offer not only huge revenue and
employment opportunities but also an opportunity to earn foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
According to a NASSCOM-McKinsey report, revenue from IT enabled
services could increase from 560 million U.S. dollars in 199-2000
to an annual revenue of 18 billion dollars by 2008.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Police Beef up Security at Filling Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Police in Nigeria's commercial
capital Lagos has been directed to beef up security at the filling
stations still selling fuel in a bid to ensure that escalating
fuel crisis does not threaten law and order.
</P>
<P>
The direction came after bloody clashes between police and
touts at a few filling stations around the outskirts of Lagos at
the weekend when touts took over a station and compelled the
attendants to sell to them in jerrycans.
</P>
<P>
The current fuel scarcity across the country caused by the on-
going strike by oil workers has crippled business activities in
the nation's major cities and spurred touts into actions to make
profit by allegedly forcing petrol attendants to sell to them the
badly needed commodity.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner of Lagos State Mike Okiro said the current
security measure aims to safeguard lives and property by ensuring
that miscreants do not take advantage of the fuel situation to
unleash mayhem on motorists.
</P>
<P>
Police have already been sent onto the streets and major roads
to have on the spot assessment of the situation and they are
expected to immediately report any ugly incident to the
headquarters, Okiro said.
</P>
<P>
"Motorists are expected to show understanding and maturity at
petrol stations and persons who do not have any business in such
place should not be there," he said, adding that police alertness
would continue until the queues disappeared at the stations.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has said that the country is planning to build a
total of 1,600 kilometers of roads at the cost of around 404
million U.S. dollars, local newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing residents in Itigi in the central Singida region at
a campaign rally on Monday, Mkapa said talks are underway with
donors including the African Development Bank (ADB), the European
Union and the World Bank which has already issued 62 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is seeking re-election to a second five-year term,
stressed that construction of good roads is among his government's
priorities.
</P>
<P>
In the 2000/2001 financial year, he said, the government will
build the Manyoni-Itigi-Rwanga road in the Singida region with the

financial support of the ADB.
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that during the last five years, a
total of 1,468 kilometers of tarmac road have been constructed and
about 5,100 kilometers destroyed by the El Nino weather phenomenon
repaired.
</P>
<P>
Roads are the lifeline of economic development, that is why the
government is giving the sector its due importance in allocation
of resources although one kilometer of tarmac road costs at least
375,000 U.S. dollars, he said.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Ian Thorpe paced Australia to
a large lead as they broke the world record in winning the Olympic
4x200m freestyle relay on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian quartet of Thorpe, Michael Klim, Todd Pearson
and William Kirby won in one minutes, 7.05 seconds, beating
Australia's world mark of 7:08.79 set in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. foursome of Scott Goldblatt, Josh Davis, Jamie Rauch
and Klete Keller finished second in 7:12.64.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands came third in 7:12.70.
</P>
<P>
Dutch wonder boy Van den Hoogenband had started the night off
with an unbelievable swim, breaking the world record in the 100m
freestyle semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband clocked 47.84 seconds, erasing Australian
Michael Klim's mark of 48.18, which was set during the lead-off
leg of Australia's winning 400m freestyle relay Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Breaking the 48 seconds, making history, I'm so happy," Van
den Hoogenband said. "I was feeling very tired. I only got six
hours of sleep last night. Hopefully, I will get more sleep
tonight and beat 48 seconds again."
</P>
<P>
Tom Malchow won the United States' sixth gold from the men's
200m butterfly, beating his own Olympic record for the third time.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 200m individual medley, Yana Klochkova of
Ukraine won her second gold of the Games.
</P>
<P>
She timed an Olympic record of 2:10.68, breaking the 8-year-old
mark of 2:11.65 held by Chinese Lin Li.
</P>
<P>
Klochkova's first gold came in the 400 IM.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese weightlifter Lin
Weining narrowly defeated her rivals in the women's 69kg category
to win China the third gold medal from weightlifting at the Sydney
Olympic Games here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin, world record holder of a combined 252.5 kilograms in the
69-kg category, lifted a total of 242.5 kgs from 110 kgs in the
snatch and 132.5 kgs in the jerk.
</P>
<P>
Lin, 21, was behind of Erzsebet Peresztegine Markus when the
Hungarian topped the snatch with a new world record lift of 112.5
kgs but jumped to the podium with clean lift of 132.5 in the first
attempt of the jerk.
</P>
<P>
The victory made a clean sweep of the two gold medals on offer
on the fourth day of the Sydney Olympic weightlifting competition.
Earlier Tuesay, Chen Xiaomin won the 63-kg category for China.
</P>
<P>
China also grabbed the gold on Monday through Yang Xia in the
53-kg category.
</P>
<P>
Markus, bronze medalist of the world championships last year,
lifted a combined 242.5 kgs, the same weight as Lin but had to
take the silver because she is more than one kilograms heavier
than Lin.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian, however, set the world record in the snatch with
a weight of 112.5 kgs, beating the previous mark of 111.5 kgs set
by Liu Dongping of China on July 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Karnam Malleswari of India, who lifted
a combined 240 kgs. She snatched 110 kgs and jerked 130 kgs for
the medal, India's first in the current Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that I won the first medal for India,"
Malleswari said. "I'm blessed to win the first medal, bad luck I
couldn't win the gold."
</P>
<P>
Lin tried to set a new world record of 145 kgs after the gold
medal had belonged to her following Markus' setback in 137.5 kgs,
but the weight was too heavy for her to lift.
</P>
<P>
"She was too anxious tonight," said Chinese coach Shen Feng. "
The pressure was so much that she didn't lift her best both in the
snatch and jerk."

<HEADLINE> Zhou Yuanguo Stripped Second Victory in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Mistral boardsailor
Zhou Yuanguo has been stripped of his second victory in the Sydney
Olympic regatta on Tuesday because he got help from his coach just
before the start.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who came from sixth place to lead the fleet of 36 sailors
over the closing three legs, won race four of the men's Mistral
class in light conditions on Sydney Harbour.
</P>
<P>
But New Zealand's Aaron McIntosh and Australia's Lars Kleppich
protested that Zhou had spoken to his coach after the five-minute
pre-race warning gun had sounded.
</P>
<P>
The race committee upheld the complaints, saying Zhou had
broken race rules prohibiting any contact between competitors and
coaches within five minutes of race starts.
</P>
<P>
"(Zhou) handed equipment to his coach after the preparatory
signal, thereby receiving outside help," the international race
jury said.
</P>
<P>
The start had been delayed for more than three hours by light,
shifting winds.
</P>
<P>
Several competitors claimed they had seen Zhou hand a jacket to
his coach just before the race, although only New Zealand and
Australia complained officially.
</P>
<P>
The unranked Zhou, 18th in the 36-man fleet before the
disqualification, will fall well back in the recalculated
standings.
</P>
<P>
Competitors are allowed to discard their worst two results--
including disqualifications -- at the end of the 11-race series.
</P>
<P>
Argentine boardsailor Carlos Espinola, silver medallist in the
Mistral class in Atlanta four years ago, was promoted from second
to first on Tuesday after Zhou's disqualification and leads
overall from Austria's Christoph Sieber.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Zhou finished first in the opening race of the
regatta on Sunday but was disqualified for crossing the start line
early.

<HEADLINE> Baiyun Int'l Airport Joint-Stock Company Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou Baiyun
International Airport Joint-Stock Company was established today in
this southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be responsible for business operations at
both the existing Baiyun International Airport and a new airport
with the same name later, changing the traditional practices of
airports which had to take charge of management, guarantee, and
business operations.
</P>
<P>
Another company -- Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport Co.,
Ltd.-- will be in charge of administration only when the new
airport is completed.
</P>
<P>
The new company has a registered capital of 600 million yuan
and is financed by five other companies, including Air China and
Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport Group Company. Guangzhou
Baiyun International Airport Group Company takes up 96 percent of
the new company's stake, while the other four companies own one
percent each of the new company's stakes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to taking charge of all profit-making businesses at
the old Baiyun International Airport, the new company will also be
responsible for raising funds for construction of the new airport
in Huadu City, which falls under jurisdiction of Guangzhou,
through share listing.
</P>
<P>
With a history of over 70 years, the existing Baiyun
International Airport, located in the suburbs of Guangzhou, is one
of the busiest airports in China. It kept an average annual growth
rate of eight percent in profits from 1993 to 1999. In the first
eight months, the airport handled 8.5 million passengers, up eight
percent from the same period last year. It expects to handle 13
million passengers this year.
</P>
<P>
The airport has long been overburdened by increasing passengers
and cargo. The new modernized airport is calculated to meet
demands from ever-growing businesses. The new airport will be
built in several stages with designs provided by Parsons Corp. and
URS Greiner Corp, two U.S. firms, and the Guangdong Provincial
Architectural Design Institute.
</P>
<P>
It will cover an area of 1,456 hectares, about four times the
area of the existing Baiyun Airport. According to a construction
plan, the first phase of the new airport is scheduled to be
finished by 2002 and will be put into trial service in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is expected to cost a total of 20 billion yuan
(about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars), 49 percent of which will be
covered by the Guangzhou Transport Investment Co., Ltd. The first-
phase construction will cost about 10 billion yuan (about 1.2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
By 2010, when the airport is fully completed, it will be able
to handle 80 million arrivals and departures and one million tons
of cargo annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share Index
sank for the sixth straight day Tuesday, down by 1.79 points or 2.
75 percent to 63.26, coming off its session low of 62.78, the
lowest level in one and a half months.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 18.55 million U.S. dollars, which was 3.77 million
U.S. dollars or 25.51 percent more than Monday's total, according
to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities
advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Continuing to weigh on the market were concerns of the
reduction of state-held shares in listed companies and the
establishment of a second board market. The market struggled today
as it had for the past four weeks amid the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The B-share market was also confronted with too hard a time to
show sign of life following the persistent doldrums in the A-share
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the market is in bad need of
some positive catalysts to help turn things around and bring
buyers back. However, such support is unlikely to emerge very soon
and the market has to go lower before it can recapture the ground.

BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Composite Index
closed at 588.78 points on Tuesday, down 14.34 points or 2.38

</P>
<P>
The sub-index closed at 4512.51 points, which was down 116.33

</P>
<P>
Turnover was 8.28 billion yuan, which was 18.62 percent more
than Monday's 6.98 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Composite Index Tuesday opened lower at 600.53
points from Monday close of 603.12. Due to the generally bearish
market sentiment, investors had no buying interests and the index
dropped to the low level of 586.8 points, which broke through the
low level of 600 points, the lowest since August.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts predicted that the A-share market is likely to
settle at the 590-point level tomorrow.

<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share Market
fell 5.40 points or 4.72 percent to close at 109.03 points today,
reaching the lowest level of two and half months, which was the
biggest tumble in September.
</P>
<P>
Market turnover totaled 81.34 million Hong Kong dollars, which
was 17.11 million Hong Kong dollars or 26.64 percent more than
Monday's total, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stocks suffered a big slump in recent days while A
share market posted its consecutive losing streak, which was
partly attributed to the news about the establishment of a second
board market. Influenced by both of them, the Shenzhen market got
tumbled as well.
</P>
<P>
The market lingered in the red for the poor momentum and most
investors preferred staying on the sidelines to wait for a clear
direction, while the selling pressure accelerated the slide of the
index.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen B-share market is likely to continue to go down
further, looking for support in correction manner, due to lack of
catalysts to drive prices now and investors' confidences for the
market seem difficult to be restored soon, Homeway analysts
predicted.

BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries slumped
today and five losers outpaced one gainer and the total
transaction value decreased by 273 million yuan to 1.04 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lack of new impetus, China's repo market slackened and combined
transaction value of three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day
repurchasing transactions shrank from 8.54 billion yuan to 2

</P>
<P>
The interest rate of the three-day repurchasing agreement went
down to 1.7 percent from 3.35 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Domestic stocks stayed weak, as a piece of news came out today,
saying that the long-awaited sale of state-held stocks in domestic
listed firms is likely to begin within this month, which will
increase the share supply and dilute certain companies' existing
share value.
</P>
<P>
The weakness of the equity market should be a boon to fixed
income treasuries but most investors still keep their intention on
the stocks, expecting that the current correction on the stock
market will bring about more opportunities. As a result, it may be
hard for treasuries to turn active in the near term, according to
Homeway analysts.

<HEADLINE> Mental Factor Leads to Diabetes: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical experts found
that abnormal mental conditions might be important factors for the
type II of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
After a nationwide survey on 413 diabetes patients, the experts
found out that endocrine disorder, high blood pressure and heart
rate, which are considered to result from abnormal mental
conditions, would bring about low insulin and glycemia, "Beijing
Evening News" reported.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chen Guanmin, professor at Wuhan University who
organized the survey, also pointed out that the abnormal mental
conditions could aggravate diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts formerly regarded that some unhealthy
lifestyles, such as lacking physical exercise or excessive eating
could lead to diabetes II, while diabetes I is due to genetic
factors.
</P>
<P>
Supported by national scientific funds, Chen has set up the
research on the relationship between diabetes II and various
nosogenesis.
</P>
<P>
Ni Zongzan, another expert on diabetes treatment, considers
that Chen's find provides credible basis for the prevention and
clinical treatment of diabetes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Second Beijing
International Exhibition of Greenhouse Engineering and
Horticultural Technology, sponsored by the Ministry of Science and
Technology and the Ministry of Agriculture, opened in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition shows the successful results of pilot "
greenhouse agriculture" projects the six Chinese cities of
Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Tianjin
during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"Greenhouse agriculture" was initiated by the former State
Science and Technology Commission (now Ministry of Science and
Technology) in 1996 to cope with China's shortage of per capita
natural resources and the imbalance between supply and demand of
farm and sideline products in China.
</P>
<P>
This kind of agriculture uses advanced technologies in
greenhouse operations, seed cultivation and crop planting, and the
processing of horticultural products to realize the intensive
cultivation of crops, vegetables and flowers.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 Chinese and foreign companies will display their
new products and technologies at the four-day exhibition. Some
lectures on greenhouse technology will also be given during the
exhibition.

PAEROA (NEW ZEALAND), September 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand
Prime Minister Helen Clark paid a visit to Kiwi Battlers 96 Ltd in

manufacturing unit, which is wholly owned by China's Guangdong
Jianlibao Group.
</P>
<P>
It was rare for a New Zealand prime minister to visit a wholly
foreign-funded factory in the country. When Helen Clark arrived in
the small city after a three hour journey from Wellington by plane
and car, she was warmly greeted by Li Jingwei, chairman of the
Guangdong Jianlibao Group, who came here from China specially for
receiving the prime minister, and Basil Morrison, mayor of Paeroa
city. Local Maoris held a traditional welcome ceremony upon the
prime minister's arrival.

Helen Clark cut the ribbon for the operation of a new
production line of the factory. The new line will double the
annual output of the factory from 10 million bottles of beverage
to 20 million to meet the increasing demands from New Zealand,
Australia and several small South Pacific island states.
</P>
<P>
At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Helen Clark said the
opportunities created by the opening of the new facility are "
exciting" and the jobs and economic activity which flow from this
initiatives will give the region a boost.
</P>
<P>
Helen Clark said China is a "very good" friend of New Zealand.
She said she is looking forward to growing economic and trade
cooperations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Jingwei pledged in his speech that his group will increase
investment in Paeroa and expand the production of the factory.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Prime Minister Clark tasted the soft drinks
produced by the factory and said "they taste very good."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Civilians to Be Put to Order: Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Acting Chief of the
Indonesian Police, Commissioner Gen. Bimantoro said Tuesday that
the police will soon put to order all armed civilians, adding that
the measure will include disarming the bodyguards of former
president Soeharto, in particular those who have no police permit
to carry firearms.
</P>
<P>
"The police will soon discipline civilians who own firearms
without the necessary permit," Bimantoro was quoted by Antara news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said in Jambi, capital of Jambi province, that the police
have taken necessary preparatory steps to disarms civilians who
posses firearms illegally.
</P>
<P>
But Bimantoro did not discount the possibility that the illegal
firearms have been used to sow terror or in criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
He said there are certain requirements to be fulfilled by
civilians who apply for police permit to own firearms, including
the type and calibre allowed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in connection with the bombing culprits, the police
chief said that the youngest son of Soeharto, Hutomo "Tommy"
Mandala Putra, and Habib Ali Ba'aqil, commander of the Islamic
Defense Front (FPI), were not behind the recent bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing Tommy and Habib to be free indicates that there was
no sufficient proof to incriminate them in the recent series of
bombings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier President Abdurrahman Wahid has instructed the police
to arrest Tommy and Habib as the two were allegedly behind the
bombings attacks.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also said that he has "sufficient evidences" confirming
their involvement.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw a series of bomb attacks over past months. The
last bombing took place at the parking area of the Jakarta Stock
Exchange building, killing 15 people and injuring dozens of others.
The blast also destroyed dozens of cars.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A coalition of health,
consumer and environmental groups on Monday demanded an immediate
nationwide recall of all Taco Bell brand taco shells sold in
supermarkets and grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
The coalition -- which calls itself Genetically Engineered Food
Alert -- independently tested a sample of the shells and detected
traces of a form of genetically modified corn, which got no
approval for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug
Administration are investigating the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the coalition, traces of the genetically
engineered protein Cry9C -- approved by the government for use as
an ingredient in animal feed -- were discovered in the taco shells.
The traces were found in a random sample of seven boxes of Taco
Bell brand taco shells picked up at a local grocery store in
Silver Spring, Md.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Wind Postpone Yachting Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Lack of a steady wind
postponed more races as the Olympic sailing regatta is underway in
Sydney Harbour on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tornado class was abandoned for the day without any races
taking place and will wait until Thursday, while the women's
Mistral was limited to one of the three scheduled races.
</P>
<P>
But the long day of waiting under the hot sun for the fickle
breeze proved no obstacle for Germany's Amelie Lux who
consolidated her position at the top of the leaderboard, despite
coming off her board on the second upwind leg.
</P>
<P>
As one of the lighter women in the fleet she is favoured by the
light winds.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta gold medallist Lee Lai Shan of Hong Kong, China had
another disappointing race, slipping from fourth at one stage to
eighth, and is only in fourth place overall.
</P>
<P>
Lux, Italy's Alessandra Sensini and Barbara Kendall of New
Zealand hold a significant 18 point lead over the rest of the
field.
</P>
<P>
The second scheduled race of the day was twice postponed before
getting underway, only to be abandoned because of the lack of a
consistent wind.
</P>
<P>
In the men's Mistral Australian Lars Kleppich lodged an appeal
against race winner Zhou Yuanguo of China following alleged
contact after the five-minute preparatory signal.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Espinola of Spain replaced Austria's Christoph Sieber as
leader in the overall points tally.
</P>
<P>
Both Mistral fleets will race again Wednesday despite it
originally being a rest day as only four of the scheduled six
races have been completed to date.
</P>
<P>
Norway maintained their lead in the Soling fleet, finishing
first and third in Tuesday's two races as the race committee
altered the course three times to take into account the changing
wind direction.

<HEADLINE> Some Poisonous Desert Plants Useful: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A number of poisonous shrubs
and grass in China's desert areas have been found useful in drug
production, animal feed and even control of desertification, a
large seminar was told today.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Boguang, a professor from Nanjing Forestry University,
said those plants get used to the environment in the deserts
characterized by droughts, windy and sandy weather, cold and plant
disease and insect pests, which help the plants develop a chemical
defense system against the harsh conditions in the desert.
</P>
<P>
Such poisonous plants have been found by him and other
scientists in many deserts in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and
Qinghai in northwest China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
The poisonous plants account for about 10 percent of an
estimated 1,000 wild plants in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who specializes in plant disease and insect pests control,
is believed to be the first expert in China, and possibly in the
world for using poisonous plants to combat desertification facing
China and other part of the world.
</P>
<P>
"The shrubs contain such poisonous substances as alkaloid,
naphtha and toxoprotein, which animals won't eat", said Zhao.But
the poisonous substances are an important component of the immune
system of plants in their struggle against grass-eating animals,
insects, epiphyte and eelworms, the professor added.
</P>
<P>
He described these substances as good raw materials for natural
farming chemicals, drugs and additive as they are highly active to
many living things.
</P>
<P>
These poisonous plants can also be used to turn plant stem into
high-protein animal feed and high-density fiberboard, said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility study has shown that, a factory with an annual
designed capacity of processing 40,000 tons of the plants can
produce 620 million yuan (74 million U.S. dollars) worth of
alkaloid, protein animal feed and fiberboard each year.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of input and output is one to 4.6, he said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers living along desert areas should be encouraged to grow
those plants for desertification control and commercial use, thus
turning desertification control into a very profitable industry,
he stated.

<HEADLINE> First Iranian Woman Announces to Run for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A 41-year-old single lady has
recently decided to run in the eighth presidential election next
year, unprecedented in the history of the Islamic republic, local
media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Farah Khosravi, holder of a master's degree in management and
planning, is the secretary-general of the Iran-e Farda Society,
which is said to be a right wing group. She had run twice for a
seat in the Majlis (parliament), but failed.
</P>
<P>
Khosravi currently directs the physical exercise curriculum for
schools under the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology and
also monitors appointments in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Her decision has once again brought into focus a disagreement
over the interpretation of Article 115 of the constitution, which
states that "the president should be elected from among spiritual
and political men."
</P>
<P>
To date, only the sitting president, Mohammad Khatami, has
announced his candidacy for the presidential election. Khatami
promised in late July that he would stick to his reform policies.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was elected president on May 23, 1997 in a landslide
victory, obtaining over 20 million, or 69 percent, of the total
ballots. His term is to expire in August next year.
</P>
<P>
Iran's restrictions on women have eased in recent years, and
women can now do a variety of jobs, including judges, lawyers and
parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Soon after he took office, Khatami appointed a woman vice
president to show his efforts to promote women's status in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Interior Ministry also appointed a woman
governor for Sarvestan district in the southern Fars province. Both
cases were also unprecedented in Iran's post-revolution history
since 1979.

<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- African trade ministers met here
Tuesday to deal with issues such as inter-African free trade and
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the ministers will seek ways of
promoting inter-African trade by implementing the recommendations
made at a meeting in Nigerian capital Abuja in 1992 on creating a
common African economic group.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to discuss the results of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Seattle, the United
States, last December, and the new partnership with the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also dwell on the results of the 10th session
of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held in
Thailand in February and U.S. proposals for trade and development
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the importance of the third session of African trade
ministers, Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef
Boutros Ghali has said that it was aimed at forging a unified
African stance to meet the challenges in view of the economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The previous two sessions were held in Zimbabwe in 1998 and
Algeria in 1999 respectively.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Urged to Surrender and Free Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Manny
Villar on Tuesday asked the Abu Sayyaf to lay down their arms,
surrender to government forces and free all remaining hostages
unharmed before their group is totally wiped out.
</P>
<P>
Villar said in a radio speech that given their situation, the
best option is for the Abu Sayyaf to surrender in order to end the
hostilities or they face the prospect of being wiped out
completely.
</P>
<P>
Immediately ending hostilities, said Villar, will reduce the
possibility of more innocent civilians being killed and in the
cross-fire. "The faster this ends the better for everyone," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Surrendering," he pointed out "would be the most prudent
option for the Abu Sayyaf at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Government troops have reportedly overrun three Abu Sayyaf
camps in Sulu since President Joseph Estrada ordered a military
siege of the Abu Sayyaf at dawn last Saturday to rescue the 19
hostages still in the bandit group's hand.
</P>
<P>
Villar, who has given full support to the government initiative,
rallied Filipinos to support the government in its drive to end
the hostage crisis so it can concentrate in bringing forth true
development to Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"Let us give our all-out support to government, especially our
troops in order that hostilities are put to an end with the
neutralization of the Abu Sayyaf and the rescue of the remaining
hostages unharmed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Vice Philippine President Sets 3 Agenda of Good Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA September 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President and
concurrent Social Welfare Secretary Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on
Tuesday earmarked the needs of transparency in civil service
founded on three agenda that are necessary for good governance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the more than three hundred state workers here
to commemorate the centennial celebration of the Philippine Civil
Service, Arroyo said the traditional bureaucratic model in
national governance tends to break away as it leads now to a
continuing partnership with civil society.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo said the three agenda of civil service for good
governance are: first, the sound moral foundation to guide
leadership at all levels; second, philosophical transparency to
all government actions and the third, an ethic of effective
bureaucracy, effective implementation throughout the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo noted that if we combine good civil servants and good
governance in our country it will surpassed other countries and
probably make ours an economic giant in the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
She believed that every civil servant has the capacity to
partake in exemplary performance in rendering good public service
with the help of the modern and new information technology.
</P>
<P>
The vice president led the oathtaking rites of government
employees in Luzon in a ceremonies held Tuesday morning in Quezon
city, Metro Manila, for their reaffirmation of oath of office and
recitement of centennial prayer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Expand Multilateral Military Exercises in Asia Pacific:  Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We intend to maintain our strong bilateral relations with
countries all over the region," Cohen said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"But we hope over a period of time we can expand them to a
multilateral basis in the fields of peacekeeping, humanitarian (
assistance), disaster relief so the countries in the region can
exercise together, can share information, training techniques and
technology to respond to the kind of crisis that would affect more
than one country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen emphasized he wanted to make it clear that expanding
multilateral exercises does not mean diminishing of bilateral
military ties with the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also said multilateral military exercise is not "something
designed in any way to isolate China".
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States and China have "reestablished
good military-to-military" relations with purpose of keeping this
relationship on track, Cohen said the U.S. government understands
that China will continue to grow as an economic power and will
increase military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"We believe positive engagement with China is very important
for the future development of China and for the evolution of a
successful integration into the international community of a
growing power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the two countries will certainly have disputes
and contentions in the future, Cohen said problems must be
resolved peacefully and diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
He pledged the United States will continue to maintain the
military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, which he said is "
indispensable" for the continued stability and prosperity in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States were not present it will create a vacuum
that will be filled with a number of competing and contending
interested countries that will be adverse to China's interests and
to interests of all in the region," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the situation in East Timor and Indonesia,
Cohen said he is not satisfied that the Indonesian government does
not have control of its military, urging the government to act
aggressively to dismantle, disband and disarm the militia groups
in West Timor and hold their leaders and supporters accountable
for their atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Though admitting being encouraged by the reduction of tension
and moves towards reconciliation and rapprochement in the Korean
Peninsula, Cohen warned to remain cautious and vigilant, citing
the size of army and the amount of artillery the Democratic People
's Republic of Korea maintains.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is on a nine-day trip to Asia beginning on September 13.
He arrived in Thailand Monday after visiting the Philippines,
Singapore and Indonesia. He will visit South Korea and Japan later.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches First Training Program on Hybrid Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Ministry of
Agriculture and Lands on Tuesday launched its first hybrid rice
seed production and cultivation training program which will be
conducted by Chinese experts.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka will benefit from the hybrid rice technology and
become an exporter of rice within this decade," Minister of
Agriculture and Lands D.M. Jayaratne told the inauguration
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said the hybrid rice technology developed by China's Yuan
Longping, who has been internationally recognized as the "father
of hybrid rice", has proved that it has the potential to increase
yields by 20 percent over those of conventionally bred varieties.
</P>
<P>
On the invitation of Jayaratne, a team of four experts from
central China's Hunan Academy of Agricultural Science arrived here
early this month to conduct the training program. Three Chinese
experts of the team will stay in central Sri Lanka for three
months from September to December to train more than 20 Sri
Lankans on hybrid paddy cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Jiang
Qinzheng said as a longstanding friend of Sri Lanka, China highly
appreciates and fully supports the Sri Lankan government's efforts
to alleviate poverty and secure the national food supply.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening technical cooperation with Sri Lanka is a fixed
policy of the Chinese government, said Jiang, adding that he hoped
the project will bear fruit in the near future and benefit the
people of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Rice is Sri Lanka's staple diet. However, the island country
has not been self-sufficient in rice except for a brief period in
the 1980s. Some 200,000 tons of rice are still imported annually
to meet local requirements.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Should Speak With One Voice: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Press Secretary
Ricardo Puno said Tuesday that the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN should speak with one voice to promote the 10-
member regional grouping around the world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening of a seminar-workshop for ASEAN
media executives, Puno urged participants to work for a unified
communication plan to create awareness and widen publicity support
for the association.
</P>
<P>
"What is clear at this point is the need to effectively
communicate to our respective publics that ASEAN is relevant to
our lives, that we need ASEAN to have one voice to the world so we
will be stronger," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
Puno, who is also the presidential spokesman, noted that the
implementation of a draft communication plan to promote the
regional body is one way of bringing back the confidence on ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore,
Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The proposed communication plan is not only timely but "crucial
to the long-term survival of the association particularly during
this time when our economics are still reeling from the impact of
the financial crisis that swept the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Puno also lamented the unwarranted publicity the Philippines
has been getting from the international media because of Muslin
bandits in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Puno was referring to the kidnapping activities of the Abu
Sayyaf terrorist gang that is now the subject of military
operations in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed unfortunate that a handful of bandits have eaten
away a large part of our work to show the world the gains we have
made in building a better Philippines," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that President Joseph Estrada had to take a
determined and difficult decision "in order to ensure the safety
and security of our people in the long run."
</P>
<P>
Puno said the Philippines is not alone in the region with such
serious problems to deal with. "Different problems maybe, but
problems just the same that ASEAN leaders have to solve," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Urges Strikers Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has called on striking oil workers and their employers to
urgently resolve their differences and restore normal suppliers to
fuel stations across the country as soon as possible, media here
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo made the appeal on Monday as the worsening fuel
scarcity was paralyzing the country's economy and bloody clashes
between police and touts reported at some filling stations.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo attributed Nigeria's frequent energy crises to the
long-term mismanagement and neglect of the country's refineries,
as well as the endemic corruption in the social fabric perpetrated
by the past administrations, saying "corruption has totally
destroyed the Nigerian social fabric and infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
He also hinted that the federal government might intervene in
the on-going stand-off between major oil marketing firms and their
workers to arrest the crippling effects which the fuel crisis has
brought on Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The intervention would become necessary if the strike were not
called off as quickly as possible, said the president, adding that
he is very much concerned about the hardship which the strike has
caused ordinary Nigerians apart from its disruptive impact on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government, though not a party to the on-
going dispute between the workers and their employers, would not
remain disinterested in the face of the worsening situation in
various parts of the country given the critical importance of fuel
to the well-being of the economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Semiconductor Maker Rolls Out New Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 18 (Xinhua) -- After two years in the
making, National Semiconductor Corp. (NSC) on Monday released a
new family of semiconductors that integrate the functions
previously handled by several chips into a single piece of silicon.
</P>
<P>
News release from the company said that NSC is targeting the
new "system-on-a-chip" devices at the burgeoning market for "
information appliances," a term used to describe computing
products specially designed to access the Internet or other
information networks.
</P>
<P>
The new chips are the latest in NSC's "Geode" product line,
which was first unveiled in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Since taking the helm as NSC's president and chief executive in
1996, Brian Halla has been heralding the coming of an information
appliance revolution and steering the company for that direction.
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, NSC in 1997 acquired Cyrix Corp., a supplier
of PC microprocessors. While the Cyrix buy turned out to be a
costly one for NSC, putting itself squarely in the cut-throat PC
processor market, it also provided the company with the foundation
for its "Geode" chips, according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
NSC, which has its roots as a supplier of pure analog
integrated circuits, sold off the Cyrix business in August 1999,
but kept the rights to its Media GX microprocessor design, around
which the "Geode" chips are made.
</P>
<P>
Since the company sold off the Cyrix business, it has posted a
strong recovery, which executives have attributed largely to
strong sales of analog semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the market for semiconductors used in
information appliances will be heating up over the next couple of
years. Technology research firm International Data Corp. recently
said it expects U.S. unit shipments of information appliances to
outnumber consumer PCs by 2002.
</P>
<P>
For NSC, the opportunity for growth in the information
appliance market is two-pronged, according to Xavier Pucell,
semiconductor analyst at International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
"National is also a major supplier of analog chips," Pucell
said. "This is going to drive its analog business because with
each of these processors, you have to use other analog chips."

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The International
Weightlifting Federation (IWF) is trying to find a better solution
on how to fight drugs and make a clean sport, IWF top leader Tamas
Ajam said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the IWF gereral secretary said: "If the world's best
weightlifters are tested three, four or five times and results are
negative, I have to believe them."
</P>
<P>
He admitted that: "We have a feeling some countries don't want
to follow IOC or International Federation guidelines."
</P>
<P>
"We will find a better solution on how to fight drugs," Ajam
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
When being asked how the IWF would improve weightlifting's
image, Ajam said: "We are confident this is the right way to make
a clean sport. Weightlifting has been part of Olympic sport since
1896 and we want to continue to be on the program. Our aim is not
to make enemies for ourselves but to make friends and make a clean
sport."
</P>
<P>
The general secretory also said the IWF tries to investigate
who are standing behind the competitors who are using the drugs,
and investigate who gave them the banned substance.
</P>
<P>
"We have never found the really guilty people -- morally you
can criticize but we as a federation are trying to make a clean
sport," he insisted.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President to Protest Turkish "Two State" Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides will issue a written protest to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan over Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem's "two states"
comments on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Mail reported Tuesday that Clerides, who is in New
York to attend the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus, termed
Cem's comments as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Cem urged the U.N.
to accept the existence of two separate "states" in Cyprus as a
means to end the division.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island after a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots in 1983 unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus recognized only by Ankara, against the
internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored indirect talks have been held in
an effort to find a way leading to a Cyprus solution. The fourth
round of the talks is now underway in New York.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in New York said that Cem's speech was one of
the toughest made by a Turkish foreign minister since 1974, and was
indicative of Turkish key's stance on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou, speaking at a
news briefing in New York, condemned Cem's comment as "outrageous."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the solution to the Cyprus issue has already
been defined by the U.N. decisions as a bizonal, bicommunal
federation.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called realities Cem is citing cannot overrule the U.N.
decision and the principles of international law," Papapetrou said.

</P>
<P>
Israel Road Transport Board (IRTB) Chairman Gabi Ben-Haroush and
other representatives held last meeting Monday evening with
officials of the finance and transport ministries, but the two
sides failed to work out measures to reduce fuel prices as asked
the truckers.
</P>
<P>
Two convoys of thousands of Heavy truck and bus drivers are
moving their vehicles Tuesday morning at pace of 40 kilometers per
hour along the coastal national highway between Haifa in the north
and Ashdod, a seaport just north of the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
As planned by IRTB, one convoy set out from Ashdod Port and the
other from Haifa's Central Bus Station. The teams are moving vis-a-
vis; when they reach the end of their routes, they will turn around
and retrace their steps at the same speed.
</P>
<P>
IRTB has members of some 15,000 heavy truck drivers and 4,000
bus drivers, and over 90 percent of cargo are transported over road
by trucks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Due to the oil price increase in the world market, the finance
and transport ministries decided to raise fuel prices in the
country since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The price of diesel fuel has been increased by 13 percent,
bringing the price to 2.41 Shekels (0.60 U.S. dollars) a liter.
Since the beginning of 1999, diesel price has be doubled.
</P>
<P>
The police authority said it recognizes the trucker's rights to
organize a legitimate protest, but the police would not hesitate to
take legal actions against those truckers who break the law.
</P>
<P>
During their Monday meeting, Finance Ministry officials said
that the price hike does not depend on the government but on the
price of fuel in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Haroush said that the truckers have been unable to absorb
the increases in the prices of fuel and the transport industry is
facing a collapse.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is only the beginning and that if no efforts
are made to improve conditions in the trucking industry, the
protests would spread to other parts of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Oil price crisis has become a worldwide problem. The oil prices
have still stayed high despite output hike by oil producing states,
which have led to widespread protests in European countries.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak rejected the idea of
Islamic sovereignty over the Temple Mount at Monday's cabinet
meeting, Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, in an interview with The
Jerusalem Post, raised anew an idea first hinted at in the 1995 "
Beilin-Abu Mazen" plan: extra-territorial status for the scared
site.
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, said Beilin, the mount would have a legal
status similar to an embassy's. "For the last 52 years, no one has
entered (an embassy) without permission," Beilin said. "It is
theoretically on Israeli soil, but only an emergency of the highest
level would warrant Israeli intervention there."
</P>
<P>
Giving the Temple Mount a similar status would mean that the
Palestinians would continue to exercise their current de facto
control over the site. Israel would have symbolic sovereignty,
actualized only under the most extreme circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli cabinet Monday approved the budget for 2001 by a vote
of nine to two, with three abstentions. Barak said that the budget
represented economic growth and social sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
During the cabinet meeting, Barak asserted: "we have extricated
the economy from a deep and severe recession to intensified growth
and the creation of new jobs." He said the emphasis in the 2001
budget would be on education, infrastructure and closing social
gaps.
</P>
<P>
"With a policy like this," the prime minister said, "within
seven or eight years, Israel will be at the forefront of the
world's advanced countries in terms of its level and quality of
life."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shohat will soon begin
negotiations with the Knesset (Parliament) factions in an attempt
to muster a majority for the budget.
</P>
<P>
Most of the parties in the Knesset have objections of one kind
or another to the planned 2001 budget, and changes will almost
certainly be introduced in order to get the bill passed.
</P>
<P>
If the 2001 budget is not approved by the Knesset by March 31,
2001, the Knesset is automatically dissolved and new elections are
called. In the meantime, government ministries will receive the
same monthly budget as in 2000 with the addition of the cost-of-
living index.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli commuters face gridlock Tuesday as thousands of
trucks and taxis are to disrupt traffic along the coastal road from
Haifa to Ashdod to protest a recent 13 percent rise in diesel fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
According to Gabi Ben-Haroush, head of the truckers' council,
fuel prices, which have doubled over the last two years, account
for 40 percent of the costs of the trucking business. In the past,
the truckers claim, fuel constituted only nine percent of their
costs.
</P>
<P>
The truckers are demanding that the prices of diesel be adjusted
once every six months, instead of once a month, which is currently
the norm. They also demand that a committee be set up to
investigate the profit margins of the fuel companies.

<P>

According to the stand-by regulations signed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the budget has to be tighter
next year in a bid to drop the runaway inflation in the country. If
so, the spending will be limited while finding ways to increase the
revenues.

MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Share prices at the Philippine
Stock Exchange ended lower Tuesday amid lack of positive news to
spur market activity.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, fell 16.04
points to close at 1,424.23.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Grants 3 Million U.S. Dollars to Help Refugees in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will get 3
million U.S. dollars from the United States to purchase food
supplies for refugees staying in its western regions, the
independent Guardian newspaper reported here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount is part of an additional 7.6 million dollars
released by the United States to the World Food Program (WFP) to
be used in purchasing food supplies for refugees in Africa,
according to a statement issued by the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
The grant will also benefit refugees in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC), which will receive 1 million dollars. Moreover,
Guinea will get 2 million dollars, Kenya 1 million dollars, Uganda
500,000 dollars and Djibouti 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, which currently hosts over 660,000 refugees, the
biggest number in the Great Lakes region, will get the lion share
of the U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
The funds provided will also cover WFP emergency and recovery
operations in the Great Lakes region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP, which feeds an estimated 1.5 million refugees in the
Great Lakes region, with about half of them based in Tanzania,
announced in July this year to cut by 40 percent food rations
because of lack of funds to purchase food.
</P>
<P>
Refugees in Tanzania are mainly from troubled countries such as
Burundi, the DRC, Rwanda and Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Get 24 Million U.S. Dollars Under WB Insurance Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will receive some 1.9
million shillings (about 24 million U.S. dollars) from a 100-
million-U.S. dollar insurance scheme funded by the World Bank (WB)
to cover political risks, media here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is part of an initiative called the Regional Trade
Facilitation Project whose aim is to improve financing for export
and import trade in African countries.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is among seven African countries to benefit from the
scheme whose implementor will be a multinational organization
called African Trade Insurance Agency.
</P>
<P>
The other six countries are Burundi, Rwanda, Malawi, Tanzania,
Uganda and Zambia, all member countries of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
The target of the African Trade Insurance Agency will be
foreign companies selling goods to COMESA member states, foreign
banks financing exports to participating African countries, and
companies from participating countries exporting goods or service
to their peers or foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
At the launching of the program here last Thursday, Kenyan
Minister Nicholas Biwott said foreign investors, who have feared
for several years to lose their investment in Africa due to
political risks, can now expand their business concerns to the
continent freely.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has agreed to work
towards the release of about 6,000 Ugandan children abducted by
the Lord Resistance Army (LRA) rebels led by Joseph Kony since
1988, the New Vision daily reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a communique signed in Canada between

The communique, issued at the end of the International
conference on War-Affected Children held in Winnipeg, was also

<P>
The communique urges its signatories to take measures to engage
in dialogue with the LRA to secure amnesty, reconciliation and
rehabilitation of abducted children.

Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy was quoted as saying
that his country will pay transport costs and provide 670,000 U.S.
dollars for rehabilitation of the children.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Osman said Canada's involvement in freeing the
children would help because it has good relations with both
countries.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minster Nicholas
Biwott for Tourism, Trade and Industry has called on manufacturers
in the country to produce high quality goods that could compete
effectively in regional and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Biwott made the remarks at the inauguration of a seminar on "
Exhibiting for Success Around the World" opened at Norfolk Hotel
in the capital Nairobi Monday, the government-run Kenya Times

</P>
<P>
The minister observed that ability to access relevant
information by manufacturers and entrepreneurs is crucial in
marketing products in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Proper packaging and attractive presentation of goods to
potential clients would enhance the marketability of local
products in world and regional markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that exhibitions play a vital role in marketing
in a fast moving technological environment and are the most
effective strategy for the sale of goods to the highest number of
potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is receiving positive business inquiries from developed
countries as a result of trade fairs recently held abroad and the
interest in doing business with Kenya by foreign businessmen is an
encouragement for more Kenyans to participate in more trade fairs
in future, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Sprint Queen Has New Hopes for Olympic Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's sprint queen
Susanthika Jayasinghe believed she has new hopes of winning a
medal at the Sydney Olympics after dismissing drug scandal and
injury worries, the state-owned newspaper Daily News reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe, who won the silver medal in the 200 meters at the
1997 world championships in Athens, told the newspaper that she
had put behind her problems she had to face since winning the
medal and she was now in a better frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
"There was a time that I had high medal hopes after I became
the second best 200 meters sprinter at the IAAF World
Championships in Athens in 1997. But all of a sudden I faced many
problems and those hopes faded away gradually," said Jayasinghe.
</P>
<P>
She said, "but I think today I am in a better frame of mind and
is having fresh hopes."
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe ran a new personal best of 22.32 at the Super Meet
2000 in Yokohama, Japan last Saturday, third best in the world
this year, showing that she has recovered the form.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old hopeful will compete in the 100 meters, 200m
and the 4x100m relay in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe will team with Pradeepa Herath, Nimmi de Soysa and
Asian Games double gold medalist Damayanthi Dharsha in the women's
4x100m relay.
</P>
<P>
During the past century Sri Lanka has won only one Olympic
medal, a silver in the 400 meters hurdles by Duncan White at the
1948 London Games.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Courtesy Car Hijacked by Escaped Convicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- An Olympic car leased to the
Korean National Olympic Committee was hijacked by two escaped
convicts near the main Olympics site Tuesday, with four people
inside, an Olympic spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The car was seized at Silverwater, a Sydney suburb adjacent to
Olympic Park and the site of a large prison, shortly before 4 p.m.
(0500 GMT), police announced.
</P>
<P>
"Two inmates on work release from Silverwater minimum security
prison commandeered a vehicle in the Silverwater area," police
said.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Games organizing committee spokesman Milton Cockburn
said none of the four occupants, one of whom was a games volunteer,
was taken hostage in the escape.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if the other occupants were
Olympic officials or if they were from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea or South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Local television showed two men wearing t-shirts with the word
"Korea" emblazoned across the back being interviewed by police at
the scene of the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
Police said all four were released shortly after the vehicle, a
Toyota Tarago, was snatched. They were taken to a nearby hospital
apparently to be treated for shock.
</P>
<P>
The car was later dumped in the inner-city suburb of
Marrickville, and the escaped convicts escaped on foot. Police
using sniffer dogs launched a major man hunt for the fugitives.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Rejects Pardon For Baumann </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- World athletics governing body
the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) Council
Tuesday rejected by a large majority an appeal for German runner
Dieter Baumann, who has been suspended for two years for drugs
offence.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF's arbitration panel had on Monday nullified a ruling
by the German body DLV and had thereby virtually shattered the
1992 5,000 meters gold medallist's dream of competing in his
fourth Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF's decisions mean that the 35-year-old Baumann, who
also won an Olympic silver medal in 1988 and the European title in
1994, is most likely at the end of his career since the ban is to
last until January 21, 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, Baumann's lawyer Michael Lehner said Tuesday that he
would appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), the
highest authority at Olympic Games, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CAS is not, however, recognised by the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
Baumann tested positive twice for the steroid nandrolone at
random tests last autumn.
</P>
<P>
He was cleared in Germany after convincing prosecutors and the
DLV that he was the victim of a conspiracy. He said his toothpaste
had been spiked, but the IAAF had the final say and its council in
July referred the case to the arbitration panel for a final ruling.

<HEADLINE> IWF Officials Defends Drugs Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Tamas Ajan, secretary general
of the International Weightlifting Federation defended his sport's
"three strikes and out" drugs policy on Tuesday, saying that their
aim is to clean up the sport not to punish clean athletes.
</P>
<P>
Ajan has been under fire since the IWF kicked out the whole
Romanian team from the Sydney Olympics after giving three
positives tests and then allowed them back in after payment of a
50,000 U.S. dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
Romanian weightlifters Traian Ciharean and Adrian Mateas were
unmasked as drug takers by a mass doping exercise carried out by
the IWF in the lead up to the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
As a third Romanian lifter had also tested positive in May, the
IWF activated a rule which banned the entire squad from the
Olympics and international competition for a year.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Olympic Committee stepped in and said it would pay
a 50,000 dollar fine to allow their four "clean" lifters to
compete. The IWF has instructed that the cash be deposited by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ajan said on Tuesday that the results of the 'B' test on
Ciharean and Mateas for anabolic steroid use were still not known.
Analysis of 57 of the 257 pre-Games tests carried out in a blitz
by the IWF had also been delayed because the IOC approved
laboratory in Sydney was under tremendous pressure, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ciharean and Mateas threatened on Monday to go on hunger strike
if their names were not cleared and Ciharean has since gone
missing from the Athletes Village.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Int'l Seminar on China Agricultural Census Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A four-day International
Seminar on China Agricultural Census Results opened here today,
focusing on the census process and China's rural economy based on
related census statistics.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will discuss twelve topics mainly on statistics
quality, census organization, improvement of the census system,
rural status quo, and agriculture in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu Zhixin, director of the National Bureau of
Statistics, the first agricultural census in China, which was
started in January 1997 and lasted for three years, provides
reliable information for the government to design and implement
agricultural layouts and rural development strategies.
</P>
<P>
The census got technical and financial support from the Italian
government and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly held by China, Italy and FAO. About 60
Chinese and 40 foreign representatives are attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Atomic Energy Organization to Hold First Meeting in Nine Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Atomic Energy
Organization is to hold its first scientific conference since the
1991 Gulf War on environment protection on November5-6, the
official Iraqi News Agency(INA) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to explore ways to tackle air, soil,
and industrial pollutions, enhance environmental protection and
water purification and develop anti-radiation technology.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on the damage caused to Iraq's environment by the
use of depleted uranium bombs by the U.S.-led Western forces during
the Gulf War, sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has condemned the U.S.-led multinational army for dropping
hundreds of tons of depleted uranium bombs in the south and other
parts of Iraq that have caused harm to the health of the Iraqi
people and contaminated the environment.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that the depleted uranium has been responsible for
the increase of cancer patients in the country. Iraq's cancer cases
in 1997 reached 6,158, compared with the 4,341 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and Britain of
blocking vital contracts to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies such as sewage treatment equipment, worsening
the humanitarian crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell oil
to finance its imports of humanitarian goods to offset the
crippling impacts of the U.N. sanctions, which were imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people were
killed and some 50 others injured Tuesday when a bomb blasted at a
fruit and vegetable bazaar in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The powerful blast occurred at around 8:00 a.m. 0300 GMT when
the bazaar was crowed with vegetable farmers from suburbs,
according to police sources.
</P>
<P>
Shopkeepers said a big pang panicked the bazaar, which some 15,
000 people visit every market day, and at least six people were
killed at the spot.
</P>
<P>
The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and an emergency
was then announced in all hospitals in Islamabad and its win city
Rawalpindi.
</P>
<P>
The death toll has risen to 12, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was planted in a truck which was from the Northwest
Frontier Province, the province bordering Afghanistan and home to
some radical Islamic activists.
</P>
<P>
Seven drivers are under investigation and dogs were used to
search possible more explosive devices, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Senior Police Officer of Islamabad Asad Durrani didn't rule out
the possibility of foreign hands behind the blast, but he refused
to blame any side.
</P>
<P>
"We will not blame any side for it until the investigation is
completed," he said.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the gory incident.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest of a series of bomb blasts in Pakistan
during the past months. Pakistan and India usually blamed each
other for terrorist attacks on their soil.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Supply Safe Water for All People in Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 19 (Xinhua)-- Vietnamese government plans to
supply safe water for all people in the country at a rate of 120
to 150 liters per head per day by 2020, according to Vietnam News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has, so far, invested 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in more
than 200 water plants scattered across all the country's cities
and provincial capitals, and 45 percent of small townships, thus
ensuring the safe water for 60 percent of urban population, more
in big cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, at a rate of 60 to
80 liters per head per day, according to a recent seminar held
here on this topic.
</P>
<P>
However, only 40 percent of the rural population of the country
has benefited from safe water supply.
</P>
<P>
To reach the target of supplying safe water to all people of
the country, Vietnam is to focus future investment on rural safe
water suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Vietnamese government made a policy to encourage
investment in water supply and irrigation facilities, from all
financial sources and all economic sectors, both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to invest more in upgrading existing
water supply facilities in an attempt to reduce the rate of water
loss from 40 to 50 percent currently to 30 to 40 percent by 2005
and 20 to 25 percent by 2020.

<HEADLINE> Zambia on Way to Enforce Anti-dumping Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
currently working out plans to enforce anti-dumping laws aimed at
protecting local manufacturing industries from unfair trading
practices, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Zambian Commerce, Trade and Industry
Minister William Harrington as saying in an interview that the
plans would ensure industries such as nitrogen chemicals be
protected from unfair trading practices posed by foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
The government sees it prudent to enforce the intended laws
because the influx of most cheap foreign goods is threatening the
development of the local industry, Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
He said "my ministry intends to enforce anti-dumping laws more
vigorously to ensure industries such as Nitrogen Chemicals of
Zambia are fully protected."
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government would continue to
provide necessary conducive environment for the sustainability of
the local industry.
</P>
<P>
The conducive environment should be very helpful when coupled
with the review of energy costs, reduction of excise duty on
imported raw materials and other fiscal incentives, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would also ensure the strengthening of the
Zambia Bureau of Standards to make sure that locally produced
goods are more competitive and meet international standards.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Adopts New Approach to Tackle HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
adopted a new multi-sectoral approach to tackle the HIV/AIDS
pandemic, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Having recognized that HIV/AIDS is a problem that affect all
sectors, it could be tackled effectively if all sectors contribute
to preventing its further spread and mitigating its impact, said
Zambian Community Development and Social Services Minister Dawson
Lupunga here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue to contribute to the fight
against HIV/AIDS through community development, social welfare and
cultural services, he said while launching the "Night Life
Campaign Against HIV/AIDS".
</P>
<P>
He said "the Public Welfare Assistance scheme, through which
basic requirements of food, clothing, medical and school fees are
provided to the destitute, has been redesigned with emphasis on
community management of the limited welfare resources with
assistance from the European Union."
</P>
<P>
The public welfare scheme will more effectively channel its
assistance to the poor and vulnerable groups including orphans,
widows and widowers and the terminally ill without means to
sustain themselves, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Lupunga, his ministry has integrated HIV/AIDS
information in its literacy materials which would contribute to
the sensitization of rural communities who can not easily access
such information in comparison to their counterparts in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Such community-designed programs have significantly reduced the
rate at which HIV/AIDS spreads, he said.

<HEADLINE> Strike Paralyzes Los Angeles Mass Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of poor
residents in Los Angeles walked or bicycled in the blazing sun or
shared cars and cabs Monday as a strike by public transit drivers
went on.
</P>
<P>
The walkout by 4,400 bus and train operators of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) created bigger-than-
normal commuter traffic jams when officials urged strikers to
return to the bargaining table and end the walkout.
</P>
<P>
But union leaders rejected the proposal, saying they would not
return to the bargaining table until asked to do so by a state
mediator, and they ignored a MTA invitation to show up for talks.
</P>
<P>
"We don't take orders from the MTA board of directors or from
MTA management," said Goldy Norton, spokesman for the United
Transportation Union (UTU).
</P>
<P>
Some 4,300 members of the UTU went on strike over wages and
overtime Saturday, halting 2,000 buses and rail and subway lines
serving a 1,400-square-mile area. An estimated 450,000 people in
the car-dependent region rely on the transit system.
</P>
<P>
The MTA said it will face a 438-million-dollar operating
deficit over the next 10 years if it doesn't cut costs or raise
fares. It wants 23 million U.S. dollars in savings from its rail
and bus operators over the next three years by cutting overtime
costs 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The MTA proposed that 400 of its 4,400 drivers accept four-day
working weeks in which they would be on duty at least 12 hours but
be paid for only 10 hours a day. Overtime would kick in only after
12 hours. The union rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The MTA has offered 2.7 percent raises per year for three years
while the unions want 4 percent per year.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Widens Cooperation with Friendship Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing and Canberra, the
capital of Australia, have become friendship cities on September
14, with a view to strengthening their cooperation in such areas
as trade, economy, environmental protection, tourism and education.
</P>
<P>
So far, Beijing has established friendship-city ties with 27
cities in 24 countries, while maintaining good relations with more
than 100 cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qi, mayor of Beijing, said that facing the new century, the
Chinese capital is willing to establish such ties with more cities
worldwide, so as to enhance governmental and people-to-people
exchanges between sister cities for common development.
</P>
<P>
Beijing established its first sister-city ties with Tokyo, the
capital of Japan, in March 1979, the second year after China
introduced the policy of reform and opening up. By the end of
1980s, Beijing had established friendship-city ties with New York,
Belgrade, Lima, Washington, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Cologne.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, Beijing forged friendship-city ties with another
17 foreign cities, including Ankara, Cairo, Islamabad, Jakarta,
Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Seoul, Kiev, Berlin, Brussels, Hanoi,
Amsterdam, Moscow, Paris, Rome and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 18 districts and counties of Beijing have also
developed friendly relations with 50 foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades and more, Beijing and its friendship
cities have had frequent inter-governmental exchanges, and their
friendly cooperation have expanded to various sectors including
economy, science and technology, education, culture, health and
sports.
</P>
<P>
In September 1997, Beijing held a "Music Week for Friendship
Cities," where over 50 musicians from Berlin, Paris, Moscow, Hanoi,
Brussels and other cities staged performance to Chinese audiences.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Tokyo have so far organized "the Beijing-Tokyo
Urban Symposium" 11 times. During the gatherings, officials,
experts and scholars from both sides have conducted in-depth
discussions on such issues as urban construction, administration
and population management.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of sister-city relations between Beijing
and foreign cities said he believes that the "2000 China
International Friendship Cities Conference", expected to be
convened in Beijing later this month, will provide new
opportunities for expanding cooperation between Beijing and its
friendship cities.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Traditional Chinese Medicine Gets Popular in SE Asia: Thai Expert By Yang Qingchuan, Huang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- In Southeast Asia, the over
5000 year-old traditional Chinese medicine is now getting more and
more popular, while governments in the region gradually recognize
its importance and begin to take promotive measures, an expert of
the traditional Chinese medicine said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid development of the traditional Chinese medicine in
the region shows that the age-old Chinese medical science is
gaining greater international reputation and will play a more
important role in the global medical market," Wong Zhongzhou,
secretary-general of the Association of The Traditional Chinese
Medicine of Thailand, told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The scientific value and business potential of the traditional
Chinese medicine have been acknowledged and emphasized unanimously
at a recent regional medical meeting held here earlier this month,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wong, who acted as the secretary-general of the 6th Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)'s Academic Conference on
Traditional Chinese Medicine, said the participants agreed that
the traditional Chinese medicine is now widely-accepted in
Southeast Asia, and urged the region to further boost it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the biggest-ever and the most influential of its
kind in the region, was attended by around 700 experts and
scholars in the traditional Chinese medicine from the 10 ASEAN
members: Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, The Philippines,
Brunei Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar, as well as China's
mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Australia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Wong pointed out that as the traditional Chinese medicine
becomes more and more famous in the region, its market prospect
has already been noticed by the investors.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, the foreign investments in the traditional
Chinese medicine in Southeast Asia have grown quickly, increasing
continuously in both capital and projects," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the general support from the governments in the
region to develop the traditional Chinese medicine has also
generated a new momentum, he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that earlier this year, Thai deputy prime minister
and health minister Korn Dabbaransi have praised the traditional
Chinese medicine as "an outstanding health-care science which has
5,000 years of experiences and practices," and declared that "it
has been accepted by the majority of Thai people."
</P>
<P>
In July, the Thai government also announced a formal
recognition of the legal status of the traditional Chinese
medicine, and launched a cooperative project with China to build a
regional training, research and treatment center of the
traditional Chinese medicine in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Wong said in Malaysia, the authorities decided to integrate the
traditional Chinese medicine into the "mainstream of national
medical system," and wished to offer all the Malaysians a combined
medical service with both western medicine and the traditional
Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the health ministry supports the idea of forming
a coordinating committee among the organizations of traditional
Chinese medicine and provides policy protection for these
organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under supportive policies, the Association of Doctors of
Singaporean Traditional Chinese Medicine has emerged as a leading
force to promote the traditional Chinese medicine in the country,
establishing several hospitals and research centers of the
traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
In other ASEAN countries, governments also start to take
various measures to develop the traditional Chinese medicine, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wong, who owns one of over 400 traditional Chinese medicine
stores in the capital city, said that his customers were mainly
Thai Chinese, but now more and more Thais and foreigners come to
his shop.
</P>
<P>
"Many people here used to believe the western medicine is the
only way to cure diseases," he said, "however, now most patients
who suffered from difficult and complicated illness or chronic
diseases are seeking the help of the traditional Chinese medicine.
"
</P>
<P>
The numbers of traditional Chinese medicine shops are growing
rapidly in Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia, he said in his
shop, which is crowded by customers.
</P>
<P>
"As the traditional Chinese medicine thrives in Thailand, every
kind of such medicine is now available here, including Chinese
herbal medicine, Chinese synthesized medicine, precious Chinese
medicine materials, Chinese tonic and other Chinese medicines," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the traditional Chinese medicine has been proved
by countless treatments of every kind of illness, and it is the
time to give it the relevant international status," the expert
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said although the traditional Chinese medicine has
achieved a considerable success in Southeast Asia and other places
around the world, lots of efforts still need to be taken to make
the traditional Chinese medicine to better meet the modern
scientific standards and the requirements of the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
"There remains a huge task ahead to develop the over 5000 years-
old traditional Chinese medicine into a fully-modernized science
and business across the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thais' Incomes Fall by 9.81 Percent in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai people's real incomes
have declined by 9.81 percent over the past three years, with
higher prices and salary freezes thinning wallets for millions,
the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Salary scales for the civil service have not been increased
since 1995 while the minimum wage of 162 baht (3.85 U.S. dollars)
a day was last lifted in 1998, the newspaper quoted statistics
released by the internal trade department.
</P>
<P>
Salaries and bonuses across dozens of industries have been
frozen or reduced by firms seeking to control costs.
</P>
<P>
With wages basically unchanged from three years ago, overall
real earnings after accounting for inflation have actually fallen
by 9.81 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Index price levels in 1997 stood at 118.2 while at the end of
August this year it stood at 129.8.
</P>
<P>
Falling incomes for much of the population have strong
implications for future spending and consumption habits, and thus
the pace of overall recovery, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While employment has increased slightly, spending remains
anemic while bank deposits continue to grow, pointing to low
levels of consumer confidence as people seek to boost savings to
hedge against job uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
Real incomes could post further declines this year and next,
particularly as oil and energy prices have soared beyond previous
projections.
</P>
<P>
The report said labor representatives are almost certain to
push for a review of the national minimum wage scale later this
year or next. The last wage increase, five baht (11 cents) a day,
has been far outpaced by price increases for many products and
services.
</P>
<P>
But wage increases are a sensitive issue for government policy
makers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While politically popular, a wage increase could dent business
recovery, export competitiveness and lead to inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
Without economic recovery, incomes are unlikely to show growth
or could even contract for another year, particularly as many
companies and the civil service plan to maintain staff levels at
current reduced levels, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Drops to Two-year Low Despite Better GDP Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai baht has sunk to a two-
year low against U.S. dollar despite the better-than-expected
second quarter economic data.
</P>
<P>
The currency's fall to 42.24 against one dollar yesterday, the
lowest point in recent two years, was coincided with a government
news release in the same day of a 6.6 percent growth in the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter,
exceeding the 6 percent forecast.
</P>
<P>
However, the news have not generated any encouraging sentiments
in the markets.
</P>
<P>
"The news did nothing for the baht, currency players continue
to sell baht and buy dollars," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The baht's weakness was due to the dollar's recent strength in
the Southeast Asian region and the increasing capital outflow.
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainties in Thailand ahead of the general
election, fresh worries in Indonesia after last week's stock
exchange bombing and the hostage situation in the Philippines are
adding the dollar's strength against the currencies in the region,
including baht.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, as the gap between Thai and foreign interest
rates is widening, a greater amount of capital outflows lay ahead,
which will force local companies to speed up their repayments to
foreign lenders and eventually drive the baht down significantly,
according to analysts.

The accords involve Spanish investment in projects in northern

There are reports saying Madrid would also agree to convert
some 40 million dollars of Moroccan debts into private investment.
</P>

During talks with Spanish officials, the king, who inherited

</P>
<P>
Morocco refused to extend a four-year fishing agreement with
the European Union late last year, citing the danger of draining
its fishing resources by the 600-strong European fishing fleet
which was essentially Spanish.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that Spain will take advantage of the king
's visit to make progress in renewing the fishing agreement.

<HEADLINE> WWII Sex Slaves File Class Action Suit Against Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen former "comfort
women" who survived Japanese sex slave camps during World War II
filed a historic class action lawsuit on Monday against the
Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Michael Hausfeld, one of the lawyers for the
plaintiffs, told a crowded press conference here that the Japanese,
like their German racist colleagues, also pursued racist policies
and treated women from countries occupied or colonized by Japan in
the most demeaning manner.
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking at these offenses because they are just
single instances of rape. We're looking at them because they
involve massive, systematic, premeditated forced rape," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, two former "comfort women," one
from South Korea and another from Taiwan of China, told their
chilling stories during World War II when they were cheated and
forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act, an 18th
century U.S. law which grants foreign citizens the right to sue
for abuses of international law in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in the District Court for the District of
Colombia on behalf all women who were forced into sexual slavery
by Japan between 1931 and 1945 as well as their heirs, accuses
Japan of instituting sexual slavery on a massive scale.
</P>
<P>
It alleges that the "comfort women" program was a systematic
plan ordered and executed by the Japanese government because it
required the deployment of the vast infrastructure and resources
that were at the government's disposal, including soldiers and
support personnel, weapons, all forms of land and sea
transportation, and engineering and construction crews and
materiel.
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, the Japanese government built,
operated, and controlled hundreds of "comfort stations" staffed
with hundreds of thousands of women and girls, who were taken by
Japan from countries throughout its enormous area of colonization
and occupation and placed in slavery for the purpose of providing
sexual pleasure to the Japanese military.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was followed by a silent vigil conducted
by the 15 plaintiffs in front of the Japanese embassy in
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Russian Peleshenko Aims for Women's Shot Put Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Having returned from a four-
year drug ban last year, Larisa Peleshenko of Russia is now
setting her sights on gold as she prepares for the women's shot
put at the athletics competitions of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Such an achievement is not out of her reach, judging on her
recent performances. If Peleshenko can repeat her huge effort of
21.46 meters that she threw in Moscow in late August, then there
is little doubt that the gold will belong to her.
</P>
<P>
However, she can expect tough competition from gold medal
contenders compatriot Svetlana Kriveleva and German Astrid
Kumbernuss.
</P>
<P>
Bronze medalist in the 1999 World Championships in Seville,
Kriveleva is in good form coming into the Sydney Games, with
recent throws indicating she will gain a place on the podium.
</P>
<P>
Current Olympic champion Kumbernuss who returned to elite sport
in May 1999 after the birth of her son the previous year, made a
successful comeback to retain the world title at Seville. She
will be wanting the repeat that performance in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Consistent performances throughout from Nadine Kleinert-Schmitt
of Germany suggest she will also be a medal contender, but more
likely for the bronze. Yanina Korolchick of Bulgaria also has an
excellent championships record.
</P>
<P>
Four-time Olympic veteran Connie Price-Smith of the United
States is not considered a threat to the top competition but will
be hoping to match her Atlanta 1996 performance of fifth place.
</P>
<P>
The women's shot put has been an Olympic event since 1948, and
Kumbernuss was unbeaten in 53 consecutive contests from May 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, she was named German Sportswoman of the Year, and
still holds the world record of 20.54 meters set up in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Suspended Romanian Lifter Disappears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Romanian lifter Traian
Ciharean who was tested positive for doping has gone missing after
walking out of the athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
"He's left. He's handed his accreditation back to SOCOG. He is
in Australia somewhere but we don't know where," said Romanian
team spokesman Meheal Espaf.
</P>
<P>
After being banned for life for testing positive for the
steroid nandrolone, Ciharean had been expected to return home
immediately on a flight booked by his country's Olympic committee.
But he did not take the flight
</P>
<P>
"He can come and go as he pleases. It is possible to change the
ticket but he is not our resonsibility anymore," said Espaf.
</P>
<P>
Ciharean and fellow lifter Andrei Mateias returned positive
tests in a doping blitz conducted by the International
Weightlifting Federation (IWF) on the eve of the Games.
</P>
<P>
Ciharean posted a positive "B" sample on Saturday and was
thrown out of the Olympics. Mateias's analysis is expected later
Tuesday and if positive he too will have his accreditation removed.
</P>
<P>
Another Romanian lifter tested positive earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The entire Romanian weightlifting team was suspended from the
Games by the IWF as a result of the three positive tests, but
invoked a clause that allowed it to pay a 50,000 US dollar fine to
stay.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian shot putter Aleksandr Bagach will also learn on
Tuesday if he is to miss the Olympics for doping offences.

<HEADLINE> Van Almsick Fails for Semifinals of Women's 200m Butterfly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Franziska van Almsick of
Germany was unable to hold back her tears as she was stopped from
winning her first-ever Olympic gold medal after failing to qualify
for the semifinals of the 200m butterflyat the Olympic Games on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old German champion finished in a disappointing 11
th place as American Misty Hyman and Australian world-record
holder Susie O'Neill topped the qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Van Almsick, who has captured seven Olympic medals
but the gold, failed to make the women's 200 meters freestyle
final, an event where she has held the world record for the past
six years since the 1994 World Championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, she withdrew from the semi-finals of 100 meters
butterfly to concentrate on the freestyle in a bid to fulfil her
dream for an individual gold.
</P>
<P>
Van Almsick, a former prodigy, missed the gold in the 200m
freestyle in Barcelona by an arm's length at the age of 14, and
again in Atlanta four years later.
</P>
<P>
However, she still has the last hope of an Olympic gold in the
two relays later this week and her world record of 1:56.78 remains
unchallenged at the Sydney International Aquatic Center where
eight world records have been shattered so far.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Launches Anti-Trafficking Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia must improve its
ability to prosecute those who organize and profit from the
trafficking of humans, said Mu Sochua, Minister of Women's and
Veterans' Affairs, according to The Cambodia Daily Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the ministry's new Counter-Trafficking Bureau
Monday, Mu Sochua said that the new bureau will focus on improving
the capacity of the ministry to deal with trafficking issues by
sensitizing its members to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Between 400 and 800 Cambodian women and children are trafficked
to Thailand each month to work as prostitutes or beggars, the
local newspaper quoted Chanthol Oung , director of the Cambodian
Women's Crisis Center, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the some police officers are also involved in
sexual exploitation of children by either protecting brothel
owners or directly trafficking children.
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of girls and boys between 15 and 18 years
who suffer from trafficking and sexual exploitation and do not
have justice because they are (outside the trafficking law)", Mu
Sochua said.
</P>
<P>
The female minister also announced an intended amendment to the
country's trafficking law that will define a minor as anyone
younger than 18 years old--compared to the current limit of
younger than 15 years old.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Investment Projects Approved by Indonesia in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign
investment approvals soared to 3.76 billion U.S. dollars in July,
up from 265 million U.S. dollars in June, despite the country's
lingering political and economic uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise was mainly due to an increase in approvals for
chemical projects, worth about 3 billion U.S. dollars, Antara news
agency Tuesday quoted a government statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investment approvals from January to July this
year were 6.09 billion U.S. dollars, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have sharply reduced their Indonesian
exposure since the height of the regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign investment approvals amounted to only 10.
9 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, compared with 13.6 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998 and 33.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Traditional Chinese Medicine Gets Popular in SE Asia: Thai Expert  By Yang Qingchuan, Huang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- In Southeast Asia, the over
5000 year-old traditional Chinese medicine is now getting more and
more popular, while governments in the region gradually recognize
its importance and begin to take promotive measures, an expert of
the traditional Chinese medicine said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid development of the traditional Chinese medicine in
the region shows that the age-old Chinese medical science is
gaining greater international reputation and will play a more
important role in the global medical market," Wong Zhongzhou,
secretary-general of the Association of The Traditional Chinese
Medicine of Thailand, told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The scientific value and business potential of the traditional
Chinese medicine have been acknowledged and emphasized unanimously
at a recent regional medical meeting held here earlier this month,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wong, who acted as the secretary-general of the 6th Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)'s Academic Conference on
Traditional Chinese Medicine, said the participants agreed that
the traditional Chinese medicine is now widely-accepted in
Southeast Asia, and urged the region to further boost it.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the biggest-ever and the most influential of its
kind in the region, was attended by around 700 experts and
scholars in the traditional Chinese medicine from the 10 ASEAN
members: Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, The Philippines,
Brunei, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar, as well as mainland
China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Australia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Wong pointed out that as the traditional Chinese medicine
becomes more and more famous in the region, its market prospect
has already been noticed by the investors.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, the foreign investments in the traditional
Chinese medicine in Southeast Asia have grown quickly, increasing
continuously in both capital and projects," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the general support from the governments in the
region to develop the traditional Chinese medicine has also
generated a new momentum, he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that earlier this year, Thai deputy prime minister
and health minister Korn Dabbaransi have praised the traditional
Chinese medicine as "an outstanding health-care science which has
5,000 years of experiences and practices," and declared that "it
has been accepted by the majority of Thai people."
</P>
<P>
In July, the Thai government also announced a formal
recognition of the legal status of the traditional Chinese
medicine, and launched a cooperative project with China to build a
regional training, research and treatment center of the
traditional Chinese medicine in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Wong said in Malaysia, the authorities decided to integrate the
traditional Chinese medicine into the "mainstream of national
medical system," and wished to offer all the Malaysians a combined
medical service with both western medicine and the traditional
Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the health ministry supports the idea of forming
a coordinating committee among the organizations of traditional
Chinese medicine and provides policy protection for these
organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under supportive policies, the Association of Doctors of
Singaporean Traditional Chinese Medicine has emerged as a leading
force to promote the traditional Chinese medicine in the country,
establishing several hospitals and research centers of the
traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
In other ASEAN countries, governments also start to take
various measures to develop the traditional Chinese medicine, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wong, who owns one of over 400 traditional Chinese medicine
stores in the capital city, said that his customers were mainly
Thai Chinese, but now more and more Thais and foreigners come to
his shop.
</P>
<P>
"Many people here used to believe the western medicine is the
only way to cure diseases," he said, "however, now most patients
who suffered from difficult and complicated illness or chronic
diseases are seeking the help of the traditional Chinese medicine.
"
</P>
<P>
The numbers of traditional Chinese medicine shops are growing
rapidly in Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia, he said in his
shop, which is crowded by customers.
</P>
<P>
"As the traditional Chinese medicine thrives in Thailand, every
kind of such medicine is now available here, including Chinese
herbal medicine, Chinese synthesized medicine, precious Chinese
medicine materials, Chinese tonic and other Chinese medicines," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the traditional Chinese medicine has been proved
by countless treatments of every kind of illness, and it is the
time to give it the relevant international status," the expert
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said although the traditional Chinese medicine has
achieved a considerable success in Southeast Asia and other places
around the world, lots of efforts still need to be taken to make
the traditional Chinese medicine to better meet the modern
scientific standards and the requirements of the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
"There remains a huge task ahead to develop the over 5000 years-
old traditional Chinese medicine into a fully-modernized science
and business across the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Tries NATO Leaders for War Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 18 (Xinhua)-- A local court in Yugoslavia
on Monday opened a trial in absentia of 14 NATO leaders including
U.S. President Bill Clinton and his NATO allies for war crimes
during last year's bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade District Court accused them of violating
international law, the UN Charter, and the country's criminal law
for staging an invasion against a sovereign state, war crimes
against civilians, and the use of banned munitions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 504 Yugoslav civilians, 240 servicemen, and 147
policemen were estimated to have been killed during the March 24-
June 10 NATO air strikes last year.
</P>
<P>
In the court room, there were chairs labeled with names of the
western leaders: President Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The other labeled chairs represented U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, U.S. Defense Chief William Cohen, and their
counterparts from Britain, France and Germany. NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana and NATO Commander Wesley Clark were also
put on trial in absentia.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 pieces of evidence covering over 500 incidents
are expected to be presented at the court, which will include spot
investigation reports, forensic reports, statements of witnesses,
photographs and videotapes.
</P>
<P>
It took the country's 29 local courts and military courts over
one year to collect the evidence.
</P>
<P>
A 192-page bill of indictment said that during the air raid,
the western military alliance carried out 25,119 combat aircraft
sorties, while launching 600 cruise missiles attacking both
military and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, NATO used internationally banned cluster bombs and
ammunition with depleted uranium during the targeting of 77 sites
in the rebel Kosovo province, six other places in southern Serbia,
and one in Montenegro, inflicting severe environment damages on
top of other damages.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors listed all the sites including towns, villages,
and industrial and military facilities.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 juridical officials from Serbia were present at
the court, in addition to about 120 foreign journalists and
diplomats from 11 foreign embassies in Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Calls for Measures to End Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 18 (Xinhua) --- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana left here for Cali on Monday to attend a security meeting
on the Sunday mass kidnapping of 53 hostages, the president's
office said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be attended by military and police officials,
will decide what steps the military and police will take to help
release the hostages taken on Sunday by the country's second
largest rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The hostages were taken after about 200 ELN guerrillas set up
two roadblocks on the road between Cali and the Pacific coastal
city of Buenaventura, closing a three-kilometer stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the ELN released 17 of the 53 captives. The rest of
them were forced by the guerrillas to move into the mountains
close to Cali.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the army's third brigade, Jaime Canal, told reporters
that the army and police troops, supported by Air Force
helicopters and airplanes, were after the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
But the governor of Valle complained of the lack of a strong
police force at such a short distance from Cali, 477 kilometers
southwest of Bogota, and made a call to Pastrana to reinforce the
military presence on the Cali-Buenaventura road.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said Camilo Gomez, the government chief peace
negotiator, is keeping in touch with the leadership of the ELN in
order to listen to their position. "Once we have an answer, we
will take the necessary measures," said Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
This is the third major kidnapping by the ELN since last year.
It kidnapped 150 parishioners in May last year before releasing
them a few months later. The rebel group also hijacked an Avianca
airplane flying from Bucaramanga to Bogota in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Although talks between the government and this guerrilla group
have started, the two sides have not agreed on the venue.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Concludes Debt Rescheduling With Paris Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's President of the
Foreign Debt Rescheduling Commission Jorge Gallardo confirmed
Monday that the rescheduling of Ecuador's foreign debt with the
Paris Club, amounting to 1.3 billion US dollars has concluded.
</P>
<P>
According to Gallardo, out of the 1.3 billions, 887 million
dollars will be re-financed, and besides, it was possible to swap
20 percent of the debt for the realization of social programs.
</P>
<P>
Gallardo said the goal of Ecuador is to search for mechanisms
to condone the debt and that for that purpose there is a meeting
on the agenda with the Paris Club creditors in April, next year.
</P>
<P>
It was possible for Ecuador to get a 20-year term with a 10-
year grace period, and an interest rate in the same preferential
terms. The second part of the foreign (commercial) debt could be
rescheduled to an 18-year term, with a three-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
President Gustavo Noboa said the achievements reached in the
foreign debt rescheduling process with the Paris Club creditors
means the levels of the so-called "risk-country" have decreased.
</P>
<P>
He said the rescheduling with the Club means that all of the
national
financial community is supporting Ecuador in its processes.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came last Friday after the first revision of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Ecuador, whose Gross
Domestic Product has plunged from 20 billion U.S. dollars to 12
billion due to two years of political chaos and economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The creditor governments also clinched "an agreement in
principle" to study a new rescheduling of Ecuador's credits coming
to maturity after April 30, 2001."

<HEADLINE> Argentina Tightens Border Control in Pursuit of Fugitives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine
authorities tightened air, land and river border controls on
Monday in an attempt to recapture three fugitives who escaped from
the Central Police Department on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Police said two of the fugitives are charged with the
murder of Paraguay's Vice President Luis Maria Argana on March 23,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Fernando de la Rua said Monday that the
escape of the two suspects involved in the vice president's murder,
which was described by the local press as "another scandal" in the
political arena of Argentina, is very serious.
</P>
<P>
The president said he is determined to "use all the power of
the state to find them."
</P>
<P>
Federal Judge Gabriel Cavallo, who is in charge of the case,
has reportedly issued orders to the National Police and the Air
Police to double their forces in order to capture the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Federal Police, Ruben Santos, said on Monday
that the fugitives are believed to be still in Argentine territory,
since they do not have the resources to leave the country so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Photos of the three fugitives, Luis Rojas, Fidencio Vega
Barrios and Agustin Cabrera, have already been sent to security
forces, and were posted at every border post to help local people
recognize them.
</P>
<P>
President de la Rua has reportedly ordered an immediate
investigation into the incident on Monday. He said he is waiting
for the reports to decide whether there will be changes in police
leadership due to the escape.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Santos said on Monday that "it would be cowardly" to
resign during such a difficult moment, saying that he has decided
to take the investigation and capture the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
The two fugitives, allegedly linked to the March 1999 murder of
Paraguay's vice president, were captured several months later in
Argentina.

27 dead and almost 2,000 people infected in El Salvador this year,
according to officials from the Central American country.
</P>
<P>
Twenty new cases of the disease occurred Saturday, said
Director of the Children Hospital, Benjamin Bloom Sergio Parada,
according to reports from San Salvador Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Only with fumigation and the elimination of mosquito's
breeding places will it be possible to expel the epidemic," said
Parada.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.5 million students and 4,000 soldiers participated in a
campaign Monday for the elimination of mosquito breeding places.
</P>
<P>
The chief of Epidemiology of El Salvador's Health Ministry,
Rolando Hernandez, said specialists from Cuba, Mexico and Panama
will arrive in the country this week to investigate the dengue
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The dengue is a disease that causes fever, weakness and muscle
pains. Five years ago, when the epidemic first attacked El
Salvador, five died and 9,529 were infected.

<P>
WARSAW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Navies from seven NATO
countries started a three-day military game Monday in the Baltic
Sea.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,500 soldiers from Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark,
Spain, Germany, the United States and Poland, took part in the
exercises aimed at "executing U.N. sanctions against an imaginary
country" that violated international principles in a fishing right
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvering troops belong to both NATO Atlantic navy and
its rapid reaction force.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time for Poland to take part in a NATO drill
since it joined the military bloc last year. In August 1999, the
country joined military exercises with Germany and Denmark in its
northwestern city of Szcezinski.

<HEADLINE> Koreans On Way to Finish 1-2-3 in Women's Archery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean archers are on
target to have a clean sweep of the women's individual archery as
three archers from the country advanced to the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Yun Mi-Jin set a new Olympic record as she downed British hope
Alison Williamson 173-164 in the clash of the round, eclipsing the
previous best of 168 held jointly by her team-mate Kim Soo-Hyung
and Natalia Nasaridze of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
World number three Williamson, who was fortunate to edge past
Turkey's unheralded Elif Altinkaynak in the previous round, raised
her game but had no answer to Mi-Jin's barrage, which included
eleven dead centres from her 18 arrows.
</P>
<P>
Williamson, whose score of 164 would have beaten all except the
South Korean trio, responded with eight bullseyes of her own but
could not quite overhaul Yun.
</P>
<P>
Yun now plays Natalia Bolotova of Russia in the quarter-finals
and is on course to meet Kim Soo-Hyung in the last four.
</P>
<P>
Three-time Olympic gold medallist and world number one Kim Soo-
Hyung had few problems in disposing of Australian outsider
Michelle Tremelling - ranked 121 in the world.
</P>
<P>
She won through 168-158 despite enthusiastic vocal
encouragement for the Melbourne-born home favorite.
</P>
<P>
Joanna Nowicka of Poland has the unenviable task of trying to
stop Kim next after her surprise 162-158 win over China's Yang
Jianping.
</P>
<P>
The third member of the South Korean Korean trio Kim Nam-Soon
was pushed harder by China's He Ying.
</P>
<P>
She now faces Japan's Sayoko Kawauchi, who squeezed past Karen
Scavotto of the United States 159-157.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Ok Sil Choe of the Democratic Poeple's Republic of
Korea comfortably defeated Ukraine's Kateryna Serdyuk 160-153.
</P>
<P>
Her quarter-final opponent is Natalie Valeeva, who moved past
Cristina Ioriatti 163-156 in an all-Italian contest.
</P>
<P>
The bullseye is the size of a thumbnail at arm's length to the
naked eye when viewed from the archers' position 70 metres away.
</P>
<P>
The quarter-finals begin later Tuesday, followed by the semis
then the bronze medal contest and finally the gold medal match.
</P>
<P>
In these matches competitors have just 12 arrows each.
</P>
<P>
Kim Soo-Nyung holds the Olympic 12 arrow record with of score
of 114 set at Barcelona in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Perez Could Represent U.S. at Sydney Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Canoest Angel Perez, whose
native country was Cuba, has finally got nod from the Sports
Arbitration Tribunal to compete for the United States at the
Sydney Olympic Games, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sports Arbitration Tribunal granted an appeal by the USOC
even though the paddler has not completed the three years period
required by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
Article 46 of the Olympic Charter dictates that an athlete's
country of birth can veto an athlete's participation during that
period.
</P>
<P>
"I can not believe it," said Perez. "I had just packed my bags
to return to Miami and I am delighted that justice has been done."
</P>
<P>
Perez competed in the Barcelona Games in 1992 for Cuba but in
1993 went to the United States although he only became a citizen
of his new homeland last year.
</P>
<P>
The Sports Arbitration Tribunal has insisted that the decision
is final.
</P>
<P>
Perez had been one of six athletes prevented by Cuba from
taking part in the Millennium Games. The most famous is women's
World Champion long jumper Niurka Montalvo who has been prevented
from competing in Sydney by her homeland.

<HEADLINE> China Found Century-Old Dungeon By Japanese Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A water dungeon built by
Japanese troops 100 years ago was found recently in Shanhaiguan in
north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Historical records indicate that the cell was built in 1900 by
Japanese troops after they shelled the Shanhaiguan along with the
Eight-Power Allied Forces, who then built their barracks covering
an area of 2 square kilometers there.
</P>
<P>
Guo Zemin, head of the local cultural relics conservation
office, said that the newly found Japanese water dungeon was among
the earliest ones set up by foreign invasion troops.
</P>
<P>
Lying in southwest of the ruin of the Japanese barracks, the
dungeon is near the central building -- "General Building," the
residence of a high-ranking Japanese officer.
</P>
<P>
Experts measured that the concrete square dungeon is five
meters long and 4.5 meters wide. One narrow entrance is facing
south. Two small ventholes are set on the southern top.
</P>
<P>
"When I first entered the dungeon through the narrow entrance,"
said Guo Zemin, "I was frightened by the sight of some skeletons
lying on the clammy cement floor."
</P>
<P>
About 100 meters north of the water dungeon lies another prison
house which is 10 meters long and 4 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese troops didn't retreat from Shanhaiguan, arriving
there in 1900, until they surrendered in August of 1945.
</P>
<P>
"During the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945,
I often heard some Chinese screaming painfully at night," said 80-
year-old Zhang Shouben.

<HEADLINE> High Oil Prices Fire Up Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- High crude oil prices are
giving Chinese firms an incentive to pump more oil, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese fuel consumers predict that fuel prices will rise
even further at home, and they are none too pleased, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission Monday lifted the
average retail price of gasoline to 4,160 yuan (about 501.2 U.S.
dollars) per ton from 3,980 yuan (about 479.5 U.S dollars) with
the price of diesel oil going up to 3,564 yuan (about 429.4 U.S
dollars) per ton from 3,264 yuan (about 393.3 U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh fuel price rise on the domestic market since
November.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that world crude oil prices are likely to
exceed 40 U.S dollars per barrel by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
This is in spite of reports on Sunday that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will raise oil output by 500,000
barrels a day if prices remain above the top end of its target
range of 22 U.S. dollars to 28 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
However, oil refineries have suffered because of the high
prices and consumers have also complained about the consecutive
rises in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Although a high price benefits oil producers, it puts a squeeze
on refineries and fuel consumers.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry's profits surged by more than 30 billion yuan
to 40.3 billion yuan during the first half of the year, which oil
analysts said was mainly helped by the high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
But those profits are not helping the end users. And the
commission announced last month that it will readjust domestic
fuel prices every month according to changes on the world market.
</P>
<P>
It says fuel price increases are merely designed to bring
domestic oil product prices more in line with world levels.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese oil producers should channel more of their profits
into oil reserve prospecting and exploration when the prices are
at a high level," said Yang Jingmin, a senior researcher at the
Development Research Center of the China National Petroleum
Corporation, one of the country's two largest oil giants.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asian Economy to Grow 4.7 Percent, ADB Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank has
revised slightly upwards its forecast for the economic growth of
Southeast Asia this year to 4.7 percent from a previous projection
of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the countries affected by the 1997-1998 financial crisis,
except for Indonesia and Thailand, output lost during the crisis
is likely to be recouped by the end of 2000, the bank said in a
latest regional economic report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, The Asian Development Outlook 2000 Update, is a mid-
year update of the annual Asian Development Outlook, published in
April.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, it may take another year for per capita GDP (gross
domestic product) to reach pre-crisis level, while Indonesia may
take even longer as economic and political uncertainties have
become somewhat interwoven and are clouding a more robust recovery,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that in Singapore, sound macroeconomics management,
successful promotion of new technology industries, strong demand
for exports, and continued capital inflows have helped achieve a 8.
9-percent growth rate in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP is expected to grow by 8 percent in 2000 and
ease to 6 percent the next year, the bank said, adding that the
level of economic growth will depend on the overall global
economic climate, particularly the continued recovery of the
crisis-affected Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The main challenge faced by Singapore is how to continue the
policies that support the growth while avoiding overheating,
according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy, following a growth of 0.2 percent in 1999,
gathered momentum in the first half of 2000, expanding by 3.2
percent in the first quarter and 4.1 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
If the recovery is to be sustained, the bank said, further
progress in corporate, financial and administrative reforms is
required.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy is forecast to grow by 3-4 percent in
2000 and by 5 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's GDP registered a 10.3 percent year-on-year increase
in the first half of 2000, supported by improved external demand
for manufactured goods, especially electronic products and parts,
buoyant domestic consumption demand and an upturn in gross fixed
investment, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Strong growth in the first half of the year has led to a
revision of forecast growth upward from 6 percent to 7.8 percent
for 2000, and from 6.1 percent to 7 percent for 2001.
</P>
<P>
Faster restructuring of heavily indebted corporate entities
will enhance medium-term growth prospects for the country, said
the bank.
</P>
<P>
For the Philippines, the bank maintains its earlier forecast of
GDP growth of 3.8 percent for 2000 and 4.3 percent for 2001. The
2000 forecast is slightly lower than Manila's projected range of 4
to 5 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's GDP is forecast to grow by about 4.5 percent in 2000
and by 4.6 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic recovery continued in the first six
months of this year, achieving a growth rate of 5.2 percent in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said, the recovery will only become self-
sustaining when financial sector reforms and corporate debt
restructuring have been completed.

<HEADLINE> Wolfensohn Diagnoses Australian Dollar's Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- President of the World Bank
James Wolfensohn indicated Monday that the reason for the weakness
of the Australian dollar was the weakness of its high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald reported Tuesday that Wolfensohn was
speaking in Sydney during a brief private visit for the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
The Australia-born U.S. citizen said he agreed with the
chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan that the
biggest single factor in sustaining growth in the United States
had been its huge increase in investment in research and
development and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
He praised Australia's fiscal and monetary policy, but pointed
out that "(with) research and development policy you have not put
the money in and you have not expanded your markets."
</P>
<P>
The Australian officials explained that the Australian dollar
dropped because the U.S. dollar is too strong. They complain that
the international currency market has undervalued the Australian
dollar and that it's present market value does not tally the
strength of the Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
In the past five days, the Australian dollar reached new record
low levels and at Tuesday morning it was reportedly trading at 54.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Guards Hamper Probe: AG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said that armed civilian guards of former
president Soeharto have hampered the corruption probe into the
disgraced ex-ruler.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Monday in response to President Abdurrahman Wahid
's demand on Sunday for authorities to disarm Soeharto's civilian
guards, Marzuki said, he has received information from
intelligence officers that many armed civilians were deployed to
guard Soeharto's Cendana residence in Central Jakarta in a bid to
halt the legal process of the nation's former strongman.
</P>
<P>
"That's the information kept by the president and most people
have been aware of this. The information is clear and the
intelligence unit also says the same," Marzuki said.
</P>
<P>
He said the armed civilians were involved in the recent
violence against the anti-Soeharto activities, and carried weapons
that could harm the people.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, violent clashes broke out between Soeharto
supporters and their rivals at nearby Cendana, injuring scores of
people, including police officers.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who ruled the country for 32 years and stepped down
in May 1998, has twice defied his corruption trial that commenced
on August 31 and September 14. The court ordered him to show up
during the third session scheduled for September 28.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's order to disarm Soeharto's civilian guards has received
mixed reactions from human rights activities and political
analysts. Many supported the move, while some others questioned it.

<HEADLINE> (Updates With More Details) U.S. Senate Passes Bill on PNTR With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Tuesday
afternoon passed a bill on permanent normal trade relations (PNTR)
with China by a vote of 83-15 after a heated debate.
</P>
<P>
Once the legislation is signed into law by President Bill
Clinton, the United States will terminate its practice of
reviewing China's "most-favored-nation (MFN)" status on an annual
basis according to the relevant articles of the 1974 Trade Act and
establish permanent normal trade relations with China after the
latter joins the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The establishment of permanent normal trade relations will help
create a long-term stable environment for the economic and trade
cooperation between China and the United States, serve the
fundamental interests of their people and is of great importance
to the healthy development of China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, however, the Senate legislation kept the
contents in the House bill that harm China's interests and
interfere in China's internal affairs. The Chinese government has
taken up the issue with the U.S. government and expressed strong
opposition to these contents.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives adopted the PNTR bill on May
24 by a vote of 237-197. On September 5, the Senate began
comprehensive debates on the bill and voting on the relevant
amendments.
</P>
<P>
During the debates, most senators held that granting PNTR
status to China conforms to the economic and security interests of
the United States and will help promote the smooth development of
U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
A few senators, however, in order to block the bill from
passage, proposed more than 20 amendments trying to link trade
with China with issues unrelated to trade. After repeated votes,
the Senate overwhelmingly rejected these amendments.
</P>
<P>
When China and the United States established diplomatic ties in
1979, they signed an agreement on bilateral trade relations, which
would grant MFN treatment to each other.But after the agreement
went into effect in 1980, the U.S. side, in accordance with the
relevant articles of the 1974 Trade Act, insisted on reviewing
annually whether or not to give MFN status to China.
</P>
<P>
This discriminatory practice on the part of the U.S. side has
for long constituted an impediment to the healthy and steady
development of the economic and trade relations between the two
countries. The Chinese side has always opposed this unilateral
annual review and called for an early solution to the issue of MFN
treatment.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, President Clinton signed a tax reform act,
formally changing the parlance of "MFN" into "normal trade
relations". Last November, the two countries signed an agreement
on China's entry into the World Trade Organization. In March this
year, President Clinton submitted a legislation proposal to
Congress, urging it to grant PNTR status to China.
</P>
<P>
Since then, President Clinton and senior administration
officials repeatedly urged Congress to adopt the PNTR bill as
early as possible. While many national economic organizations,
major businesses in the industrial, commercial, financial and
other sectors and far-sighted personages in various walks of life
in the United States actively urged Congress to pass the bill,
more and more Congressmen also gave clear-cut support to permanent
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Establishing permanent normal trade relations with China has
become the mainstream aspiration in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Continue Falling While Tech Stocks Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Blue chip stocks continued
to fall amid worries about weakening corporate earnings and rising
oil prices Tuesday but technology shares bounced back after a
steep drop.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 19.23 at 10,789.29,
extending its loss of 118.48 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 139.12 at 3,865.64 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 15.39 at 1,459.90.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index struggled through the volatile trading day but
failed to recover from a recent fall. Investors had already sold
stocks amid worries about corporate earnings and rising oil prices,
dragging the Dow index down 424.71 points in the previous four
sessions.
</P>
<P>
A number of companies have issued earnings warnings, sparking
uncertainty about investment returns in the slowing U.S. economy
and fresh earnings warnings came out from Alcoa, Federal-Mogul and
Ingersoll-Rand Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A series of reports showed that the U.S. economy is moderating
after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for six times in
the past 15 months in a pre-emptive move to cool off the economy
and keep inflation under control. The slowdown in the economy will
ease pressures on inflation but could lower corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
But investors moved into the technology sector for bargain-
hunting after a Wall Street analyst upgraded Intel's shares to "
buy" from "market perform." The same analyst downgraded the
chipmaker less than a week ago, hitting the company's stocks
heavily.
</P>
<P>
Other good news also helped move the Nasdaq index higher.
Cobalt Networks announced it was acquired by Sun Microsystems and
the computer server manufacturer rose.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of Ariba also rose after the software company said it
would provide e-commerce support systems to Transora, a global
business-to-business Web site for food, beverage and consumer
goods.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 1.33 at 661.11 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 6.63 at 523.31. But the Americana Stock
Exchange index fell 10.10 at 950.68.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,524 down, 1,401 up and 441
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.01 billion shares from 951.87
million in the previous session.
