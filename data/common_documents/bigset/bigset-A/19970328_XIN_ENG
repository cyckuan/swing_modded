<HEADLINE> Cash For Questions Tory MP Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Conservative party's
general election campaign suffered a serious blow last night with
the decision by one of its MPs Tim Smith to quit over his
involvement in the so-called "cash for questions" scandal.
</P>
<P>
Smith resigned in the wake of the Guardian newspaper's
publication last week of leaked extracts of his questioning during
a parliamentary investigation into MPs accepting cash for asking
questions in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Smith, a candidate for the safe Conservative seat of
Beaconsfield, claimed that he was the victim of a media witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
He said on Wednesday, "I very much regret that the action of
the Guardian newspaper in support of the Labor party has made my
course of action inevitable with its complete disregard for both
parliamentary privilege and natural justice."
</P>
<P>
Smith resigned as a minister in October 1994 after a series of
articles in the Guardian alleging he was paid to ask questions in
parliament on behalf of Egyptian businessman Mohammed al-Fayed,
owner of London's luxury Harrods store.
</P>
<P>
He admitted failing to declare 25,000 pounds (40,000
U.S. dollars) in cash payments from al-Fayed in the register of
MPs' outside earnings. But he remained as an MP, saying his
failure to declare was a mistake but not illegal.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary committee was set up to investigate claims that
money was paid to Smith and former junior trade minister Neil
Hamilton and eight other MPs by a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
But John Major's decision to dismiss parliament last Friday,
launching the longest election campaign in 80 years, meant the
report on these charges could not be published before the election.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party, strong favorites to win the
election, accused Major of deliberately closing parliament to
cover up the scandal. But the prime minister rejected the charges.
</P>
<P>
There was strong speculation that Smith's decision to step down
as a candidate in the election had been pressed on him by party
bosses hoping him to damp down the damage being caused by a string
of sleaze scandals that have hit the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
A colleague of the prime minister said Wednesday night
that Smith had to quit to "avoid damage to the PM."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major defended Smith, telling the Yorkshire
Post newspaper on Wednesday that " people are innocent until
proved guilty."
</P>
<P>
He also said that he wanted to see Smith and the nine other
Tory MPs under investigation by Sir Gordon re-elected on May 1.

SHANGHAI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- US Vice-President Al Gore spoke
highly of Shanghai's environmental protection efforts during his
meeting with Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi today.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that improving environment quality is the key to
Shanghai's implementation of the sustainable development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Gore arrived in China's largest industrial city in the
afternoon after winding up his visit to Xi'an, capital city of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Xu told Gore that during the 9th Five-Year Plan
period from 1996 to 2000, Shanghai will devote at least 40 billion
RMB yuan to environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The city also attaches great importance to afforestation, Xu
said, adding that a total of 100 pieces of public lands will be
planted in the city within the year.
</P>
<P>
The city has also launched a comprehensive project to harness
the heavily-polluted Suzhou River. The river will be expected to
become basically clean by the end of the century, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Gore expressed his hope that his country will have greater
economic cooperation with Shanghai and more US companies will come
to participate in the construction projects of the city, like
Pudong Airport, telecommunications, and finance.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Parliamentary Chief Says Relations with Greece Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of Albania's
parliament Pjeter Arbnori said yesterday that friendly relations
between Albania and Greece would not falter.
</P>
<P>
Arbnori, speaking after a meeting of the National Assembly, was
responding to accusations by the former director of the National
Intelligence Bureau, Bashkim Gazidede, that Greece and the United
States were responsible for fomenting the current upheaval in
southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
Gazidede said during the assembly meeting that organizations
from Greece and the United States schemed to subvert the rule of
the Albanian government in Vorioepirn in southern Albania in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Though the plot failed at the time, it was resurrected and
carried out recently, he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks triggered immediate denial and condemnations from
both Greece and the United States.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Albanian Foreign Ministry described the
accusations as baseless.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis in Albania stemmed from the collapse of
fraudulent investment schemes in January in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
Weeks of street protests turned violent three weeks ago when
angry demonstrators looted military depots in the south of the
country and took control of several towns.

and is willing to work with the Bolivian Government toward this
end.

<HEADLINE> S'pore to Gain Around 1 Billion US Dollars With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Information
Technology (IT) exporters will stand to gain an accumulated
potential tariff savings of around one billion US dollars when the
Information Technology Agreement (ITA) is fully implemented, the
Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
This figure represents a 50 percent rise over the previous
estimate, the TDB said, adding that the tariff savings were based
on Singapore's 1996 IT domestic exports to its major markets,
which included the United States, the European Union nations,
Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the ITA, which was agreed upon in December
1996 at the inaugural World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial
Conference in Singapore, will begin from July 1, 1997 according to
schedule. Tariffs on relevant IT products will then be
progressively reduced and eliminated by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The number of ITA participating members has now increased from
the original 28 to 39. The first 28 members under the ITA were
Australia, Canada, Chinese Taipei, the 15 European Union nations,
Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Iceland, Norway,
Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The additional 11 new members are New Zealand, Macao, Costa
Rica, Malaysia, Thailand, Romania, Estonia, Israel, India, the
Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Together, these participating members represent more than 92
percent of world trade in IT goods, the TDB said, adding that with
the 90 percent threshold having been exceeded, this in effect
signifies a broad acceptance of the ITA by major IT exporting
economies.
</P>
<P>
The ITA covers five main categories of products, namely
computers, telecommunication products, semiconductors,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and scientific equipment.

<HEADLINE> More Stringent Criteria to Be Applied on Noisy Hammers in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- More stringent noise criteria
will be applied on noisy percussive hammers and such construction
tools are to be practically banned in built-up areas in Hong Kong,
 the Hong Kong government said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A noise control bill approved here today seeks to reduce noise
level generated from percussive piling by phasing out the use of
three most noisy types -- diesel, pneumatic and steam -- in
built-up areas and replace them with quieter alternatives such as
the hydraulic ones.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that percussive piling generates
significant noise impact on its neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Of the three types, diesel hammer accounts for over 80 percent
of piling permits issued and produces noise levels up to 103 dB
(A) at 10 meters. Pneumatic and steam hammer also produces noise
level up to 106 dB (A) at 10 meters.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, hydraulic hammer is more environmentally
friendly as it produces about two to nine dB (A), quieter than
diesel, pneumatic and steam hammers under the same site conditions
 and will not emit filthy smoke.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, mitigation measures such as acoustic shrouds may be
applied to further reduce noise.
</P>
<P>
In collaboration with government departments, the Hong Kong
Construction Association has completed a series of piling tests
which found that hydraulic hammers can achieve the required hammer
 efficiency.
</P>
<P>
And to moderate the impact on the construction industry and to
allow time for suppliers of hydraulic hammers to meet the demand,
it was proposed to phase out noisy hammers in four stages at
six-month intervals beginning in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Progressively, the noise criteria for issuing constructing
noise permits to percussive piling operations using those hammers
will be tightened, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During the final stage at around year 2000 the use of noisy
hammers in built-up areas will practically be banned. Nonetheless,
they can still be used in remote areas where they will not
disturb anyone, he added.

that total for year-end 1997 figures, about 12.5 million visitors
this year.

<HEADLINE> Greek General Staff Chief May Meet Turkish Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government said today
that Chief of National Defense of Greece General Athanasios
Tzoganis may meet with his Turkish counterpart, General Ismail
Hakki Karadayi, next month.
</P>
<P>
Acting government spokesman Yiannis Nikolaou said that the
meeting, if held, would be within the framework of "routine
contacts" which takes place on the sidelines of NATO meetings and
could serve "to further broaden possibilities for improving the
climate of Greek-Turkish relations."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on an invitation from Karadayi to Tzoganis to visit
Turkey, Nikolaou said an official invitation would have to be
extended.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that while all such initiatives were positive,
they should be accompanied by "concrete measures for the
implementation of Turkey's good intentions."
</P>
<P>
"Such moves are meaningful when the conditions are secured
which are related to respect for international law, international
treaties and the implementation of the principle of refraining
from using force or threatening the use of force," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi attended a reception at Athens' embassy in Ankara to
celebrate Greece's independence day on Tuesday. The government
described his attendance as as "a polite gesture."
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in many years that such a senior member
of the Turkish armed forces attended the Greek commemoration of
March 25, the day in 1821 when the Greek war of liberation against
the Turkish Ottoman Empire began.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish general reportedly spoke to Greece's ambassador to
Ankara of the need to resolve bilateral differences "so that
future generations will not be burdened by these problems."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have long been at odds over rights in the
Eagean and the disputes in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM to Announce Relief-Oriented Mini-Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif will announce the first ever relief-oriented "Mini Budget"
soon, with downward revision in the income tax, tariff rates and
sales tax besides a unique industrial package.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Revival Program will provide incentives and
concessions across the board to almost each sector of the economy
in a direct and indirect manner.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary package, three months ahead of the new fiscal
year (1997-98), is expected to ensure a diminishing trend in the
price spiral, arresting a surge in inflationary pressure, contrary
to the previous budgetary proposals which had always entailed an
upward trend in the prices.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of the different committees constituted by
the prime minister will provide a basis for the Economic Revival
Program containing a substantial reforms package, ensuring rapid
economic development and relief to the common man.
</P>
<P>
Despite reduction in the tax and tariff rates, an increase in
revenue collection is expected by broadening the tax base.
Rationalization of tax rates will not only net new tax payers but
will also check tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Government sources have expressed the hope that both
individuals and companies are most likely to benefit from the
rationalization of tax rates.
</P>
<P>
The concessions and relief, in fact, are aimed at lessening
unbearable burdens on the tax payers, improving the revenue
collection and minimizing tax evasion, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A substantial industrial package to be appended with overall
budgetary proposals and economic revival program is expected to
provide an impetus in accelerating the pace of industrial
production and augmenting the country's exports, thus slashing the
trade deficit, presently around 4.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign as well as local investors will be provided special
industrial zones with a variety of incentives and concessions to
improve productivity and production in traditional as well as
non-conventional sectors of the economy, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Another package for the revival of closed and sick units will
also be unfolded to bring them into the mainstream of the economy,
enabling them to contribute towards economic growth in a phased
manner.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Revival Program will also envisage structural
reforms, which is to lay a sound basis for Pakistan to qualify for
the Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) of the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has already launched the National
Debt Retirement Program which has so far attracted 450 million
dollars including commitments made by overseas Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has embarked upon a revolutionary
program of advancing the privatization process in a more judicious
and transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Pakistanis have so far remitted over 37 billion
dollars since 1972 through banking system, excluding the foreign
exchange remitted through other unofficial channels.
</P>
<P>
Of the total remittances, only 18 percent was utilized for
commercial and development purposes, while the rest of the major
chunk was channeled towards the consumption sector.
</P>
<P>
Sensing the huge potential of overseas capital, the present
government is determined to tap this avenue of enormous capital
and investment for revival and development of the country's
economy.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Italy to Drop Blockade of Albanian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) envoy to Italy, Fazlul Karim, on Thursday
criticized Italy's coastal blockade designed to prevent Albanian
refugees reaching Italy by sea.
</P>
<P>
On an inspection tour of the refugee situation and talks with
local authorities, Karim criticized Italy's hard line policy and
told the press that the High Commission does not approve of this
type of blockade.
</P>
<P>
"We always ask that people in need be granted protection and to
be in a position to ask for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karim noted that since the beginning of the crisis in Albania
the UNHCR had asked neighboring counties to let in refugees
because of the disorder and anarchy in the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government had followed this policy until a few
days ago when it decided to adopt a more hard-line position.
</P>
<P>
Karim went on to reiterate his demand that Rome recognize
temporary protection for a limited time period to those fleeing
Albania.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis in Albania stemmed from the collapse of
fraudulent investment schemes in January in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
Weeks of street protests turned violent three weeks ago when
angry protesters looted military depots in the south of the
country and took control of several towns.
</P>
<P>
The upheaval triggered an uncontrolled mass exodus of refugees
from Albania to neighboring Italy across the Adriatic Sea.

<HEADLINE> Italy's PM Announces Mini-Budget to Prepare for EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
today unveiled a widely-expected mini-budget of 15.5 trillion lira
(about 9.12 billion U.S. dollars) to prepare for the country's
entry into the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
The supplementary budget, the second this year, will help keep
the country's current budget deficit within the limits set out in
the Maastricht Treaty, he said.
</P>
<P>
The major component of the mini-budget was a levy on company
severance pay funds this year and next year, which will raise a
total of 12 trillion lira (7.06 billion dollars), Treasury and
Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
However, companies with fewer than 15 employees will be exempt
from the levy, Ciampi added.
</P>
<P>
In February, Prodi said his government was likely to announce a
spring mini-budget to ensure the country qualifies as a founder
member of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Italy is fighting hard to convince sceptical partners in the
European Union, notably Germany, that it can put its finances
in order on a lasting basis to qualify as a founder of the
single currency which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Maastricht Treaty has set five criteria for membership
of European Monetary Union, one of which is that the budget
deficit and national debt of a member country must not exceed 3
and 60 percent respectively of its gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, US Envoy Hold Talks in Rabat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, March 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
autonomous authority Yasser Arafat today had a two-hour meeting
with the U.S. Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross, but no details
of their talks were given by either Palestinian or U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here this morning to attend the 16th session of
the Al-Qods (Jerusalem) Committee of the Organization of Islamic
Conference, which opened today under the presidence of King Hassan
II of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Qods Committee will examine the latest situation in
Jerusalem and the dangers posed against the Arab part of the city,
after Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu decided to build a
new settlement in the Arab part of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The members of the committee accused Israel of trying to
"Judaize" Jerusalem by continuously carrying out plans to expand
the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
King Hassan today also had a meeting with Ross, who is also the
personal envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Ross was sent by President Clinton to tap the possibility of
relaunching the Middle East peace process, which is now marked by
an overall freeze of all dialogue between Israel and the
Palestinians following the Israeli decision to build a new housing
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross will return to Washington this weekend to make a report on
his talks with Arafat to President Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published earlier today, King Hassan urged
Israel to implement all the agreements it has signed with the
Palestinians and all the commitments made since the Madrid
International Peace Conference on the Middle East in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"The act taken recently by the Israeli administration.... made
us think that it was not serious when pretending that it wanted to
pursue the peace process on the basis agreed upon by the Madrid
conference, and that it was not aware of the grave consequences
which would result from the implementation of its decision to
build a new settlement," said the king.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Madrid conference decided upon the
principle of "land for peace" which should serve as the basis of
negotiating peace between Israel and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Palestinian people have the "imprescriptible"
rights to self-determination and the establishment of an
independent state on their fatherland with Jerusalem as its
capital.

<HEADLINE> Major Reforms in Economic Restructuring for 1997 Mapped out (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy has listed a number of major reforms of
the country's economic structure this year, with the reform of
state-owned enterprises serving as the top priority.
</P>
<P>
In line with the strategic objectives of China's Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000), the reforms also cover investment
mechanisms, social security, housing, commodity circulation,
taxation, and banking.
</P>
<P>
The government will intensify efforts to organize large-scale
state-owned corporations and enterprise groups favored with local
advantages and guided by market requirements and state policies,
and at the same time give more operating freedom to small
state-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
Through varied forms of combination, annexation, share-holding,
purchasing, auction and bankruptcy, the restructuring of the
operation mechanisms of state companies will be strengthened so as
to make the best use of their current assets.
</P>
<P>
In the process, the commanding role of the market and the
guiding and driving forces of the government will be better
combined. With approval and coordination of relevant departments,
state assets can flow freely between different enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Those heavily-indebted and inefficient enterprises can be made
to turn out new products, have their debt burdens reshuffled by
means of coordination, merging, entrustment, and the auction of
debt ownership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a property right transaction market, which features
annexation, purchasing and leasing, will be nurtured in order to
promote the flow of state assets. In case of annexation and
bankruptcy, the bottom-line living expenses of laid-off workers
must be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
More efforts will be put to the establishment of a modern
enterprise system characterized by more efficient and scientific
internal management, the separation of government administration
from enterprise management, and less burdens piled up in the
enterprise's history.
</P>
<P>
Some qualified enterprises can raise money by issuing stocks
and setting up specific funds so as to improve their balance
sheet.

<HEADLINE> US Congressman Advocates Sino-US Talks and Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A US congressman said here today
that China and the United States need talks, mutual understanding,
and high-level contacts to remove their differences.
</P>
<P>
US Congressman Curt Weldon made the remark in a speech at the
Lincoln Lectureship. He came to the Fudan University at the
invitation of the university's president Yang Fujia.
</P>
<P>
Weldon said that the two countries have different social
systems and values, and there exist many differences. But the two
will finally find solutions to the differences as long as they
have frank talks instead of confrontation, mutual understanding
instead of suspicions, and maintain high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States often lacks the understanding
of views in other countries, especially in China. If American
decision-makers can know more about China's views on many issues,
the relations between the two countries will be more successful.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he also praised China for the policies to
maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and supported the
"one China" stand of the US government, and advocated that the two
sides cooperate to boost environmental protection with technology
from national defense research.
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln Lectureship was founded by the Lincoln National
Group, an insurance institution in the US, and Fudan University
last year. Every year, well-known scholars, politicians and
entrepreneurs are invited to make speeches.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Second Largest Oilfield Produces 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The daily output of the Zaire
oilfield, the second largest in Angola, has increased to the
present 10,000 barrels from 4,000 in March last year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Angolan Petroleum Minister Albina Assis
at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
She said, it is expected that the daily output of the
oilfield will reach 20,000 barrels in the near future because a
new oilfield at Kingula will soon be put into production.
</P>
<P>
Several foreign petroleum firms will come to the Zaire
oilfield to develop oil, she added.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry is the pillar of the Angolan economy
and oil is the country's major export. However, the petroleum
industry has been destroyed seriously during a 19-year-old
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country produces only 550,000 barrels
a day. enditem

<HEADLINE> Major Reforms in Economic Restructuring for 1997 Mapped out  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will cut investment in enterprises, so that they
can become fully adapted to market economy. Enterprises should be
encouraged to invest in profitable projects, while the government
puts more money in public projects and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the decisions of corporate executives will be
restricted by the risk of banking loans, and banks in turn will
have bigger decision-making power in providing loans while holding
responsibility for the risk of their loans.
</P>
<P>
To coordinate the reform of state-owned enterprises, the reform
of social security system, which mainly covers old-age pension,
medical care and unemployment, will be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
With regard to housing reform, houses will no longer be part of
welfare given to workers and government employees, who in the
future will have to pay a growing sum of rent, but with a certain
amount of subsidies at the same time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, public housing funds will be collected from all
work units.
</P>
<P>
The prices of commodity houses will be made more reasonable,
and banks will provide more housing loans to encourage more people
to buy houses.
</P>
<P>
In commodity circulation sector, concrete measures will be
explored to incorporate the grain purchasing prices of the
government and market prices. Meanwhile, the government will
be more capable of regulating and stabilizing the grain market.
</P>
<P>
As to cotton transactions, the form of cotton trade fairs will
be improved, in which cotton producers and buyers will have the
chance to hold face-to-face business talks.
</P>
<P>
And the government will boost the development of wholesale
markets, used goods markets, and store chains.
</P>
<P>
And in financial reform, the on-going revenue transfer system
and revenue-sharing system will continue to be implemented so as
to beef up the macro-control power of the central government.

could help stop fighting and start political dialogue between the
warring sides in Zaire, a French foreign ministry spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a Zairean government delegation and leaders of
the separatist Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire (AFDL) held their first meeting in Lome.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting yesterday, for the first time, of an official
Zairean delegation and the AFDL, is in itself a success that can
be credited to the Lome summit," French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt said today.
</P>
<P>
"The future of Zaire can only be conceived on the basis of
democratic institutions created by free and fair elections,"
Rummelhardt added.
</P>
<P>
The separatist AFDL have been fighting government troops in
southern Zaire since last October. In only five months, the AFDL
have seized a quarter of the vast African country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Curb Money Supply Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)
today pledged to step up efforts to control money supply growth to
contain inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The bank warned the inflation in Zimbabwe could derail one of
the most dramatic economic recoveries ever experienced since 1980.
</P>
<P>
RBZ Governor Leonard Tsumba, delievering his traditional
twice-yearly monetary statement in Harare, appealed for support from
the government to contain the runaway budget deficit, which is
expected to exceed 11 percent of GDP in the year to June 1997.
</P>
<P>
''Money supply growth will, therefore, have to be curbed. In this
regard, the out-turn for January 1997, which saw broad money grow at
a reduced rate of 23.9 percent, is a welcome development and a
movement in the right direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He added Zimbabwe's foreign reserves have plummeted from a high of
five months import cover last September to just three months cover
due to speculation and increased import demand.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's inflation would be around 19-21 percent by
June and below 20 percent for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
On economic performance, he said in 1997, the bank was forecasting
that real growth would be about five percent due to the generally
favourable 1996/97 agricultural season. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Economic Returns, Social Effects from Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today at a film forum that film-makers should produce more
and better films that depict socialist cultural and ethical
progress, and gain more economic returns while attaching
importance to the social effect.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and also member of the
Central Committee's Secretariat, said at the three-day forum which
ended today that film-producers and government departments at all
levels produced more films that carry forward socialist cultural
and ethical progress, and quite a number of them gained popularity
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Government departments have enhanced their leadership in the
field, conduct in-depth reform, and increased investment, Ding
noted, adding that "the general situation is good".
</P>
<P>
Ding said the Party pays great attention to the development of
films, and Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin has made
many remarks on it, saying that China should produce more fine
works and pursue film prosperity.
</P>
<P>
China is still short of excellent films, Ding noted, and the
film-making industry is still faced with difficulties and problems
that cannot be underestimated. Film-makers and officials should
redouble efforts to vitalize Chinese films, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ding underlined that films should have ideological contents,
artistry and should be appreciable and enjoyable. He pointed out
that film-makers should consider the market, gaining social
effects and economic returns at the same time.
</P>
<P>
And the film circle should continue to deepen the reform and
have a healthy development, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
The forum was held one year after the National Film
Conference. Participants studied the remarks of President Jiang
Zemin and the late leader Deng Xiaoping on films, exchanged their
experience and offered a lot of suggestions at the forum.

<HEADLINE> Russians Hold Nationwide Protest for Social Guarantees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- About 20 million Russians turned
out today to take part in a well-organized protest action under
the slogan "For work, justice and social guarantees."
</P>
<P>
The nationwide protest, initiated and organized by the
Federation of Independent Trade Union of Russia (FITUR) almost a
month ago, is held mainly to demand repayment of wage and pension
arrears, which are running at about 9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is ensure that the protest action result in the
breaking off the mechanism which is conducive to the emergence of
wage arrears," said FITUR leader Mikhail Shmakov.
</P>
<P>
During the nationwide protest, 7 million protesters are expected
to go on strike while the rest will march in demonstration or
participate in pickets and rallies.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today at a regular
meeting of the government that strikes and protest action of the
trade unions cannot solve problems.
</P>
<P>
The premier meanwhile pointed out that during the first three
months of the year real incomes of the population had increased by
4 percent from the same period of 1996 and the size of the
population whose incomes are below the subsistence level was
reduced by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Chernomyrdin stressed that "trade union strikes are a vivid
and objective indication of the acuteness of accumulated
problems."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Get Bumper Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean commercial farmers today
said they are predicting another bumper agricultural harvest this
season despite earlier concern about reduced output due to heavy
rains early this year.
</P>
<P>
In a report released in Harare, the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU)
Vice-President for Commodities Bob Swift said for example, total
output of the staple maize crop from all farming sectors was
estimated at two million tonnes, while 258,000 tonnes of seed cotton
were expected from both large and small scale farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said soyabean production was estimated at 95,000 tonnes in the
current season, which market experts said was slightly below forecast
by about 10-15 percent due to waterlogging caused by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Coffee production is forecast at 12,000 tonnes and at least 30 to
40 percent of the crop has been forward sold to take advantage of the
buoyant prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said winter wheat production was this year estimated to reach
300,000 tonnes, while a total of 15,000 tonnes of flowers and 13,000
tonnes of fresh produce was expected this year. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said here today that U.S. senators have no right
to annul Cambodian court verdict.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while talking to reporters about the case
of Prince Norodom Sirivudh at an alliance forming ceremony between
his Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the Khmer Citizen Party
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said "the whole U.S. senators cannot annul the verdict
handed down by a Cambodian court," referring to the fact that
three U.S. senators wrote to and pleaded him to allow exiled
Sirivudh return to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Sirivudh, former Cambodian Foreign Minister, was sentenced in
absent to 10 years jail on charges of plotting to kill Hun Sen and
illegal weapons possession last February. But he went into exile
in France before the trial.
</P>
<P>
"Even the King cannot pardon Sirivudh if the culprit has not
served in jail for seven years, two thirds of his prison term,"
Hun Sen said, adding that "Sirivudh must be jailed first."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen reaffirmed his insistence that royal family members
forgo their royal status if they seek office, suggesting the royal
family itself initiate a constitutional amendment to remove royal
family out of politics.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The 8th International Congress

</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Tanzania Public Health Asociation (TPHA),

will draw 800 participants worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Kilama said the participants to the congress will include health
practitioners, policy and decision-makers, academicians and NGOs.
</P>
<P>
He said the theme for this year's congress is "Health in
Transition: Opportunities and Challenges", adding that the theme was
chosen after realizing that there are many changes affecting human
health, either positively or negatively.
</P>
<P>
The congress among other things will also dwell on the rapid
urbanization in developing countries which is mainly driven by a
search for better life, employment opportunities and changes in
production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Kilama said current estimates indicate that by the year 2000,
the majority of the world population will be in urban centers and
at that time the essential social services will be greatly
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Other sub-themes to be addressed are health polcies and the
strategy of health-for-all through primary health care, environmental
and occupational health and linkage between health and human rights.

<P>
LOME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The extraordinary summit of the
Organization of African Unity ended here today, recommending to the UN
Security Council the setting up of a mechanism for the implementation
of the UN/OAU peace plan on Zaire.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here today at the end of the
meeting, the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution requested that the secretaries
general of the OAU and the UN to make nececcasry consultations to this
end.
</P>
<P>
The five-point peace plan on the Zaire crisis, adopted by the UN
Security Council, provides for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal
of foreign forces, negotiations and elections and the protection of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, attended by 30 African countries, reiterated
its grave concern over the deteriorating situation in the
Great Lakes region, especially the current armed conflict in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It called for immediate negotiations between the government of
Zaire and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Zaire-Congo so as to lead to a ceasefire and complete cessation of
hostilities to pave the way for the UN peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the OAU central organ authorized OAU
Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim to "establish contacts with
the leadership" of the Zairean rebels led by Laurent Kabila,
whose fighters are fighting against the government army in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
All types of foreign military intervention and the use of
mercenaries in Zaire were condemned by the central organ, according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The central organ also requested Salim to take appropriate
practical measures to assess the situation of refugees and displaced
persons in eastern Zaire and all other countries of the region.
</P>

All the parties to the conflict were urged to create safe and
secure conditions to faciliate the delivery of humanitarian and relief

conference on peace, security, stability and development in the Great
Lakes region under the auspices of the OAU and the UN, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
All the peace initiatives for resolving the Zaire conflict were
welcomed, but the central organ stressed the need to ensure proper and
adequate coordination of all these initiatives.
</P>
<P>
However, the delegation of the Zairean government for the summit
had reservations about a few points of the statement, including the
condemnation of the use of mercenaries in Zaire, the call for
immediate negotiations before a ceasefire, and the establishing of
OAU contacts with the rebel leadership.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which centered on finding ways to resolve the conflict
in Zaire, was attended by 30 African countries with the two warring

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today decided to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Military Observer Million in Liberia until June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the Security Council
emphasized that the holding of free and fair elections scheduled
for May 30 was an essential phase of the peace process in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the ultimate responsibility of Liberian people
for achieving peace and national reconciliation, the council urged
the international community to provide financial, logistical and
other assistance to the electoral process in Liberia, and to
provide additional support for the Economic Community of West
African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also urged all Liberian parties to
cooperate with the peace process, including by respecting human
rights and facilitating humanitarian activities and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Wang Xuexian said at the council today that
the final settlement of the Liberia issue depends on the Liberian
people only. Starting from the interests of the state and the
people, leaders of all Liberian parties should show their sense of
political duty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that China has always firmly supported the Economic
Community of West African States to solve the problems in the
region according to the United Nations Charter. Together with the
international community, China will make its own contribution to
earlier realization of peace and stability and ushering in a new
era of reconstruction and development in Liberia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Syria Denounces US Silence on Israeli Malpractices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President Abdul
Halim-Khaddam today criticized the U.S. silence on the Israeli
government's settlement moves.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the leaders of the ruling Syrian Arab Baath
Party, Khaddam indicated that extending political support by the
U.S. at United Nations for the Israeli settlement policy
constitutes a negative element in the peace process and weakens
the U.S. role as one of co-sponsors of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam apparently referred to the recent
start of the Israeli construction of 6,500 homes for the Jews in
Har Homa, also known as Jabal Abu Ghoneim in East Jerusalem, which
has aroused strong opposition from the Palestinians, Arab states
and other countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam reviewed the latest developments worldwide and their
repercussions on Arab interests and basic Arab causes at this
juncture.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that peace which fails to restore Arab lands is
no more than what he called a return to chaos and instability in
the Middle East. Any agreement that involves deception of the
Arabs, he said, will not be accepted by them and will have grave
repercussions on security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam praised the stance of the European Union on the peace
process which has urged Israel to commit to the terms of peace,
to withdraw from the Syrian territories up to the 1967 borders
and from all Lebanese lands, and to provide the Palestinian
people with the right of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
He called for the strengthening of Arab solidarity which will
serve as the solid grounds that guarantee Arab interests and the
restoration of Arab rights.

ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian former Deputy
Prime Minister Tamirat Layne today appeared in the federal
supreme court along with eight others alleged accomplices on

hurdles and demanded for payment.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat was accused of receiving 16 million U.S. Dollars from
Sheik Mohammed Al Amoudi and shared the money with his alleged
accomplices. Tamirat himself took 9 million of the 16 million
U.S. Dollars, according to the charge.
</P>

the company, ordered the sale of 1,000 tons of state coffee that
was sold for 3.6 million U.S. Dollars of which the former deputy
prime minister took 1.8 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The second charge leveled against Tamirat alleged he laid the
favorable condition for Ramis International Private Limited
Company to be the sole supplier of construction materials to four
regions. Tamirat was the head of the company and ordered the four
regions to buy construction materials from the company.
</P>
<P>
The third law suit filed against Tamirat said he unlawfully
helped Soja Contractor win a tender put in for the Mile-Assab
road project for which he was paid one million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat has voiced objections against the first and third
charges, saying he would present to the court his objections.
</P>
<P>
The trail was adjourned until April 15.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat was prime minister of the transitional government from
1991 to 1995. He became deputy prime minister and minister of
defense in August 1995. He was also president of the Amhara
National Democratic Movement and deputy chairman of the ruling

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States will cut the
number of U.S. Air Force personnel assigned to a base in turkey by
up to 50 percent in the next 18 months, the Defense Department
announced in a statement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said reduction of the 24,000 U.S. Air Force staff
permanently assigned to Incirlik would begin immediately, and is
expected to continue through September 1998.
</P>

The move "is part of the general realignment of U.S. bases in
Europe, in which more than 800 U.S. military installations have
been returned to European countries, reduced or place on standby
status, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government is not reducing its commitment to Europe
or Turkey," which "remains a vital U.S. ally and key regional
partner," the statement added.
</P>

Defense officials said the whittling down of U.S. troops
strength would not affect a separate operation at Incirlik for

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Rise to Near-Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned
homes in the U.S. increased by 9 percent in February to the second
highest level on record, the U.S. National Association of Realtors
said today.
</P>
<P>
The association said in a report that existing single-family
homes sold at a 4.26 million annual rate in the month, up from
3.91 million in January,
</P>
<P>
The level of sales in February was the strongest since last May
when existing homes sold at a record 4.28 million annual rate.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1996, the sale of previously owned home totaled 4.09
million, the best in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
By region in February, sales soared by 13.6 percent in the
West, 10 percent in the Midwest, 8.6 percent in the Northeast and
5.5 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing home was 117,500 dollars last
month, up by 3.1 percent from a year earlier. The median is the
midpoint, meaning half of the homes sold for more and half for
less.
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts said that the strong sale resulted from mild
temperatures, lower interest rates and health U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
However, with the U.S. Federal Reserve starting to increase
interest rates, many analysts are expecting a more moderate --
though still good -- rate of sales this year.

<P>
PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- France today called for an
exceptional meeting of the European Union (EU) countries to help
relaunch the Middle East peace process, which is now experiencing
another crisis.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
such a meeting should be held at the level of political directors
of the foreign ministries of EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The date for holding such a meeting has not been decided yet,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
France has also expressed its deep concern over the
comprehensive blockade of the Palestinian territories by Israeli
security forces, who have blocked all accesses into Israel and
Jerusalem from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, after a suicide
attack by a Palestinian militant on Thursday last week killed four
in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have intensified their protests after Israel
decided to build a new Jewish settlement in an Arab district of
East Jerusalem Israel has occupied since 1967.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross is on a mission in the
Middle East and has held talks with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Ross has asked Arafat to help defuse the tension between
Palestinians and Israelis, and stop Palestinian militants from
staging more attacks on Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
France said the Israeli blockade of Palestinian territories is
unfairly punishing the whole Palestinian people, has gravely
endangered Palestinian economy and has prevented Palestinians from
going to their places of worship in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"This is why France hopes that the Palestinians, whatever
their beliefs are, could have free access to all the holy sites of
Jerusalem," said the foreign ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette had a telephone
conversation with his Egyptian counterpart, Amr Moussa, this

<HEADLINE> Leading US Network Supplier Expands Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bay Networks, one of the major US
suppliers of computer networks, has made an cumulative investment
of two million US dollars in China since it inaugurated business
here in 1994, said a senior representative of the company.
</P>
<P>
David Shrigley, vice-president of Bey Networks, told a press
conference today that the investment will further increase in the
coming years, for "the appealing market potential that no company
can reject."
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, Bay Networks registered a
consecutive increase of 100 percent-plus annually in its business
income. Through the cooperation with China Construction Bank, one
of the country's largest commercial banks, Bay helped launch the
country's first frame relay network, which largely quickened the
data transmission in the computer system of the bank.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company provided model networks for two
national-level information network projects of the country, the
Golden Card, and Golden Customs Programs.
</P>
<P>
Shrigley said that the company is now seeking more extensive
involvement in China's information modernization drive, and will
expand the cooperation and exchanges with the domestic network
companies over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
So far, Bay has opened two representative offices in Beijing
and Shanghai, providing the country with the sophisticated network
products ranging from high-speed routers, ATM (asynchronous
transport mode) switching gear, to network management systems.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1994 through a merger between two US network
firms, Bay Networks now has more than 120 branchs and 1,000 sales
agents throughout the world. Its business revenues stood at two
billion dollars in 1996.

the economy, create jobs, cut red tape and provide foreign
companies with greater access to the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
The package is designed to reduce or revise a vast range of
regulations that foreign critics say impinge on fair
competition and serve as a barrier to trade with Japan.
</P>
<P>
It is the final part of a three-year program containing 2,823
measures to deregulate areas such as financial services,
communications, housing, distribution, transport, energy, labor
and education.
</P>
<P>
The government says it aims to set out clear-cut rules,
inspect whether they are observed and punish violations. It will
check progress in the autumn on the implementation of the
measures.
</P>
<P>
The package contains 890 new deregulatory steps,
including allowing brokerage houses to offer comprehensive
accounts from which public utility charges are automatically
debited, permitting construction of higher buildings in city areas
to create more living space, and lifting a ban on sales of vitamin
compounds at convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
Also among the items aimed at moving Japanese standards toward
international levels is a revision in industrial standards and
allowing more foreign lawyers to work in Japan.
</P>
<P>
A number of items are designed to reduce government
intervention in determining new entrants into certain industries,
such as taxis, domestic airlines and foreign currency
transactions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A fair to greet Hong Kong's
return to the motherland opened here today with Chinese Premier Li
Peng attending the ceremony.
</P>
<P>

significant, and said that it will help the mainland people know
more about Hong Kong and understand the great significance of
late Deng Xiaoping's principle of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>

the State Council and the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News
Agency, the fair systematically tells people from all walks of
life about Hong Kong's today and yesterday, the process of its
return to the motherland, the Chinese government's series of
principles towards Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's economic
achievements and social life.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Li said it is unprecedented to use the
principle of "one country, two systems" to peacefully settle the
Hong Kong issue, which is also the Chinese government's
constructive contribution to seeking ways to solve international
disputes in the world.
</P>
<P>
The goal for implementing the principle of "one country, two
systems" is to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintain its
long prosperity and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
A law to totally reflect the principle of "one country, two
systems" is the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, a national law. Not only Hong Kong, but all departments of
the Communist Party, government and army, all social organizations
and the people throughout the country should completely abide by
this law.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return constitutes the first important step in the
reunification of the motherland and will play an exemplary role in
Macao's stable transition and smooth return and even in the
settlement of the Taiwan issue, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets US House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that disputes should not impact the development of Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark here this afternoon when meeting with
Speaker of the US House of Representatives Newt Gingrich and his
delegation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the number of US Congressmen visiting China is on
the rise annually, which is conducive to enhancing mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US delegation has fully exchanged views with
China's National People's Congress (NPC) on setting up long-term
contacts and exchanges, which the Chinese government supports.
</P>
<P>
Li recalled that former US President Nixon opened the door of
Sino-US relations during his term, and the two countries
established diplomatic relations during Carter's term as US
President. He expressed the hope that US Republicans and Democrats
present at the meeting can make their contributions to the
improvement and development of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the US is the largest developed country and China
is the largest developing country, Li said that if China and the
US can maintain a stable and normal relationship avoiding
confrontations and strengthening dialogue and cooperation, it will
be not only in the fundamental interests of the two countries, but
also an important contribution to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that China and the US have both common points
and differences, and both should carry forward the common points
and resolve the differences through dialogues and contacts.
</P>
<P>
It does not matter if the differences can be solved at the
moment, Li said, adding that both sides should learn to seek
common ground while reserving differences, and do not let the
differences hinder the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China abides by an independent foreign policy of
peace and it needs a long peaceful international environment,
especially a good relationship with its neighbors for its economic
construction, which is the key task for China.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that China adheres to a policy of good-neighborly
friendship and is enjoying good cooperative relations with all its
neighbors, Li called the so-called "China threat" as groundless,
saying that such assertion shows an ignorance or misunderstanding
about China.
</P>
<P>
China threatens no one, and does not seek "spheres of
influence", Li pointed out, noting that China is an important
factor for safeguarding world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War, Li said, although the international
situation moves generally towards relaxation, the world is not yet
peaceful because there are still occurrences of regional
conflicts and other disputes, and peace and development are facing
many challenges.
</P>
<P>
Citing the world as a diversified one, Li said that every
country has the right to choose its own social system and
development mode.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his admiration for China's economic achievements,
Gingrich said that the delegation includes both Republicans and
Democrats, and they have come to enhance mutual understanding and
better US-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that bilateral relations have had a great development
since the two sides signed the Shanghai Communique in 1972,
Gingrich said that if the US and China can build a stronger
relationship in the next century, it will make a great
contribution to the whole of mankind.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that through contacts here, members of his
delegation have a better understanding about China's domestic and
foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he does not believe that China will threat other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun attended
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Attends Film Premiere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- President and Chairman of the
Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin today attended the debut
ceremony of a new film in the Great Hall of the People, and
congratulated the shooting crew for their success.
</P>
<P>
The film, named "A Great Turn", is about the history of the
People's Liberation Army's (PLA) turning from the strategic
defensive to strategic offensive during the War of National
Liberation (1945-1949).
</P>
<P>
Former leader Deng Xiaoping who died last month, was then the
political commissar of the Second Field Army then, and he played
an important role in the "Great Turn".
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission
and member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee, delivered a speech at the ceremony,
citing Deng as a military strategist and saying the film shows
Deng's brilliant image s .
</P>
<P>
He also said that Deng's staunch and revolutionary spirits as
well as his love for the people reflected in the film should be
learned by every PLA soldier today.
</P>
<P>
"All actions of the army should submit to the leadship of the
Party with Jiang Zemin at the core, and the PLA should always
belong to the Party, the people, and the socialist country," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Interviewees Refute Involvement in US Political Donations (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ma Zehua, entrusted by COSCO, made a formal statement that
COSCO is an enterprise group engaged in normal operations in the
world and never participates in any funding of the political
activities of any party, units or individuals. The so-called
COSCO's involvement in "political donations" is groundless
vilification.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we lodge a strong protest and reserve the right to
take any measures to protect the interests of the company against
any harms that have been done to the company," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The three interviewees all mentioned that the 25-year history
since the resumption of trade between China and the United States
has shown that it is in the interests of the people of both
countries for the economic and trading circles of the two
countries to increase exchanges and cooperation and advance the
the bilateral relations under the principle of equality, mutual
benefit, and compensation of each other's needs.
</P>
<P>
Good bilateral relations will provide a sound environment of
cooperation for the enterprises of the two countries to promote
the economic and trade cooperation, they said. The essence of
China's so-called involvement in "political donations" is that a
handful of people attempt to place new obstacles and undermine the
development of the Sino-US relations by taking advantage of some
anti-China forces and news media in the United States.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that all the people of insight will
resist the evil innuendos.
</P>
<P>
It is an irreversible historical trend for the improvement of
the Sino-US relations and further development of the economic and
trade relations between the two countries, and any attempt to harm
the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries will
never succeed, they said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Buy South African Attack Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will purchase the
Rooivalk attack helicopter from South Africa as part of its
efforts to strengthen its air force.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Malaysian Air Force needs eight such aircraft under
its modernization plan, the Malaysian national news agency
reported today quoting Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of aircraft to be purchased would only be
determined after negotiations between the government and the
manufacturer Denel Group, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia needed to look at its financial strength
before it could say how many it was going to buy.
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably purchase eight aircraft but it all depends on
the negotiation of the whole deal and this includes transfer of
technology if possible," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia set its eye on the Rooivalk during a helicopter
exhibition -- the Heli Asia show -- here last November, the report
said, while adding that Malaysia agreed to purchase the attack
helicopter after South African President Nelson Mandela's visit to
Malaysia early this month.

<HEADLINE> New Political Party Formed in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A new political organization,
the United Peace Party (UPP), was formed in the Somali capital
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The members of the party are mostly intellectuals,
businessmen, artists and youth.
</P>
<P>
UPP Chairman Abdi Muhumad Amin, a popular play composer in
Somalia, told reporters here today that the UPP is not a clannish
or regional-based party and it will work on the basic principles
of improving the Islamic religion.
</P>
<P>
Amin said his party maintains sympathizers of the two
warring parties in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to the UPP Constitution, the party is designed to
promote peace in the wartorn Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
The UPP is not armed and opposes the use of all kinds of
weapons for securing a political position and power, Amin said.
</P>
<P>
Amin added his party considers the unity and territorial
integrity of Somalia as sacred and non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Amin declared his party will play a major role in the
reconciliation between the warring parties in Somalia and in the
reconstruction of the country.
</P>
<P>
The party opposes the tribal-based theories and the clan
discrimination, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first non-armed political party in Mogadishu since
the last ruling political party of Somalia, the Somali Youth
League, was overthrown by Somalia's late dictator, Mohamed S.
Barre, in 1969.
</P>
<P>
Amin has composed many plays since l991 when a civil war broke
out in Somalia. Most of his plays speaks for the possible ways
of making peace in the country. Some of his plays were put on
display during meetings by Somalia's armed factions in Addis
Ababa and Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Amin is the composer of the well-known play "Land Cruiser"
performed during the last months of late Siad Barre's regime in
Mogadishu. The play accused the late regime of buying expensive
vehicles such as Land Cruisers and begging maize from donor
countries. The play attracted all the Somalis. However, Amin
gained deep animosity from the Siad Barre regime, which was
hunting him even during its last days in power in 1991. Enidtem

<HEADLINE> Interviewees Refute Involvement in US Political Donations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- In a recent period, the media in
the United States have been spreading the news about China's
alleged involvement in political donations to the Democratic
National Party.
</P>
<P>
To verify the truth and notify the world of facts, Xinhua
reporters has conducted interviews with responsible persons of
the three units mentioned in the media reports, namely, the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the China
International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), and the
China Ocean Shipping Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The US media claimed the three units have been involved in the
case of political donations. By doing so, they are taking aim at
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jun, president of the CITIC, told Xinhua that the US media
has recently fabricated some slanderous stories about CITIC and
himself. "These stories maliciously distorted the facts occuring
during my tour in the US this February, saying that I participated
in the activity concerning the illegal political donations to the
US president. I deem it is necessary to clarify this," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, from February 2 to 9, 1996, as president of
the CITIC, he visited the US at the invitation of the Lehman
Brothers Company of the US. The main purpose of the tour was to
acquaint himself with the US bond market and also US investors'
attitude toward the Asian market, particularly, the Chinese
market, as the CITIC hopes to maintain sound and cooperative
relations with US investors.
</P>
<P>
Wang's agenda included a meeting with the late Ron Brown,
secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce. In the interview,
the Chinese side mainly explained the CITIC's business operations,
and hoped to expand the Sino-US trade, especially the CITIC's
imports from the US.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, the CITIC has not only set up its
sound cooperative relations with the US economic community, but
also maintained friendly exchanges with well-known figures who
took positions in the US political circle. The CITIC has worked to
promote the economic and technological cooperation and exchanges
between China and the US.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
with three Senators from the United States here today, saying that
the maintenance and development of a healthy and stable Sino-US
relationship is not only beneficial to the economic growth and the
people of the two big countries, but also to the peace and
development of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to witness that more and more members of the US
congress are supportive of developing relations with China," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang met with Senators Connie Mack, James Jeffords and Joseph
Lieberman in Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Chinese central
government.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the guests on the Chinese government's policy on Hong
Kong, he said that the government will ensure "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and high degree of autonomy in the region
under the principle of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Mack said that on his first trip to China, he and the other
senators are deeply impressed by the country's economic
achievement.
</P>
<P>
He said that he fully understands the significance of Hong
Kong's return to China. He wished the region stability and
prosperity in the future.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said that there is a growing number of US
congressmen, regardless of their party, who believe that the
Sino-US relations will be the most important bilateral relations
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have good reason to develop a sound bilateral
relationship and make it a stable and constructive one, he added.

<P>
"Before I visited the US this time, I had no plan to meet with
President Clinton. After my arrival in Washington, I was told at
the last moment that there would be the possibility for me to meet
with Clinton. Because my agenda was so tight at that time, and I
did not have anything to say to him, so I politely declined (the
invitation)," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, on an occasion when a lot of people were present,
Wang met with President Clinton informally. "Both sides referred
to no other topics except expressing greetings to each other," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is sheer nonsense that some US reports described this
meeting as something to do with the political donations case, Wang
said seriously. "I always talk about business affairs as a
businessman should do, and never take part and meddle in other
country's internal affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also mentioned a case concerning the smuggling of 2,000
AK-47 automatic rifles which occurred in the US last year. Some
people in the US purposedly imposed the charge upon the Poly
company whose president is Wang.
</P>
<P>
And now, after one year has passed, they again connected the
case with his meeting with Clinton as well as with the alleged
political donations. This action was intended to make a false
charge against and frame him, and was done with ulterior
motives.

<P>
Poly began to export guns for civilian use to the U.S. from the
end of 1984 while strictly abiding by the relevant Chinese laws
and regulations on management of gun export and the
U.S. regulations on gun import, Wang Jun said.
</P>
<P>
All goods exported to the U.S. had import certificates issued
by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, under the U.S.
Department of the Treasury. Poly never undertook business which
might violate both Chinese and U.S. laws, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President issued a decree to ban importing guns for
civilian use from China in 1994. Poly immediately stopped the
business, withdrew the company's office in the U.S., and has since
never exported a single rife or a single bullet to the U.S., he
added.
</P>
<P>
Wang held that China's related authorities have made a serious
and overall investigation into the so-called gun-smuggling case
since it was disclosed last year.
</P>
<P>
"I can say responsibly that the case has nothing with Poly
Technologies Inc. and its staffers," he said. "Actually, it was
some Americans who registered a company with a name similar
to 'Poly' after Poly withdrew its office in 1994, and got a person
who was fired by Poly many years ago involved in."
</P>
<P>
"Such deeds are illegal not only in the U.S., but also in
China. I do believe there will be a fair judgment of this case,
and truth will finally prove that the case has nothing to do with
Poly," Wang told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I would solemnly declare that I have never visited the U.S. or
met with U.S. President Clinton for the purpose of Poly's
business. CITIC, Poly and I myself have never got involved in the
so-called political donations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am strongly indignant at some reports appeared in the
U.S. news media, which have severely damaged the reputations of
CITIC, Poly and mine," he said. "If necessary, we will resort to
laws for resolution."

<P>
During his interview with Xinhua, Zheng Hongye, former chairman
of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade
(CCPIT), expressed great indignation at some US news media's
groundless fabrications and vilification that the council was
involved in the case of "political donations".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that those people harbored ulterior motives and
resorted to mean tricks, and their acts could only be regarded as
attempts to undermine Sino-US relations and the growth of Sino-US
economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that he headed a delegation of Chinese enterprises
to the United States in March 1995 at the invitation of the
American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
As usual, it was purely a business trip, he said. Johnny Chung,
president of the Automated Intelligent System Inc. of the United
States, hinted to Zheng that he could arrange a meeting between
the delegation and the US president.
</P>
<P>
"Being the CCPIT chairman," Zheng said, "It is beneficial and
in line with the international practice to take the opportunity to
express Chinese entrepreneurs' views and wishes of cooperation to
the US government leaders when the Sino-US trade relations were at
a low ebb."
</P>
<P>
The delegation met with President Clinton on March 11 after
Clinton's weekly national broadcast speech. Zheng conveyed to
Clinton the hope of Chinese economic and trade circles that there
could be a good trading and investment environment for the growth
of Sino-US economic and trade relations.

<P>
That was all about the matter, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
"We never paid Mr. Chung any fees," Zheng said sternly and with
the force of justice. "There is no such thing as providing
political donations through Mr Chung or someone else. We hope that
those who have ulterior motives stop such mean tricks to distract
attention and put the blame on others, and give up attempts to
make trouble for and undermine the steady improvement of Sino-US
relations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some US news media dragged the renting of a wharf in
Long Beach by the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) into the
issue when fabricating the news of "political donations".
</P>
<P>
Since the news media have made distorted reports on the legal
operations of the COSCO, Cosco America Inc. President Ma Zehua noted,
it is necessary to clarify the real situation.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that COSCO started to rent the Long Beach Port back in
1981. With the growth of the Sino-US trade, the turnover of the
COSCO's containers increased and its liners stopped at western
American ports three times a week.
</P>
<P>
To develop the business better still, according to Ma, COSCO
planned to rent a container wharf in the regions of Long Beach or
Los Angeles. Having made surveys for a long period of time and
conducted feasibility surveys of some ports in southern
California, Cosco America Inc. signed an agreement to rent a
closed former navy wharf in Long Beach with the port
administration on April 14, 1994. The agreement officially took
effect on November 15. The negotiations were conducted through
lawyers and agreed to the laws and legal procedures of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the agreement, the Long Beach Port had already started
planned development of the wharf facilities.

<P>
MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today said he has directed the Labor Department to forge bilateral
labor agreements with various countries to protect the welfare and
rights of Filipino Overseas Workers.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said during an inspection tour to the Subic Bay Freeport
that he was optimistic that labor accords will soon be reached
with the countries hosting overseas Filipinos following the
signing of the Philippines-Qatar Labor Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The labor accord which forged on March 9 during Ramos' state
visit to Qatar was the first ever between the Philippines and a
Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Qatar and the Philippines will lay down
the necessary rules and regulations on the implementation of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also stipulates that recruitment of workers from
the Philippines, their entry into and employment in Qatar will be
regulated by relevant laws, rules and procedures of the two
countries.

<P>
The President said he has already tasked the Department of
Labor and Employment to make sure similar agreements to be forged
with other countries to ensure the well-being of overseas
Filipinos.

He added that the government will not stop searching for ways
and taking advantage of every opportunity to give every Filipino
expatriate worker the full protection he deserves.

worker would be dealt with expeditiously through the mechanism of
the labor accord between the Philippines and the country hosting
overseas Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> OIC Expresses Support for Mideast Peace, PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Jerusalem Committee of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) affirmed its support
to the Middle East peace process and the Palestinian National
Authority, according to reports reaching here from Rabat, the
capital of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique released at the end of the 16th session
of the committee in Rabat Thursday evening, the Jerusalem
Committee headed by Morocco's King Hassan condemned the Israeli
measures obstructing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged Islamic countries to reconsider their
relations with Israel, including the closing down of offices and
the suspension of missions, until Israel abided by
U.N. resolutions and implemented agreements signed between the
PNA and Israel in accordance with the Madrid peace conference and
the Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
The communique called upon the international community to
oblige Israel to adhere to peace accords with the Palestinians
and to resume negotiations with Syria from the point reached
before suspension.
</P>
<P>
It also condemned Israel's persistence in its settlement
policies in Jerusalem and other occupied Palestinian and Arab
territories.
</P>
<P>
It called for an immediate cessation of construction works in
Jebel Abu Ghneim, or Har Homa in East Jerusalem and all other
measures aiming to change the political, geographic, legal
and historic status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It called upon OIC Secretary General Izzidine Iraki to
undertake necessary contacts with international and regional
organizations and specialized agencies to study ways and means to
preserve the historic, cultural and religious heritage of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The committee reaffirmed in the communique that the city of
Jerusalem constituted an inseparable part of the occupied
Palestinian territories in 1967, adding that Israel has to pull
out from these territories in accordance with international
legitimate resolutions and the land-for-peace principle which
demand Israel withdraw from all Palestinian and Arab
territories occupied during 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The committee called once again for the restoration by the
Palestinian people of their firm and irrevocable national rights,
including their right to return home, self-determination, and the
establishment of their independent state on their national soil
with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
It also called on Israel to release Palestinian prisoners and
to lift the economic siege imposed against Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The 16th session of the OIC Jerusalem Committee began in Rabat
Thursday evening at foreign ministerial level. PNA President
Yasser Arafat attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Committee is an offshoot of the OIC, which
includes the PNA, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco,
Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Pakistan, Niger, Mauritania,
Guinea, Iran and Indonesia.

BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Adham Sharara is
expected to challenge Chinese Xu Yinsheng as president of the
International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).
</P>
<P>
Sharara, first vice president of the ITTF, will very likely bid
for the top position at the table tennis ruling body, Xu said here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Sharara has once told me he will publicize an open letter to
inform all continental table tennis federations that he won't bid
for ITTF president at the ITTF Congress during the world
championships in Manchester, but I haven't received this letter,"
said Xu, who succeeded deceased president Lollo Hammarlund in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I assume that he will challenge me," added Xu.
</P>
<P>
Sharara, also general-secretary of the Canadian table tennis
association, is in charge of the sport's marketing in the ITTF.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champs Lead Chinese Team in Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Olympic double medalists Liu
Guoliang and Deng Yaping are going to lead a 25-member Chinese
team in the World Table Tennis Championships starting on April 24
in Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team comprises 12 men and 13 women players. The
backbone of the Chinese men's squad is formed by Liu Guoliang,
who last September added World Cup title to his two Olympic
titles, world No. 1 and defending world singles champion Kong
Linghui, defensive player Ding Song and veterans Wang Tao and Ma
Wenge, said team chief Li Furong.
</P>
<P>
Ma, Wang and Ding combined to lift the men's team trophy after
edging defending champions Sweden 3-2, kicking off a Chinese
clean sweep of seven titles in the 1995 championships in northern
Chinese city Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping, who has bagged 15 world titles and four Olympic
gold medals in her 10-year-long career, tops the Chinese women
team.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Deng, along with four youngsters -- Yang Ying
(world No. 4), Li Ju (No.6), Wang Chen (No.7) and Wang Nan
(No.9), will have a shot at the women's team top honor, said
coach Lu Yuansheng.
</P>
<P>
The oldest of the men's players is 30-year-old Wang Tao, who
has competed in four world championships and swept the doubles
and mixed titles in last two worlds.
</P>
<P>
The youngest are Ma Lin and Liu Guozheng, both 17. Liu caught
attention as he took the singles title in the Globe Youth
Championships in February. He has no connection with Liu
Guoliang.
</P>
<P>
Former world doubles champion Qiao Yunping, 29, is the oldest
player on the women's team. She has been called back from
Germany for her last national cap.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yinsheng, chief of the Chinese Table Tennis Association,
said it was impossible for the Chinese team to repeat a clean
sweep of the titles in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese men's players have no advantage over their
European and South Korean rivals," said Xu, also president of the
International Table Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
"Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner and Belarus' Vladimir Samsonov are
the top threats for the Chinese players," Xu added.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Waldner, who won Sweden's only gold medal in
the Barcelona Olympics, regained form at the Qatar Open in
February, where he took the singles event after leading Sweden to
the team top podium.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, 20, who has composure beyond his age, has beaten all
of the European top players to clinch the world No.3 ranking.
</P>
<P>
To upset the Chinese most, Samsonov has twice overcome the
Chinese "secret weapon" Ding Song, who jumped to fame after
ending the singles run of then world No. 1 Jean-Michael Saive of
Belgium and winning a crucial point in the team final at the
Tianjin Worlds.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars on Dalai's Taiwan Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Dalai Lama's so-called
"religious pilgrimage" to Taiwan island is a political crusade
under the guise of religion, and an activity to split the
motherland made by the forces advocating "Taiwan independence" and
"Tibet independence," two Chinese scholars said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Li Yihu and Xu Bodong, professors
from Beijing University and its branch school, said that as Hong
Kong will soon return to the embrace of its motherland, China's
reunification is the trend of the times and reflects the
aspiration of the people.
</P>
<P>
The separatist activities of the Taiwan authorities and the
Dalai clique will surely end in failure, as they are opposed by
the entire Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots and
compatriots of ethnic Tibetan group, the scholars emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Li said the Dalai Lama is not an ordinary religious
figure, but rather a political leader of the separatist forces in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's supreme ruler, is a political leader of
another form of separatist forces, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Lee Teng-hui and the Dalai Lama, held in
the name of "spiritual reform" and "humanitarianism," was actually
a coming-together of the two separatist forces in a move to change
their unfavorable situation, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Xu said the forces of "Taiwan independence" and "Tibet
independence" have similar concepts of splitting the country, and
the Taiwan authorities' purpose to collude with the Dalai Lama is
to challenge the peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they want to make use of the Dalai's international
connections to put forth their repeatedly blocked "pragmatic
diplomacy" and expand the international scope of the "Taiwan
independence" movement, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Taiwan authorities are catering to the need of
the anti-China forces worldwide to pave the way for further
collusion, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two scholars said, the Dalai's Taiwan trip is a
very dangerous step the Taiwan authorities has taken on its way of
splitting the motherland, fully exposing the Taiwan authorities'
real attempt to contend with the "one China" principle and
deteriorate the cross-straits relations, and the true feature of
the Dalai Lama who passes himself off as the religious figure.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Marks Its 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) today observed
its 50th anniversary, stressing its role and achievements over the
past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"As the main economic and social development center within the
United Nations system in the Asia and Pacific region, ESCAP plays
a multi-faced role as the only intergovernmental forum for the
exchange of national economic and social development views and
experiences," the ESCAP Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
"The commission also acts as a regional body for
policy-oriented socio-economic research and analysis as well as an
executing agency of technical assistance," the secretariat said in
a press release issued today.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP now has grown to embrace 60 member and associate member
countries from an initial membership of 10 countries, representing
some 60 percent of the world's population, it said.
</P>
<P>
Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of ESCAP, earlier this month
also noted: "the advent of the commission as an instrument to
assist in the reconstruction of war-torn areas must surely have
been a silver lining."
</P>
<P>
ESCAP was established on march 28, 1947, known as the economic
and social commission for Asia and the far east then. The name was
changed to ESCAP in 1977.
</P>
<P>
With the theme "50 years of achievement", the ESCAP is planning
to launch a series of activities, including a roving exhibition,
forums, visits to the ESCAP secretariat, and planting of a peace
pole in the U.N. conference center's garden here to mark its 50th
anniversary.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- American police confirmed on Thursday the "mass suicide" of
39 people in a villa north of San Diego, California. All the
victims belong to the Higher Source, a company of information
services specialized in the making of Web pages on the
Internet. Among the staff of the company there is a cult which
combined millenary beliefs with science fiction and
high-technological theories on a potential universe.
</P>
<P>
-- The Lome Summit of the Organization of African Unity on the
crisis of Zaire ended Thursday evening with an agreement between
the government and the rebels of Zaire to ``respect the principles
for ceasefire and negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after a long closed-door meeting
attended by delegates from the two conflicting sides of Zaire,
Togolese President Eyadema, U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan,
and U.N. Envoy for the Great Lakes Region Mohammed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>

ruling RPR party, has expressed his disagreement with the plan by
the leftwing and extreme leftwing parties to hold a large-scale
demonstration against the National Front (FN) on Saturday in
Strasbourg, where the FN will hold its 10th national congress.
</P>
<P>
Mancel said the best way to fight the FN is to explain to its
supporters that they are wrong to vote for the FN.
</P>
<P>
-- The Hale-Boop Comet passing nearby the earth recently could
have motivated the mass suicide of 39 cult people in southern
California, whose bodies were discovered Thursday by police.
</P>

of the bodies of five members of the cult group Solar Temple
Order.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- High speed is becoming a sign of
the times for China's highway, railway, and water transport
systems.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Communications show that China
now has 3,260 kilometers of expressways, compared with only 50 km
in the early 1990s. The combined length of high-grade highways,
with a designed speed of more than 80 km per hour, has reached
18,000 km.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the country's first expressway, from
Shenyang to Dalian, in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
started in 1984.
</P>
<P>
An express railway from Beijing to Shanghai, two large cities
in China, will have a designed speed of 250 km per hour, 50 km
more than the lowest international express standard, making the
entire journey 6.5 hours long, revealed Zhou Yimin, deputy
director of the Beijing-Shanghai Expressway Research Office of the
Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
The railway line will become one of the largest construction
projects for China in the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though China has no express railways at present, trains on the
three major lines of Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai, and
Beijing-Harbin will run at a per hour speed of 140 km as of next
week, sources say.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country has a quasi-express railway line from
Guangzhou to Shenzhen, in southern Guangdong Province. Trains on
the line run at 160 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The China State Shipbuilding Corporation says that more than
200 high performance vehicles are operating on over 70 water
routes in the country, covering the rivers of Zhujiang, Yangtze,
Huanghe (Yellow), and Heilongjiang, as well as Bohai Bay, the
Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The per hour speed of the ships reaches 60 to 70 km, above the
average travel speed of trains.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Administration of China predicts that
airplanes will carry 62 million passengers this year, a rise of
11.7 percent over 1996, and 38 planes will be added, bringing the
total number to 481.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the number of air travelers has
grown at an average speed of 16.3 percent. Last year, the number
of travelers handled by airliners for the first time exceeded 50
million.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev
said today that strengthening comprehensive cooperation with other
republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States will be one of
the priorities of Kyrgyzstan's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Supreme Council Wednesday, Akayev said the main
task of the Kyrgyz foreign policy is to constantly strengthen
bilateral and multilateral cooperation by which to create reliable
external conditions for national stability and security and
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The president said Russia is Kyrgyzstan's major strategic
partner and their relations have seen positive development since
1991.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation within the Central Asia Alliance also made new
progress last year. The alliance's member states will seek more
cooperation in trade, waterpower, transportation and customs in
the future, Akayev said.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, established in July 1994, groups Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Akayev invited other countries to join the alliance as
observers and promised to make efforts to promote the alliance's
integration.
</P>
<P>
He said the confidence-building treaty signed by China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in Shanghai last April and
the treaty on disarmament at the borders to be signed by the same
five countries in Moscow this April, will further deepen Kyrgyz
relations with China and benefit the two countries' cooperation in
other fields.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Refugees to Return Home in April: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- About 768,000 Liberian refugees
are expected to be repatriated from April on after improvement in
security in the western African country, according to an official
of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The move will require 60 million U.S. Dollars, among them 35
million Dollars to be used in Liberia and 25 million in the
refugee-hosting countries, said Alert-Alain Peters, a UNHCR
member and the director of Operations for Central, East and West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR is relaunching its comprehensive voluntary reintegration
program for Liberian refugees residing in various asylum
countries of the sub-region, he said, quoted by the Nigerian
Tribune today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, this followed the holding of a meeting in
Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, which brought together UNHCR
representatives from refugee-hosting countries, including Guinea,
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The process which begins in mid-April is expected to cover a
period of 18 months and UNHCR is in no business of "rushing
anybody back who does't want to come back home," he said in
Monrovia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has started visiting refugee camps in the sub-region to
allay the fears of refugees that the security condition has not
improved.
</P>
<P>
It will also encourage some leaders of these camps to come
home to assess the situation for themselves, then go back to tell
their people, the UNHCR official said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia-Singapore Bilateral Ties to Continue: </HEADLINE>

<P>
 Deputy PM
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today the Cabinet which met on
Wednesday decided that bilateral ties with Singapore will continue
but it will take time to restore the previous level of confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet regretted that some members of the Singapore
government "seem to lack insight and earnestness, even appear to
trivialize what is at issue," Anwar said in a statement issued
here today.
</P>
<P>
He said "the Cabinet in its meeting on Wednesday, March 26,
1997 discussed the events following the disparaging remarks on
Malaysia by Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew."
</P>
<P>
he said "the Cabinet feels, along with the Malaysian people,
that good neighborly relations are built upon the principle of
reciprocity, nurtured by mutual understanding and respect for one
another. We therefore regret that some members of the Singapore
government seem to lack in insight and earnestness, even appear to
trivialize what is at issue."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet reaffirmed its decision of March 19, 1997, to
accept the apology tendered by Lee Kuan Yew and reaffirmed that
Malaysia seeks to normalize relations with Singapore, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, such relations are a partnership. It is the quality
of the partnership that has been brought into question, naturally
it will take time and effort on both sides to re-establish
previous levels of confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first statement by the Deputy Prime Minister who
chaired Wednesday's Cabinet meeting to clarify what exactly the
Cabinet decision was.

<HEADLINE> HK Jockey Club Donates Funds to Help Prisoners' Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Jockey Club has
donated three million HK dollars (387,100 US dollars) to the
Correctional Services Department (CSD) to help hundreds of
prisoners to further improve their language skills.
</P>
<P>
The donation is to be used for building two language
laboratories at Stanley Prison and a multi-media language
laboratory at Lai King Training Center, a CSD spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Two language laboratories at Stanley Prison will be built at a
cost of about 1.6 million HK dollars (206,460 US dollars) and they
are scheduled to be completed within the next six months, he said.
</P>
<P>
The labs will enable 20 prisoners at a time to learn various
languages through audio-visual equipment.
</P>
<P>
The multi-media language laboratory at Lai King Training Center
that will accommodate 24 inmates per session is expected to be
completed in five months at a cost of about 1.3 million HK dollars
(167,700 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that most inmates admitted to Lai King
Training Center, which has a population of about 300, are
characterized by their low educational level, especially in both
Chinese and English language ability because of their early drop
out from school.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inadequacy in language ability is a major
hindrance for them to attain better chances of employment or
further schooling, which in turn makes it difficult for them to
lead a decent and industrious life after their discharge from the
center.
</P>
<P>
He said that a properly equipped language laboratory with
modern teaching equipment is considered essential in providing
inmates with proper language training.
</P>
<P>
Since its first donation of 130,000 HK dollars (16,774 US
dollars) in 1979, the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has
donated more than 31 million HK dollars (four million US dollars)
to CSD for the project.

<HEADLINE> OIC Head Calls for Support of Jerusalem Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) Izzidine Iraki called
Thursday night upon the OIC members to extend all forms of
consolidation and support to the Palestinians in their fight
against Israel over Jerusalem in view of the grave perils
befalling the holy city, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 16th session of the OIC Jerusalem Committee in
the Moroccan capital city of Rabat, he said the OIC members should
back the cause of Jerusalem "particularly that the coming phase
will witness the commencement of the final status negotiations
between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He asserted the need "to materialize the Islamic nation's
support of this top issue and to confront the settlement offensive
and the Judaization policy to which Jerusalem is being exposed."
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is engaged in a struggle against time to offset
Judaization, obliteration and forgery, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OIC chief underscored that the gravity of the situation
necessitated an official as well as popular stances and the
mobilization of Islamic moral and material potentials for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Israeli hardline government for trying to
isolate Jerusalem geographically, politically, economically and
socially by putting up barricades at the northern, southern and
eastern entrances, and prohibiting the entry of Palestinians
living beyond it.
</P>
<P>
Beside isolating the city internationally, the Israeli
government is denying foreign diplomats and officials the right to
visit the "Orient House", the Palestinian political symbol in
Jerusalem, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OIC Jerusalem committee, meeting in Rabat at foreign
ministerial level under the chairmanship of Moroccan King Hassan,
has concluded its works last evening.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Cut Taxes to Revive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz
today announced a downward revision of tariffs, income tax and
general sales tax rates as part of an economic revival program.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at the National Assembly during a
parliamentary meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) which was
chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The tax cuts had been done to revitalize the economy,
particularly the engine of growth of the industrial and export
sectors, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Revival Program, Aziz said, had the potential of
taking Pakistan out of the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is our own package and we are pleased that our new approach
package has been endorsed by the IMF (International Monetary Fund)
and will form the basis of negotiations on an ESAF (Extended
Structural Adjustment Facility) in the next few weeks," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the maximum tariff was being reduced from the
present 65 percent to 45 percent, except for imports like
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Describing the reform packages as "revolutionary steps," Aziz
said the number of tariff rates was being reduced from 13 to five.
</P>
<P>
The general sales tax (GST) would be cut from 18 percent to
12.5 percent. Items currently subject to 10 percent GST would
remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The package also included a drastic reduction in the personal
income tax and announcement of corporate income tax in advance for
public companies, other companies and banking companies for the
fiscal years 1997-98 and 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The export enhancement package, a central pillar of the
government's program for economic recovery, is the strategy for
export-led growth, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government was setting a target of doubling the total
dollars value of exports in three years, said Aziz. Measures are
being taken to remove biases against exports by cutting duty on
import of machinery for export-oriented industries to 10 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials and machinery are to be made available to
exporters at international prices and raw materials used mainly
for export are being zero-rated, according to Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Duty drawback payments would be made within 14 days instead of
30 days at present. The government was revamping the 1981 export
houses scheme to facilitate export by small and medium-sized
enterprises, he said.

</P>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif today vowed to root out corruption and poverty in the
country, although these objectives cannot be achieved overnight.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliamentary meeting of the Pakistan Muslim
League (PML-N), Sharif urged party members to place confidence in
the economic revival program.
</P>
<P>
By implementing the program, Pakistan would be pulled out of
the current economic crunch which is evident in all spheres of
life, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace would return, and sectarianism would be controlled.
These are the problems which arise when people are faced with a
difficult economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"But these objectives would be achieved over a period of time
and not overnight. We would need full cooperation of our allied
parties to realize these goals," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not discriminate between the members of the
National Assembly and the Senate though the latter has no say in
passing the budget or in financial matters.
</P>
<P>
"But it will always be my endeavor to take the members of the
Senate into confidence before presenting such affairs before the
National Assembly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz later presented the economic
revival program which was approved by the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China Shows Deep Concern for Middle East Situation: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cui
Tiankai said here today that China is deeply concerned about the
difficult situation in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Cui said that Israel, disregarding the opposition from the Arab
nations and the international community, has recently insisted on
the establishment of Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Israeli conduct "has brought about
increasing tensions in the Palestine-Israel relations and more
violence," and the peace process is now "faced with difficulty."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government is deeply concerned and worried about
the Middle East peace process," Cui noted.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the Chinese government has all along actively backed
the Middle East peace process. It holds that all the parties
concerned should abide by the related UN resolutions, and seek a
fair and reasonable solution to the Middle East issue at an early
date through political negotiations and in the spirit of "land for
peace," Cui said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only in the fundamental interests of the peoples
of the Middle East countries," the spokesman said, "but also
conducive to peace, stability and development of the region and
the world as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"In order to create a favorable atmosphere for the continuous
development of the peace process, we demand the Israeli Government
cancel the plan to expand the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem,
and all the parties concerned earnestly carry out the agreements
that have been reached," Cui stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, is willing to work with the international community to
deliver thorough, fair peace in the Middle East at an early date.

It was reported that police and bank officials received a

the case.

There are a number of bank frauds reported every year in

Copperbelt police chief Alexander Makayi said that bank cases

BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A high school to offer both
Chinese and western-style courses will open this fall in the
Chinese capital, enabling students to experience differences
between the two cultures.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Concord College of Sino-Canada plans to include in

</P>
<P>
The school, the first of its kind in Beijing, is scheduled to
open in September, when it has both Chinese and Canadian teachers
and students in the classrooms together.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien recently conveyed their congratulations to the
establishment of the school.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the school to play a new role in promoting
educational and cultural exchanges between two countries," said
Lan Weimin, who is in charge of the establishment of the school.
</P>
<P>
The school was jointly launched by the Experimental High School
affiliated to Beijing Normal University, the Advanced Education

investment group.
</P>
<P>
"We'll offer courses mainly in line with China's education
outline, while still following some useful practices of the
Canadian education system," Lan said.
</P>
<P>
In the school, located in Beijing's suburban Tongxian County,
students will also undertake eight-month or two-year vocational
education after they complete their three-year high school studies.

And they will be granted mutually-recognized Chinese and
Canadian diplomas, Lan said.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The primary food shortage
findings by the World Food Program (WFP) has revealed that food
scarcity in Tanzania is more serious than it was reported earlier
by the government, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The WFP representative here, Irene Lacy told Minister for
Agriculture and Cooperatives Paul Kimiti here on Wednesday that
3.9 million people need food in one way or another while the
early report indicated only 670,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Lacy said the selected committee which visited 12 regions
found out that while some people could buy the food, it was not
available; there were also those who could not afford to buy the
food but could work for it, and there were those who cound'nt do
both and needed emergency food.
</P>
<P>
She said among the 12 regions visited, 11 regions needed the
food support immediately and the Arusha and Lindi regions were
considered to be more critical than the rest.
</P>
<P>
The total relief food requirement is estimated at 30,000 tons
of maize and 3,000 tons of beans, she said, warning that high
food prices in the regions are causing severe hardships to the
people and that efforts are needed to encourage traders to
release maize at reasonable price in order to establish market
peace for both maize and beans.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the report, Kimiti said the government has
stocks of maize ready to be sent to the markets but there is no
fund to deliver the food.
</P>
<P>
The 12 regions visited by the selected committee are Arusha,
Mwanza, Mara, Shinyanga, Kilimanjaro, Tanga, Mtwara, Lindi,
Singida, Dodoma, Tabora and Morogoro.

<HEADLINE> Japan Announces Deregulation Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan announced Friday a package
of revised measures to deregulate rules which are blamed for
preventing a vigorous expansion of the economy and the creation of
new business.
</P>
<P>
The revised package is the final installment of a three-year
program containing 2,823 measures to deregulate areas such as
financial services, communications, housing, distribution,
transport, energy, labor and education.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and domestic businesses complain that red tape in
Japan has been suffocating the economy.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has said that his
government is committed to cutting red tape to boost the fragile
economy because it is making Japan less attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,823 measures, only 890 are new. The rest have been
invoked in some form by government departments.
</P>
<P>
Included in the revised package are measures to ease rules on
foreign currency transactions in Tokyo and in Japanese stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, financial institutions will be allowed to
set up branches wherever they wish, and stockbroking fees will be
liberalized.
</P>
<P>
And the package will permit construction of higher buildings
in city areas to create more living space, loosen rules on private
job agencies and allow firms to enter Japan's telecoms market.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Zairean government
soldiers have joined the remnants of the Allied Democratic Forces
(ADF) rebels in western Uganda, the New Vision paper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Citing an intelligence officer in Ugandan army on Tuesday, the
paper said the Zairean soldiers have arrived in Rwenzori
Mountains in western Kasese district, settled down and joined the
ADF.
</P>

arms and ammunition.

The 200 Zairean soldiers are believed to be survivors under
offensives of Banyamulenge rebels in eastern Zaire and to be
still loyal to Mobutu Sese Seko, the ailing Zairean president.
</P>
<P>
The main forces of ADF were annihilated since it crossed into
western Uganda last November, and its remnants split into small
groups scattering in the west and southwest of Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Buy Vessels to Strengthen Coast Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey plans to spend about 250
million U.S. dollars on purchasing a large number of patrol boats
and navy helicopters in an effort to strengthen its coast
defense.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted military sources as
saying that the proposals for buying six speedboats were being
studied by Turkey's Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey has a plan to import 14 large coast guard
vessels, according to the unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Turkey also intends to jointly produce
such boats with a foreign company in one of the Turkish
shipyards. However, it fell short of mentioning the shipyard by
name.
</P>
<P>
The sources told the paper that a number of navy helicopters
would be bought in order to provide air support for the vessels,
adding some foreign firms had presented their proposals to the
SSM.
</P>
<P>
According to these sources, Sikorsky's S-76 model, Eurocopter's
Dolphin and Augusta-Bell's helicopter are highly competitive for
the deal.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Coast Guard has long been handicapped by a lack of
well equipped boats to patrol Turkey's vast territorial waters
against increasingly rampant smuggling of illegal immigrants and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The latest series of arms deals are expected to help solve
this long-standing problem, sources added.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Pak Foreign Secretary-Level Dialogue Begins Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign secretaries of India
and Pakistan are resuming their dialogue here today, stalled since
January 1994, in a bid to normalize their relations.
</P>
<P>
The formal inaugural session is expected to start at Hyderabad
House, a state guest house, here this afternoon. Prior to the
dialogue, Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad will call on
Indian External Affairs Minister I. K. Gujral at his office.
</P>
<P>
There will be no formal agenda for the dialogue. Both India and
Pakistan have expressed their desire to improve their relations
through peaceful talks.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released to the press on his arrival
here Thursday evening for the four-day dialogue, Ahmad said, "It
is our belief that given the political will on the part of the
leadership of our two countries, time is propitious for us to
seize this opportunity for removing the root causes of tension
between India and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen at the airport, Ahmad said he looked forward
to "substantive and meaningful discussions" with his counterpart
Salman Haider. He said it was Pakistan's belief that determined
efforts must be made by the two countries to rid South Asia of the
existing tensions and hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Greeting his Pakistani counterpart at the airport, Indian
Foreign Secretary Salman Haider said, "We know there is a great
deal of expectations on both sides...We hope to engage ourselves
in a purposeful and constructive dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Since last year, political leaders of the two countries have
time and again expressed their desire and willingness to resume
their talks so as to normalize their tense relations and enhance
their exchange and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Since winning independence from Britain in 1947, India and
Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Now leaders of the two countries are beginning to realize that
the conflicts between them have drained the treasury and wasted
enormous manpower and resources and that the most pressing thing
to do is to solve their long-standing disputes through peaceful
talks so as to concentrate their efforts on economic development
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of Indo-Pakistani dialogue has been widely
welcomed by the people of India and Pakistan as well as by the
international community, and the move is generally perceived as
the best chance in three years to reduce tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have wasted more than five decades in animosities. The end
result is that those countries which were far behind us when
freedom came have gone ahead," Gujral said on the eve of the
talks.

<HEADLINE> a City in the Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- At first glance, Chongqing, the
new and largest municipality of China, may remind visitors of a
beautiful castle in the sky.
</P>
<P>
This is not only because this city of southwest China is built
almost entirely on hills, but also because of its modern
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
While in the past, wooden houses dominated the city scene,
tall, modern commercial and residential buildings now dot the
slopes, forming a skyline that can be seen in many other booming
cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Upon closer inspection, flower and vegetable gardens can be
seen on the rooftops of many buildings -- an innovative way of
solving the land shortage that adds a bright spot of vitality to
this industrial city of over 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing this month was separated from Sichuan Province to
become China's fourth municipality directly under the central
government. The total population of the municipality is over 30
million.
</P>
<P>
A modern sports ground for the Chongqing No. 29 Middle School
was built on the roof of a neighboring department store to end the
constant need to borrow sports areas for the students. The "sports
ground in the air" has three standard basketball courts, a track,
and a gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
The city also has traffic in the sky: apart from buses running
on the winding roads through the hills, transportation services --
which themselves have attracted thousands of tourists -- include
two aerial cable cars stretching across the Yangtze and Jialing
rivers which run through the city.
</P>
<P>
To appreciate the view from above at night, Chongqing people
suggest a trip to the top of Piba Hill, a local favorite, or a
visit to the Wudu Hotel where a tea house on its 24-story roof has
been built to serve night-viewers.

<HEADLINE> Mountainous Chongqing Features Unique Transportation Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Before arriving in Chongqing
for the first time, Ms. Yang of Shanghai imagined travel in this
mountain city would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
But soon she was thoroughly charmed by the unique and
convenient transportation services the city has to offer, and has
joined the growing multitude of visitors who feel traveling in
Chongqing is a special treat rather than a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
People leaving the Chongqing Railway Station no longer have to
climb up high stone steps to get to a street leading to the city
center -- a modern outdoor escalator now lifts passengers there in
just two and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It not only saves me a great deal of walking, but also serves
as a good way to sightsee," commented one traveler.
</P>
<P>
With a length of 112 meters and a slope of 30 degrees, the 150
million US dollar moving stairs are the longest of the kind over
hilly land in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Operational on February 18, 1996, the outdoor escalator not
only is a convenience for tourists who want to go to many tourist
attractions and the major commercial centers, but is also liked by
local residents.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, which this month was separated from Sichuan Province
to become China's largest municipality, is known to have one of
the hilliest topographical areas among large Chinese cities. But
unique travel opportunities are not limited to the
mountains: cross-river traffic on the Yangtze River and the
Jialing River running through the city is also diversified, as
people can choose between a ferry, an aerial cable or a cable car
to get back and forth.
</P>
<P>
The aerial cable across the Jialing River, which was put into
use in January of 1982, is the first large passenger in-air
cableway in China.
</P>
<P>
With a length of 714 meters, and two cars each capable of
holding 50 people, the cable transports an average of 10,000
people daily.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing section of the Yangtze River had its first such
suspended cable in 1987. At 1,166 meters long, the cableway has
two 80-passenger cars running dozens of meters high above the
river.
</P>
<P>
At the Chaotianmen Dock of the Yangtze River, a 140-meter cable
car has been running since 1984, taking passengers up to a slope
of 36 degrees to reach major streets. The price is a meagre two
jiao (0.20 yuan) -- a fraction of a penny -- per passenger.
</P>
<P>
Several such riverside cable cars are now in service.
</P>
<P>
Though Chongqing city proper has a population of over 10
million, its population of bicycle riders is the smallest among
large Chinese cities. However, it has no lack of modern means of
transport, such as buses, taxis, and minibuses.

<HEADLINE> New Municipality to Build Grand Square </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Chongqing has
started to construct a grand square, the first key infrastructure
item after the city was named the country's fourth municipality
directly under the central government.
</P>
<P>
The new project, the People's Square, includes the construction
of a 24,000-square-meter square and the renovation of the People's
Hall. It is scheduled to be completed on May 31.
</P>
<P>
Once finished, the square and hall will be the main public
gathering places for the local political and cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
The People's Square will be composed of three parts: the
granite-paved central space covering a T-shaped area of 7,000
square meters; the cultural space that includes a performing
platform and a rest area; and a grassland region with artificial
fountains and streams.
</P>
<P>
The People's Hall was built in 1951, but now is in need of
repair.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing residents have donated over three million yuan (about
357,100 US dollars) for the project.

<P>
HANOI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Prices for services and goods in

<HEADLINE> Seles Sails into Lipton Final against Hingis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles looked like the
Seles of old Thursday night when she sailing into the final of the
Lipton Championships, where she will meet Martina Hingis in a
showdown of once and future world number ones.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded Seles, playing her first tournament of the
year after being sidelined by a broken finger, destroyed
11th-seeded Austrian Barbara Paulus 6-1, 6-0 in 51 minutes to take
her place in the final.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Swiss teen sensation Hingis won a hard-fought
battle with third-seeded Czech veteran Jana Novotna 6-3, 2-6, 6-4
to stretch her perfect 1997 record to 25-0.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Hingis, who Monday will become the youngest
player ever ranked number one in the world, will be looking for
her fifth title of the year when she faces former number one Seles
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who was 17 when she first grabbed the top ranking six
years ago, held the previous record for youngest world number one.
</P>
<P>
The 14th-ranked Paulus and Seles were tied 1-1 in the first set
when the Yugoslav-born American pushed her game into high gear and
raced through the next 11 games without dropping another one to
the helpless Austrian.

<HEADLINE> Everton Drops Bid for Norwegian Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Everton withdrew their 3 million
pound (4.9 million US dollars) bid for two Norwegian players on
Thursday as the club was left reeling by the departure of manager
Joe Royle.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian side Brann Bergen on Wednesday rejected an offer of
2.5 million pounds for midfielder Claus Eftevaag and striker Tore
Andre Flo.
</P>
<P>
Everton came back with an increased offer but then withdrew it
three hours before Thursday's English league transfer deadline.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards Royle announced he was to leave the club "by
mutual consent."
</P>
<P>
The two players had come to Royle's attention during their
team's European Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final against Everton's
neighbours and great rivals Liverpool.

<HEADLINE> Writers Say Good-bye to Iron Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese writers have
forsaken the "iron bowl" system -- the former Soviet model under
which the state subsidizes writers for their entire life.
</P>
<P>
A contract system has been introduced into the literary circle,
mandating that a writer has to sign a contract with a literary
organization to obtain financial aid, sources said.
</P>
<P>
These organizations pay salaries or subsidies to the working
writers, but if the writers do not produce work, they will be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
There are thousands of writers' associations and arts societies
at different levels in China, a country that holds a sacred view
of culture and literature. Writing novels is a government-subsided
profession for many members of these associations.
</P>
<P>
The former system has come under fire by some critics who
believe it benefits lazy people: a writer can become famous
overnight for one short story, then can stop writing and live off
his short-lived success for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
The new system, although still regarded by some writers as a
"mud bowl" because it does not guarantee true freedom for writers,
is a sign of progress as it introduces competition, said Ji
Wenzhang, a writer.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei Literary Institute has signed agreements with 43
contracted writers in the past few years. Only half of them were
re-employeed when the contracts reached their terms.
</P>
<P>
Guan Renshan, a novelist, said that the new system forced him
to continue to write good works. "In the past, no matter if I
wrote or not, I received regular government payment. But now if I
stop writing, I will lag behind."
</P>
<P>
Many people agree that some booming coastal provinces are the
birthplaces of the contract-writer system.
</P>
<P>
As book remuneration is still very low in many cases, many
writers will have to depend on salaries given by literary
associations, while others have to write books in their spare time
and receive regular salaries from their work units.

<HEADLINE> Steel Giant Debuts in Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tangshan Steel Co. Ltd.
floated nearly 1.1 billion yuan-worth (about 132.5 million US
dollars) of new stocks Thursday, the biggest sum ever raised by a
listed company in Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The steel venture placed 120 million A shares in total, at a
per share value of 9.22 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Our company will use the funds raised for technical
renovations, and the completion of such projects will raise our
annual production capacity from the current 2.1 million to three
million tons," a company official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The steel company ranked tenth in China's steel industry last
year, but its annual profit came in sixth. Faced with the sliding
economic efficiency in the national steel-making sector last year,
the company realized 430 million yuan in net profit.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that golden opportunities still await
Chinese steel-makers, since the market demand for high-quality
steel has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
China has been importing steel since the 1980s, between 20 to
30 million tons annually.

VIENNA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security and

VIENNA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Commission on
Narcotic Drugs ended its annual session here today after deciding

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Toronto Stock Exchange
(TSE) today nose-dived nearly 200 points to post its biggest loss
in almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
The TSE 300 composite index lost 191.09 points to close at
5,931.75, the worst single-day loss since the collapse of the
North American stock markets in October 1987.
</P>
<P>
The TSE loss was followed by drops in three other stock markets
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges of Alberta, Vancouver and Montreal fell today by
3 percent, 4.7 percent and 3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The stock market freefall was triggered by the dumping of
almost 8 million shares of the troubled Bre-X Minerals Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The mining company resumed trading after a one-day suspension
during which it revealed its Indonesian gold mine could turn out
to be bust.
</P>
<P>
Bre-X lost 2.8 billion Canadian dollars (2.0 billion
U.S. dollars) in value as its shares fell from 15.50 dollars (11.3
dollars) to 2.5 dollars (1.8 dollars) in a matter of minutes,
dragging the company down with them.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian market was also hit by the fall on the Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrial average suffered its eighth-worst point
drop, falling 140.11 to 6,740,59, when the latest statistics

<HEADLINE> Nepal Needs Technology Transfer for Industrialization: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Nepal needs a transfer of
technology in many areas especially where the country has
export-oriented products with competitive advantages in the
international market, a senior government official said.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Devi Prasad Ojha told the opening of a
regional seminar here Thursday that Nepal, like most developing
countries, depends heavily on foreign countries for technology in
the country's industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
Nepal still has backward types of technology in some areas and
worse still, these outdated technologies are running in an
effective way, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on foreign technical experts to help improve Nepal's
existing technologies as Nepali technicians are familiar with them
and they can be handled at the local level.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar titled "Technological Capability Building
in Southeast Asian Region", was organized by the Royal Nepal
Academy for Science and Technology (RONAST) and was being attended
by about 45 experts from Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Consumer Prices Drop 0.2 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 28 (Xinhua -- Japan's consumer price index in
February fell 0.2 percent from the previous month, but was up 0.6
percent on the same month a year earlier, the Management and
Coordination Agency announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The month-to-month decline followed a 0.1 percent drop in
January.
</P>
<P>
The rise on a yearly basis was due partly to price rises in
fresh fruit and fish, rents and school tuition fees, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the consumer price index in Tokyo, a leading
indicator of nationwide inflation, rose 0.1 percent from February
but was unchanged from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
For fiscal 1996 ending March 31, consumer prices in Tokyo were
up 0.1 percent from the previous year, after falling 0.4 percent
in fiscal 1995, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal 1995 marked the drop of Tokyo's consumer price index
from year-before levels since the agency began to compile the
index in 1971.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1996, food prices rose 0.2 percent following a fall
of 1.5 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Clothing and shoe prices were up 0.3 percent after being flat
the previous year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The price of educational services rose 2.6 percent in fiscal
1996 after rising 2.2 percent a year earlier, while prices of
furniture and household products fell 3.0 percent following a
fall of 2.0 percent a year earlier.

</P>

</P>
<P>
In addition, the population under the age of 14 dwindled by
350,000 to 19.69 million, reflecting a growing trend in Japan of
marrying at a mature age and bearing fewer children.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by Metropolitan Tokyo show the city's

<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Panamanian
vice-president Ricardo Arias Calderon has strongly opposed the
idea of inviting Taiwan's Lee Teng Hui to attend the coming Panama
Canal Universal Congress.
</P>
<P>
The local press quoted Arias as saying the congress, to be held
here from September 7 to 10, would end in failure if the
Panamanian government insisted on inviting Lee.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal Management Committee decided on January 16 to
hold the congress.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of this international conference is to prepare for
the return of the canal's sovereignty to Panama at the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
According to treaties signed by the governments of Panama and
the United States in 1977, the United States must deliver control
of the Panama Canal to Panama and withdraw all its troops from the
Canal district no later than December 31 of 1999.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense
Secretary William Cohen today defended the missile agreement
reached by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin last week in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Navy League convention here, Cohen said that
Clinton gave up nothing by agreeing with Russia to ban space-based
theater missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, Clinton and Yeltsin reaffirmed the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, agreeing to share details of their
theater missile defenses, and restrict development of theater
defenses that could be based in space.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was criticized by some lawmakers as a giveaway
that will place lives of Americans in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Cohen argued that any space-based system that could protect
troops in a military theater could also be used to shoot down an
intercontinental ballistic missile aimed at the U.S., and such
systems are banned by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"So this provision has given up nothing," he said. "It simply
confirms the fact of where we are today."

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo's Road May Lead to Rome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona's world player of the
year, Ronaldo, looks to be heading to Rome, according to local
reports on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian, who has scored 23 goals in the Spanish league
this season, has been given permission to meet Lazio owner Sergio
Cragnotti the day after Barcelona's European Cup Winners' Cup
semifinal against Fiorentina on April 24.
</P>
<P>
"Ronaldo-Lazio, another yes," declared the Corriere dello Sport
newspaper in a front page headline, reporting that his main
sponsor Nike posed no objection to him moving to the mid-table
club.
</P>
<P>
However, newspapers also pointed out that the terms of Lazio's
current sponsorship deal with Umbro, rivals of Nike, could scupper
any deal.
</P>
<P>
The speculation has been growing since Ronaldo declared on
Monday that the "door is open" for him to leave Barcelona at the
end of the season.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Seeks Compromise on Black Sea Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said here today that necessary conditions must be created for
normal operations of Russia's Black Sea Fleet in the Black Sea and
Crimea.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Kuchma proposed seeking a compromise on
the issue, and said his country was ready to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet, a major part of the former Soviet Union's
naval force, is based on the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Russia
and Ukraine both claimed the fleet after the disintegration of the
Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have reached a tentative agreement on
dividing the fleet, but there have been disputes over the status
of Sevastopol, the headquarters of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin will seek crucial ways to
resolve the dispute between Russia and Ukraine, the Ukrainian
president said.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also stressed that the two countries must sign
agreements on bilateral relations in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said Kiev wanted to see greater cooperation with the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under the Partnership for
Peace Program, but would not apply for a NATO membership at
present.
</P>
<P>
"It would be quite laughable if Ukraine said 'we want to join
NATO today,'" he told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian president is in Moscow to attend a summit of the
12-nation Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) scheduled to be
held Friday. The summit, bringing together the leaders of the
former Soviet republics except the three Baltic states, is to be
chaired by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, heads of government of the member states met to
prepare for the summit, which will focus on a framework for
economic integration.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Investigators confirmed today
that the deaths of 39 cult members in a mass suicide in southern
California were caused by drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Based on all indications this was a mass suicide," Bill
Kolender, San Diego County Sheriff, told reporters. "The group
acted in concert to commit suicide for unknown reasons."
</P>
<P>
Police said the victims were all members of a cult called
"Heaven's Gate" which helped design computer web pages.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the dead comprised 21 women and 18 men, aged
between 20 and 72. They were dressed in matching dark clothes and
tennis shoes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the 39 deaths were all men, aged
between 18 and 24.
</P>
<P>
Two of the group were black and the rest were white or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
A medical examiner in San Diego County said it appeared the
suicides were carried out in three groups over a period of several
days.
</P>
<P>
Based on preliminary toxicology tests on four of the dead,
doctors said the deaths appeared to be caused by a combination of
alcohol and the drug phenobarbitol.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Province Develops Export-Oriented Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Export-oriented agriculture in
east China's coastal province of Fujian has become a major
contributor to its economic development.
</P>
<P>
The province exported 3.38 billion US dollars worth of farm
products in 1995, accounting for 36 percent of its total exports,
says Liu Qinrui, the director of the Provincial Agriculture Office.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Province adopted policies in the early 1980s to
encourage overseas investment in its hilly areas, and the influx
of foreign funds contributed greatly to its forest cover
percentage, and outputs of longan and litchi, which rank first
in China.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s the province has invited more overseas
participation in comprehensive agriculture development, involving
processing, storage, farm machinery, water conservancy, power
plants, and other infrastructural facilities.
</P>
<P>
The province has imported 2,700 improved strains of seed, 4,000
items of advanced technology and equipment, in an effort to
modernize its agriculture, the official says.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,200 overseas-funded enterprises have by now
invested two billion US dollars into agriculture-related
industries.
</P>
<P>
An American company has invested in producing the famous oolong
tea in Zhangpu County and raised the purchase price to
10 to 12 yuan from one to two yuan per kilogram. Local tea
growers' per capita annual income rocketed to 5,000 yuan from 500
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan plays a major part in Fujian's export-oriented
agriculture. Nearly half the overseas-funded enterprises and used
capital come from Taiwan. The two partners co-established in
Xiamen the Fujian-Taiwan Agricultural High-Technology Park.

<HEADLINE> European Experts Meet Albanian Leaders on Relief Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino renewed his country's request today for a multinational force
to secure humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
During talks with a 15-member European delegation of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the
European Union (EU) and its Commission, Fino said security in
Albania was improving slowly, but a protection force was necessary
to secure safe transport and distribution of relief materials.
</P>
<P>
Fino stressed that a security force is especially needed at the
capital international airport, the port of Durres west of Tirana
and the Vlora port in the south, and along key roads.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been plunged into a lawlessness since January when
nation-wide protests broke out in protests of collapsed investment
schemes.
</P>
<P>
The protests later mushroomed into armed unrest in the south.
</P>
<P>
So far the OSCE has agreed to set up a security force in
principle, but the member states failed to approve a mandate for a
military mission at a meeting in Vienna Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some member states said the United Nations Security Council
should set out the mission's mandate.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear when the OSCE would meet again.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the European delegation also met with Albanian
Interior Minister Belul Cela and Defense Minister Shaqir
Vukaj. Cela requested the OSCE and EU provide special equipment
needed by police and anti-terrorist special force.
</P>
<P>
Vukaj said the country's heavy equipment, including aircraft
and armored vehicles, was still under control of the army.
</P>
<P>
He added that the army was being regrouped and a special force
was being formed to help gain control of the airports, sea ports
and roads.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trucks sent by the Geneva-based International
Committee of the Red Cross carrying international emergency food
aid to Albania stopped at the Greek border Thursday, waiting for
word from relief workers on the other side that it was safe to
cross.
</P>
<P>
The trucks would try to cross the border on Friday and hoped to
make their way to the port of Durres, dropping off food in towns
along the way, reports said.

<HEADLINE> WHO: No Definite Link Yet Between Madcow Disease and CJD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today reiterated that there still has been no definite link
between the madcow disease and its human equivalent.
</P>
<P>
WHO made the statement in its guidelines for avoiding the
madcow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), in making medical products of human and animal origins.
</P>
<P>
There has been "no link definitely established" between BSE and
its human variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), said
the United Nations specialized agency headquartered here.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines were published after a WHO-sponsored
international consultation from March 24 to 26, or a year after
BSE's possible link with CJD sent a shock wave across Europe.
</P>
<P>
During the consultation, experts confirmed their previous
conclusions and statements on transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSE), including the need for continued and
intensified research.
</P>
<P>
They also concluded that new information does not change
previous recommendations regarding milk and gelatin safety.
</P>
<P>
WHO recommended, however, that cattle sources and other animal
species naturally affected by a TSE should be avoided whenever
possible for preparing medicinal products and devices.
</P>
<P>
When cattle sources are unavoidable, the world's top health
agency said, source countries should be those which have low or no
BSE confirmed by an effective surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines should also be applied to medical products from
other animal species with naturally-acquired TSE, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no proven or even probable instance of
CJD transmission from human to human by blood transfusion or blood
products, observation must continue, it said.
</P>
<P>
Experts associated with WHO concluded that blood transfusions
continue to be safe, but organ transplant donors should exclude
individuals who are at risk of CJD and other familial TSE.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that it will follow the development of the situation
and take into consideration any new element that could modify or
change its conclusions and recommendations regarding the matter.

<HEADLINE> Bamerindus Could Become Biggest Bank in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Bamerindus Bank,
which has been taken over by the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC) British bank, could become the biggest bank in
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"HSBC will be the biggest foreign bank in the region, and HSBC
Bamerindus the biggest bank of Latin America," said Michael
Geoghegan, who will be the president of the new entity.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Brazil determined Wednesday this week to
sell Bamerindus -- the fifth biggest private financial institution
in Brazil -- to the HSBC, which must assume administration of the
HSBC Bamerindus next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Bamerindus Bank has 1,241 agencies throughout Brazil and
three abroad; a portfolio of 2,630,238 clients, and a
23,000-employee payroll.
</P>
<P>
The British bank, founded in 1865 in Hong Kong and in London,
and considered by the The Banker magazine to be the biggest bank
in the world, acquired the almost 10 billion dollars worth of
assets and liabilities of Bamerindus in exchange for an investment
of just 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The commitment also involved assuming a great part of the
Brazilian institution's deficit.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's total export to
Britain rose to 380 million U.S. dollars last year, a 13 percent
increase over 1995, according to official figures released today.
</P>
<P>
The increase in exports was mainly attributed to the strong
performance of Sri Lanka's garment industry.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from exports in the apparel and clothing sector grew
to 275 million U.S. dollars in 1996 from 229 million U.S. dollars
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Exports of textile yarn fabrics, fruits and vegetables and
non-metallic minerals also recorded marginal increases in terms of
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's imports from Britain dropped by five
percent last year to 245 million U.S. dollars from 258 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> First Bosnian Refugees Return Home From Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- About 100 Bosnian refugees
repatriated by Germany today arrived in Sarajevo, capital of
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 Bosnian refugees are expected to be repatriated
home from Germany by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia reached a repatriation agreement with Germany in 1995 to
send back roughly 320,000 Bosnian refugees now staying in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The repatriated refugees will, it is believed, worsen the
unemployment in the country in which 350,000 are now jobless.
</P>
<P>
More than 320,000 refugees fled to Germany after the
disintegration of former Yugoslavia in 1991. Bonn said it spent
about 500 million marks (350 million U.S. dollars) a year to feed
the Bosnian refugees taken in by Germany's 16 regional states.
</P>
<P>
Facing budget crisis after the Bosnian war ended at the end of
1995, Germany decided last October to begin forcing the refugees
to go home unless they volunteered to go.

HAVANA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Cuba reiterated its willingness
today to receive the Peruvian rebels who are holding 72 hostages
inside the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.
</P>
<P>
A deal is reportedly in the works in which the Tupac Amaru
rebels would free the hostages in exchange for asylum in Cuba and
a multimillion dollar payoff.
</P>
<P>
There had been no change in the position of Cuba since the
talks between Cuban President Fidel Castro and his Peruvian
counterpart Alberto Fujimori early this month, Cuban Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol said.
</P>
<P>
Havana awaited an agreement, as well as an official request
from the Guarantors Commission, to receive the Tupac Amaru
members, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The Lima hostage crisis hit the 100-day mark today. The
previous Latin America's hostage holding record was 61 days when

RIYADH, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia scored three goals
against nil for a win over Bangladesh in the Group One Asian World
Cup qualifying Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Saudi broke the deadlock with Malaysia to take
the top spot in the group as the other two members of Malaysia and
Chinese Taipei played a scoreless draw.
</P>
<P>
The Saudis, winners of Asian Cup last year, netted their first
strike only two minuets into the game through Ibrahim Al-Suwayed.
</P>
<P>
Despite a great save which denied a penalty kick from Khaled
Al-Timawy, Bangladesh's goalkeeper Ponir was not strong enough to
beat the eleven Saudi nationals.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the half break, Ponir was beaten the second time by
Obaid Al Doussary.
</P>
<P>
With 15 minutes into the second half, Bangladesh was reduced to
10 men after Mohammed Ahmed was sent off for a foul on Sami
Al-Jaber.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Al-Jamaan scored 11 minutes before the game's end off
a pass from right-back Abdullah Shelia.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia will face Malaysia on Saturday and a win will
award Saudi a spot in the second round.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- England will field a virtual
second-string team when they face Mexico in a friendly at Wembley
on Saturday after an unprecedented injury crisis deprived coach
Glenn Hoddle of no fewer than 17 players.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle acknowledged that the match will now be of little help
in England's preparations for the World Cup assignment against
Georgia on April 30.
</P>
<P>
The list of players unavailable amounts to almost two full
England teams and includes strikers Alan Shearer, Les Ferdinand,
Nick Barmby and goalkeepers David Seaman and Ian Walker.
</P>
<P>
The midfielders ruled out are Paul Gascoigne, Steve Stone, Paul
Merson, Andy Hinchcliffe, Darren Anderton, David Beckham and Matt
Le Tissier.
</P>
<P>
The defence has been hit by injuries to Gary Neville, Tony
Adams, Sol Campbell, Gary Pallister and Dominic Matteo.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Mexico will field a full-strength side as they bid
for a hat-trick of victories over England.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's key players include striker Carlos Hermosillo, who has
seven goals in his last 11 appearances and is regarded as a
modern-day Hugo Sanchez.

advancing to the semi-finals of the ATP Lipton Championships.
</P>
<P>
Courier, ranked 26th, upset fourth-seeded Croatian Goran

Courier, who lives on nearby Fisher Island, took his fourth
victory in a row over Ivanisevic and his sixth in eight meetings
overall. Ivanisevic has not beaten Courier since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The triumph gave Courier, who has missed the number one since
1993, back-to-back victories over top 10 foes for the first time
since the 1995 US Open.
</P>
<P>
Courier opened the year by winning in Doha for his 20th career
crown, but had not advanced past the second round in his past

<P>
LISBON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese striker Sa Pinto faces
a three-year ban from football after attacking national coach
Arthur Jorge earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old, who has now been dropped from the team to play
Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier this weekend in Belfast,
insisted on Wednesday that Jorge is to be blamed for his insult
first.
</P>
<P>
Sa Pinto claims that when he turned up for the team's final
training session before leaving for Northern Ireland, Jorge called
him "a son of a whore."
</P>
<P>
The Sporting Lisbon attacker immediately began punching and
kicking Jorge and had to be pulled away by fellow teammates.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese Football Federation has opened an inquiry into
the incident and if Sa Pinto is found guilty could face a three
year ban.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Import Huge Amount of Crude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will import 6.3
billion U.S. dollars worth of crude oil and byproducts this year,
Joel Renno, president of the Brazilian state oil company,
Petrobras, said here today.
</P>
<P>
National oil output grew 20 percent from January 1995 to
December 1996, rising from 750,000 to 900,000 barrels a day, Renno
said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic oil output met only 53 percent of domestic demand,
which had registered a yearly increase of 6 percent during the
last two years, said Renno.
</P>
<P>
To reduce crude imports, the Brazilian government adopted
several measures to increase production, setting a goal of 1.2
million barrels a day in 1998 and 1.5 million barrels at the end
of the decade.

BUENOS AIRES, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Foreign Minister
Guido di Tella rejected here today a Spanish request for the
arrest of a former Argentine military chief of state.
</P>
<P>
Di Tella told the press that the international and provisional

<P>
He also ruled out any dialogue on the matter with the Spanish
government.

Garzon ordered Tuesday the arrest of Galtieri to make him

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Due to poor results in the Premier
League, Joe Royle resigned on Thursday as manager of Everton Club.
</P>
<P>
After 31 games, Everton is five points above the relegation
zone with 13 losses, a dismaying contrast to neighbor Liverpool
which is racing against Manchester United for the League title.
</P>
<P>
"I have been disappointed by recent results and our current
league position," said Royle, a former Everton striker of the late
1960s and 70s. "Having spoken to the chairman, it has been agreed
we should part company by mutual consent."
</P>
<P>
Royle who capped England for six times, took the helm of
Everton in November 1994 when the club tailed in the League.
</P>
<P>
He guided Everton to be away from relegation and finished sixth
last season.

TIANJIN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese artists will gather in
Tianjin this October to celebrate the country's first calligraphy
festival.
</P>
<P>
The event will showcase different schools of the art, which
originated thousands of years ago and is regarded as a national
treasure.
</P>
<P>
To create the art, calligraphers use traditional brushes and
ink to form pictographic characters on white paper, styling them
to look like abstract paintings.
</P>
<P>
Masterpieces can usually be auctioned for thousands of US
dollars on the international market.
</P>

The art has also been greatly developed in many Asian
countries, including Japan and Korea.

Hingis appeared to have the match in control early, breaking
Novotna for a 2-0 lead and won the first set 6-3 with a blistering
backhand up the line.

<P>
LOME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's government and rebel
delegates today reaffirmed the principle of ceasefire and peace
talks, according to the communique released here today by the
special summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
The communique, read by Togolese Foreign Minister Pierre Panou
at the end of a consultation held after the OAU special summit,
said the agreement was reached under the mediation of OAU, the
Untied Nations and African regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Camerounian President Paul Biya who is also the current OAU
chairman, Nigerian President Sani Abacha who is also chairman of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), United
Nations Secretary-General Koffi Annan, OAU/U.N. special envoy on
the Zairean crisis Mohamed Sahnoun, as well as delegates of the
two warring parties, attended another consultation as most of the
30 African leaders left for home after the special OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
The date of the start of peace talks and ceasefire would be
announced simultaneously in Lome, Kinshasa and Goma after the
delegates of Zaire's warring parties report to their leaders back
home, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The Lome summit is the first peace effort participated in by
both sides of Zaire's warring sides as rebels, led by Laurent
Kabila, won one victory after another and has occupied about one
third of the territory of the Africa's third largest country
since they started the civil war at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> USDA Urged to Check If U.S. Pork Contaminated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Veterinarians and consumer
organizations in the U.S. urged the U.S. Agriculture Department
today to determine quickly if American pork products might be
tainted by a "mad-pig disease."
</P>
<P>
A coalition of consumer groups and veterinarians has sent a
letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman outlining their
concerns and calling on the department to act "before there is a
tragedy."
</P>
<P>
They said USDA should upgrade the inspection of animals before
they are slaughtered to pinpoint any that may have diseases of the
central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
A leader of the coalition said at a news conference today that
there is no evidence to support a conclusion that U.S. hogs are
already contaminated with anything similar to the fatal "mad-cow
disease" that has infected many British cattle and resulted in
human deaths.
</P>
<P>
"But it is irresponsible not to take a look," said Tom Devine,
an official of the Government Accountability Project.
</P>
<P>
A press officer for the Food Safety and Inspection Service at
USDA said a response was being prepared.
</P>
<P>
Mad-cow disease has been linked by the British government to
the practice of mixing ground-up sheep into feed for cattle.
Mad-cow, in turn, is suspected as the cause of a new strain of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal brain-wasting disease in
humans.

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Thursday that Vice President Al Gore's visit to China had
gone well and validated his China policy of engagement.
</P>
<P>
"He (Gore) said to me that in every aspect, his trip had gone
well, and better than he had anticipated.... I think the trip has
been a real validation for our strategy of engagement with China,"
Clinton said at a White House news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said he had got all these informations about his visit
through his conversation with Gore on Thursday morning, and he
was "encouraged about it."
</P>
<P>
"I think the trip has been well worth making," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, National Security Adviser Samuel Berger emphasized
the United States must deepen its strategic dialogue with China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, Berger said the U.S. strategy of engagement with China
"is a vehicle for expanding areas where we can cooperate to
advance our shared strategic interests."
</P>
<P>
"Seeking to isolate China or to isolate us from China almost
certainly will ... undercut the stability that America, China
and the entire Asia-Pacific region need for the future to be
secure and prosperous," he added.

PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, today
told Philippe Seguin, president of the French National Assembly,
that China has made great achievements in its construction of law.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Seguin in the latter's official
residence, Qiao said that China wishes to make use of the
successful experience in law-making by developed countries in its
own construction of law.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will strengthen the work of law-making in
order to provide a good environment for reform, opening and
modernization construction.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his wish that through friendly exchanges, the NPC

and learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the 5th Plenary Session of the 8th NPC has just
decided the main tasks, policies and measures for economic
construction and social development of China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will unwaveringly carry forward reform,
expand opening and seek new achievements in socialist
modernization construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that the prosperity and progress of China have provided
the country with a great perspective and a good opportunity to
develop relations with all countries of the world in political,
economic, trade, scientific, technological and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also expressed his belief that under the joint efforts by
the two countries, the relations between China and France will
rise to a new higher level.
</P>
<P>
Seguin said that both he and the president of the French
Senate, Rene Monory, attach great importance to developing
relations with China, and wish to push forward Franco-Chinese
relations through their ties with the NPC of China.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner held in honor of Qiao Shi, Seguin noted that both
France and China attach great importance to their national
independence.
</P>

He said that France supports China's application for the
membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and it is glad
that China will become a member of the WTO soon.
</P>

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Department of Defense has
approved initial production of the Navy F-18 E and F fighter, new
models of F-18.

The E and F models will cost an estimated 48 million U.S.
dollars each. The U.S. Navy plans to buy 1,000 of the aircraft to

PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, said
here today that China does not wish to have more confrontation
with certain Western countries over human rights.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with French President Jacques Chirac, Qiao
thanked France for supporting China over the issue of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
"We don't wish to have more confrontation over human rights.
Certain Western countries proposed anti-Chinese resolutions at
international human rights conferences, which have badly hurt the
feeling of the Chinese people, as well as the relations between
China and these countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that China does not oppose having dialogue over human
rights, but the outcome of such dialogue should not be the
precondition for stopping confrontation between China and certain
Western countries over human rights.
</P>
<P>
On the perspective of China's joining the two United Nations
human rights conventions, Qiao said that China is studying the
issue with an active attitude.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese law experts are looking into the clauses
of the two conventions to compare them with Chinese laws.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Ban on Sea Cucumber Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's ban on fishing of
sea cucumber in the sea waters of the southern province of
Inhambane has achieved little results, Rodolfo Macassa, director
of the provincial fishing administration, disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
Macassa was quoted by the Mozambican News Agency as saying the
ban, which was meant for protection of the rear species of sea
cucumber, has been seriously violated by the local people.
</P>
<P>
"The ban failed to put a halt to the trend of sea cucumber
extinction in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macassa said though the government has stopped issuing
licenses to fishermen, but supervision of the ban was very weak
due to poor manpower with only three supervisors covering over
the 700 km seashore.
</P>
<P>
Fishing and export capacity of sea cucumber, which is both
edible and for the use of shoe-making and rubber industry, were
not known, he said.

NEW YORK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Prices plunged on Wall Street
today as the long-term interest rates jumping over 7 percent, and
strong economic data incited fears that the Federal Reserve would
again push interest rates higher.
</P>
<P>
Stock prices were mixed in early trading, but after the
Treasury's 30-year bond yielding broke through 7 percent -- a
level feared by stock and bond investors -- the Dow Jones
industrial average fell steadily and sharply. In late trading it
was down more than 216 points before recovering some ground.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell 140.11 points to 6,740.59 at the closing. It was
the blue chip index's eighth-largest point drop.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than 3 to 1 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaled 475.93
million shares as against 487.33 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 16.62 to 773.88.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 7.94 to 407.43.

<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 19.58 to 1,249.50, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index dropped 5.17 to 577.90.
</P>
<P>
The markets were nervous about another interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said today's trading was also affected by
technical factors including end-of-the-quarter portfolio
adjustments. And they noted the market's plunge came on relatively
light volume because many traders left early for a three-day
weekend. The stock market will be closed for Good Friday.

Early today, the government issued strong home sales and
jobless claims reports, a day after it reported a surge in durable
goods orders.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Shocked by 39 People Mass Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that "it's heart-breaking, it's sickening, it's
shocking," when he expressed his unease over the apparent mass
suicide involving 39 people at a southern Californian mansion.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important that we get as many facts as we can
about this and try to determine what in fact motivated those
people," Clinton told reporters at a White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
He also said it should be determined "what all of us can do to
make sure that there aren't other people thinking in that same way
out there in our country, that aren's so isolated that they can
create a world for themselves that may justify that kind of
thing."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno earlier said the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was working with state and local law
enforcement officials to handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
The 39 people were found dead Wednesday in a million-dollar
mansion at Rancho Santo Fe in northern San Diego County. They were
dressed in matching black pants and dark tennis shoes, lying in
apparent peace on their backs, arms at their sides, each covered
across the face and chest with a triangular shroud of purple
cloth, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
San Diego Sheriff's deputies said that there was no gunshot
wounds, no knife holes in anybody, no signs of struggle or trauma.
Investigators believe the group, at the age of 18 to 24, died in a
mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that the group sent a farewell videotape to
a former member, announcing their plans and may have timed their
deaths to the approach of the Hale-Bopp comet.
</P>
<P>
The members believed it was time to "shed their containers,"
perhaps to rendezvous with a UFO they believed was traveling
behind the Hale-Bopp comet, which can be observed from Earth in
these days, a source close to a former member said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said a former member of the group received two
videotapes by mail Tuesday evening. One video was of the group's
leader and the other contained each member's taped farewells.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a website, apparently designed by Higher Source, a
thriving business designing Web pages and apparently centered at
the mansion where the "suicide" occurred, described the group's
desire to leave Earth and rendezvous with a spaceship behind the
Hale-Bopp comet.
</P>
<P>
"The joy is that our Older Member in the Evolutionary Level
above human (the `Kingdom of Heaven') has made it clear to us that
Hale-Bopp's approach is the `marker' we've been waiting for....
Our 22 years of classroom here on planet Earth is finally coming
to conclusion _ `graduation' from the Human Evolutionary Level. We
are happily prepared to leave `this world' and go with Ti's crew,"
the Heaven's Gate Website reads.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no information on the Heaven's Gate Website
that connected it to the Higher Source group. There is a separate
Website under the Higher Source name. The Heaven's Gate Website
said suicide was unacceptable for people who were not part of the
group but was an acceptable way for members to ascend to a higher
level of life, a report said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators searched the house and refrigerated vans from the
coroner's office stood by. One of the vans, which is capable of
holding 20 bodies, pulled away from the home about 5:15 a.m. and
arrived at the morgue in San Diego an hour and a half later.
</P>
<P>
If it was confirmed, it was another biggest mass suicide in the
country in little more than four years. On April 19, 1993, Branch
Davidian leader David Koresh and 80 followers died by fire or
gunfire, six hours after the FBI started filling their cult
compound near Waco, Texas, with tear gas. The government called
the deaths a mass suicide after a 51-day armed standoff.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends Extension of Haiti Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday recommended to the Security Council that
the mandate for a 762-member U.N. force in Haiti be extended until
31 July, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council extended the U.N. Support Mission in Haiti
(UNSMIH) until 31 May 1997. In doing so, it was the council's
understanding that, under the recommendation of the
secretary-general, its mandate could be extended for the final
time until 31 July 1997. The force were sent to Haiti mainly to
help the government form a professional national police force.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan drew attention to a letter by Haitian
President Preval last November, which said it would take between 8
to 12 months for the Haitian police force to be able to ensure a
secure and stable environment.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear from the present report that UNSMIH can make a
further contribution to that goal and to the objective of
resolution 1086, which affirms the importance of a professional,
self-sustaining, fully functioning national police force of
adequate size and structure, able to conduct the full spectrum of
police functions, to the consolidation of democracy and
revitalization of Haiti's system of justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
After consultation with Haitian government and several other
concerned countries, Annan said he came to the conclusion that in
order to ensure the continued institutional development of the
Haitian national police force, the mandate of UNSMIH should be
extended for the final time until 31 July 1997.

<HEADLINE> Albright Calls on Arafat to Give "Red Light" to Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Thursday repeated her call on Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to refrain Palestinians from taking violent
actions against Israel despite Israel's violating peace agreements
by breaking ground in east Jerusalem to build Jewish Housing
units.
</P>
<P>
"What we think is that it is very important for Chairman Arafat
to give a red light to the terrorist activities," Albright told
National Public Radio in a interview.
</P>
<P>
Albright made a similar call on Arafat earlier this week when
she wrote a letter to Arafat, urging him to do whatever to stop
Palestinians taking possible violent actions against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy Dennis
Ross is in the Middle East in an attempt to bring the Israelis and
Palestinians to negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He first met Arafat in the Moroccan capital of Rabat and he
described the talks with the Palestinian leader as "very
thorough."
</P>
<P>
He then left for Israel where he would meet Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late on Thursday and on Friday.

China, in the Elysee presidential palace.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Endorses Mammography Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
endorsing a National Cancer Institute recommendation that women in
their 40s get regular mammograms.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly after the NCI issued its revised
recommendations, Clinton said on Thursday that the long-debated
advisory from his chief cancer research and education agency
provided "clear, consistent guidance" for women.
</P>
<P>
He issued a series of recommendations urging that health care
plans serving women in their 40s fully cover annual mammograms.
The recommendations propose that Congress change Medicare and
Medicaid rules to fund the cost.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced plans for a national public education
campaign to provide women with information on the subject.
</P>
<P>
The NCI said Thursday it was recommending mammography every one
to two years for women with no special risks of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Some 44,000 U.S. women died of breast cancer last year,
including 4, 700 women in their 40s, and an NCI advisory panel of
experts concluded that regular screening would reduce deaths from
breast cancer by nearly 17 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consider More Food Aid for DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
consider to provide more food aid to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on humanitarian ground, the State
Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The United States... has no plans at this time to provide
additional food aid to North Korea. We continue to monitor the
situation closely. We will consider future appeals for food aid.
But we contribute food aid based on humanitarian needs," State
Department spokesman John Dinger said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out any links between the possible additional food aid
and a deal for Korean Peninsula peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have from the beginning provided the food aid and
humanitarian assistance... based on humanitarian needs, not linked
to political developments. And that is how we intend to continue,"
Dinger said.
</P>
<P>
Dinger also confirmed the United States, South Korea and the
DPRK held a meeting in New York on Wednesday on U.S.-South Korean
proposal for four-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But "no agreement of any sort was reached at yesterday's
meeting," Dinger said.
