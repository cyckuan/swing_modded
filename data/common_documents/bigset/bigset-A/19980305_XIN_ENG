<HEADLINE> China Records High Growth Rate Accompanied by Low Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The State Statistics Bureau
announced today that China's economy has entered a phase of "high
growth and low inflation."
</P>
<P>
The bureau's Annual Report on 1997 National Economic and Social
Development released today shows that China recorded an annual
growth rate of 8.8 percent in 1997, with the increase rate for
retail prices of commodities falling by 5.3 percentage points and
the rate of consumer prices for household goods dropping by 5.5
percentage points on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that the 1997 gross domestic product (GDP)
reached 7,477.2 billion yuan (900.9 billion US dollars). Retail
prices for commodities rose by 0.8 percent on 1996 and consumer
prices for household goods rose by 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Liu Hong, director of the State
Statistics Bureau, said the fact that China followed the principle
of "seeking development through stability" for economic
development and strengthened macro-regulatory policies in 1997
helped to maintain the good momentum of the economy. He noted that
the economy has continued to grow at a moderately high rate
accompanied by low inflation pressures since the "soft landing" in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that macro-regulation, consecutive
bumper harvests, the emergence of a buyer's market and the
strengthened role of market mechanisms were the main factors
helping to curb price increases.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed to a number of problems existing in the
course of economic and social development, including the
irrational industrial structure, weak agriculture sector and the
low overall quality and efficiency of the national economy; poor
economic efficiency resulting from the production and management
difficulties of state-owned enterprises; rising reemployment
pressure resulting from the increased number of laid-off workers;
incomplete financial supervision system; disorder in certain
aspects of the banking sector; and mounting difficulties faced by
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Statistics revealed that 675 state enterprises in 111 cities
either declared bankruptcy or were closed, with an additional
1,022 enterprises subject to mergers. Excessive stockpiles of
finished products continued to be a prominent problem affecting
enterprises. The year ended with industrial enterprises holding
stockpiles of finished products valued at 592.1 billion yuan, up
by 11.7 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The problem of loss-making enterprises remained grave at the
end of the year, according to the report. Total losses suffered by
industrial enterprises with independent accounting hit 134.1
billion yuan, up 11.1 percent on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that 432 major state-owned wholesale and
retail enterprises recorded annual net sales of 235 billion yuan
in 1997. Nonetheless their total profits dropped by 5.9 percent on
1996 levels to end at 4.4 billion yuan, a fact which fully
indicated the failure to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the registered unemployment rate in
urban areas stood at 3.1 percent at the end of 1997, up 0.1
percentage points on the previous year. A total of 4.8 million
redundant workers found new jobs through various channels. Some
1.92 million people in 330 cities across the nation received
relief funds to ensure the minimum standard of living during the
year.

contain Israel, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.

A very dangerous and gloomy future is awaiting the regional
states if they fail to control Israel's weapons of mass

mass destruction was a vital security measure for the survival of
the region, urging the regional states not to be indifferent

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Urges Implementing Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin called for
steadfastly implementing Deng Xiaoping Theory to ensure the
attainment of ambitious development goals mapped out at the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing remarkable achievements the country has made in
recent years, Jiang said: "It is by no means a simple matter to
turn various goals set at the Party congress into realities.
Contradictions and problems confronting us are complicated. We
need to exert great efforts to study them and resolve them."
</P>
<P>
"As long as we persist in taking Deng Xiaoping Theory as our
guideline, adhere to the basic line and basic program for the
primary stage of socialism, strengthen unity among all ethnic
groups, all parties and people in all walks of life, correctly
handle the relationship among reform, development and stability,
and work hard with one heart and mind, we can certainly realize
our trans-century grand goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks this afternoon when he
joined a panel discussion attended by members of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), which is in session here.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled that non-Communist parties and the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce have recently elected their
new leaderships.
</P>
<P>
He referred this as a major event in China's political life,
which he said helps consolidate and improve the patriotic united
front, multi-party cooperation and political consultation under
the leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing close cooperation between the non-Communist parties
and the CPC, Jiang said that old leaders of the non-Communist
parties had devoted their wisdom and ability for the country's
revolution, construction and reform.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC is an important institution for multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
CPC, and is a feature and advantage of China's political system,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that members of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee would contribute more to safeguarding social and
political stability and promoting reform, the modernization drive
and the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, who presides over meetings of executive chairmen of
the presidium of the First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee, was present at the penal discussion.

BUCHAREST, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania, worried over the recent
ethnic violence in Kosovo, said it is willing to help putting an
end to the crisis in the autonomous province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anda Filip said Wednesday Romania,
as a neighbor of Yugoslavia, is deeply concerned over the situation

Romania likes to see the conflicting parties show restraint and

Romania supports the efforts by the international community --
the European Union and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe in particular -- to bring peace back to
Kosovo, she said.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo heightened on March 1 after an escalation of
armed conflict between Serbian police and local ethnic Albanians,
during which four policemen and 16 Albanians were killed, and two
other policemen injured.

Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population

progress so hopes for the future drove out demons of the past.

"It remains the case that on any objective analysis the
prospects for a settlement are good, and we have to work towards
that with renewed vigour and determination. Democracy must defeat
evil," the prime minister said in a statement.

<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain received a record number of
25.96 million foreign tourists in 1997, three percent up over
1996, Tourism Minister Tom Clarke said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign visitors had spent a total of 12.65 billion pounds

Britain remains a very popular tourism destination."

He attributed the rise of tourists to British fashion, design,
music and film, all part of the "Cool Britannia" explosion that
has seen London crowned the most "happening" city in the world.

<P>
Of recent film releases Clarke highlighted "The Full Monty",
which tells a story of jobless steel workers becoming strippers in
the northern city of Sheffield.

OTTAWA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadians posted the most

<HEADLINE> Hamas Founder Leaves for Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Founder and spiritual leader of the
Palestinian Hamas organization Sheikh Ahmed Yassin left Cairo
Wednesday for Saudi Arabia to perform pilgrimage, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He will come back to Egypt before returning to Palestinian
self-rule area Gaza, an official at the Palestinian Embassy in
Cairo said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, a 61-year-old quadriplegic with ear problems, arrived
in Egypt on February 19 for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
He has received good treatment during a stay in a military
hospital, the Palestinian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's visit to Cairo was his first formal trip abroad after
being jailed by Israel for more than eight years for ordering the
killing of Palestinians who collaborated with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He was set free last October after a botched assassination by
two Israeli agents against a Hamas leader in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Yassin founded Hamas, or Islamic Resistance Movement, in 1987,
which insists that peace will not be realized until Israel returns
all the occupied Arab land.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Siamese Twins Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Siamese twins
who were successfully separated in South Africa in December
returned home Wednesday after spending more than five months at a
Pretoria hospital.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since their birth 13 months ago, Luka and
Joseph Banda will be able to live in their home in Matete
village, Zambia, with their laborer father and five other
siblings.
</P>
<P>
The nursing staff of Garankuwa Hospital, where the boys were
separated, went to Johannesburg International Airport Wednesday
morning to bid the boys and their mother farewell, the South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Luka and Joseph, who had been joined at the craniums, were
separated in a marathon 30-hour operation performed by a
50-member team of surgeons from South Africa, the United States
and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The boys will have to wear protective head gear because of
skull defects caused by the operation, until rectifying surgery
is carried out -- probably at the age of two.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to lead normal lives after that.
</P>
<P>
Garankuwa Hospital spokeswoman Babe Mosuwe said the twins were
in good physical health. They talk, smile, play and eat just like
any other one-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
However, they are unable to sit without support as their neck
muscles have not yet developed fully.
</P>
<P>
Since the operations, the boys had undergone a skin graft, and
pipes were inserted into their skulls to drain cerebral-spinal
fluid.
</P>
<P>
Mosuwe said the doctors were confident that the boys would not
develop any major complications and they would not have to return
to Garankuwa Hospital within a year.
</P>
<P>
The separation operation has been described as the first of
such in medical history that did not experience any major
complications.
</P>
<P>
The operation, which cost about 220,000 Rand (44,600 U.S.
Dollars), was done in South Africa at the request of the Zambian
government, since Zambia did not have the necessary facilities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Measure to Lower Drinking Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
approved a measure that would set a national standard for drunk
driving and punish states that don't abide by it with a loss of
highway funds.
</P>
<P>
The senators voted 62-32 to amend a major highway spending
bill, calling on all states to set 0.08 percent as the
blood-alcohol level at which a driver is declared legally drunk.
States that fail to do so by October 2001 would losing 5 percent
of their share of federal highway spending, with the penalty going
up to 10 percent at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Senator Frank Lautenberg, a chief sponsor of the amendment,
said, "Drunk driving is a crime, like assault, like shooting at
someone, like murder and it should be treated with the same
severity."
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure expressed concern that the punishments
were too harsh and said the federal government shouldn't be
forcing standards on states.
</P>
<P>
The issue is also likely to come up in the House when it takes
up the highway bill, probably later this month.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton strongly endorsed the legislation at a
White House gathering Tuesday. He announced that he was asking
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to conduct a study on
enforcing the 0.08 percent limit on federal lands such as national
parks and military bases.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 15 states enforce 0.08 percent blood-alcohol levels,
while the other 35 states set the drunk driving standard at a
higher 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, more than 17,100 people died in alcohol-related
vehicle crashes nationwide, about 41 percent of all traffic
deaths, officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the amendment could save 600 lives a year if
the entire nation abided by the 0.08 percent level.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Criticizes National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Public Service, Labor
and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro Wednesday said a
confrontation between the government and labor movement would not
help resolve the pressing economic problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on national radio during a phone-in program,
Chitauro said the government, individuals and private business
were prejudiced millions of Dollars in lost production due to
nationwide work stoppages.
</P>
<P>
The two-day national strike which started on Tuesday was
organized by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) to
press the government into scrapping a 2.5 percentage sales tax
effected late last year, remove developmental levy and reduce the
prices of all basis commodities.
</P>
<P>
"If these stayaways, strikes and demonstrations we are
experiencing had no negative effect on the economy we would
simply ignore them," said the minister, adding "It is not
demonstrations against the government or even stayaways and
boycotts that will reduce the price hikes and taxes."
</P>
<P>
She said, however, there was always room for negotiations with
the labor movement to resolve the issue of price increases and
tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
"Any dispute should be resolved through dialogue. We are ready
and willing to negotiate with the trade union," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said:"The problem with the ZCTU is that they want to
criticize the government without offering any solutions or
alternatives to the problems."
</P>
<P>
Chitauro urged the labor movement to promote a culture of
dialogue with the government and other interested stakeholders to
resolve problems.
</P>
<P>
She said the issues of taxes should be discussed by members of
parliament as the elected representatives of people who should
take the matter up with government ministers.
</P>
<P>
On price increases, the miniter said that it was not the
government that pegs prices as these were determined by market
forces because of the now liberalized economy.
</P>
<P>
The mass strike Wednesday entered second day, causing most
businesses in the country closure.

<HEADLINE> Moi Urges Banks to End Workers' Strike in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has urged employees of banks to end their strike starting last
Friday through dialogue Wednesday when union leaders called a
general strike.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks at a meeting of the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
After a while, union leaders made the new strike call at a
press conference, partly in response to Tuesday's governmental
decision on the sacking of some 15,000 striking bank workers who
were seeking for the scrapping of new tax rises on their soft
loans and allowances.
</P>
<P>
"A general strike is the decision reached by the labor
movement in this country," Central Organization of Trade Unions
(COTU) Assistant Secretary-General George Odiko said.
</P>
<P>
The umbrella body said it will announce a strike date and hold
a rally in capital Nairobi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that employees in Kenya Posts &AMP;
Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) and the pension agency
National Social Security Fund (NSSF) were joining the strike in
sympathy with bank staff.
</P>
<P>
The NSSF began its protest on Tuesday, the KPTC planned to
join on Friday, and the Kenya Power &AMP; Lighting Corporation staff
planned to join the strike next week, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The strikers from at least 53 banks across the eastern African
country were demanding the government to quickly rescind the new
22 percent interest rate imposed on their loans and allowances,
</P>
<P>
They vowed at the beginning of the strike that they would not
return to work until the government called off the decision on
the new tax hike.
</P>
<P>
Most of major banks in Kenya, including the Commercial Bank,
Development Bank and Barclays Bank, remained closed Wednesday on
the fifth day of the strike.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Tries to Accelerate Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) will take a number of initiatives
this year to accelerate economic and trade activities among member
countries, said the grouping's Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Tuesday at the Kathmandu-based
SAARC Secretariat, Hasan said the SAARC has a number of
initiatives this year for moving from the SAARC Preferential
Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) to a South Asian Free Trade Area
(SAFTA) preferably by 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said the commerce ministers of the seven SAARC member
countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- will meet in Islamabad, Pakistan, in
April to make a full review of the achievements made in the past
two years in this regard.
</P>
<P>
And the third round of trade negotiations under the SAPTA will
be completed by the end of March, he said. This round of
negotiations had been scheduled to end in January, but was delayed
because the commerce ministers' meeting slated for February has
been rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
The previous two rounds have offered more than 2,000 items of
products for tariff cuts ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said the list of products is expected to be expanded in
the third round and there will be a difference in focus.
</P>
<P>
"In the third round we're trying to deal with non-tariff
barriers. Before we were only looking at tariff barriers," he
said. "Secondly, instead of the (previous) commodity-by-commodity
approach, we're trying to adopt a sectoral (and across-the-board)
approach. This is one step forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
The most striking event this year will be the 10th SAARC summit
expected to take place in July or August in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the summit has not been finalized yet, but
traditionally economic and trade cooperation and poverty
alleviation are prominent, said Hasan, a career diplomat from
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Then an SAARC trade fair will be held in Sri Lanka, where
private investors, businessmen and traders will get together to
display their products, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To get trade and economic cooperation to succeed, you have to
involve the private sector," he explained. "Because today in all
the SAARC countries, the trend is toward deregulation and
liberalization, and our private sector has played a very important
role in complementing and supplementing the inter-governmental
process of economic and trade cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the non-governmental SAARC Chamber of Commerce and
Industry will meet this month in Islamabad and a conference on
economic cooperation is also scheduled for this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This year we intend to have a meeting on investment, because
we're trying to have a treaty on promotion and protection of
investment in the SAARC region," the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC also intends to hammer out a treaty on avoiding
double taxation this year, Hasan added.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, formed in 1985 to promote regional cooperation in
economic development and other areas, launched the SAPTA in
December 1995 as its first concrete measure for economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the ninth summit in 1997, SAARC leaders decided to bring
forward the timetable for the establishment of the SAFTA to 2001,
four years ahead of the previous schedule.
</P>
<P>
They had originally set the goal of realizing the SAFTA
hopefully by 2000, but not later than 2005.
</P>
<P>
"From the trend it is safe to conclude that the intra-trade (in
the region) is going up, but it is still unsatisfactory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now intra-SAARC trade accounts for only 3 percent of the
region's total foreign trade. Hasan said the SAARC wants to
increase the percentage to 10-15 percent.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the SAARC can achieve the SAFTA by 2001, he said:
"That's the question nobody can answer. The work is going on, we
have to wait and see."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been placed
7th in the competitive index of 23 African countries, South
African Press Association quoted the World Economic Forum as
reporting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing its Africa competitiveness report for 1998, the
forum praised South Africa for its peaceful transition to
democratic rule since 1994.
</P>
<P>
While growth in economic terms has not been particularly high,
South Africa has maintained stability under circumstances which
most observers had expected would lead to civil unrest, the forum
said.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius, which has averaged an annual growth rate of six
percent, was ranked first. The island country was also cited as
one of th best off-shore locations for business.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia, which has had an average growth rate of 4.5 percent
in the past 10 years and a real gross domestic product of nearly
14 billion U.S. dollars, was placed second.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, previously classified as one of the world's
impoverished countries, was placed third. It has turned around
over the past three decades to earn the country a position in the
World Bank's group of medium income countries. Its 4.6 percent
GDP is Africa's fourth hightest.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, bordering with South Africa and Botswana, numbers
fourth in the rankings. Its export-oriented economy has ensured
the country of a modest per capita growth of two percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall competitiveness in the report was based on six
indices, which included openness, finance, labor, infrastructure
and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Other countries featured in the report are Morocco, Egypt,
Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Angola, Cameroon,
Nigeria, Lesotho, Cote D' Ivoire, Zambia, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda,

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The first mobile vocational
training center will be set up in Angola this year with
assistance from Brazil, an Angolan government official announced
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Oliveira Marques, Director of the National Bureau of
Vocational Education, said a news conference that the move aims
to further expand vocational education throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
He detailed that the mobile vocational training center after
completed in the second half of the year will provide mobile
teaching service in Angola's 18 provinces to enable more Angolan
people especially in remote areas to get educated.
</P>
<P>
The training center funded by the Brazilian government will
have a capacity of getting 2,000 people from all walks of life
trained every year, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
Marques noted that vocational education is an important part
of Angola's education sector and has contributed a lot in
improving people's education level and meeting the demands of
national building.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the National Bureau of Vocational Education which was
set up in 1992 has expanded vocational education to 15 provinces
from six provinces one year ago, he added.

<HEADLINE> France Not to Extradite Former Italian Extreme-Left </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- France will not extradite the former
Italian extreme-left militants seeking refuge on its territory and
wanted by Italian judicial authorities for violent activities in
1970s, said French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jospin made the statement after 11 former Italian
extreme-leftwing militants living in exile in France appealed to
President Jacques Chirac and him for guaranteeing their
"legitimate stay" in France.
</P>
<P>
After Italy entered in December the Schengen space which
abolishes border control among European countries, three members
of former Italian extreme-left militants have been arrested by
French police in Paris and Bordeaux under obligation of the
Schengen agreement on judicial cooperations among signatory
countries.
</P>
<P>
Two of them have been released while one of them is waiting for
a court decision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the lawyer representing the exiles, Jean-Jacques
de Felice, Jospin affirmed his government commitment to the
decision made in 1985 by President Francois Mitterrand not to
extradite the "persons who have renounced their former
activities."
</P>
<P>
"My government does not have the intention to change the
attitude which has been that of France up to now. That is why it
has not given and will not give right to any demand of extradition
of any of the Italian nationals who are in our country under the
conditions which I have previously indicated," he said.

the adoption of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which
calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone with an area of more
than 1,000 square kilometers in south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly
protect its northern territory from cross-border attacks by Muslim
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Observers here have expected that the U.N. chief would carry
some ideas for the implementation of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Lebanon, Annan will also inaugurate a
regional office for a U.N. agency, Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
Annan originally planned to tour the region last month, but was
forced to put off the visit to deal with the Iraqi crisis over
U.N. arms inspections.

<HEADLINE> Frenchmen See Economic Resumption in International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-nine percent of French people
think that the resumption of economic growth in France is the
result from the changes in the international economic context,
rather than that of the policy of any political party, said a poll
published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the BVA-BFM-Paris Match, was published
when the right opposition and left majority of France are
disputing who have contributed to the economic resumption and on
the eve of the regional elections.
</P>
<P>
Only 17 percent of the people polled said that the improvement
of economic situation in France is the result of the policy of the
Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, while seven
percent said it is due to the former conservative government of
Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
Conducted on February 27 and 28 among 952 people above 18 and
representing all walks of life in France, the poll shows that the
opinions of French people on economic growth converged beyond
partisanship.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Barings Directors Banned for up to 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- British government has disqualified
two former directors of Barings, the merchant bank which collapsed
three years ago following unauthorized trading activities by Nick
Leeson, from acting as company directors.
</P>
<P>
Several national newspapers reported Wednesday that Ex-chief
executive Peter Norris has been disqualified from acting as a
company director for four years while former treasurer Tony Hawes
is banned for five years by the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This sends a clear message to business. Directors must take
their responsibilities seriously -- there can be no passing the
buck. This message should be pinned up in every boardroom," said
competition and consumer affairs Minister Nigel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Nobody should be let in any doubt that we will act
wherever there are serious failings by directors".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that so far six former executives at Barings
have been temporarily disqualified from acting as company
directors. The DTI is expected to bring actions against 10 former
executives.
</P>
<P>
The DTI alleges that Norris failed to ensure Leeson's
activities were properly monitored or controlled despite his
awareness of a number of warning signs.
</P>
<P>
It also accused Hawes of failing to ensure that the provision
of massive amounts of funding to Leeson in Singapore was ever
properly understood, controlled and reconciled in Barings'
accounts.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges to Help Save the Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain has pledged to help
bring the Middle East peace process back on track and do
something to help move the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
forward.
</P>
<P>
This pledge was made by British Prime Minister Tony Blair in
his letter to Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and delivered on Wednesday by British Consul
General in Jerusalem to Arafat in Gaza, according to Jerusalem
Media and Communication Center (JMCC).
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Blair said that Britain worries about the
impasse of the peace process and it will try its best to help
bring it back on track.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that Britain is preparing to
pay the diplomatic bill to the Arab world for its active
participation in the military build-up during the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Britain, which holds the current presidency of
the European union (EU), have already signaled they will take
full advantage of at least two high-profile opportunities to
underscore these points in the coming weeks, when British Foreign
secretary Robin Cook visits Israel later this month and Blair
visits Israel in April to take part in Israel's 50th anniversary
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Both Cook abd Blair are scheduled to meet Arafat in Gaza and
they are expected to tell Arafat that Britain's current government
will be far tougher than previous one in blaming what they
perceive to be foot-dragging by the Israeli government in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Wednesday also met with Terry Larsen, the Norwegian
Envoy to the peace process at his Gaza headquarters, during which
the two discussed the latest developments in the process, JMCC
said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian talks on Gaza airport, sea port and the safe
passage linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip are continuing, but
no specific results have been reached so far.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian Safe-passage Route Committee,
comprising military and security officials of both sides, met
again secretly on Wednesday, but no progress was reported.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Wu on Declaration on Human Rights Defenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Dialogue is one of the main reasons
leading to the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
adopted by consensus here on Wednesday, Ambassador Wu Jianmin
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the declaration adopted at a meeting of the
drafting working group, the head of the Chinese delegation said
that the adoption by consensus of the declaration, known as the
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders one week before the 54th
session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission is
undoubtedly a valuable gift from the working group to the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Wu underlined three points which the international community
should learn from the experience of the working group:
</P>
<P>
-- Dialogue is better than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
In the drafting process of the past 14 years, members of the
working group refrained from confrontation, lecturing and having
one's own way. They engaged in patient dialogues to enhance mutual
understanding and bridge differences and finally reached
consensus.
</P>
<P>
One can well imagine if there had been no willingness for
dialogue, no interest in differing views and no stomach for
discussion, there would have been no consensus. The experience of
the working group once again proves that confrontation doesn't
help. Dialogue is the correct way to promote and protect human
rights.
</P>
<P>
-- Equality and mutual respect are an important guarantee for a
fruitful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
One other factor that contributes to the consensus is that the
parties concerned observed the principle of equality and mutual
respect in the drafting process. Although they were wide apart on
many issues, they managed to discuss their differences on the
basis of equality and mutual respect. They tried to understand and
accommodate each other's views and showed a degree of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
If some countries or a group of countries had insisted on a
declaration which only reflected their own position, they could
have pushed through a declaration by vote long ago. But that kind
of declaration would lack moral strength and a solid base for
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The one we have adopted today is a product of compromise. It
may not be considered an ideal document by individual countries.
But it is definitely the best result the international community
is able to achieve today, therefore it will exert more influence.
</P>
<P>
-- Cooperation is feasible if the principle of seeking common
ground while reserving differences is observed.
</P>
<P>
The prime objective of the Declaration on Human Rights
Defenders is to formulate a political framework for the activities
of individuals, groups and organs of society in the field of
promoting and protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
Since different countries have different values, different
legislations and judicial practices, it's only natural for them to
have divergent views on some issues. However, we do share the same
views on many other issues.
</P>
<P>
During the past 14 years, in spite of many difficulties,
members of the working group never gave up their efforts to seek
common ground and to pursue the ultimate goal of reaching
consensus.
</P>
<P>
This fully shows that differences are not insurmountable, if
all concerned endeavor to seek common ground while reserving
differences. Common ground provides the basis for cooperation, and
makes consensus possible.
</P>
<P>
"The 54th session of the Human Rights Commission is about to
begin," Wu concluded. "We sincerely hope that all the members of
the working group will bring the spirit of engaging in equal
dialogue and seeking common ground to the Commission, and reject
the North-South confrontation which has been plaguing the
Commission for so long, with a view to putting the international
human rights activities on the sound course of dialogue and
cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Urged to Join Cyprus' Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government expressed hope
on Wednesday that the Turkish Cypriots would participate in the
upcoming accession negotiations with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it also put forward principles governing the Turkish
Cypriot joining of the government delegation.
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances should Turkish Cypriot participation
undermine the status of the Republic of Cyprus or imply in any way
direct or indirect recognition of the illegal entity in the
Turkish-occupied part of the island," Cypriot government spokesman
Christos Stylianides told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government would consult with the Cypriot
political leadership, the Greek government and legal experts to
try to find a formula for Turkish Cypriot participation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island to protect
the Turkish minorities after a failed coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has invited the Turkish Cypriots to take
part in the accession talks with the EU, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides announced that former President George Vassiliou
would lead the Cypriot delegation in accession talks due to start
on March 31.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came shortly before EU External Relations
Commissioner Hans Van den Broek and British special envoy for
Cyprus David Hannay arrived here Wednesday night to discuss a
formula for the Turkish Cypriots to attend the EU accession talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has refused to
meet with them. He has accused the EU of sabotaging the U.N.-led
talks of the two communities by initiating the accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has claimed that if the "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" is recognized, "doors to negotiations will open."

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan Wednesday
urged Iraq to fully abide by U.N. resolutions related to
dismantling weapons of mass destruction to avert any possible
U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Jordanian king made the statement after talks with
his UAE counterpart Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan. He said
"the sole reply" to U.S. war talks "is Baghdad's full compliance
with the agreement Iraq signed with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan," the United Arab Emirates' official Wam news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The accord signed in Baghdad on February 23 was approved by the
U.N. Security Council Tuesday with the adoption of a
U.N. resolution warning Iraq of "servest consequences" if it fails
to give U.N. arms inspectors complete and unconditional access to
sites suspected of containing biological or chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton threatened Tuesday that Washington
will take military action against Baghdad if it did not implement
all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to dismantling
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit, is to
leave for Oman Thursday. He said his visits to the two Gulf
countries were mainly aimed at exchanging views with the two
states' leaders on the latest developments in the Gulf region in
the light of the Iraq-U.N. agreement and discussing with them ways
of boosting Arab solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Kosovo Event is Internal Affair of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo envent is Yugoslavia's
internal issue which has no direct bearing on the settlement
process in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after meeting with visiting
Polish counterpart, Bronislaw Geremek, the current OSCE chairman,
Primakov said that both he and his polish guest agreed that
terrorist activities in any form in Kosovo should be countered,
while conditions must be created for a dialogue between the
Yugoslav authorities and moderate Kosovo Albanian leaders who
regard the area as part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the resolution of this problem is imperative, the
Russian minister noted the need to "put an end to terrorist acts
by individual extremist groups" without launching a "large-scale
combat operation" on the part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers held the OSCE has a major role to
play in setting up a security system in Europe, and the system
cannot be hierarchical, according to Primakov.
</P>
<P>
On the NATO expansion, Geremek, for his part, said that Warsaw
and Moscow continue to differ on the issue. "Poland wants to join
NATO and simultaneously to have the best possible relations with
Russia," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Another report quoted a Russian Foreign Ministry source as
saying that Moscow is not considering sending a special envoy to
Yugoslavia and is negotiating with the Yugoslavian leadership via
the Russian Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Primakov plans to visit former Yugoslav republics after
mid-March, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Geremek arrived in Moscow on Tuesday night for a one-day
working visit to Russia.

Qatar has paid the Egyptian workers leaving Qatar recently and
allow others to stay until they finish departure procedures,
Hussein al-Mulla, Qatari undersecretary of Housing and Civil
Service told reporters in Egyptian southern city Luxor on the
sidelines of the 25th Arab Labor Conference.

examine any complaint submitted by Egyptian workers over their
remittances.

BONN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany Wednesday deported 117 ethnic
Albanians originated from the ex-Yugoslav area of Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians and Serbs are on the verge of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that at least 20 of the people
boarded a plane bound for Pristina, a main town of Kosovo, while
others being flew to Belgrade, including 77 persons from the
southern state of Bavaria alone.
</P>
<P>
Bavaria's council on refugee affairs criticized the
deportation, saying it was against the German law and Geneva
conventions to deport any person into a zone of danger.
</P>
<P>
The deportees had been denied refugee status in Germany. It is
reported that there are currently well over 50,000 Kosovo
Albanians in Germany, with more than 20,000 of them in Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
Dieter Schlee, the federal parliament's commissioner for Bosnian
refugees, earlier said that so far a total of 140,000 ethnic
Albanians had applied for refugee status in Germany.
</P>
<P>
German refugee tribunals have rejected most of the claims for
political asylum, noting that most of the Albanians were not
subject to persecution individually though their community is in

In a statement adopted at the end of the two-day High-Level
committee meeting Wednesday, 36 ministers and officials elected
from among the U.N. members and its specialized agencies said
UNEP should be strengthened to ensure that it could serve as "the
leading global environmental authority".
</P>
<P>
The Committee welcomed the U.N. Secretary-General's decision
to establish a task force under the leadership of Klaus Topfer,
the UNEP executive director, to prepare proposals on reforming
and strengthening U.N. activities in the environment and human
settlement spheres.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening UNEP and its voice in the field of the
environment is in our interest and that of the environment," said
Simon Moyo, an official attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In another communique on the funding of UNEP adopted at the
meeting, the committee said there was an urgent need to relate
work programs and budgets to realistic expectations for funds.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Topfer expressed the hope that member
states should set themselves the objective of improving the
funding of UNEP and of "bringing the level of funding for the
Environment Fund back to that of 1992".
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that the financial contributions by
member states to the Environment Fund had declined by one third
since 1992, which had prevented approved work programs from being
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the approved work program and budget for
the biennium 1998-1999 could not be implemented unless
contributions increased by 50 percent over current levels.
</P>
<P>
In another statement, the committee noted that freshwater
would be "an overriding issue of global significance."
</P>
<P>
The statement said sound environmental management and
development of freshwater resources as well as efforts to address
water quality issues were "a key to sustainable development,
especially in water-poor countries."
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed that UNEP should play a vital role in
providing substantial environmental input in freshwater issues,
in particular at regional and sub-regional levels.
</P>
<P>
The High-Level Committee of Ministers and Officials was
established under a decision at the 19th session of UNEP's
Governing Council held here last year as a consultation body.
</P>
<P>
It makes reform and policy recommendations to the UNEP
Governing Council and provides guidance and advice to UNEP
executive director.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Health Spending Low in Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's per capita health
spending of nine U.S. Dollars a year is much lower than Ghana's
14 Dollars and Kenya's 16 Dollars, the Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing 1990 as example, FOS said health spending accounted for
2.7 percent of the year's gross domestic product (GDP) in
Nigeria, 3.5 percent in Ghana and 4.3 percent in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, Nigerian children have poor health
much worse than in most other African countries, FOS said in a
publication entitled "Poverty and Welfare in Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
The publication, jointly produced by the National Planning
Commission of Nigeria and analyzed by the World Bank, says that
under-five mortality rate in Nigeria is 20 percent, compared with
15 percent and nine percent in Ghana and Kenya respectively.
</P>
<P>
It noted that one in every six children under five years had
at least one attack of diarrhoea in the previous two weeks with
little gender variation in Nigeria, which witnessed an infant
mortality of 11.4 percent in 1990, as against 7.4 percent in
Ghana and 5.9 percent in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to FOS, many households in Nigeria are unable to
provide adequate nutritious food for all family members, a
situation that has led to increasing malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Widespread are childhood malnutrition and its consequences,
such as stunting, which are caused by poor diet, short birth
intervals and rampant diseases, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Yet almost 80 percent of infant deaths are caused by
preventable diseases including 10 percent of vaccine preventable
diseases, 25 percent diarrhoea and malaria, acute respiratory
infection which stood at 20 percent and five percent of low birth
weight," it said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that good ventilation in houses and early vaccinations
could help reduce the infant mortality rate by 20 percent and 10
percent respectively, it maintains that immunization coverage is
only 22 percent for children between 12 and 23 months.
</P>
<P>
The publication further noted that only 36 percent of people
in the rural areas have access to potable water, compared with 80
percent in urban centers, while 48 percent of the latter have no
access to adequate sanitation.

<HEADLINE> China Wins Bid for Zambian Copper Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) announced here Wednesday that one of its copper mines has
been awarded to a Chinese corporation, who has won the bid.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, ZCCM Chairman Luke Mwananshiku, and Francis
Kaunda, chairman of the government privatization negotiating
team, announced that Chambishi mine has been won by the Foreign
Engineering and Construction Corporation of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chambishi mine is proved to have 33.5 million tons'
reserves of 2.55 percent copper.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Chinese corporation told Xinhua that the
corporation is committed to the development of the mine over a
period of five years from close.
</P>
<P>
The corporation plans to re-establish the mine with a planned
production capacity of 3,000 tons of ore per day within the first
two years from close, and 6,000 tons after another two years, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Due to copper price falls in the international market and
outdated equipment, lack of investment and mismanagement, the
annual copper output in Zambia, one of the biggest
copper-producing countries in the world, has decreased gradually
to about 300,000 tons in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investments, advanced technology and
management to revive the stagnating copper production, the
government has invited foreign tenders for the ZCCM mines and
assets.

<HEADLINE> Blair not to Rule out Use of Force on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Wednesday that military action "will inevitably follow" if
the Iraqi government fails to comply with United Nations Security
Council resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in British parliament, Blair said that the new U.N.
Security Council resolution adopted early this week was a big step
forward on the weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"What that enables us to do is to send a very clear message to
Saddam Hussein that he either allows the inspectors in and testing
to begin, or force will inevitably follow as a result of him
breaching that agreement," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose government was the staunchest American ally in the
lastest standoff between the United Nations and Iraq, also
confirmed that British troops would remain in the Gulf "to make
sure the testing is in place and the agreements that Saddam
Hussein has entered into are adhered to and obeyed".

<HEADLINE> 80 Percent Nigerians Live Below Poverty Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- About 80 percent of the more than
100 million Nigerians now live below the poverty line, according
to a senior official from Family Economic Advancement Program
(FEAP), the country's poverty-alleviation organization.
</P>
<P>
The poverty line margin rose from 34 percent in 1992 to the
current rate following the dwindling of family income and weak
purchasing power, said FEAP Director-General Abdullahi Aliyu.
</P>
<P>
While inflation rate declined over the period, poverty
continued to increase, he said recently, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, FEAP has carefully selected 140 projects
that could be executed by people living perpetually below the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of FEAP, he said, was to encourage local
industrial revolution based on re-orientation of the productive
sector at the grass-roots.
</P>
<P>
The program would create about two million jobs annually with
variables put in place, to ensure that by the year 2010, only
about 10 percent of the total population would be below the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Currently, six banks have been selected to disburse about
seven billion Naira (about 87 million U.S. Dollars) earmarked by
the government for the program.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks Over $11 Million to Meet Sierra Leone's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Wednesday appealed for 11.2 million U.S. dollars to meet priority
humanitarian needs in Sierra Leone over the next three months, as
the country recovers form the forceful removal of the military
junta.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was prepared after two United Nations missions
returned form the country last month and determined that the
current humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone remains serious.
</P>
<P>
In the country, the primary health care system has been
devastated by a lack of supplies, looting and the exodus of
medical personnel. Widespread neglect of water and sanitation
facilities has increased the exposure of hundreds of thousands to
disease.
</P>
<P>
The missions also found that normal distribution of food to
vulnerable groups has been disrupted, affecting children in
particular. Many children have also been exposed to acts of
violence after being sent into battle as combatants.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations appeal seeks funds for priority intervention
to support agriculture, re-establish basic health and education
service, ensure the resumption of food aid distributions and to
provide protection and assistance to the most vulnerable groups
affected by the current conflict.

CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Wednesday set up its first
company to operate the nation's 100,000-subscriber mobile
telephone network, in a move to privatize its telecommunications
industry, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Mobile Telephone Services Co. will install,

company's issued shares, totaling 600 million pounds (176 million
dollars). Four major Egyptian banks will purchase 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shares were priced at 10 pounds (3 dollars) each, with only 2.50
pounds (0.7 dollars) due at subscription and with a minimum
purchase of just 50 shares. The maximum purchase was set at
600,000 shares, or 3.3 percent of the 18 million share offering.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Halts New Taxes to End Bank Staff's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae announced Wednesday evening the suspension of new tax
hikes on bank workers' loans and allowances, hours after union
leaders called a general strike across the country.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to exercise my option under the law and
directed the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to suspend the
implementation of the increase until the matter is brought to
parliament for review," said Nyachae in a local TV news
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi also urged
bank employees to end their five-day strike through dialog and
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000 bank staff from 53 banks around the country took
part in the strike, demanding the scrapping of the new 22 percent
interest rate imposed on their soft loans and allowances.
</P>
<P>
In response, the bank employers announced Tuesday that all the
striking workers were fired, which has triggered off a possible
general strike.
</P>
<P>
In sympathy with bank staff, employees in Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) planned to join the strike
Friday while the pension agency, National Social Security Fund
(NSSF), began its protest Tuesday, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The strikers vowed at the beginning of the strike that they
would not return to work until the government called off the
decision on the new tax hike.
</P>
<P>
Most of the major banks in Kenya, including the National Bank
of Kenya, Commercial Bank, Development Bank and Barclays Bank,
remained closed or only offered very slow and limited services
Wednesday.

LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
extended Tuesday's retreat and ended lower, dragged down by a weak
Dow, worries about possible interest rate rise and profit-taking
after recent strong gains.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index on the London market, Europe's biggest
one, closed down for the second consecutive session, depressed by
a weak New York, profit-taking in the heavy weight bank sector as
well as by concerns over a possible imminent rise in UK interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index tumbled back below the 5,800 level and
closed at 5733.1, down 74.6 points, or 1.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that market sentiment was cautious as investors
became jittery ahead of the Bank of England's verdict Thursday on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The bank's two-day monetary policy meeting began on Wednesday,
with City analysts split on whether another rate increase is on
the way.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German's DAX-30 index fell from earlier record
highs and closed at 4,709.58, down 47.56 points or 1.00 percent as
the market was hit by profit-taking and losses in the debt market.

Shares prices in Paris retreated in line with other European

<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani arrived in Bahrain Wednesday afternoon on a
three-day visit, the Bahraini news agency monitored here reported.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who now heads Iran's powerful Expediency Council,
will hold talks with Bahrain's Emir Sheikh isa bin Sulman
al-Khalifa on developing bilateral relations, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
This is Rafsanjani's first visit to Bahrain. He paid a 10-day
visit to Saudi Arabia late last month to discuss with Riyadh
joint cooperation in propping up sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in Manama said Rafsanjani's visits to the two
Gulf states were another signal from Tehran to further ease its
decade-long strained ties with the neighboring Gulf Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
The past two decades saw strained ties between Iran and its
Gulf Arab neighbors, mainly because of Iraq-Iran war and differences
over the presence of Western forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi toured
all of the six Gulf Arab states, namely, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman, as part of the
efforts by the new Iranian government headed by President Mohammad
Khatami to improve ties with these countries.

BONN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- German police have arrested in
Stuttgart a suspected German Nazi criminal who was involved in the
killing of over 70,000 people, mostly Jews, in Poland during World
War II, it was announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Justice officials said police arrested the 78-year-old man
Tuesday. He was a member of the Command of the Nazi Security
Police in Lublin, Poland, and of the Gestapo secret police.
</P>
<P>
They said the man, whose name had never been listed as a wanted

including children, in November 1943 at the Majdanek concentration
camp.

<HEADLINE> EU Talks Cannot be Conducted Without Turkish Cypriots: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' European Union (EU)
membership negotiations can start without the Turkish Cypriots
but cannot be conducted without them, a British envoy said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, which is the second trip to
the island within a week, Hannay said "I hope we will move
ahead, particularly on the issue of Turkish Cypriot involvement
in the accession process", due to start on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Hannay told reporters that the EU and Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides are pursuing exactly the same objective, "that
is to say ideally, we would like to see a bizonal, bicommunal
federal Cyprus joining the EU."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that for this to happen, Turkish Cypriots
have to be involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations cannot simply be conducted without them. Of
course you can start the negotiations without them, that may
be forced upon us by Mr. Denktash's attitude," Hannay said.
</P>
<P>
Rauf Denktash, Turkish Cypriot leader, has refused to meet
British envoy and EU Commissioner for External Relations Hans
Van den Broek, to discuss EU related matters. The EU official
will arrive in Cyprus Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Denktash's refusal to meet him, Hannay said
"I am afraid to say that not seeing people is not the most
effective form of diplomacy," adding that he will continue to
be at Denktash's disposal.
</P>
<P>
Hannay and Van den Broek are due to have talks Thursday
with President Clerides and Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides to
discuss a formula for Turkish Cypriot participation in Cyprus-EU
membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Hannay said discussions will continue next week in London
when the Cypriot President Clerides attends the European
Conference and is scheduled to have bilateral meetings with
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prime Minister Tony
Blair.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has denounced the EU's decision last December to
start accession talks with the Cypriot government on March 31.
</P>
<P>
He has ordered suspension of bicommunal contacts in
retaliation to the EU's move.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

Walubita called for closer economic and political cooperation
between the two countries, especially in trade and economic
spheres.

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
Wednesday evening met with French president's special envoy
Bertrand Dufourcq to discuss the implementation of the agreement
signed by U.N. Chief Kofi Annan and Iraq on arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq, who arrived here Tuesday evening, handed over
President Jacques Chirac's letter to Saddam during the
meeting. Saddam said he would write a letter in reply and send his
special envoy to Paris with the letter.
</P>
<P>
Chirac reportedly said in his letter that Iraq has the right
to return to the international community on the condition that it
plays the game according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq, also secretary general of French Foreign Ministry,
stressed the significance his country attaches to the complete and
rapid implementation of the agreement signed late last month by
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq agrees to grant a special U.N.
inspection group free, unconditional and unrestricted access to its
presidential palaces. The group will comprise of senior diplomats
appointed by Annan and experts drawn from the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's banned weapons and the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq told reporters Tuesday upon his arrival at the Saddam
International Airport that he would raise the perspective of the
lifting of the U.N. sanctions as soon as Iraq has fulfilled its
obligation in terms of elimination of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on Monday which
approves the agreement and warns of the "severest consequences"
if Iraq violates the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq visited Baghdad as French president's special envoy
early last month to help find a diplomatic solution to the then
standoff between Iraq and the United States over U.N. weapons
inspection.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Violating Greek Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Wednesday denied the
Greek allegations that Turkish warplanes violated Greek air space
over the Aegean Sea, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry
deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkish military jets
were conducting routine training at that time, describing the
accusations as "groundless."
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said that Greece had made such allegations many
times, adding that this formulation arose from Greece's unilateral
and illegal announcement of a 10-mile air space.
</P>
<P>
The Greek News Agency reported that Turkish warplanes crossed
the Flight Information Region line without permission on
Tuesday, constituting a violation of Greek airspace.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry has repeatedly emphasized that Turkey
does not recognize Greece's 10-mile air space as it is against the
principles of international law.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds due to their disputes over
the limits of air space, sovereignty over islets in the Aegean as
well as the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Warplanes and naval vessels of the two countries are often
involved in minor clashes over and in the Aegean, triggering off
endless accusations.
</P>
<P>
Their disagreement about an uninhabited small island in the
Aegean brought the two rivals to the brink of war in early
1996.

<HEADLINE> French Role in Rwandan Genocide to Be Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- New French Ambassador to Rwanda,
Jean Claude Brochenin, has confirmed that a commission of the
French parliament has been asked to probe the activities of
French troops during the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
"The French government wants to assist Rwandans who are
victims of the genocide, especially by helping them in providing
health and education facilities," the ambassador told reporters
in Kigali, the Rwandan capital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The relations between France and Rwanda have been cold for
over three years after the new regime was put in place in July
1994 following the defeat of "genocidal" forces of late Hutu
president Juvenal Habyarimana, who was strongly supported by the
French government, the Rwanda News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On pretext of a secret agreement signed by Habyarimana and the
then French president Valery Giscar d'Estaing in 1975, France
provided troops and weapons to Rwanda to defend Habyarimana's
regime seriously shaken by the armed rebellion of the Rwandan
Patriotic Front (RPF) which was launched from neighboring Uganda
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that French troops participated in fighting in
many ways, including the use of artillery to shell RPF's
positions and checking of identity papers on road-blocks.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, the French troops trained the notorious
"Interahamwe" Hutu militia which are largely responsible for the
1994 genocide that claimed the lives of more than 800,000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Recent publications by the French daily "Le Figaro" proved
that France's support to Hutu extremists continued even during
the genocide.
</P>
<P>
France is accused of having supplied communications equipment,
arms and ammunition to the former Rwandan government forces and
"Interahamwe" militiamen who were slaughtering people all around
the country.

<HEADLINE> Criminals Can be Identified at Age 7: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Potential future criminals can be
identified as young as at seven or eight years old and thus those
children can be diverted from a life of crime, according to a
report on juvenile crime Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report by Britain's Association of Chief Police Officers
said that those children can be identified by teachers, social
workers and police acting together.
</P>
<P>
It said that if young offenders can be identified earlier and
can be prevented from their offending in the first place, then the
country's prison population can stop climbing up.
</P>
<P>
"Diverting a young person from a criminal career once they have
processed by the criminal justice system is far more difficult
than preventing their offending in the first place," said Tony
Butler, spokesman for the association.
</P>
<P>
The report called on teachers, social workers, health workers
and police to share their information on children of seven or
eight who were attacking other children or stealing. It said that
in this way, it might be possible to divert them away from a
career of crime.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Unwarranted Massive Detentions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister Habib
el-Adly Wednesday dismissed charges that his ministry has made
massive arrests without trial and rampant telephone buggings in
the country.
</P>
<P>
El-Adly told the weekly illustrated magazine Al-Mussawar that
the claim by the Cairo-based Egyptian Human Rights Organizations
about 34,000 Egyptians were detained without trial was
"fictitious."
</P>
<P>
"Detentions are made after careful calculations and we keep
suspects in a safe place to pre-empt crimes. Not even one suspect
has been detained without a prior court permission because
detainees have the right to contest their detention decision in
court within 30 days," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister also scoffed at claims that 100,000 telephones
were bugged, saying the figure is "absolutely wrong and
exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
"To do that we need an additional ministry of communications
devoted for this job ... if there is telephone tapping it is done
with permission of a court and a judge for a certain period of
time and a certain reason," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has tightened the noose over Muslim militants
since 58 foreign tourists were slaughtered by six Muslim militants
in front of the Hatshepsut Temple in the country's largest
archeological city of Loxor on November 17.
</P>
<P>
But some human rights groups accused Egypt of abusing the
Emergency Law which was enacted after former President Anwar Sadat
was assassinated in 1981 to make indiscriminate arrests, mass
detentions and military trials of civilians.

<HEADLINE> S. African Cabinet Approves Info Tech Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South African cabinet
Wednesday approved a framework proposal for the development of a
national information and communication technology strategy, the
Department of Post and Telecommunications said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the key elements of the strategy
are:
</P>
<P>
-- improving the technology capability of the government
through the creation of a number of technology projects based on
a high-speed fiber-optic backbone developed by the
telecommunications giant Telkom;
</P>
<P>
-- improving service offered to all citizens by providing a
one-stop shop through the use of smart cards and public
information terminals; and
</P>
<P>
-- developing legislation on cyber laws such as digital
signatures and encryption that will allow e-commerce to become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
"The use of information would allow the government to offer an
efficient, standardized service to citizens in all areas on a
24-hour basis," the statement quoted Post and Telecommunications
Minister Jay Naidoo as saying.
</P>
<P>
This will be done through the introduction of public
information terminals and community information centers, said
Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
"The result of this will be a much more dynamic interaction
between government and the people and see a substantial reduction
in bureaucracy."
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet decision meant the government could begin
the mammoth task of coordinating the development of the strategy
as well as individual projects to be introduced in the short,
medium and long term.
</P>
<P>
"New key projects and existing projects will be integrated
into the strategy," said Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
He said a cost benefit analysis would be presented to the
government budgetary committee during the next budgetary cycle.
</P>
<P>
Several government departments are to be involved in the
process.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Create Information Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is ready to adopt a
national strategy for the creation of an Information Society,
Minister of Communications and Works Leontios Ierodiaconou said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ierodiaconou was addressing the Euro-Med Net '98 Conference on
Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) which started here
Wednesday, with the participation of 300 representatives from
European and Mediterranean countries and European Union (EU)
officials.
</P>
<P>
Ierodiaconou said this strategy is expected to strengthen the
island's participation in the Global Information Society.
</P>
<P>
The basic ingredient for this national strategy is the
framework set by the EU itself for its member-states, a fact that
confirms Cyprus' full harmonization with the EU, in view of its
accession to it, the Minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The EU accession negotiations with Cyprus will begin on
March 31.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot Minister also stressed that Cyprus can and wants
to actively contribute to turning the Mediterranean into an area
of peace and prosperity for all.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference will deal with the subject of the role
of Internet and the World Wide Web in the development of the
Euro-Mediterranean society.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, there will be display of high speed
Internet connections via satellite and a host of European
companies will present the latest achievements in the field of
communication networks.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Using Iraqi Equipment in UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has demanded the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) use Iraqi, not foreign
equipment in its mission to avoid violating Iraq's sovereignty,
the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq made the demand in a letter sent by Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, INA
said.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say what are the equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, al-Sahhaf lodged a protest against U-2 spy plane
of the United States flying in Iraq's air space.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U-2 plane of infringing Iraq's space under the
cover that it carries out inspection mission in the air for the
UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, arms inspection teams of the UNSCOM went on with
their mission Wednesday, Husam Mohammed Ameen, director general of
the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate assisting the UNSCOM,
told INA.
</P>
<P>
Ten teams paid surprising visit to 12 sites and accomplished
their task under the cooperation of the Iraqi side, Ameen said.
</P>
<P>
One of the teams carried out its inspection work in the air by
helicopter, he said, adding that no incidents happened.
</P>
<P>
A technical team dispatched by the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) held discussion about the inspection of nuclear
weapons with the Iraqi side during the day, the Iraqi official
said, without disclosing details.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA team arrived in Iraq two weeks ago and has been
carrying out its work smoothly, he added.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is to verify that Iraq has destroyed all its
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction. Only
then will the U.N. lift the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in
1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> PLA General On Party Leadership, Army Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A People's Liberation Army (PLA)
general said here today that the Chinese army must subject itself
to the Party's absolute leadership, improve its quality and combat
strength with science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"We should firmly safeguard the authority of the Party Central
Committee and the Central Military Commission (CMC) with Jiang
Zemin at the core," said General Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of
the CMC, during a panel discussion of the PLA delegation to the
ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a deputy to the Ninth NPC, is also a member of the
Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee,
</P>
<P>
"The history of the past 70 years proves that only under the
Party's absolute leadership can our army retain its character and
purpose, win one victory after another, and guarantee the
long-term stability and prosperity of our country," Zhang told his
fellow deputies.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that under new historical circumstances, the
fundamental way for the Chinese army in accepting the Party's
absolute leadership is to keep ideological and political
consistency with and subject all its actions to the command of the
Party Central Committee and the CMC with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he urged the whole army to earnestly carry out the
decision by the 15th CPC National Congress and the ongoing NPC
session to further cut the PLA troops by 500,000, and spare no
effort to fulfil the goal in the next three years as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"We shall also take this opportunity to implement the military
strategy and principles for the new period in a down-to-earth
manner, and persevere in strengthening the army through
the use of science and technology," he added.
</P>
<P>
Army building should be prioritized by setting up a scientific
military system and setup, stepping up the development of advanced
weapons and equipment, training and fostering a contingent of
highly-competent military personnel, and developing military
theories with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The general called for still greater efforts to fight against
corruption and promote socialist ethical and cultural progress in
the army.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also urged all PLA officers and men to increase their
political awareness and sense of mission by studying Deng Xiaoping
Theory, and provide a strong safety guarantee for China's reform,
opening-up and modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PLA Urged to Build Fewer, Better Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese general today
underlined the necessity of actively advancing the building and
reforming the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China's armed
forces, and embarking on the road towards fewer but better troops.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the statement in a
panel discussion attended by PLA deputies at the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also defense minister and vice-chairman of the Central
Military Commission, urged the army officers and soldiers to
earnestly implement the general requirements set forth by Jiang
Zemin, namely, to "be qualified politically, competent militarily,
sound in their style of work, well-disciplined, and assured of
adequate logistical support."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the top army officer noted, it is essential to
attach importance to combat-effectiveness of the armed forces, and
keep strengthening the army building by relying on science and
technology so as to push the modernization of the national defense
and the Chinese army to a new height.
</P>
<P>
After lauding the country's economic and social achievements
scored over the past five years, he expressed his full confidence
in the modernization of the Chinese army and the national defense
as a whole in the next century as well as in the future of
socialism and revitalization of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
"We must adhere to the Party's absolute leadership over the
army and rally still more closely around the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core," he said. "We must
be resolute in safeguarding the authority of the Party Central
Committee and the Central Military Commission, observe their
orders and be always at their beck and calls."
</P>
<P>
When asked about reducing the troops of the armed forces by
additional 500,00 persons within the next three years, he said
"this is a demand required by the situation and so it's an
important move for bettering troops".
</P>
<P>
The number of the Chinese troops was reduced by one million in
the 1980s at the order of late leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "we should put the army's ideological and political
at the command, and bring out a new upsurge in the study of Deng
Xiaoping Theory," he acknowledgeed, calling for intensifying the
education among senior and middle-rank offices, further improving
the Party's work style, and retaining the character of the
people's army."
</P>
<P>
Chi also spoke of the importance of conducting nationwide
defense education and increasing the people's awareness of of
national defense in the panel discussion.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Quality Education Fund was
launched here Thursday to encourage innovation, competition and
self-motivated reform in Hong Kong primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The 5-billion-HK dollar (641 million U.S. dollars) fund was
initiated by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa in his maiden policy
address last October.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launching ceremony Thursday, acting Chief
Executive Anson Chan noted that basic education is the pillar of
social progress and that the government has all along attached
great importance to it.
</P>
<P>
Substantial resources are devoted to this area every year, she
said, stressing that the financial provision for basic education
will increase by more than 16 percent this year over the previous
one, as shown in the 1998-1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
She said the fund will mark a significant step forward in the
government's endeavor on the educational front.
</P>
<P>
"It is aimed at encouraging the education community to take the
initiative in introducing improvements and innovations to school
education" by providing a flexible funding mechanism, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the fund steering committee, Irving Koo Yee-yin,
also said after the ceremony that the fund will provide an
effective channel to fund worthwhile projects to improve the
quality of basic education in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ceremony were around 1,500 heads of nurseries,
kindergartens and primary, secondary and special schools,
representatives of major school sponsoring bodies, teachers'
associations and education bodies and academics.
</P>
<P>
Schools, education bodies and teaching professionals will be
invited between March 5 and April 30 to submit applications to the
fund for funding innovative projects. The first batch of grants
are expected to be released by the end of June.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Calls for Greater Efforts at Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Environmental protection and
sustainable economic growth are two issues vital to the health of
the people and the interests of future generations, Premier Li
Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental protection should be put on the agenda of key
matters of governments at all levels," Li said when he took part
in a group discussion attended by Beijing deputies to the National
People's Congress (NPC), which is in session here.
</P>
<P>
It is a good thing that more than 20 cities across the country
are making public air quality on a regular basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The air in Beijing is not good, but recently the municipal
government has decided to publish a weekly bulletin on local air
quality. This is a demonstration of courage and resolution," the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Funds and technology are needed to improve the environment, and
these are what Beijing basically has, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With people developing a greater environmental awareness, the
environment in Beijing will surely improve," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Beijing, acting as the country's political and
cultural center and a center for international exchanges, should
meanwhile boost its economy.
</P>
<P>
With a large number of institutions of higher learning and
research institutes, Beijing enjoys great advantages in economic
development, particularly in the development of an information
industry, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
He urged municipal officials to show great care for laid-off
workers, noting that the problem can be solved with concerted
efforts from the state, enterprises, communities and individuals.

HONG KONG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A joint-venture hotel management
company, owned by Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and Hutchison

</P>
<P>

two are in Hong Kong and the Bahamas respectively.
</P>
<P>

industry. The current economic downturn will also provide us with
good investment opportunities," said Dominic Lai, group managing
director of the company.
</P>
<P>
The company will operate under the trade name of Harbor Plaza
Hotels and Resorts. "The company's brand identity draws on the

<HEADLINE> Two Finance Ministry Officials Arrested Over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo prosecutors arrested Thursday
two Finance Ministry bureaucrats for allegedly taking bribes from
two major securities firms and a major commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Prosecutors Office identified one of the two
officials in custody as Takashi Sakakibara, 38, deputy director of
the Securities Bureau's general affairs section.
</P>
<P>
The other official was Toshio Miyano, 51, of the Securities and
Exchange Surveillance Commission.
</P>
<P>
Sakakibara and Miyano are suspected of receiving a total of
4.86 million yen (about 38,300 U.S. dollars) in bribes in the form
of wining, dining and rounds of golf, the office said.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecution sources, involved in the case were
officials from Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and
Sumitomo Bank, who were being questioned by investigators.
</P>
<P>
The probe into the entertaining spendings of current and former
MOF officials began last September.
</P>
<P>
Two bank inspectors at the Finance Ministry and a former career
official at the ministry were arrested earlier this year on
suspicion of taking bribes from banks and brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret over the arrests, Chief Cabinet Secretary
Kanezo Murao said the government will present a bill on the ethics
of public servants to the Diet, or parliament, next month.
</P>
<P>
The government will take this opportunity to drastically reform
the Finance Ministry and enforce discipline on its employees, he
said.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian
Telecommunications Corporation plans to double its capacity
to meet increasing demand for Internet service in the country, a
local report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Berhe Seyoum, manager of external relations division of the
corporation, told local journalists that the corporation had
projected to connect only 1,000 users to the Internet, the
world's largest pool of information, within two and half years
since beginning operation in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, the demand for Internet service was so high
that within the first seven months, 1,300 subscribers have
already been registered," Berhe Seyoum was quoted by the as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said, at present Ethio-Internet has over 2,000 active users
in Addis Ababa and regional towns.
</P>
<P>
The corporation wants to upgrade its potential capacity from
the present 5,000 to 10,000 users, he said.

<HEADLINE> Official Grain Prices to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The central government is
determined to stablize the prices for state grain purchases in
1998 in order to protect the interests and enthusiasm of the
nation's farmers, according to an official from the State Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that successive bumper grain harvests have
contributed greatly to sustained, rapid and healthy national
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He advised local governments in all provinces, ethnic
autonomous regions and municipalities to base this year's prices
on 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
Differing varieties and qualities of grain should be priced
accordingly, said the official, adding that quality items should
quite obviously be subject to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Pricing should meet market requirements and protect the
enthusiasm and interests of farmers, according to the official. He
stressed that protective prices should be adopted when costs
exceed market prices in order that farmers have the capacity to
produce sufficient seeds and ensure their own subsistence.
</P>
<P>
He urged local governments to decide on grain purchase prices
at the earliest possible date. He also called for guaranteeing
access to means of production, including seeds, fertilizer and
chemicals, and for eliminating illegal charges and levies on
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Last Tribal Rebels Lay Down Arms in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 218 Bangladeshi tribal
rebels laid down their arms Thursday in the fourth and last phase
of their ceremonial surrender, the national news agency BSS
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial handing-over of weapons by the last batch of
tribal guerrillas in Daduckchhari, Khagrachhari, Southeast
Bangladesh, marked the end of the rebel arms deposit process.
</P>
<P>
With Thursday's surrender, all the 1,943 men of the Parbatya
Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) have laid down their arms.
The disbandment of Shanti Bahini, the armed wing of the PCJSS,
brought an end to two decades of bush war in the Chittagong Hill
Tracts.
</P>
<P>
"It is a historic day for the nation as it marks the end of the
bush life of all the PCJSS men," said Civil Aviation and Tourism
Minister Mosharraf Hossain.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord signed last December between the
government and the PCJSS, the first phase of arms surrender by the
tribal rebels was held on February 10 when Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina received weapons from the first batch of more than 700
Shanti Bahini members.
</P>
<P>
The second and third phases of arms surrender were held on
February 16 and 22 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Zico Joins Brazil World Cup Coaching Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil former World Cup
striker Zico has been appointed to the coaching group on Wednesday
to improve Brazil's recent poor form with three months to go
before the France Open.
</P>
<P>
Zico, who scored 66 goals for Brazil in 88 appearances, will be
number two to head coach Mario Zagallo as the technical
coordinator, according to the Brazilian Football Confederation
(CBF).
</P>
<P>
"I am not concerned about whether I will be above Zagallo or
under him," Zico said at CBF headquarters. "My only concern is to
help the Brazil team do its best for Brazilian soccer."
</P>
<P>
Zagallo has publicly stated he does not want an assistant.
But after Brazil's defeat by the United States in the CONCACAF
Gold Cup in February, when they also drew with lowly Jamaica and
Guatemala, the CBF came under intense pressure to make changes.
</P>
<P>
"The coaching staff is now in a stronger position for Brazil
to win the World Cup for a fifth time. God willing, we will,"
Zagallo told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
CBF president Ricardo Teixeira said Zico's role would be
similar to that played by Zagallo in the 1994 World Cup as
assistant to then coach Carlos Alberto Parreira.

<HEADLINE> Intel Dramatic Sales Drop Shakes Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest computer chip manufacturer, said Wednesday its revenues in
the year's first quarter would be 10 percent less than expected.
</P>
<P>
The California-based Intel said in January its sales in the
first quarter would be about 6.5 billion U.S. dollars but the
latest warning indicated sales would be down to some 5.85 billion.
</P>
<P>
The warning shook the high-tech industry and fueled fears that
the industry is headed toward a broad-based slowdown.
</P>
<P>
What is more alarming, the giant could not give a reason for
the dramatic drop in sales. Intel's microprocessors power more
than 85 percent of personal computers, or PCs, worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Other major companies have also reported disappointing earnings
in recent months. But up to now, most market research firms had
been predicting a fairly robust 15 to 20 percent growth rate in PC
sales for 1998, even accounting for the meltdown in the Asian
economy.
</P>
<P>
An Intel spokesman said computer companies are buying far fewer
chips than Intel expected. Most of the shortfall is occurring in
Europe and North America. Industry observers estimated Intel will
end up selling 2.5 million fewer chips than previously expected
this quarter.
</P>
<P>
PC prices have been dropping steadily for the past two years,
mostly the result of lower prices for components such as disk
drives, microprocessors and memory chips. There is some evidence
that more recent price cuts, however, are a response to lower
sales volume.
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts say Intel's sales decline could reflect
the company's slowness to react to changing market conditions,
particularly the emergence of the sub-1,000 dollars PC.
</P>
<P>
Intel's announcement had already affected share prices. While
after-hours trading volumes were extremely small, Intel's stock
dropped by as much as 10 dollars a share. Dell, IBM and other
computer companies also dropped steeply.

PARIS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Katja Seizinger won the
downhill and Super-G Alpine Skiing World Cup titles on Thursday
after two races due to be held next weekend in Morzine of France
were cancelled for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Bad weather conditions and especially strong winds which blew
violently this week have torn the safety nets along the piste. It
is impossible to re-install the safety devices in time for the
races," organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Seizinger now can no longer be beaten in the downhill and
Super-G classifications since the rest of the tow races over the
weakend could not be postponed as World Cup finals are slated next
week in Crans-Montana.
</P>
<P>
The German downhill and combined Olympic champion has already
won the downhill World Cup three times and the Super-G crown four
times.
</P>
<P>
But she will have to wait for the four Crans-Montana races to
know whether she can claim her second overall World Cup
title. Seizinger currently leads compatriots Martina Ertl and
Hilde Gerg by 267 and 329 points, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Takes Steps to Cut Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae Thursday announced a "firm and painful" package of tax
increases in a bid to reduce the budget deficit and get the
country's economy back on right track.
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging package raises value-added tax and fuel
prices. It also includes a drive on tax arrears and a freeze on
all duty waivers for charitable agencies.
</P>
<P>
The move came just one day after the government's failure to
raise revenue by imposing higher tax rates on bank employees'
soft loans and allowances. The efforts to raise revenue were
suspended Wednesday due to a nationwide bank staff strike
starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of these macro-economic and structural
reform measures is essential to enhance economic growth, limit
the rate of inflation to a manageable level and enable interest
rates to fall," Nyachae said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's budget deficit is estimated to rise to 3.9 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 1997/98 (July/June)
from a target of 1.7 percent (the same as the 96/97 figure) if
emergency measures are not put in place.
</P>
<P>
The proposed package includes:
</P>
<P>
-- Reduction of non-wage, non-interest recurrent and
development expenditure by a total of 3.4 billion Shillings;
</P>
<P>
-- A rise in the lower rate of VAT to 12 percent from 10
percent, and in the higher rate to 17 percent from 16 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- An increase in duties on petrol by 3.1 Shillings per liter,
on automotive diesel by 2.5 Shillings per liter and on kerosene
by 1.15 Shillings per liter;
</P>
<P>
-- A complete freeze on all duty and VAT waivers: all
donations for non-governmental organizations will be on a tax
basis, except for medicines and items imported by U.N. refugee
agency UNHCR and U.N. food aid agency WFP;
</P>
<P>
-- Tighter administration of customs procedures, especially
customs bonds and transit cargo, and collection of all income tax
and VAT arrears;
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government would also maintain a strict monetary policy
and accelerate its privatization of state firms, said Nyachae.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi, who won a final five-year term in
the December elections, has repeatedly urged his fellow people to
tighten their belts in the coming tough economic year.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund last week painted a bleak
picture of the country's economy, with its budget deficit
ballooning, GDP growth and currency declining, interest rates
climbing and inflation rising well beyond projections.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Kenyan government has agreed to cut
spending by 10 billion Shillings (165 million U.S. Dollars) in
order to keep the budget deficit at about 2.4 percent of GDP.

BAGHDAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz on Thursday met with former French Chief of Staff Jeannou
Laceze, who is on a private visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting they discussed "the historical relations
of friendship and cooperation" between Iraq and France and the
importance of restoring them, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Laceze praised the victory won by Iraqi policy in the recent
crisis over U.N. weapons inspection, the agency said without
giving other details of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, French president's special envoy Bertrand
Dufourcq left here wrapping up a two-day visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During Dufourcq's visit, he met with Aziz and President
Saddam Hussein and handed over a letter to Saddam from
President Jacques Chirac. Saddam said he would write a letter
in reply and send his special envoy to Paris with the
letter.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Regulate Sugar Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will take
over the importation of sugar from the private sector next year to
avoid over-import of cheap foreign sugar, Sugar Regulatory
Administrator Michael Suarez said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Suarez said Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero had already
given the Sugar Regulatory Administration the go-ahead with a plan
for government importation of sugar as long as there is
consultation with sugar producers.
</P>
<P>
Suarez said the country's sugar producers have urged his
administration to regulate the importation of sugar this year.
</P>
<P>
Suarez said he is going to meet with the National Council of
Sugar Producers to discuss the matter so that next year's
importation of sugar would be done through the National Food
Authority.
</P>
<P>
But he said it would already be too late for the government to
take over sugar importation this year as the planned imports of
some 150,000 metric tons should come in as early as June to ensure
a buffer stock during the months of July, August and September.
</P>
<P>
Under government control, an orderly sugar importation could be
assured, Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been troubled by a glut of sugar supply
during the past two years as the private sector was empowered to
import sugar.
</P>
<P>
The over-importation of sugar pulled down the prices of
locally-produced sugar considerably, plunging the country's
downstream sugar industry into a crisis.

<HEADLINE> Samsung Develops World's First 128 MB Flash Memory Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A leading South Korean
electronics giant said Tuesday it has developed the world's first
128 megabytes (MB) flash memory chip.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Electronics Corporation also said it will put the chip
into mass production in July.
</P>
<P>
Smaller than conventional data storage components and often
used in credit card-sized devices, flash memory chips can retain
data even after the power is off and consume less electricity,
said a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The chips are likely to be turned into the next generation of
memory products to replace hard disk drivers in portable computers
and also used in digital camers and other handy digital products.
</P>
<P>
A single 128 MB flash memory chip has the ability to store data
equivalent to those on 1,050 newspaper pages and record up to 30
minutes of voice messages.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide sales of the flash memory chips, 2.6 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, are expected to reach 5 billion dollars by
2000. And Samsung's export could be 250 million dollars by then.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Pursues Muslim Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military, backed by
helicopter gunships, continued Thursday its pursuit of a Muslim
extremist group in a remote southern island after a fierce
gunbattle with the rebels Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As of early Thursday morning, skirmishes have been reported
between the pursuing government troops and the extremist Abu
Sayyaf group near Lantawan City in Basilan Province, the
Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine National Police Provincial Operations Officer
William Manzan confirmed that three extremists were killed while
five soldiers were wounded Wednesday morning in a four-hour
gunbattle.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Army's 103rd Brigade launched this week the
offensive against the Abu Sayyaf, following the killing of at
least 11 fishermen by the extremists last week off the seas of
Lantawan.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, one of the two remaining Muslim rebel groups in
the country, mainly operates in Basilan and its nearby provinces
in southern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government, which is engaged in peace negotiations with the
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), has refused to
open peace talks with the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The government already signed a peace agreement with the
mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in September
1996.

JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A new soft drink, branded

</P>
<P>
Virgin Cola was officially launched on Wednesday in

He said the Virgin Group was prepared to shake up cola market
in South Africa, stressing that "for years Coca-Cola has

JINAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
planned to invest 1.9 billion yuan into 11 proposed sewage plants
in the coming three years to curb water pollution in the
Huaihe and Haihe river valleys.
</P>
<P>
The province expects to complete the sewage plants, with a
total daily handling capacity of 800,000 cubic meters, by the end
of the century, according to an official from the Shandong
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds have been
earmarked for the projects, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another 15 sewage plants costing 983 million yuan
(about 12 million U.S. dollars) and dealing with 550,000 cubic
meters of waste water daily will be built in the province before
2010.
</P>
<P>
A total of 95 water disposal centers will be built in the
province by 2010, and they will be able to purify at least 50
percent of its urban drainage, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The heavily polluted Huaihe and Haihe rivers, both winding
through Shandong, do great harm to the people living along the
rivers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has poured 3.2 billion yuan into the
waste water purification efforts since the beginning of the
1990s.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Incentives Boost China's Agricultural Drive: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Favorable government policies of
fostering farming enthusiasm are the driving force behind China's
agricultural development in the past three decades, said an expert
of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
"Providing incentives to the farmers to keep them on the land
and encourage farming activities as a whole is the most successful
aspect of China's agricultural development," said Dr. Samir Miladi
in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua, shedding his insight
on China's food security program.
</P>
<P>
Miladi, a food policy nutrition officer of FAO's Cairo-based
Near East Office, said his interest in what he called "the Chinese
experience" stemmed from his 27 years of U.N.-affiliated teaching
and research work in around 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
For the past 30 years, China has managed to feed 25 percent of
the world population on 7 percent of the world's cultivated land
while its once malnourished people have grown into a
well-nourished and productive force.
</P>
<P>
Citing a significant barometer to a country's food security
situation, he said the daily energy intake for an average Chinese
rose by 68 percent to 2,757 calories in 1992-94 from 1,638
calories in 1961-63.
</P>
<P>
This, said the expert, can not have been achieved without a
clear government aim to provide food security to all through
offering favorable policies to the peasants.
</P>
<P>
To encourage farming, the Chinese government has provided a
host of incentives to farmers, foremostly, introducing a
production contract system that fixes farm output quotas for each
household while allowing farmers to sell the surplus in free
markets.
</P>
<P>
"This production-pricing-distribution system strikes a good
balance, between the government's task to promote food production
and the farmers' need to make profits," said Miladi.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with a favorable policy was the emphasis on intensive
cultivation and applied technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, health, educational and cultural facilities were
upgraded. Various agro-industry and village business were
encouraged. These measures were designed to keep rural people
where they are.
</P>
<P>
In this aspect, the Chinese experience could well serve as a
good reference to most Arab countries, where urbanization has gone
overboard, said Miladi whose major concern in recent years is in
the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
He said massive rural migration in the Arab world, increasing
at 4-6 percent annually, has not only eroded the quality of urban
life but also crippled the food situation across the nation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Banks Beef Up Foreign Exchange Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks in this largest
economic and financial center of China are beefing up their
efforts to develop foreign exchange business.
</P>
<P>
The domestic banks here had more than 4.99 billion U.S. dollars
in outstanding hard currency deposits by the end of last year, up
11.6 percent over a year ago, according to statistics of the
Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China (PBC), the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Mao Yingliang, governor of PBC Shanghai, urged
Chinese banks to sharpen their competitive edge in foreign
exchange business and achieve new breakthroughs in business of
foreign exchange settlements, letters of credit, and deposits and
loans in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Bank of
Communications, are the top three Chinese banks in terms of
foreign exchange business, with their combined hard currency
deposits in excess of 4.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year Chinese banks in Shanghai reversed a trend of decline
in the volume of foreign exchange deposits of enterprises, with
the year-end amount up 13.2 percent year-on-year to 4.18 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that Shanghai's Chinese banks had 8.12
billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange loans by the end of last
year, up 8.98 percent over a year ago. They accounted for more
than half of the international trade settlements, valued at 17.7
billion U.S. dollars year-round.

However, they acknowledged that there remain some difficulties
in achieving these goals, which could only be overcome by
effective measures of the government.
</P>
<P>
In a government work report he delivered at the opening session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) this morning,
Premier Li Peng said China plans to maintain an eight percent
economic growth rate in 1998, while keeping inflation under three
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy grew by 8.8 percent last year, with an
inflation of 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongli, an NPC deputy from China's largest city
Shanghai, said that since China began to cool down its overheated
economy several years ago, inflation has come down sharply and the
economy has maintained a reasonable and steady annual growth of
eight to nine percent.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that China has basically avoided a bubble economy
and that inflation will remain at a low level this year, providing
a favorable environment for economic development," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ding Xiemin, mayor of Taizhou City in east China's
Jiangsu Province, said that an eight percent economic growth rate
is conducive to achieving a fiscal balance for local governments
and ensuring the employment of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, a member of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) which
opened its first annual session Tuesday, said that there are a
host of positive factors for China to maintain a rapid and sound
economic development.
</P>
<P>
These factors include a stable political and social
environment, successive good harvests of crops in recent years, a
sustained influx of foreign investment, and a fairly big amount of
foreign exchange reserves, the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Most NPC deputies and CPPCC members said they endorse central
government macroeconomic control measures as enumerated in the
premier's report, such as an appropriate enlargement of the
investment scale and continued implementation of relatively tight
fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Member of CPPCC Dong Fureng, another noted economist, said
that the Chinese economy is currently at the bottom of its
development cycle.
</P>
<P>
"The government should send correct signals to the market and
encourage an appropriate increase of investment to stimulate
economic growth," he suggested.

<HEADLINE> Western Foreign Ministers to Meet on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
will meet Monday with his U.S., Russian, French, British and
Italian counterparts to discuss the Kosovo crisis in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the six foreign ministers, Kinkel said Thursday
at the parliament, would take place in London under the framework
of the six-nation contact group for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the escalation of ethnic violence in
Yugosalvia's autonomous province of Kosovo, Kinkel would also
discuss the Kosovo issue with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright during her brief visit here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We must do everything to prevent an entire region from being
engulfed in flames," the top German diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
should be preserved, Kinkel said, the ethnic Albanian majority in
Kosovo must also have more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict holds part of
Serbia's "return ticket" to Europe, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, has held the
position against any foreign intervention on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo heightened on March 1 after an escalation of
armed conflict between Serbian police and ethnic Albanians, during
which four policemen and 16 Albanians were killed, and two other
policemen injured.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population
in Kosovo, have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia since
1981.

a statement to the UAE's official Wam news agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To achieve such a joint stand, "efforts should concentrate on
direct bilateral dialogs" between Arab countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with the two Gulf Arab states' leaders
are "broad-based" and cover all problems such as the stalled

CHENGDU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Sichuan province has
set its sights on getting more foreign investment in 1998,
according to Li Dachang, the deputy governor, who says that the
key areas are infrastructure, hi-tech industry, tourism
development, upgrading state-owned enterprises, and agricultural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sichuan used 880 million US dollars worth of foreign
investment, a significant increase over the previous year. It also
issued H-shares (in Hong Kong) for the Chendu-Chongqing Expressway.
</P>
<P>
To attract more foreign investment, the provincial government
has tried to improve investment conditions and will revise
regulations encouraging foreign investment and formulate more
preferential policies.

<P>
This year, Sichuan will work out regulations on exploiting
mineral, water, and plant and animal resources.

SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the Bank

(Group) Co. Ltd., a listed foreign trade company with assets of
2.2 billion yuan, according to an agreement signed by the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, BOC Shanghai will support Lansheng with

<P>
JINAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Haier Group of Qingdao in
China's Shandong Province has purchased the Hefei Yellow Mountain
Electrical Co. Ltd, a major electrical appliances producer in
Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The merger can increase Haier's production capacity of
large-screen televisions to more than a million units
annually. Yellow Mountain has used technology and equipment from
the Netherlands and Japan, but bad management left it seriously in
debt.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the merger is a successful case of capital
reformation and is a good way for Haier to reach its ambitious
goal of being one of the world's top 500 multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Low-cost expansion has been a reason for the rapid growth of
Haier, which has acquired 15 domestic electrical appliance
manufacturers, acquiring 1.5 billion yuan in assets and expanding
its business from freezers, air-conditioners, and washing-machines
to televisions.
</P>
<P>
Its cooperation with the West Lake Electrical Group last
September greatly improved China's digital color TV capacity.
</P>
<P>
Haier now has 67 direct subsidiaries and 5.68 billion yuan (684
million U.S. dollars) of registered capital. It has plants in
Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines and more than
8,000 overseas sales outlets in North America, Europe, and the
Middle East. Sales last year topped 10.8 billion yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 members of Poland's
Rural Solidarity protested Wednesday against plans for the
nation's farming industry after it joins the EU.
</P>
<P>
They held demonstrations in front of the palaces of president
and prime minister, with banners saying "Don't join the EU by
stepping on the backs of farmers", the Polish Press Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The EU is proposing that Poland's farmers go through a 10-year
transition period without EU subsidies while still implementing
the Common Agricultural Policy.
</P>
<P>
But many in the farming industry believe the proposals will
make the country's agricultural products even less competitive,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Janusz
Tomaszewski said that some of the measures would disadvantage the
country's farmers. But he stressed that the Polish agricultural
products enjoyed a very good reputation in the western market.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the EU farmers should be more worried
than Poles after his country joined the EU.
</P>
<P>
Poland is expected to formally begin negotiations over its
entry into the EU on March 31.
</P>
<P>
However, Ryszard Czarnecki, chairman of the European
Integration Committee of Polish parliament, said that although
the negotiations would be difficult, Poland "will protect its
economic interests."

<HEADLINE> Chuan Confident of Alleviating Social Impact of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said Thursday that he is confident that the government will
effectively address the social problems in the country and
mitigate the social impact of the economic crisis on the people.
</P>
<P>
Chuan made the remarks at the opening ceremony of a
consultative meeting on the social impact of the economic crisis
which is co-sponsored by the Prime Minister's Office and the
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
In his address entitled "Social Impact of the Economic Crisis
and Thailand's Responses: the New Social Agenda," Chuan
highlighted the importance to establish a "people-centered" social
agenda for future development.
</P>
<P>
"To overcome this crisis..., the government and the people of
Thailand must re-examine not only its economic but also its social
agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of our social agenda is the basic premise that
people are our most valuable assets and must be at the center of
all our future development endeavors."
</P>
<P>
"To make this happen, we must invest in people and provide new
opportunities to contribute to and also to benefit from future
growth," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the financial crisis, which started in July 1997,
deeply affected the society and the people and shook the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the increase in unemployment was one of
the most obvious social impact. Unemployment in Thailand is now
1.5 million and will possibly increase to 2 million by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Another major social impact of the crisis is the increasing
pressure on social services, especially on health and education,
Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken steps in response to the situation,
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a committee had been established to tackle the
unemployment problem by launching a comprehensive program
involving skill training and employment creation.
</P>
<P>
As for social service, the government vowed to maintain the
expenditure on public health and education as much as possible
despite an austerity program and necessary cuts in government
spending.
</P>
<P>
Chuan praised the sense of unity and common concern among Thai
people, describing the "Thais Help Thais" project as an example of
Thai people's positive reaction to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of the people and the government's
commitment to good governance and a parallel decentralization of
bureaucracies, a new social agenda will be realized, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for cooperation and collaboration with the
private sector and the international community.
</P>
<P>
"By working together, we can surely open new doors and achieve
a brighter future for Thailand -- a future in which sustainable
development is achieved not for growth in and of itself, but for
the increased welfare and prosperity of our people in the long
term," he concluded.

TIRANA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo has urged the U.N. Security Council to monitor the escalating
ethnic conflict in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the Security Council on Wednesday, Milo
asked the U.N. body to express concern over the Kosovo crisis
between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslavian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The move came as Milo left for talks with the French government

Sokol Gjoka.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano had exchanged views on the
Kosovo issue with leaders of some Western European and Balkan
countries by phone.

<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population
of Kosovo, have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia since
1981.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo heightened on March 1 after an escalation of
armed conflict between Serbian police and local ethnic Albanians,
during which four policemen and 16 Albanians were killed, and two
other policemen injured.

<HEADLINE> Women Farmers in Central China Province Learn New Techniques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The per-hectare cotton output of
Huang Dazhen, a farmer in Honghu village of central China's Hunan
Province, reached 2.63 tons last year, a record high in her village.
</P>
<P>
Huang attributed the high cotton output to the application of
new farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
In the province, about 1.6 million female cotton growers like
Huang have learnt new techniques. As a result, their production
cost has been reduced and cotton output and quality improved.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of female farmers in Hunan have benefited
from various new farming techniques, which were not easy for them
to learn because most of them were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the provincial women's federations have helped
350,000 women learn how to read. The province has also organized
500,000 women to learn the techniques of crop growing, animal
breeding and farm produce processing.
</P>
<P>
About 7.2 million women farmers in Hunan have utilized the new
techniques to make financial gains, many of whom now receive a net
annual income of 200,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yiyang city now has 64,000 family-run enterprises with women as
main workers, 56 pig-raising centers, 95 vegetable production bases,
and 250 farm produce processing plants.

But the parties again failed to agree on terms for ending the
strike, which the employers said had cost the industry millions
of Rand.
</P>
<P>
The major disagreement appeared to be on the guards' demand
for a 17 percent salary increase. The employers are offering a 13
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Court on last Friday dissmissed the application by
the South African Natioanl Securtiy Employers' Association which
asked the strike be declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
Security workers, who started the strike last Monday to demand
higher pay and better working conditions, were still assembled at
the workers' library in Johannesburg Wednesday evening, waiting
for developments in the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Comments on Lien Chan's 'Private Visit' to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed "regrets and
displeasure" to the fact that relevant countries, regardless of
the repeated representations from China, insisted on receiving a
visit by Lian Chan to those countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks
here today when asked to comment on a report that Lian Chan of
Taiwan recently made a "private visit" to Malaysia and met with
the leaders of that country.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government firmly opposes the fact that countries
having diplomatic ties with China conduct official contact in any
form with Taiwan," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the special difficulties some Southeast Asian
countries are encountering and we hold no disagreement on the
non-governmental economic contacts between Taiwan and countries
having diplomatic ties with China," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
However, instead of an ordinary businessman, "Lien Chan is a
major political figure in Taiwan," Zhu said, adding that "the acts
by the Taiwan authorities have obvious political intent.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government asks relevant countries to respect
China's solemn stance of maintaining its national reunification,
abide by the promise they made concerning the 'one China' policy,
adopt no actions that might harm bilateral ties and safeguard the
friendly and cooperative situation between the two sides."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) in Bulawayo, the country's second
large city was damaged by fire this morning, a day after the
two-day national strike, a ZCTU official said.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Information Officer Komore Sibanda told Xinhua, "one room
of the office was severely damaged and some furniture, machinery,
documents and fridges were destroyed."
</P>
<P>
He said his office in Bulawayo has reported the police. The
police said they would investigate.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda strongly condemned the destroyed action, adding that
the ZCTU would hold a press conference this afternoon to tell the
fact of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU organized the countrywide strike Tuesday and
Wednesday to press the government into scrapping a 2.5 percentage
sales tax effected late last year, remove developmental levy,
reduce the prices of all basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
The strike closed most of shops, banks and schools in the
country, causing millions of dollars losses.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe Monday said his government would not
tolerate violence in activities organized by the ZCTU. "That is
total madness on the part of the ZCTU to go ahead with the
stayaway."
</P>
<P>
Other ministers condemned the strike as illegal.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asian States Put on "Alert" of Taiwan Authorities' Political Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian countries were
urged to properly handle their ties with Taiwan and remain alert
to the political plot of Taiwan authorities by granting economic
aid, according to Zhu Bangzao, spokesman of China's Foreign
Ministry, who spoke here today at a routine news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's remark came when answering questions on the recent
economic-aid activities by Taiwan authorities among some
crisis-stricken Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the the stance of the Chinese government on the Taiwan
issue is "clear and consistent." "The Chinese government holds no
disagreement on the non-governmental economic contacts between
relevant countries and Taiwan, but strongly opposes official
contacts in any form by countries which have diplomatic ties with
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged countries to respect China's stand in this regard and
to keep their commitment to the "one China" policy in a bid to
safeguard the mutually friendly and cooperative relations for
sound and steady development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government understands the difficulties and context
of certain countries in southeast Asia, he said, adding that China
will not do anything against the interests of those countries.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Taiwan authorities are "in no position
to provide financial aid in any official form or participate in
any official arrangement in the region."
</P>
<P>
He hoped relevant countries would be in a state of high
alertness on the political plot of the Taiwan authorities aimed at
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" by using economic
aid.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that "There is only one China in the world. The
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole,
legitimate government representing entire China, and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China."
</P>
<P>
"Although the territories across the Taiwan Straits have not
yet been reunified, Taiwan's status as part of Chinese territory
remains unchanged and cannot be changed. Chinese sovereignty is
not split and cannot be split," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Lists Opportunities for Thailand's Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) Thursday listed six priorities or opportunities the
current economic crisis has provided for Thailand for its future
recovery.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Assistant
Administrator Nay Htun, who is also Regional Director for Asia and
the Pacific, said the current financial and economic crisis can
provide a powerful catalyst to institute positive fundamental
changes.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the opening ceremony of the consultative
meeting of the social impact of the economic crisis and responses
from the government, private sector, civil society and
international community, which was co-sponsored by the UNDP and
the Office of the Prime Minister of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
UNDP suggested that Thailand make efforts to improve
information, to design interventions with short-term and long-term
pay-offs, to restore the environment, to promote social and
investment fund, to promote the sharing of experience and to
increase attention to spill-over effects.
</P>
<P>
He said the with the necessary improvements Thailand will be
back on the road towards economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Htun also hailed the achievements Thailand and Asia have made
during the past two to three decades in human development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the quality of growth is as important as its
quantity for human development, poverty reduction and long-term
sustainability.
</P>
<P>
"Sustained economic growth and sustained human development can
be mutually reinforcing," he added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Thailand's recovery will also be providing
enhanced and sustained benefits to all the people.

<HEADLINE> Australian Company Exports Smart Cards to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian electronics Omnitech
LTD said Thursday it had supplied 200,000 contactless smart cards
to the Shanghai Transit system, and a further 300,000 cards had
been ordered.
</P>
<P>
Omnitech said it would undergo "considerable growth" with its
contactless smart cards and smart card readers, forecasting
exponential returns above 20 million U.S. dollars from a Chinese
contract.
</P>
<P>
The four-year contract, in conjunction with Cubic Corp of the
United States, was worth about 20 million U.S. dollars to Omnitech
when completed, Omintech Chairman Arthur Sturgess was quoted
Thursday by the Australian Associated Press (AAP) as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said there was potential for additional business using
Omnitech smart card readers on other public transport systems such
as bus and ferry services in China.
</P>
<P>
"If you talk about the expansion of that to bus, ferry and
other transport systems, we are not going to put a figure on it,
but you can see that it's going to grow exponentially," Sturgess
told AAP from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
His chief executive officer, Peter Au, said: "we have discussed
with the appropriate authorities the integration of Omnitech smart
card solutions for the entire Shanghai transport system which
includes rail, bus and ferry."
</P>
<P>
The smart card readers used on the 562-kilometer Shanghai
metro, which services 13 million people, were developed and
designed by Omnitech's subsidiary, VFJ Electronics, in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, the second phase of providing
contactless smart cards and small card readers for China's Guangxi
tollway had started, with final implementation expected later this
year, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Discussions with Chinese officials on supplying similar
technology for two other tollways, Chengdu Highway and Guangzhou
Highway, had also commenced, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
VFJ Electronics had also won a contract to supply more than 700
contactless smart card readers and 4,000 cards to Hong Kong Air
Cargo Terminal LTD for the new Chep Lap Kok Airport, opening in
July, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sturgess also said discussions were taking place in Australia
to provide readers for the VISACash system in Sydney, and
Singapore government was considering a fully integrated transport
payments system.
</P>
<P>
"We see opportunities in all of these areas," he said,
referring to a U.S. report forecasting that the smart card
technology business would be valued worldwide at 30 billion U.S.
dollars in 2003 from its present 1 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Women More Educated Than Men: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli women, aged 25 to 64,
are more educated than men at the same age, according to a latest
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics, showed that 51 percent of women in Israel have
completed a high school or higher education, compared to 47
percent of men.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted for the International Women's day which
falls on Sunday, covered Israel's 2.9 million women, who make up a
little bit more than half of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Israeli women's schooling years went up in the last decade,
reaching an average of 12 years in 1996 as opposed to 10.9 years
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The number of Jewish women who attended college between the
ages of 20 and 29 almost doubled in the past two decades, reaching
11.5 percent in the 1995-96 school year.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said that Israeli women are marrying later than
ever before, and the number of women who do not marry all their
lives has gone up.
</P>
<P>
The average marrying age of Jewish women in Israel was 24.2,
and men got married at an average age of three years older.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, each Jewish woman gave birth to an average of 2.6
children, each Muslim woman in Israel had an average of 4.6 births,
each Christian, 2.6 and Druse, 3.4.

<HEADLINE> Australian Car Sales Remain Strong in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian vehicle market
remained on track for another record year with a jump in sales of
new cars and trucks in February.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI)
said Thursday 62,105 new vehicles were sold last month, an 11.7
percent increase over the 55,605 sold in February last year and up
21.3 percent over the 51,195 retailed in January.
</P>
<P>
The market performance took sales over the first two months to
113,300 units, up 11.8 percent compared to the 101,347 units at
the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
The total sales would jump beyond 800,000 units this year after
reaching a record 722,427 last year if that increase be maintained
over the full 12 months, FCAI said in its car sales bulletin.
</P>
<P>
A strong return to the market by fleet customers and the
continued high levels of competition at the lower end of the
market are generally considered the main reasons for the
improvement so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ongoing economic problems in various Asian
countries, most Asian car producers have been doing better on the
Australian market so far this year.

KAMPALA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan health minister Crispus
Kiyonga appealed for a regional cooperation in the Great Lakes
Region to fight contagious diseases, The Monitor reported
Thursday.

The health minister said that a coordinated attempt is needed

meningitis, plague, typhus and vital haemorrhagic fevers such as
ebola.
</P>

than 30 highly-infected diseases including sleeping sickness,
tuberculoisis, yellow fever and meningococcal meningitis have
been identified in the region in the last 20 years.

However, Elizabeth Madraa, a delegate from Uganda AIDS control
program, said on the four-day conference that HIV/AIDS is still a

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive on Rostrum of Ninth NPC Opening Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), attended the
opening session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's new legislature, as a non-voting delegate this morning.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in history that Hong Kong, which returned
to the motherland on July 1 last year, has sent its head of
government to an annual session of the country's paramount body of
state power.
</P>
<P>
At 8:35 a.m., Tung, in spick-and-span dark suit, was energetic
and beamed with smiles as he came to a lounge at the southern side
of the Great Hall of the People, venue of the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
He came across Defense Minister Chi Haotian and Jiang Enzhu,
head of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch at the gate, who
greeted him with cordial handshakes and an exchange of greetings.
Several photographers aside snapped the scene.
</P>
<P>
Then he sat down beside Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, and they had a
hearty conversation.
</P>
<P>
In the lounge, Wang Guangying, an executive chairman of the NPC
session's Presidium, noticing Tung's arrival, rose from his seat
and greeted the chief executive with a cordial handshake.
</P>
<P>
Almost all new arrivers at the lounge shook hands with this
honored guest invited to the session by the Standing Committee of
the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
When the bell sounded a few minutes before the NPC session
began, President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other top
government leaders, who had been in the other side of the lounge,
walked over to meet Tung and greeted him with cordial handshakes.
</P>
<P>
In the conference hall, Tung was seated on the right flank of
the third row on the rostrum, with Wan Guoquan and Luo Haocai,
chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, one
of China's eight non-Communist parties, sitting next to him.
</P>
<P>
When Li Peng was reading out his government work report, Tung
listened attentively and was seen occasionally marking the lines
with a pencil.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his idea on the current NPC session upon his
arrival in Beijing on Wednesday evening, Tung said it is convened
at the time China is facing major growth opportunities, and that
it will surely contribute to the trans-century development and
prosperity for the country.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR has sent a delegation of 35 deputies to the
ongoing NPC session.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Not to Exclude Russia From Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has no intention to exclude
Russia from Caspian oil projects, local newspaper Daily News
Thursday quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We reminded them (Russians) that it is out of the question for
Turkey to exclude Russia from the Caspian Sea projects," said
Sermet Atcanli, deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials had expressed astonishment at the holding of
the five-nation meeting in Turkish largest city Istanbul, which
focused on the study of the Caspian oil exploitation, arguing all
states around the Caspian Sea should take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and energy officials from Turkey, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan attended the meeting on
March 1-2.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why Russia was not included in the Istanbul
meeting, Atcanli said that the gathering mainly focused on those
countries that would sell oil and where the pipelines would pass
through.
</P>
<P>
Russia will be invited to a more comprehensive meeting
discussing the oil project, he said, without mentioning when and
where the meeting will be held.
</P>
<P>
As an energy-starving country, Turkey has been playing an
active role in exploiting the abundant Caspian oil in order to
meet its rapidly increasing energy demands and also earn foreign
exchange through the pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Georgia have expressed full support for the
1730-kilometer Baku (Azerbaijan)-Ceyhan (Turkey) route which
passes through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline, which is estimated at a cost of 8 billion
U.S. dollars, has an annual capacity of transporting 45 million
tonnes of crude oil to international markets.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Promoting Coal Mine Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is eyeing foreign
funds and equipments to promote its coal mine industry.
</P>
<P>
Advanced coal-mining equipments worth of 14.6 million
U.S. dollars from the United States was introduced Tuesday to
transform its biggest coal mine factory, 120 kilometers away from
Ulan Bator.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia will receive a 35-million-dollar long-term preferential
loan to step up the exploitation of the coal mine industry from
the World Bank under an agreement reached by the two sides,
according to the Mongolian government.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government also will provide Mongolia
with long-term preferential loan worth of 5.8 billion Yuan (46.4
million dollars) to help promote the resource-rich country,
official source said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's coal reserves of the 200 already-exploited coal
mines reach 15.2 billion ton, while the coal output last
year only registered 4.95 million ton.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Bringing Big Change In Central Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The influx of increasing amounts
of overseas investment in central China's Henan Province has given
the local economy a new look.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the province had 5,794 overseas-funded
enterprises, with seven billion US dollars worth of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
The money has helped speed up local infrastructure
construction. Nearly 1.2 billion US dollars of overseas investment
has been used for 38 Sino-foreign joint power plants, which have a
combined capacity of 3.9 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The majority of highways built in recent years were funded by
overseas governments and financial institutions. Henan now has
more than 400 km of expressways.
</P>
<P>
The growth of overseas-funded businesses has provided a large
number of employment opportunities for local people, and they
employ nearly 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
A number of state companies have been transformed and improved
by the use of overseas funding and have been turned into larger
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-backed businesses are mostly involved in light
industry, textiles, machinery, electronics, chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, building materials, agriculture, real
estate, telecommunications, and tourism.

<HEADLINE> 1500-Year-Old Human Skeleton Found in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have
uncovered the 1500-year-old skeleton of a young woman on the
excavated site of a proposed shopping mall outside Nelspruit,
about 400 km northeast of Johannesburg, local daily Sowetan
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
University of the Witwatersrand archaeologist Tom Huffman said
bulldozers on the mall site had exposed the skeleton of a yound
woman, aged between 16 and 24. Her leg and pelvic bones had been
crushed by the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
Another important finding, two cattle kraals near the woman,
put to rest a 20-year-old debate about whether the system of
lobola was practiced in the early Iron Age.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that cattle and lobola, which is the system of
exchanging wives for cattle, were an important part of society in
the early Iron Age," Huffman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said it was known that cattle were important in society
1,000 years ago because cattle bones were abundant at sites
dating from that time, but there were few cattle bones from the
early Iron Age.
</P>
<P>
"This latest find raises a new issue, however, and that is of
the climatic conditions of the area in 500 AD," Huffman said,
noting the remains of grass in cattle dung found in two food pits
at the Nelspruit site were not the same as grass found in the
area today.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Ban Human Cloning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The cloning of human beings
is to be prohibited in South Africa, The Star daily quoted a top
Health Department official as telling parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Director-general of the department, Olive Shisana, said the
new National Health Bill, due to go before cabinet for approval,
would totally outlaw the practice.
</P>
<P>
"We are part and parcel of the world community and the World
Health Organization has taken a decision that, as a general
principle, human cloning is unacceptable. The National Health
Bill is proposing a total ban on human Cloning."
</P>
<P>
The bill, expected to be tabled in parliament before June,
would also outlaw the sale of human organs.
</P>
<P>
Reports that a South African doctor, Mohamed Cassim, attempted
to clone human beings caused a stir in South Africa. But Cassim
later denied the allegations as "bogus."
</P>
<P>
Human cloning became a central issue of debate worldwide after
Scottish scientists cloned a sheep, Dolly, from a cell taken from
the udder of a six-year-old ewe.
</P>
<P>
However, the authenticity of the cloning process is being
questioned by scientists because they failed to repeat the Dolly
experiment.
</P>
<P>
The World Medical Association, an international umbrella of
medical professional groups, has urged doctors and researchers to
abstain voluntarily from participating in the cloning of human
beings until the scientific, ethical and legal issues have been
fully considered.
</P>
<P>
Cloning a human entails removing the nucleus of a human egg
cell and replacing it with the nucleus of a cell from another
part of the body.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steelmakers Develop "Light-weight" Car Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A car body that is 25 percent
lighter than the typical one has been developed, announced
U.S. steel makers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to tell you that from now on the words 'lightweight'
and 'steel' can be used in the same sentence," said Robert
J. Damall, chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Big Three automakers, namely Ford, General Motors and
Chryster, have been researching such lighter vihicles, which can
improve mileage and help reduce emissions vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Some of their high-profile efforts, however, have focused on
car bodies made from aluminum, plastic and fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
The 35 U.S. steel producers, which hold more than 90 percent of
the market for auto bodies, said they want to prove that steel
also can be lightweight.
</P>
<P>
They have spent 22 million U.S. dollars since 1994 to develop
what they call the UltraLight Steel Auto Body.
</P>
<P>
The weight reduction can be achieved at no additional
cost by using higher strength, thinner steel, fewer parts and more
simple frame design and structure, they said.
</P>
<P>
The steel makers urged the Big Three automakers to join them in
designing an even lighter car -- one that would weigh 40 percent
less than midsize cars on the road today.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Ambassador: Qatar-Egypt Ties Back to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Qatar and
Egypt have returned to normal after talks between senior
officials of the two countries, the Egyptian ambassador to Qatar
has said.
</P>
<P>
"Positive signals have emerged from both capitals and now we
can say that the relations are back to normal," local newspaper
Gulf News Thursday quoted Ambassador Mohammed Minessy as saying.
</P>
<P>
Minessy made the remarks after Egyptian Education Minister
Hussein Kamel Bahauddin delivered a letter from Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani
on Tuesday night during a visit to Doha.
</P>
<P>
The letter "which included an invitation for the emir to visit
Egypt" was discussed at the weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday,
the Qatari official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also discussed a telephone conversation between
Mubarak and the Qatari emir on March 1 "about the good relations
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Ties between Doha and Cairo soured after a war of words broke
out between them due to Egypt's boycott against the Qatar-hosted
fourth Middle East and North Africa economic conference last
November in protest against Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
The row was escalated as Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad
bin Jassim bin Jabir al-Thani accused Cairo of being behind a
foiled coup attempt in February, 1996 to topple the Qatari
government. Egypt strongly denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
In last January, Mubarak and the Qatari emir held talks in
Riyadh under Saudi Arabia's mediation, but the talks failed to
reach any settlement.

<HEADLINE> Study Says Working Can Help Combat Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Walking briskly, climbing
stairs, gardening and doing household chores may help prevent
diabetes, according to a study published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Our studies showed that, no matter what the activity is,
increased activity is related to improved insulin sensitivity,"
said Elizabeth Mayer-Davis of the University of South Carolina,
lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
Diabetes occurs when the body is insulin deficient, becomes
impaired in its capacity to use insulin, or both.
</P>
<P>
Researchers analyzed the relationship between insulin
sensitivity -- the body's capacity to use insulin -- and the
exercise among 1,467 men and women aged 40 to 69 in four cities.
</P>
<P>
The study found that even moderate physical activity led to
better insulin sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
Mayer-Davis said the finding is important because people with
diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop heart
disease, and 75 percent of diabetics die of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
She recommended at least 30 minutes of moderate physical
activity everyday, because it "may help the body improve the use
of its own insulin and ward off diabetes".

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker Thursday following selling by Japanese investors.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed here at 67.32 U.S. cents, from
67.82 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia treasury manager Paul Macarounas said
selling interest from Japanese investors had capped the Australian
dollar near the 67.50 U.S. cents level.
</P>
<P>
"By the same token there was reasonably good local bank support
down around 67.25 U.S. cents to 67.30 U.S. cents, so it's been a
very tight range today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said private sector
Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings (AWOTE) rose 0.5 percent to
686.40 Australian dollars (461.94 U.S. dollars), in the three
months to November for an annual rate of 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Public sector AWOTE rose 0.2 percent to 762.60 Australian
dollars (513.22 U.S. dollars), in the same period for an annual
rate of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the release of the data, economists said it was highly
unlikely the Reserve Bank of Australia would raise interest rates,
and that was now a slightly better chance of an easing.
</P>
<P>
A survey of economists by MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's showed the
market considers there is a 17 percent likelihood of a further
rate cut, a four percent chance of a rate hike, and a 79 percent
probability the official cash rate will remain steady at 5.00
percent.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Markets economist Grant Fitzner said wages were not likely
to be a problem for inflation over the coming months, provided
productivity growth remains strong.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rate, the Australian dollar rose to 85.37 from
85.20 against Japanese yen and fell to 1.2216 from 1.2265 against
Deutsche mark.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In an intensified crackdown
against rampant poaching Zambia arrested 1,942 people last year
alone, Times of Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted tourism minister Amusa Mwanamwambwa
as telling parliament Wednesday that of the 1,942 1,427 have been
convicted in courts of law and a total of 98 million Kwacha
(about 65,000 U.S. dollars) has been paid to the treasury in
court fines.
</P>
<P>
The department of National Parks and Wildlife Service
recovered 253 elephant tusks and confiscated 491 military
weapons, 955 muzzle loading guns, 121 shot-guns and 93 sporting
rifles, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 22 officers died in the anti-poaching operations
between 1990 and 1997, of which 12 were shot by poachers, eight
killed by wild animals and two drowned.
</P>
<P>
Last year the department collected 1.75 million dollars from
sport hunting by overseas clients and a 403.55 million Kwacha
(about 269,000 dollars) from protein supplementing hunting by
resident hunters, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the tourism industry continued to grow
appreciably with 10.3 billion Kwacha (about 6.9 million dollars)
pledged to the sector in 1997 with an expected creation of 622
new jobs this year, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Opposes Unilateral Actions to Restrict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is against
unilateral actions taken by the major developed consumer markets
to restrict or boycott the use of tropical timber, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said such actions only rendered the forests valueless as a
source of income and consequently the forests were being cleared
for agricultural and other purposes, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
"In short restrictions on trade in timber products will not
help reduce deforestation in the developing countries. In fact if
efforts are taken by the major markets to provide greater market
access and higher value to timber products, producer countries
would be in a better position to undertake sustainable management
of their forests," Mahathir said when opening the International
Timber Conference 1998 here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the global trade in forest products was estimated
at 114 billion U.S. Dollars and continued to increase in volume
with developed countries dominating this trade, accounting for
about 80 percent of the timber trade.
</P>
<P>
He urged the developed countries to reaffirm and put into
action their commitments to provide new additional financial
resources and environmentally-sound technology transfer to
developing countries for the management of their forest resources
made at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED) and post-UNCED, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia remains convinced that an international
forest convention would provide the necessary legal framework for
ensuring an equitable, transparent and comprehensive mechanism
that balances sustainable forest management, biodiversity and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Such a convention can remedy the problems of legal uncertainty
and lack of predictability currently faced in international
regulation of global forestry," he added.

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The diplomatic section on the
second floor of the main meeting hall of the Great Hall of the
People was packed this morning with foreign embassy officials
invited to observe the opening session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
"China has made conspicious progresses over the past years.
This congress session will set guidelines for its future
development," said Endymion Wilkinson, head of the resident
European Union Delegation in China, while walking to the meeting
hall. "I wish the session a success."

According to officials of the NPC Foreign Affairs Bureau,
attending today's NPC session were a total of 121 foreign
diplomats including 105 ambassadors, a record number for an NPC

<P>
"It's important to manage them well since otherwise there could
be instability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Four New Zealand diplomats, including ambassador Dr. Peter
Adams, came to the session. The ambassador said he was interested
in China's institutional reform.
</P>
<P>
"Such reform has been carried out in New Zealand for the past
15 years. Our goal is to make government smaller and more
efficient. We may learn from each other in this respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many embassy officials said they were impressed by Premier Li
Peng's government work report, as it "gives an overall view of
what the government has accomplished in recent years."
</P>
<P>
Thai ambassador Nikhom Tantemsapya expressed appreciation for
China's pledge not to devaluate the Chinese currency. The Chinese
premier's reiteration to maintain the Chinese currency's exchange
rates helps "disperse all doubts, which will in turn contribute to
stabilizing the financial situation" in Southeast Asia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos: Political Stability to be Restored in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
expressed confidence here on Thursday that political stability can
be restored soon in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said in a statement that as present chairman of the
standing committee of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), the Philippines "values highly" the holding of free
elections and the restoration of political stability in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the forthcoming meeting between the ASEAN
Troika (Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand) and the 'Friends
of Cambodia' will substantially contribute to the attainment of
these goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "Friends of Cambodia" is an informal group whose members
come from the United States, Russia and some European Union
countries. The group held a meeting with the ASEAN Troika last
month in Manila to discuss providing aid to Cambodian elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Foreign Affair Secretary Domingo Siazon reported to
Ramos that the two groups would meet again in Manila on Friday to
discuss the preparations being made for the Cambodian elections on
July 26.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he has taken note of the recent developments in
Cambodia during the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging to hear recent pronouncements from His
Excellency Hun Sen (second prime minister) on Cambodia's
continuing desire to join ASEAN," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos welcomed the decision of Cambodian King
Norodom Sihanouk to return to his country next month, saying the
King "plays a very important rule in unifying the Cambodian people
and in reinforcing institutional arrangements in that country."
</P>
<P>
Other ASEAN members are Brunei, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
Singapore and Vietnam. Cambodia was denied admission to the
regional group last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese VCD Industry Growing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The video compact disc (VCD)
industry of China has witnessed explosive growth during the past
three years, becoming a major money-maker for China's electronics
industry.
</P>
<P>
China produced more than 10 million VCD players last year. The
VCD industry, with a sales volume of 20 billion yuan in 1997,
employs some 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Internal Trade show that, the
number of VCD players sold in the country's major department
stores last year was 10 times the figure of 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 12 percent of households in Beijing, Tianjin and
Shanghai own VCD players. Domestic VCD players account for 87
percent of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
While Chinese-made VCD players are expanding their share of
this emerging market, their prices have also dropped dramatically
during the last three years.
</P>
<P>
A VCD player sold for more than 4,000 yuan in 1995, 2,800 yuan
at the beginning of 1996, 1,700 yuan at the end of 1996, and
finally, to 1,200 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict tougher competition in the VCD market this
year, but that the sector will continue to have good market
prospects.
</P>
<P>
They urged VCD manufacturers to improve technology and
establish better brand-name identification.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) politburo which met
Wednesday was pleased at how most workers defied the trade
union's stayaway by turning up for work in spite of intimidation
by some elements.
</P>
<P>
The Herald daily reported Thursday that Minister of Home
Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said the politburo was, however,
disappointed by some industrialists who aided the stayaway by
locking away their workers during the two days of the industrial
action which was largely unsuccessful as the majority of workers
came to work Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions
organized the national strike to press the government into
scrapping a 2.5 percentage sales tax effected late last year,
remove developmental levy, reduce the prices of all basic
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the land issue was also top on the agenda of
the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will host the East African
Film Festival later this year in a bid to establish Kenya as a
center for distribution of entertainment material in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation Thursday quoted Kenyan Information and
Broadcasting Minister Joseph Nyagah as saying Wednesday that the
festival was part of recent government initiatives designed to
boost the local film industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press briefing for the coming production of
the feature film#,"To Walk With Lions", he said that the
government had streamlined the licensing procedures, initiated
dialogue with the private sector stakeholders and undertaken
promotional tours at international film festivals.
</P>
<P>
The incentives are aimed at making Kenya film-making friendly
to encourage both local and foreign film producers to make films
in Kenya, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that Kenya offered the greatest variety of
filming locations in Africa, but much remained to be done to
improve the film-making environment further.
</P>
<P>
He said that the feature film "To Walk With Lions" which
would cost 10 million U.S. Dollars would greatly market Kenya and
boost tourism in the East African country.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, the film producer, Pieter Kroonenburg,
said that filming would begin next week at Shaba National Park in
Central Kenya and was expected to take nine weeks.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief to Visit Egypt on March 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is due here on March 18 for his first visit to Egypt
since taking the job as chief of the world organization, the
Egyptian Gazette reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Annan's visit to Egypt will be part of a multi-leg Mideast
tour, which will also take him to Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas, the English daily quoted diplomatic
sources here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Annan will discuss with leaders of these
countries a host of regional issues, including means to revive the
Middle East peace process and boosting cooperation between the
world body and these countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe, Annan, with a deal at hand to ease the
Iraqi-U.N. crisis over arms inspection, will confer with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the peacemaking in the Middle East and
the implementation of the U.N resolutions on the decades-old
Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Annan is also expected to hold talks with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on the latest regional and international
developments and envisaged U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
Annan, a Ghanan, who had been working with the world body for
30 years, is the first U.N. chief to assume the office from inside.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Day in 1997, Annan, U.N. undersecretary-general
at that time, replaced former Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian who retired at the end of his five-year
term.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The development zone in Dalian, a
coastal city in east China's Liaoning Province, has become a
popular spot for overseas investors as a result of improvements in
investment conditions.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Li Yongjin said that Last year, the development zone
was ahead of all other development zones in China's coastal areas
with its 506 million US dollars worth of overseas investment, a 41
percent rise from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The zone got 80 overseas-funded projects last year, 22 of which
cost more than 10 million US dollars each, and 32 of which are
technology-intensive ones.
</P>
<P>
It had nearly 3.6 billion yuan in fixed assets investment in
1997, with infrastructure accounting for 1.32 billion yuan of that.
</P>
<P>
The zone spent 18 million yuan on 525,000 square meters of
green spaces, and simplified procedures for overseas-funded
projects and improved services.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agencies Help Zimbabwe's Land Policy Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)
Wednesday signed a 195,000 U.S. Dollar agreement to help the
country in mapping out a new land policy.
</P>
<P>
The money is designed to carry out a study project for
Zimbabwe with the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture, according to
a report from the Zimbabwean News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Zimbabwe's Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said his ministry had a long
and fruitful collaboration with the two U.N. organizations which
had jointly funded the study.
</P>
<P>
He said the national land policy would look at evaluating the
existing administrative and institutional arrangements for land
administration, review the current farm or agricultural land
sub-division policy and recommend the most appropriate criteria
among others.
</P>
<P>
"To this end an international expert and four local experts in
the land policy and land reform have been commissioned jointly by
FAO and the Zimbabwean government to carry out this national land
policy project," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, UNDP Resident Representative
Carlos Lopes said as part of the 1997/2000 country cooperation
framework for Zimbabwe, the UNDP agreed with the Zimbabwean
government to support areas of critical importance to the nation
especially those that resolve poverty alleviation.

<HEADLINE> Water Level of Yangtze River Low in Upper Reaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The water in the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River has been at its lowest level in the past 36
years, while the middle and lower reaches have had record high
run-off levels.
</P>
<P>
Jin Xingping, of the Yangtze River Hydrological Bureau, says
that, in February, the water level of the Jialing River, a major
tributary of the Yangtze, was at its lowest since 1952 and that
the average flow on the upper reaches of the Yangtze was 30 percent
less than the average for the same period in recent years. He
attributes this to drought and decreased rainfall in the valleys
along the upper Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that increased rainfall and run-off along
the middle and lower reaches have something to do with El
Nino. Normally, he explained, rainfall will increase on the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze in the year after El Nino
occurs. However, rainfall and surface run-off on the upper reaches
do not have any clear relation with El Nino.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee shipping on the upper reaches, departments in
charge of shipping have started dredging there.

<HEADLINE> Australians Getting Fatter: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Australians are becoming fatter
with more than half of the male population and almost half of
females overweight, a workshop held in Perth, a southwestern port
city, was told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the National Heart Foundation, is
based on a recently released report, which found 63 percent of
Australian men and 47 percent of Australian women were overweight,
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the National Health and Medical Research
Council, states that Australians have gained two to three
kilograms in the last decade, despite spending an estimated 500
million Australian dollars (340 million U.S. dollars) a year on
diets and weight loss products.
</P>
<P>
National Heart Foundation health promotion director Trevor
Shilton blamed an increasingly sedentary lifestyle for the weight
gain.
</P>
<P>
"The motor car and other labor saving devices mean that over
half the community do not take sufficient daily physical activity
to benefit their health," he said.
</P>
<P>
Health, education, transport and local government
representatives attended the workshop, which was reported to
generate a range of recommendations to prevent further weight gain
in adults.
</P>
<P>
These recommendations, combined with recommendations that come
from workshops in other states, will be presented to the federal
government.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, UNEP Reach Data Communication Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government and the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) have reached an
agreement on the use of the Mercure Satellite Communication
System, UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP boss said Wednesday that the agreement would require
UNEP to pay Kenya 150,000 U.S. Dollars each year for data
transmission services and maintenance of the system.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very, very positive step forward after two-and-half
years of discussions," said Topfer, adding that it was of "vital
importance" that another agreement be worked out to integrate
voice transmission into the system.
</P>
<P>
He noted that unless the new UNEP management proved they could
work in Nairobi cost-effectively, the location of a United
Nations office here could prove a burden.
</P>
<P>
UNEP can only maximize its efficiency if it is able to
establish communication links with other environmental
organizations worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Director pointed out that some of the
organization's main donors had so far invested 15 million Dollars
while UNEP itself had put in a further 5 million Dollars into the
installation of the system.
</P>
<P>
The Mercure network which is the Global Internet for
Environment and Sustainable Development will provide UNEP with a
modern global communications capability for the transfer and
exchange of environmental and administrative data between its
regional centers and the globally distributed environmental
databases and archives of its many partners.
</P>
<P>
The network will make it possible for environmental centers in
developing countries and countries in Central and Eastern Europe
to obtain timely access to environmental data which include maps
and images acquired from environmental satellites and a wide
variety of other sources.
</P>
<P>
Before Mercure came into existence, environmental data was
transmitted through inefficient and expensive long distance
telephone lines and by time-consuming mail deliveries or courier
services.

<HEADLINE> China to Sell 700,000 Personal Computers for Home Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 700,000 Chinese families are
expected to buy personal computers this year, according to experts
with the Ministry of Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
The figure will account for about 17 percent of sales of personal
computers in China this year, one expert said.
</P>
<P>
There has seen a rapid market growth for home-use computers in
the past few years. Statistics show that 61 percent of PC's
nationwide were bought in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The country sold 220,000 home-use computers in 1995, 340,000 in
1996, and 540,000 in 1997, rising over 50 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese families own fewer computers than those in
developed countries because of late development in the country's
computer industry.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing and Shanghai, only six out of one hundred families
own personal computers, compared with 20 in Japan and 38 in the
United States. Endtiem

<HEADLINE> BJP's Prospects to Form India's Govt. Brighten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJT), India's largest political force, has moved closer towards
formation of a new government at the center as efforts by its
opponents to forge a secular alliance have gone rough.
</P>
<P>
BJP claimed Wednesday that it had already secured a "working
majority" of 260 MPs to stake its claim to form a new government
and its target was to obtain an absolute majority of 272 seats or
above in the newly-elected Lok Sabha, the lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Party General Secretary Pramod Mahajan said BJP and its allies
had already obtained the support from half a dozen independents.
</P>
<P>
The BJP and its allies have secured 255 out of the 535
contested seats in the first three phases of the four-phased
elections to the Lok Sabha, which means it at least needs another
21 seats for a clear majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
BJP's opponent, the congress and its allies won 167 seats while
the United Front got 93.
</P>
<P>
The Congress and the United Front have so far still been
divided on whether they should come together to form the next
government while the left parties threw the ball into the
Congress' court, indicating that the United Front should take a
stand after it made up its mind on the formation of a non-BJP
government.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the United Front would take a final
decision Thursday on its stand on government formation.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Supports Anti-pollution Project In Huaihe Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands will provide
grants of nearly three million U.S. dollars to support China's
anti-pollution efforts in the Huaihe River Valley, according to an
official with the National Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
The fund, offered by the Netherlands' Ministry of Economic
Affairs, will mainly pay for a preparatory project for the World
Banks's anti-pollution project in the Huaihe River Valley. The
World Bank has provided China with 400 million dollars in loans to
combat pollution in the valley.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory project, beginning this year for two years,
will cover the draft of an overall plan for pollution control in
the valley, the establishment of mathematical models and control
of urban sewage and industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River, the country's most seriously polluted river,
flows across Henan, Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces. The
government has closed several thousand heavy-polluting factories
such as paper mills and tanneries in the valley.
</P>
<P>
After several years, all the factories in the valley meet the
state's pollution emission standards. China plans to declare the
river clean by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Rate Goes Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate
went up to 7.4 percent in February from 6.4 percent last month,
due to price increase of nearly all commodities, the National
Statistics Office (NSO) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, all the commodity groups recorded
higher inflation rates except for that of housing and repairs, the
NSO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It added that food, fuel, light and water are among the
commodities posting highest inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, the inflation rate for Metro
Manila rose to 8.4 percent from 7.8 percent last month while areas
outside the capital posted a rate of 7.1 percent from 6.0 percent
last month, the NSO said.
</P>
<P>
Economists, who attributed the upsurge of inflation to the
current currency crisis, noticed that the inflation rate in
February was 2.3 percentage points higher than the averaged 5.1
percent in 1997.

upgrading project in Tamu, a Myanmar border town linking India, to
facilitate border trade between the two countries, The New Light

<HEADLINE> Albright for More Constructive Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here Wednesday that her country is for a
more constructive relationship with China in spite of differences
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee on foreign
operations, she said that the United States is working to promote
stability in Asia at a time of uncertainty by solidifying links
with its allies in the region, while seeking concrete steps to
better ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"We also seek to build a more constructive relationship with
China through concrete steps and through our strategic dialogue,"
the secretary told the lawmakers, who are debating over the
budgetary allocations for foreign operations in the financial year
1998.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that China is moving in the right direction,
citing as evidence its commitment to strictly control nuclear
exports and its security cooperation on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
She also spoke highly of China's continued economic reforms,
its positive role in responding to the East Asian economic crisis,
its invitation to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to
visit and its efforts to strengthen the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Albright defended the government's decision to start peaceful
nuclear cooperation with China, saying that China has acted
consistently with its pledge not to assist unsafeguarded nuclear
facilities in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton certified to Congress last month that
China has strictly controlled nuclear exports, in an effort to get
the congressional approval to carry out the long-delayed agreement
on peaceful nuclear cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that China is serious about this commitment," the
secretary replied to skepticism expressed by some House
representatives.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Plebiscite on Puerto Rico's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives narrowly approved a bill on Wednesday that would
grant Puerto Rico political self-determination for the first time
since it becomes a U.S. possession a century ago.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the bill by just 209-208, which still needs to
be approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Alaska Republican Don Young, allows the
Caribbean island to hold a plebiscite by the end of the year on
whether it becomes a U.S. state, breaks away as an independent
nation or remains a U.S territory.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, strongly backed by the Clinton administration,
if a majority of Puerto Ricans vote for statehood or for
independence, the president must submit to Congress a plan for a
10-year transition.
</P>
<P>
"This is a bill that establishes the right of Puerto Rico to
self-determination for the first time in 100 years," said Young.
</P>
<P>
"The 3.8 million citizens in Puerto Rico have waited an entire
century for the United States to provide them with this
opportunity," Young told a news conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
New York Republican Gerald Solomon proposed making English the
only official language in Puerto Rico if it becomes a state, and
requiring Puerto Rican public schools to teach in English.
</P>
<P>
The effort was rejected earlier in the day. The House also
rejected an effort by Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., to allow Puerto
Ricans now living in the 50 states to vote in the special
referendum.
</P>
<P>
The United States took over the former Spanish colony after the
1898 Spanish-American War. Its citizens has no right to vote in

<P>
Another important item on the agenda of the session is to
deliberate on a Plan Concerning Institutional Restructuring of the

</P>
<P>
The Second Plenary Meeting of the 15th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China, held last month, emphasized that
institutional restructuring is a requirement of deepening economic

situation and China's diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, decisive strides have been made in
economic restructuring, and implementation of the open policy has
reached a new level, he said.

<P>
The past five years constitute a good period in the development
of the People's Republic. During this period, China enjoyed
political stability and unity among the people, developed all
businesses and increased its national strength, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
"To sum up, the basic experience we have gained over the past
five years is to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, conscientiously carry out the basic line of the Communist
Party of China for the primary stage of socialism, persist in
making economic development our central task, adhere to the Four
Cardinal Principles, persevere in reform and opening to the
outside world and unswervingly advance along the road to socialism
with Chinese characteristics. This is the basic guarantee for
overcoming all difficulties and obstacles and continuing to
advance in all our undertakings," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
About suggestions on government work in 1998, Li Peng said that
this year is the first year of implementing the spirit of the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China in an all-round
way and an important year for promoting reform, opening to the
outside world and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Through careful discussion and solicitation of views from all
quarters, the State Council now puts forward the following
suggestions on government work in 1998: further stabilize and
strengthen agriculture; make new breakthroughs in reform of
state-owned enterprises; continue to strengthen and improve
macro-controls; do better in opening to the outside world; develop
science, technology, education and cultural undertakings; strive
to improve material and cultural conditions for people in urban
and rural areas; actively restructure government institutions; and
promote the great cause of peaceful reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation and China's diplomatic work, Li
Peng said the Chinese government has all along maintained that
state-to-state relations should be established on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and that disputes should
be settled peacefully through consultations on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
"Resolutely opposed to hegemonism in whatever form, China is
forever an important force contributing to world peace and
regional stability. The Chinese government and people are ready to
work with all other governments and peoples of the world to make
their due contribution to establishing a peaceful, stable, just
and equitable new international political and economic order and
to promoting the lofty cause of world peace and development," Li
Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li's speech was frequently interrupted by applauses.
</P>
<P>
High-ranking leaders Jiang Zemin, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Li
Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Wei Jianxing, Li Lanqing and Rong Yiren were
seated on the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 members of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
attended the meeting as observers. Ambassadors of foreign
countries in China were invited to the meeting, and hundreds of
Chinese and foreign reporters came to cover the opening meeting.

between Yugoslav authorities and leaders of the Kosovo
Albanians. The dialogue should also be attended by representatives
from international organizations, Gjoka added.
</P>
<P>
Such a dialogue will help prevent the escalation of the crisis
and the possible evacuation of Albanians from Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo was an autonomous province that formed part of Serbia
until 1989 when Serbian authorities unilaterally revoked the
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority that has been
seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981. Violence there
has been growing this year following the non-implementation of an
education agreement reached between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and the leader of ethnic Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
Referring to activities made by some political forces in
Albania to support the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Gjoka noted
that the Albanian government opposes any attempts that will lead
to the escalation of the Kosovo dispute.
</P>
<P>
On international efforts to help end the crisis, the spokesman
said Albania should play a more active role in the mediation. But
so far the Albanian government has not yet contacted the Yugoslav
authorities on the issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy to Bosnia Robert Gelbard however said on Wednesday
that the United States might consider a military intervention in
the Kosovo crisis. Since 1989, the Bush administration and the
Clinton administration have threatened to intervene if Yugoslavia
attempts to solve the Kosovo crisis by force.

<HEADLINE> Lower Birth Rate in Italy for Fourth Straight Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy saw a reduced birth rate in
the native population for the fourth straight year in 1996,
Italian Central Institute of statistics (CIS) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A 1996 report on population statistics from CIS said there was
a drop of 21,000 in the number of births of native Italians from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But the total population in Italy increased in 1996 over the
previous year to a total of 57.4 million due to the influx of
foreigners, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the floating population, a phenomenon
rarely observed before in Italy, was remarkable in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.2 million people relocated, mostly from large
cities to small towns, to take advantage of more comfortable
living conditions and a less polluted environment.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Ready to Declassify Dirty Money Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland is prepared to
investigate secret bank accounts opened by Bulgarians for illegal
earnings in an attempt to help Sofia regain stolen funds.
</P>
<P>
The declassification of accounts just depends on Sofia making
an official request, Swiss State Secretary for Foreign Economic
Affairs Franz Blankart said during a visit to Bulgaria on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland had no intention of keeping bank accounts holding
illegal earnings confidential, Blankart told Nadezhda Mihailova,
Bulgaria's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Blankart's remarks gave Sofia hope that at least some of the
money that has been illegally transferred out of the country could
be recovered, said Radko Vlaikov, spokesman of the Bulgarian
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Blankart said at talks with Bulgarian Trade Minister Valentin
Vassilev that his visit is the first of a series of meetings
preparing for the annual conference of the World Trade
Organization (WTO). The aim of the conference in Geneva in late
April is to prepare for WTO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and Switzerland are expanding cooperation in trade and
tourism. Switzerland has been training Bulgarian entrepreneurs and
specialists in export insurance, and funding a water treatment
facility in Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second largest city. Large Swiss
companies, such as ABB and Elektrowaz, are joint partners in
restructuring Bulgaria's hydro-electric plants.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also set up an eco-fund under a
debt-for-environment program. In 1995, the Swiss government wrote
off about 20 million Swiss francs of Bulgarian debt. Sofia pledged
to invest the money in environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
Blankart will also hold talks with Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov, Prime Minister Ivan Kostov and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Market Growing Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese consumer market has
enjoyed stable growth for the last five years, with the sales
rising 180 percent from 1992 to 2.48 trillion yuan last year,
according to a report by the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
With inflation taken into consideration, the Chinese consumer
market grew at an annual rate of 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the 1993-1997 period was characterized by
a buyers' market, with a survey showing that only 10 types of
commodities out of 613 had a shortage of supply in the second half
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the appearance of a buyers' market
promotes the structural readjustment of the national economy as
well as reform in production and distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the abundant supply of commodities to a
sustained industrial growth and good harvests.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years China completely lifted its
control over prices of industrial products as well as prices of
grain, edible oil and other farm products.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the state controls prices for less than 5 percent of
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the rural market and the urban market
enjoyed the roughly same prosperity during the last five years.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on International Situation and Diplomatic Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Faced with a new international
situation, China will as always uphold its independent foreign
policy of peace and open up new vistas in diplomatic work, said Li
Peng today.
</P>
<P>
In his last government work report as premier of the State
Council, Li recalled China's fruitful diplomatic activities over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the First Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) today, Li pointed out that China's friendly
relations and cooperation with other countries and regions have
steadily improved, securing a favorable external environment for
its reform program, open policy implementation and modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
In diplomatic work, he said, China has safeguarded its
sovereignty, territorial integrity and national dignity by
adhering to principles and resisting pressure.
</P>
<P>
China's solidarity and cooperation with developing countries
has further strengthened and its relations with developed
countries have improved. China's international standing has kept
going up, he said.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development remain the two main themes of the world
today, Li said. The international situation is undergoing major
and profound changes. Big powers continue to readjust their
relations. The overall strength of developing countries as a whole
is increasing. The trend towards multipolarity is becoming
increasingly clear.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that international economic links have become tighter
and tighter, and science and technology are advancing by leaps and
bounds, both of which are exerting a major influence on world
political, economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Sino-US relations, Li Peng said President Jiang
Zemin made a successful state visit to the United States last
year, which has ushered Sino-US relations into a new stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the two sides can work together to seek common
ground while putting aside differences and increase cooperation on
the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the Sino-US
Joint Statement so as to promote new substantial developments in
our bilateral relations," Li said.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Russian relations, he said China and Russia signed
Joint Statement by the People's Republic of China and the Russian
Federation on global multipolarization and the establishment of a
new international order and completed demarcation work for the
eastern section of their border in accordance with relevant
agreements.
</P>
<P>
"We should further expand cooperation and exchanges between the
two countries in such fields as economy, trade, science and
technology and step up mutual consultation and cooperation on
international issues," he said.

Development in Sino-Japanese relations has on the whole
maintained a good progressive momentum, he said. "We support Japan
in taking the road to development through peace. We maintain that
it is necessary to draw lessons from history, set our eyes on the
future and properly handle existing problems and disagreements so
as to make fresh improvements in the friendly relationship and
good-neighborly cooperation between the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to develop stable, long-term, mutually
beneficial cooperative relations with the European Union and other
European countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will further develop its friendly and good-neighborly
relations with the countries bordering China. The country will
establish a long-term partnership of good-neighborliness and
mutual trust with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We will maintain our friendly relations with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, promote mutually beneficial
cooperation with the Republic of Korea and strive to maintain
peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula," he said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to develop its friendly relations and
cooperation with countries in South and Central Asia. China will
strengthen its solidarity and cooperation with the vast number of
developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
China will enhance mutual consultation and render mutual
support in regional and international affairs so as to jointly
safeguard the rightful interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The country will explore new ways of economic cooperation and
develop new types of economic relations and trade of mutual
benefit and reciprocity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to play a constructive role in the
affairs of the United Nations. China will actively participate in
the activities of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the
Asia-Europe Meeting and take part in other multilateral diplomatic
activities of a global, intercontinental and regional nature.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that China has all along attached importance to
the issue of human rights and has acceded to 17 international
covenants on human rights.
</P>
<P>
He noted China has already signed the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations and is
now deliberating on accession to the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is China's position to conduct dialogue with various
parties on the basis of equality and mutual respect, but we are
firmly opposed to any attempt to interfere in a country's internal
affairs under the pretext of human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has all along maintained that
state-to-state relations should be established on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and that disputes should
be settled peacefully through consultations on an equal footing.
Resolutely opposed to hegemonism in whatever form, China is
forever an important force contributing to world peace and
regional stability, he said.

The Chinese government maintains that relations between
countries should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful

<P>
China highly appreciates mediation efforts made by UN
secretary-general Kofi Annan for the peaceful solution of the
Iraqi weapons inspection crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China holds that the memorandum of understanding reached
between UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and the Iraqi government

He went on to say that China resolutely opposes hegemonism of
any form and will serve permanently as an important force in

<P>
"The Chinese government and people are ready to work with all
other governments and peoples of the world to make their due

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Problems in Economic and Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, premier of the State
Council, acknowledged today that there are shortcomings and defects
in the work of the government and the Chinese government is fully
aware that there are still quite a few conflicts and problems in
the country's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report at the First Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), Li said his government has tried
to solve these problems in recent years, but the result is far
from satisfactory and some problems have become even more serious.
</P>
<P>
"It remains an arduous task for the government to continue
tackling these conflicts and problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The main problems he cited include the following:
</P>
<P>
-- Quite a number of state-owned enterprises are experiencing
difficulties in production and operation, causing an increase in
unemployment and resulting pressures;
</P>
<P>
-- China's agriculture as the foundation of the economy is
still fragile;
</P>
<P>
-- There is blindness in investment with many redundant
construction projects and the quality and performance of the
national economy as a whole remain poor;
</P>
<P>
-- The supervision and control over finance is imperfect and
the financial order in some areas is somewhat chaotic;
</P>
<P>
-- Uneven regional development is obvious. The distribution of
income needs to be straightened out. A portion of both urban and
rural residents still live under difficult circumstances;
</P>
<P>
-- Current social conduct and public security still short of
the expectations of the people. Bureaucratic behavior divorced
from the needs of the masses and proneness to boasting and
exaggeration divorced from reality are serious problems among some
government functionaries, and corruption, extravagance and waste
are still spreading and growing.
</P>
<P>
-- Population growth and economic development have caused a
great strain on resources and the natural environment continues to
deteriorate in some areas. Some of these problems were left over
from the past and others have emerged in the course of reform and
development.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Calls for Making New breakthroughs in Reform of State Firms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng called for
working hard to achieve new breakthroughs in reform of state-owned
enterprises in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call in his government work report he delivered at
the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
this morning. He devoted about one tenth of his report to
discussing reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Reform of state-owned enterprises is the principal task of the
on-going economic restructuring," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's decision-makers announced last year that through
reform, reorganization, upgrading and improved management, China
will have extricated most large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises operating at a loss from their predicament within
about three years.
</P>
<P>
Li reaffirmed that China will strive to establish
initially a modern enterprise system in the majority of large and
medium-sized state-owned key enterprises by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Guiding ideas and basic tasks for reform of state-owned
enterprises listed by Li Peng are as follows:
</P>
<P>
--Taking reform of state-owned enterprises as the central point
in economic restructuring, China will change the way enterprises
operate, with the establishment of a modern enterprise system as
its orientation.
</P>
<P>
--Guiding enterprises according to their type and aiming at
improving the state sector of the economy as a whole, the Chinese
government will carry out a strategic reorganization of
state-owned enterprises by learning to manage large enterprises
well while relaxing control over small ones.
</P>
<P>
--Exploring various forms for realizing public ownership.
</P>
<P>
-- The central government will combine its efforts to reform
state enterprises with efforts to reorganize, upgrade and exercise
more effective management of them.
</P>
<P>
-- Encouraging mergers, standardizing bankruptcy procedures,
redirecting laid-off workers, increasing efficiency by reducing staff
and implementing re-employment programs.
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting supportive reforms which focus on the
establishment of a social security system.

<TEXT>
<P>
Measures Li Peng proposed in his government work report
include:
</P>
<P>
--Pressing ahead with reform and development of key industries
and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the textile industry, the government will
encourage industries in difficulty to deepen reform, turn their
losses into profits and surmount financial problems.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of preliminary successes in this field, the
central government will spread similar practices to the ordnance,
machinery and other difficulty-ridden industries.
</P>
<P>
In important industries and key fields, the government will
encourage the establishment of large enterprise groups in order to
increase their competitiveness in both domestic and foreign
markets.
</P>
<P>
In the promotion of enterprise groups, market orientation will
be emphasized. Efforts will be made to break departmental,
regional and ownership barriers, support association between
strong enterprises so that they can take advantage of each other's
strength and thereby prevent the practice of simply piecing
together groups and indiscriminately expanding the scale of
operations.
</P>
<P>
The State Council should strengthen financial supervision in
large state-owned enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
--Accelerating the reorganization and readjustment of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government will encourage strong enterprises to merge with
difficulty-ridden ones so as to use resources efficiently. The
government will, in accordance with relevant regulations, declare
bankrupt enterprises which have been operating at a loss for a
long period of time and have no hope of ending such a situation.
</P>
<P>
"We should be resolute in shutting down a number of enterprises
whose products are unmarketable and whose survival is difficult,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Redirecting surplus employees of enterprises is an important
way of raising efficiency, and governments at all levels should
support this endeavor, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
"We shall continue to implement, in selected experimental
cities and key industries, preferential policies that support
enterprises when they carry out mergers and bankruptcies and try
to increase efficiency through reducing staff size," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he said, total capital reserves earmarked for clearing
the bad debts of banks should be raised to 40 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In this endeavor, he said, the government will prevent concealed
avoidance of debt payment so as to protect the security of
bank assets. Both central and local governments should take
measures to reduce the burden of debt on enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to alleviate enterprises' debt
burdens by turning loans and capital construction operational
funds into state capital in relevant enterprises. The government
will turn 50 billion yuan of such debts into state capital this
year.
</P>
<P>
--Actively and steadily carrying out reform involving the joint
share system and the joint stock cooperative system.
</P>
<P>
The government will corporatize large and medium-sized
enterprises in a standard way where conditions permit, allowing
some enterprises to be listed and issue stocks in accordance with
market conditions.
</P>
<P>
In enterprise reform, efforts should be made to delineate the
rights and responsibilities of the state and the enterprise,
improve the enterprise's internal management system, and prevent
the devaluation of state assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng called for relaxing controls over small state-owned
enterprises and invigorating them by way of reorganization,
association, merger, leasing, contract operation, the joint stock
cooperative system and sell-off.
</P>
<P>
"We should make sure that the right to independent operation is
delegated to small enterprises so that they can practice
democratic management, be responsible for their own profits and
losses and adapt themselves to the market in a more flexible way.
We must choose suitable means of reform in light of differing
conditions and refrain from seeking speedy results
indiscriminately," he said.

--Improving the leadership, operation and management of
enterprises. Methods of selecting, supervising, examining,
rewarding and punishing managers should be improved.
</P>
<P>
Personnel of enterprises should change their thinking so that
production, operation and internal management can meet the needs
of the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must attach importance to speeding up technological
progress, developing new products, readjusting the product mix,
improving marketing and after-sale services, striving to reduce
costs, raise quality and become more competitive," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier urged governments at all levels to actively
help enterprises divest themselves of social functions.
</P>
<P>
--Pressing ahead with all other reforms. "We should continue to
readjust and improve the pattern of ownership," he said.
</P>
<P>
While promoting reform and development of the state sector of
the economy, the central government will actively develop various
forms of collective economy in urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The government will encourage and guide individual, private and
other non-public sectors of the economy to grow simultaneously.
Efforts will be made to quicken reform of the social security
system including workers' basic old-age insurance, medical
insurance and unemployment insurance, so as to pave the way for
reform of state-owned enterprises and readjustment of the economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
In the field of distribution, it is necessary to break regional
blockades and trade monopolies, rectify order in the market and
crack down on such illegal acts as producing and distributing fake
or shoddy goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China will press ahead with the agent system.
Association between large production enterprises and distribution
firms and between domestic and foreign trade businesses will be
encouraged so that they will jointly develop markets at home and
abroad, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Assisting laid-off workers to find
new jobs and guaranteeing their basic needs is a pressing task for
the government in 1998, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report he delivered at the First Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress, Li said that in the
process of reforming state-owned enterprises and readjusting the
economic structure, there will be some layoffs, which will cause
temporary hardships and put more pressure on employment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "The potential for employment is great
and, so long as we handle this challenge well, we shall be able to
create more job opportunities."
</P>
<P>
The number of layoffs has increased year by year since the end
of the 1980s. The figure rose to more than 10 million by the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
"We should rely on all quarters of the society to provide
better employment services and vocational training for
re-employment. We should also support laid-off workers in seeking
new jobs on their own and encourage them to become self-employed
or to work in the private sectors of the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
They should be encouraged to engage in and expand badly-needed
community services, property management and household services.
This will involve less investment and quicker results, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for guaranteeing the basic needs of laid-off
workers and show concern for employees in enterprises experiencing
difficulties and also for retired employees who are struggling
financially.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China should accelerate the establishment of a
minimum standard of living for impoverished urban residents, he
said.

<HEADLINE> China to Restructure Government Institutions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's highest
governing body, has drafted a restructuring program which calls
for the 40 existing ministries and commissions of the State
Council to be reduced to 29, According to Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Li unveiled the program in his government work report he delivered
at the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
today.
</P>
<P>
China has undergone restructuring of government institutions on
three occasions since the end of 1979, respectively in 1982, 1988
and 1993, which have produced positive results, he said. However,
the incompatibilities of government institutions with the
development of a socialist market economy have become increasingly
apparent.
</P>
<P>
Unwieldy organization and failure to separate the functions of
the government from those of the enterprise have given rise to
bureaucracy, bred unhealthy practices and created a heavy
financial burden, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted restructuring government institutions is urgently
needed to deepen economic restructuring and promote economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
"It constitutes an important aspect of reform of the system of
leadership of the state and is also a necessity in bringing the
government closer to the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the Chinese government will carry out this reform
in accordance with requirements for developing a socialist market
economy and by following the principles of simplification,
uniformity and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
China will alter the functions of the government and separate
them from those of the enterprise so as to establish a highly
efficient, well-coordinated and standardized administrative
system, he said.

<P>
The country will improve the system of public servants,
building a contingent of administrators who are highly competent
and professionally specialized.
</P>
<P>
In restructuring the State Council, he said, China will focus
on reorganizing or canceling departments directly in charge of
economic management and reinforcing departments handling
macroeconomic controls and those enforcing the law and supervising
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
This reform involves greater changes for both institutions and
people than similar previous reforms, he said. It should therefore
be handled persistently, prudently, patiently and carefully, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Government functionaries, he said, are fairly well-qualified
and most have professional expertise, so they are a very valuable
asset for China, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will adopt the methods of "channeling cadres while
allowing them to enjoy their original material benefits, providing
job-oriented training, replenishing enterprises and optimizing the
structure."
</P>
<P>
By doing so, he said, these cadres can play a full role in
industrial, commercial and banking enterprises, in law-enforcement
institutions, in cultural, educational and public health
institutions, and in other organizations.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng urged local governments at all levels to simplify their
structure and streamline their staff from top to bottom, step by
step and in an orderly way.
</P>
<P>
"We should strengthen legislation relating to administrative
institutions in order to statutorily delimit the structures,
functions, sizes and working procedures of governments at all
levels," he said.

<HEADLINE> Another Ten Million Needy People to Shake Off Poverty: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- More than ten million needy people
in China's rural areas will have adequate food and clothing this
year, Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his s Government Work Report at the openning session of the
Ninth NPC, Li said that in 1978, there were 250 million
impoverished people in the countryside, who accounted for one
quarter of the people in need around the world.
</P>
<P>
Along with China's reform and opening-up and poverty
alleviation by the government, the population of the poor in the
rural areas became 65 million in 1995, who took up one-twentieth
of the world's poor people.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, 15 million people shook off poverty.
As a result, the number of the impoverished has been reduced to 50
million.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have
announced that all the needy in the rural areas will have adequate
food and clothes by the end of the century. Consequently, many
measures have been taken for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Li Peng called on local governments to further
strengthen their leadership in anti-poverty work, increase input,
improve conditions for production in impoverished areas, and
support the development of planting, breeding, forestry, fruit
growing and the processing of agricultural and sideline products
which directly provide the needy with adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Assistance should be provided especially to villages and
households that are exceedingly poor and needy, Li said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua)--The reunification of China is an
irreversible historical trend and the Taiwan question will surely
be resolved, Li Peng, premier of the State Council, said today.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered at the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), Li Peng said: "We hope
that the Taiwan authorities respond as early as possible to our
solemn appeal that the two sides conduct political negotiations
under the principle of one China."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is an inalienable part of the inviolable territory of
China," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We will as always adhere to the basic principles of 'peaceful
reunification' and 'one country, two systems' and to the
eight-point proposal put forward by President Jiang Zemin on
developing cross-Strait relations and promoting the peaceful
reunification of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will spare no efforts in expanding exchanges and
cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in
economic, scientific, technological and cultural areas and promote
mutual visits of people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will make joint efforts with our compatriots in Taiwan to
firmly oppose any splittist activities aimed at bringing about the
'independence of Taiwan' and creating 'two Chinas' or 'one China,
one Taiwan'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities take
into consideration the overall interests of the Chinese nation and
the fundamental interests of the people in Taiwan, take concrete
steps for the early establishment of direct links of postal, air
and shipping services and trade between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's future hinges on the reunification of the
motherland," he said.

<HEADLINE> Petroleum Revenues Fall in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Compared to January 1997, the
Central Bank of Venezuela's income was reduced by 560 million
U.S. dollars in January this year as a result of a decline in
petroleum income.
</P>
<P>
The decline in revenue was attributed to a reduction in
petroleum prices on international markets beginning last December,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum price plunge, which affected the net income
received by the Central Bank, has caused a reduction in the
national budget of about 1.3 billion dollars. The petroleum
budget in Venezuela has also been affected.
</P>
<P>
The oil price was 16 dollars per barrel before December 1997.
The average price of crude oil in January was 13.05 dollars per
barrel and 12.18 dollars in February, the Ministry of Energy and
Mines said.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Economy Expects 11 Percent Growth for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- While economists predict an eight
percent growth for the Chinese economy this year, officials in
east China's Shandong Province are expecting the local Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) to grow by 11 percent or more in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Li Chunting, governor of Shandong who is attending the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) as a deputy
to the congress, said that Shandong is capable of maintaining high
economic growth with its developed basic industries and
highly-competitive enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Shandong scored an economic growth of 11.2 percent last year,
while the average growth for the whole country was 8.8 percent. In
1997, the total and per capita GDP for this coastal province
respectively reached 665 billion yuan (about 80 billion US
dollars) and 8,000 yuan (about 1,000 US dollars), nearly double
the 1992 figures.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Lin Shuxiang, director of the planning commission of the
Shandong provincial government, said that despite the impact of
the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, Shandong's exports are
expected to reach 15 billion US dollars this year, a 10 percent
rise over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to invest 200 billion yuan (about 24 billion
US dollars) in fixed assets in 1998, 15 percent more than in the
previous year, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the service industry would continue to
be the province's fastest-developing sector this year, with an
expected growth rate of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, only less than 20 percent of Shandong's urban labor
is engaged in the service sector. If this percentage can be raised
to 30, the problem of laid-off workers will be basically solved in
Shandong," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li the governor, Shandong plans to raise its
provincial and per capita GDP to 1.03 trillion yuan and 11,400
yuan by 2002.

Agriculture will be further stabilized and strengthened. The
total grain output should be stabilized at 492.5 billion kg, and

In 1998, Li said, China's priorities in the reform of the
financial system are to improve and strengthen the financial
control and supervision by the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
The country will do better in opening to the outside world and
continue to utilize foreign funds actively, rationally and
effectively.
</P>
<P>
"We should guide foreign investment toward agriculture,
infrastructure, basic industries, high and new technology
industries and export-oriented projects. We should encourage
foreign businessmen to further invest in the central and western
regions of China," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
It must keep to the principles of maintaining an equilibrium in

their basic needs is a pressing task for government in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We should rely on all quarters of society to provide better
employment services and vocational training for re-employment.
We should also support laid-off workers in seeking new jobs on
their own and encourage them to become self-employed or to work
in the private sectors of the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
They should be encouraged to engage in and expand badly-needed
community services, property management and household services.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here that
priorities in the reform of China's financial system in 1998 would
be to further improve and strengthen the financial control and
supervision by the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to exercise more effective centralized
management of state-owned commercial banks, develop regional
commercial banks systematically including urban ones and deepen
the reform of credit cooperatives in urban and rural areas and to
straighten out and improve the supervision and management of
securities, Li said in his government work report to the First
Session of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue our appropriately tight monetary policy.
We should improve the means of financial control, make timely
and appropriate adjustments and optimize the loan structure to
support the reform and development of large and medium-sized
enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
Loans for small state-owned enterprises and enterprises with
other types of ownership will be increased as appropriate to
promote the readjustment of the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Issuing shares and bonds is an important way in which
enterprises raise funds.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted,"We must ensure that they do this in strict
accordance with regulations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state should give priority to large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises in this regard. Unqualified
enterprises should be prevented from issuing shares and bonds so
as to protect investors.
</P>
<P>
"We should improve financial statutes, rectify and
standardize the financial order, vigorously enforce discipline
in settling accounts, tighten internal management of financial
institutions and arrest illegal financial activities," the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the financial crises in Southeast Asia have
affected many countries. As the momentum of China's economic
development is good, its financial situation has remained
stable, as have the exchange rates for the Renminbi against
other currencies.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he noted, "We can learn a lesson from these
crises and take effective measures to prevent and eliminate any
undesirable impact they might have on our economy. All our
financial institutions should improve the ranks of employees by
raising their political and professional competence.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Sums Up Five-Year Experience (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng summed up the experience
of the fruitful government work in the last five years during his
last term as the Chinese premier at the First Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the basic experience is to hold high the great banner
of Deng Xiaoping Theory, conscientiously carry out the basic line
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) for the primary stage of
socialism, persist in making economic development our central
task, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, persevere in the
reform and opening to the outside world and unswervingly advance
along the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"This is the basic guarantee for overcoming all difficulties
and obstacles and continuing to advance in all our undertakings,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the work of the government in the past five years,
Li has formulated the following ideas:
</P>
<P>
-- First, adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the
minds and seeking truth from facts;
</P>
<P>
-- Second, balance reform, development and stability;
</P>
<P>
-- Third, give full play to the role of the market mechanism
and strengthen and improve macroeconomic control;
</P>
<P>
-- Fourth, implement the strategies of developing the
country by relying on science and education and of achieving
sustainable development;
</P>
<P>
-- Fifth, adhere to the principle of doing two types of work at
the same time, attaching equal importance to both.
</P>
<P>
In its efforts to carry out reform, opening up and the
modernization drive, he said, China will proceed from the actual
situation of being in a primary stage of socialism and take its
own road.
</P>
<P>
"We should assimilate all advances of other countries but
not blindly follow what the books say, nor can we mechanically
imitate other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should break away from old concepts, respect the people's
pioneering spirit, make bold experiments and actively explore the
way forward," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we should act in accordance with objective
laws, correctly appraise situations and strive for practical
results," he said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Sums Up Five-Year Experience (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We should seize opportunities and engage in ventures which we
know to be sound and, at the same time, we should earnestly review
experience and remain fully aware that reform and development will
be protracted, arduous and complex; hence we should plan our work
carefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By combining our sense of urgency about speeding up the reform
and development with a scientific and practical orientation, we
can shorten our journey and avoid heavy losses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that "reform is the motive force for development. We
should lose no time in promoting reform in all spheres in
accordance with the criterion of the 'three favorables' and solve
the outstanding problems in our economic and social development."
</P>
<P>
Development is the aim of reform and it is a guarantee for
stability. The key to the solution of all China's problems lies in
our own development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stability is the prerequisite of reform and development, he
said, adding that "we should promote reform and development amid
social and political stability and we should secure social and
political stability through reform and development."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the role of the market mechanism and macroeconomic
control, Li said China has learned that this is important in
maintaining rapid economic growth and effectively curbing
inflation in our country over the years.
</P>
<P>
To develop a socialist market economy, he said China must allow
the market to play its basic role in the allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
"If this is not done, economic development cannot be dynamic.
The market is unplanned and has its limitations, so the government
must manage and guide it through macroeconomic control. If this is
not done, there will be economic chaos," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng called scientific and technological progress a decisive
factor in economic development. Only by vigorously developing
education and science and technology and really setting forth on
the path of developing our economy by relying on scientific and
technological advancements and improving the quality of the
laborers can China accelerate the process of modernization and narrow
the gap between China and the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
China must correctly handle the relationships between economic
development on the one hand and population, natural resources and
the environment on the other, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country should rationally exploit our natural resources
and make comprehensive use of them, protect and improve the
ecology and ensure that economic development meets our needs and
will benefit future generations.
</P>
<P>
In developing a market economy and opening to the outside
world, he said China is confronted with a new situation and new
tasks in promoting socialist cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
In concentrating on promoting economic development, he said "we
are prone to neglect the promotion of cultural and ethical
progress."
</P>
<P>
"We should incorporate cultural and ethical progress into the
overall plan for national economic and social development,
guarantee the necessary resources and make unremitting efforts in
this regard," he said.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The member states of the Common
Market of the South (MERCOSUR), together with Bolivia and Chile,
expressed their support and congratulations for the unanimous
approval by the Security Council of the U.N.-Iraq deal.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the latin American organization, which
was established in 1991 between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, said they hope the peaceful solution to the weapons
inspections crisis in Iraq will bring a long-lasting and stable
peace to the gulf region.
</P>
<P>
They also spoke highly of efforts made by the United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan to negotiate the peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote Monday night, the 15-member U.N. Security
Council adopted the resolution drafted by Britain and Japan that
declares "any violation (of the agreement) will have the severest
consequences for Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Under the Memorandum of Understanding signed by Annan and Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on February 23, Iraq has agreed
to grant a U.N special group free, unconditional and unrestricted
access to its presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted Monday does not spell out what the
consequences will be if Iraq violates the agreement on weapons
inspections, but U.S. officials state that any further violation
by Iraq will provide strong support for a military strike.

<HEADLINE> China to Stabilize and Strengthen Agriculture, Says Li Peng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to take
effective measures to ensure another good harvest, increase
peasants' incomes and maintain social stability in rural areas,
said Premier Li Peng today.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report given to the First Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here today,
Li said, "Agriculture has a direct bearing on our overall
situation. We should never neglect agriculture because of good
harvests over the years or because there is an adequate supply of
agricultural products."
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China plans to produce 492.5 billion kg of grain, four
million tons of cotton, both of which match the 1997 figures.
</P>
<P>
With a view to the market as our orientation, he said China will
readjust and optimize the structure of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, the Chinese government will take
the initiative to promote an industrial management of agriculture,
widen the channels of distribution, integrate the production,
processing and marketing of agricultural products and have all
these factors support each other to ensure that peasants can
derive income from production and benefit from the processing and
marketing of their products.
</P>
<P>
Reforming the grain purchasing and marketing system is an
important task in 1998 and we should go about this
conscientiously, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng also addressed the importance of the role of science
and technology for increasing agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to strengthen the agricultural
infrastructure, Li said. Different measures will be taken in line
with different conditions and priorities emphasized in water
conservancy construction projects.

In the south, he said China will concentrate on preventing
floods, and in the north the country will concentrate on fighting
droughts.
</P>
<P>
China will tighten control over water resources and implement
the system of charging for their use to encourage more economical
consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged governments at all levels to increase investment in
agriculture, guarantee water conservancy construction funds and
encourage farmers and rural collectives to increase their input
through labor and investment.
</P>
<P>
He told the NPC delegates that the Chinese government will
redouble its efforts to increase farmland improvement projects,
plant trees and grass, control soil erosion and improve conditions
for agricultural production and the ecology.
</P>
<P>
It will strictly control the land used for urban and rural
construction projects, implement a basic farmland protection
system and attend to the protection of arable land in earnest,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China will also promote the development of town and township
enterprises, especially those in the central and western parts of
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should keep stable the household responsibility contract
system with remuneration linked to output, carry out the policy of
prolonging the land contract period for another 30 years and
earnestly endeavor to lighten the burden on farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, he noted that China will strengthen political
power at the grass-roots level and self-government organizations
of the villagers and improve relations between cadres and the
masses. All this is an important guarantee for developing the
rural economy and maintaining rural stability, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks 1.85 Billion Dollars for Bosnia, Gulf Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
asked Congress on Wednesday for extra 1.85 billion U.S. dollars to
pay for U.S. military deployments in Bosnia and the Gulf during
the current fiscal year, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
The money is part of a broader 2.49 billion U.S. dollars
supplemental request for funds during fiscal 1998, which ends on
September 30.
</P>
<P>
The request includes 1.36 billion U.S. dollars for the 36,000
U.S. troops in the Gulf who are poised to move against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton sought no money for keeping them in place into
the new fiscal year, which begins on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The request also includes 487 million U.S. dollars for the
Bosnia deployment and 642 million U.S. dollars to help cope with a
slew of recent U.S. natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton also asked the Republican-controlled
Congress for an extra 1.86 billion U.S. dollars to fund the U.S.
forces in Bosnia during fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has 8,500 troops in Bosnia. But it expects to reduce
the number to 6,900 later this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Attain Eight-Percent Economic Growth Rate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua)-- China's main objectives for
macro-control over the national economy in 1998 are having an
economic growth rate of eight percent and keeping the retail price
increases below three percent, said Premier Li Peng today.
</P>
<P>
"These objectives embody the spirit of seeking progress amidst
stability," he said at the First Session of Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"If they are achieved, China will be able to maintain the good
momentum of development featuring high economic growth and low
inflation," he said.
</P>
<P>
China achieved 8.8 percent increase in economic growth rate in
1997 and 0.8 percent in retail price increase. The average annual
economic growth rate reached 11 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriately increased investment constitutes an important
condition for sustained, rapid and sound development of the
national economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the annual conference of the country's legislative body
that total investment in fixed assets this year is planned to
increase by 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
China will focus investment on agricultural, forestry and water
conservancy projects while continuing to strengthen the
construction of energy, transportation, communications,
environmental protection and other infrastructural facilities.
</P>
<P>
More input should be made in high and new technology industries
and the proportion of investment in technological upgrading should
be increased. The construction of ordinary civil housing should be
accelerated, he said.
</P>
<P>
In investing in infrastructure, he said, the Chinese government
will make sure that infrastructural facilities are rationally
distributed, tapping the potentials of existing facilities and
refraining from blindly building new ones.
</P>
<P>
The central government will support the development of
resources and major infrastructural construction in the central
and western regions of the country and stress efficiency in
utilizing this investment. We must strictly control the number of
new projects.
</P>
<P>
In principle, he said the central government will not launch
additional ordinary industrial projects, but concentrate its
strength on accelerating the construction of those projects under
construction which have good market prospects and are expected to
be economically efficient.

To promote the upgrading of their products, he said the Chinese

high and new technology equipment.
</P>
<P>
The central government will better guide enterprises to set and
adjust the direction of their investments according to market
needs through industrial policies and the publishing of relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
China will press ahead with the reform of housing, taking
effective measures to promote its commercialization and making the
construction of civil housing a new point for economic growth,
he said.
</P>
<P>
China will deepen the reform of its investment and fund-raising
systems, improving and strictly implementing the project capital
system and delineating responsibilities concerning investment and
fund-raising risks.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that China will continue to carry out an
appropriately tight financial policy. Financial and economic
discipline should be enforced. Efforts should be made to increase
revenues and cut expenditures, keep the scale of debts under
control and further reduce deficits.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report, Li said China will strictly
control the management of taxation. The government will levy taxes
according to law and tighten tax collection and management,
resolutely fighting tax evasion, tax fraud and smuggling and
ensure that taxes owed to the government are paid so as to reduce
non-payment of taxes.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to deepen the reform of our financial and
taxation systems. The income tax system should be improved and the
sales tax should be readjusted. Inheritance tax will be
introduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will also improve the accounting system, tighten the
financial management of enterprises, exercise more effective
auditing and supervision and ban all kinds of arbitrary charges.
</P>
<P>
With a view to keeping expenditures below revenues, he said
China will strictly control expenditures. Relief funds for natural
disasters and re-employment and anti-poverty funds should be
increased appropriately, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Latrell Sprewell's suspension was
reduced by an independent arbitrator on Wednesday, and the former
All-star could stay in the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
Arbitrator John Feerick, dean of Fordham University Law School,
ruled that Sprewell would return to the Warriors on July 1, and
must be paid the 17.3 million U.S. dollars remaining on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell, who assaulted Warriors' coach P.J. Carlesimo five
months ago, however, has to stay away from this season to have his
ban extended to 68 games and a cost of 6.4 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Warriors must offer him the remaining two years on the contract
or trade him.
</P>
<P>
Feerick's decision came 16 days after the close of a hearing on
the case Sprewell conducted in Portland, Oregon, and in New York.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell, who was a top guard in NBA, was originally banned for
one year had his contract suspended -- the longest non-drug ban in

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Wednesday that any U.S. bombings of Iraq would not deter
U.N. weapons inspectors to go back to that country for searching
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
She was answering a question at a House panel's hearing from
Sidney Yates, a Democratic representative, when the Clinton
administration would follow up any bombing campaign of Iraq once
it was seen as breaking away from its commitment to comply with an
agreement on weapons inspection, reached with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan last week.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if (Iraq) breaks the agreement now, there will be
much greater support for our use of force than there was before,
and therefore more support in terms of pressing (Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein to allow potentially the inspector to go back in,
even after a bombing," she said. (US-Iraq-Arms Inspection)

Gelbard indicated Washington has not changed its long-standing
policy to respond militarily if the Balkan war in the province
breaks out.

<P>
In 1989, violence occurred in Kosovo, where Albanians make up
90 percent of its population. The Bush administration, then

BONN -- The German parliament Wednesday gave preliminary
approval to a bill which will reverse an estimated several hundred
thousand convictions of the courts in Nazi Germany more than 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It is unworthy of a state which abides by the rule of law...
when convictions still stand which were clearly based on Nazi
injustice", said Justice Minister Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which still needs the parliament's final
approval, will lift all convictions of Nazi's notorious
Volksgericht (People's Court), which was set up in Berlin to give
quick verdicts to accused traitors.
</P>
<P>
It will also quash convictions of temporary courts set up
shortly before the 1945 Nazi defeat and all other convictions
leading to the death penalty or based on 57 Nazi laws.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Wednesday evening met

the implementation of the agreement signed by U.N. Chief Kofi
Annan and Iraq on arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq, who arrived here Tuesday evening, handed over
President Jacques Chirac's letter to Saddam during the
meeting. Saddam said he would write a letter in reply and send his
special envoy to Paris with the letter.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq, also secretary general of French Foreign Ministry,
stressed the significance his country attaches to the complete and
rapid implementation of the agreement signed late last month by
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq agrees to grant a special U.N.
inspection group free, unconditional and unrestricted access to
its presidential palaces. The group will comprise of senior
diplomats appointed by Annan and experts drawn from the

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Deputies Satisfied with Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators attending the
First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) that
opens today say that they are extremely satisfied with the
country's current economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"In the past five years, the Chinese economy has recorded the
most rapid and sound growth in history," said Xie Qingjian, a
deputy to the Ninth NPC from east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The current fine economic situation of high growth and low
inflation indicates that the incumbent Chinese government is
highly competent and all measures it has taken to develop economy
are successful, added Xie, president of the Zhejiang Provincial
Branch of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the socialist market economic system has taken
initial shape in China and new reform steps are expected to be
taken in the economic field, I confide in our country's future,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Houjian, an NPC deputy from Qingdao, a coastal city in
east China's Shandong Province, said it's a miracle that China
last year scored a high economic growth of 8.8 percent while
successfully controlling inflation.
</P>
<P>
President of Hi-sense, a successful hi-tech enterprise, Zhou
attributed the fast development of his company in recent years to
China's favorable macro-economic environment, as well as reforms
of tax and foreign trade systems, unified exchange rate,
rectification of financial order and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yumei, a 25-year-old female farmer from Shandong, is now
running a conglomerate specialized in rabbit breeding, with annual
profits of more than 6.5 million yuan (783,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Without the policy that encourages the growth of private
business, it would have been impossible for me to make a fortune
by raising rabbits. And my enterprise won't be so successful
without the fine economic situation in these years," she
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Yuen Mo, a deputy from the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region which returned to China on July 1 last year, said that he
was deeply impressed by the tremendous economic achievements of
the interior areas over recent years.
</P>
<P>
"It's already not easy to provide ample food and clothing for
more than 1.2 billion people. It's more amazing at high growth and
low inflation that have been scored for the national economy.
I'm really proud of my motherland," he noted.

ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Juventus came back to level with
Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine with a late goal from Filippo Inzaghi for a
1-1 home draw in the first leg of the European Cup quarter-final
in Turin, Italy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inzaghi, whose another late goal also salvaged Juventus'
quarter-finals berth in a clash against Manchester United in
December, fired home in the 76th minute when his header was
stopped by goalkeeper Olexander Shovkovsky.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Andriy Gusin put Dynamo ahead in the 57th minute.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, last year's finalists in European Cup, still had not
find their striking power as Inzaghi and Alessandro Del Piero
missed several chances to change the scoring mark.

CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's second largest company BHP's market value surged
1.58 billion US dollars Wednesday after its Chief Executive John
Prescott resigned with a payout package estimated at 13 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Federal Treasurer Peter Costello resisted calls
for big-spending federal budget for the coming fiscal year
Wednesday despite the Asian crisis taking its toll on Australia's
exports and reducing the prospect of job growth.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The resignation of BHP's Chief Executive John Prescott opens
up possibility that a non-Australian will take the reins of the
largest resources company in Australia, which despite a savaging
of its share prices is still a 21 billion US dollar colossus.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian economy is losing momentum even before the
full force of the Asian crisis hits home, with new figures
revealing that economic growth slowed in the last three months of
1997.

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A Miami-Dade County circuit
court judge in Florida Wednesday ruled last November's Miami
mayoral election is void and ordered a new election be held in 60
days.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas Wilson said there was sufficient evidence of
tampering with absentee ballots to taint the election of Xavier
Suarez, who defeated incumbent mayor Joe Carollo, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The new election will cost the city between 100,000 and 125,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, in his ruling, Wilson made it clear he felt Suarez did
not know of the vote tampering.
</P>
<P>
Miami's city charter calls for the city commission to appoint
an interim mayor.
</P>
<P>
Carollo had hoped Wilson would throw out the absentee ballots
and declare him the winner.
</P>
<P>
Two investigations of the election are still in progress by the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Miami-Dade State
Attorney's Office.

LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading fertility experts said
Wednesday that cloning is unlikely to work as a helping technique
for infertile couples in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any role for cloning for at least five
years, until many more animal studies have been done and we
understand exactly what is involved," said professor Robert
Edwards, who helped to produce the first test tube baby in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He told a symposium that the use of cloning in humans may be to
understand human system better, not to clone people.
</P>
<P>
Other experts attending the symposium, which is to mark the
20th anniversary of the birth of the world's first IVF (in vitro
fertilization) babies, agreed with professor Edwards.
</P>
<P>
Professor Robert Winston, a British fertility expert, said that
he also doesn't think there are any implications for human
fertility of any significance.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 270 Million U.S. Dollars Disbursement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Wednesday approved a payment of 270 million U.S. dollars
from its 3.9 billion dollar package to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a statement the
fund approved the loan at a board meeting after the Executive
Directors "strongly commended the Thai authorities for resolutely
implementing the economic program in very difficult
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, welcoming the decision, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin also issued a statement, saying that "as a sign of our
continued confidence in the commitment of the Thai Government to
reform,the United States would be prepared, if circumstances
warrant, to support additional IMF financing for Thailand in the
form of access to the IMF's Supplemental Reserve Facility."
</P>
<P>
"This step is designed to reinforce the positive developments
in Thailand by making it clear that access to additional resources
will be provided if needed," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The facility was used for the first time in an international
rescue package for South Korea last year. The short-term facility
allows countries to borrow more than is available under normal IMF
programs and charges higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The IMF payment was the third installment of the IMF's loan to
Thailand, and it means the disbursements total some 2.7 billion
dollars to Bangkok so far.
</P>
<P>
The loan forms part of a 17 billion international rescue
package which also includes money from the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and some other Asian states.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the IMF board had also approved changes to
earlier economic targets, allowing a Thai budget deficit of two
percent of gross domestic product and stepping up efforts to
strengthen the financial system.
</P>
<P>
Directors supported key modifications which are "aimed at
alleviating the impact of the sharp economic downturn and
strengthening the currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said Thailand appeared to have adequate funds to keep
the currency steady and maintain adequate foreign exchange
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Inspections Continue Even After Bombing Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Wednesday that any U.S. bombings of Iraq would not
deter U.N. weapons inspectors to go back to that country for
searching of weapons of mass destructions.
</P>
<P>
She was answering a question at a House panel's hearing from
Sidney Yates, a Democratic representative, when the Clinton
administration would follow up any bombing campaign of Iraq once
it was seen as breaking away from its commitment to comply with an
agreement on weapons inspections, reached with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan last week.
</P>
<P>
"I think that if (Iraq) breaks the agreement now, there will be
much greater support for our use of force than there was before,
and therefore more support in terms of pressing (Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein to allow potentially the inspector to go back in,
even after a bombing," she said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have said bombing may result in Iraq barring U.N.
inspectors for good. This is also an issue that critics of the
U.S. Iraq policy have repeatedly raised.
</P>
<P>
Sonny Callanhan, a Republican representative and the chairman
of the House of Representative Appropriations Subcommittee, said
some members of Congress were "grossly disappointed" that
"countries that have been huge recipients of American aid in the
past" had not readily backed the U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to several Arab countries that were ambiguous
about using military force against Iraq when Albright and Defense
Secretary William Cohen talked with the leaders of these
countries.
</P>
<P>
But Albright said she was "comfortable" with the level of Arab
support for the U.S. policy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I have to tell you that both Secretary Cohen and I feel
comfortable with the support that we are getting from them,"she
said.
</P>
<P>
"We actually got what we considered good statements of
support," she said. But "they are in the neighborhood with the
bully... and therefore their statements to some extent are
tailored to that regard," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright dismissed suggestions that diplomats accompanying
weapons inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission on visits to
sensitive sites might tip off Iraq in advance on when searches
were coming.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a system whereby the diplomats will not be in a
position to warn anyone," she said.

<HEADLINE> Students in UK Walk Out in Protest on Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of students
across Britain boycotted the class Wednesday to protest against
the government's plans to charge 1,000 pound-a-year tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
The National Union of Students said the students picketed
college entrances, distributed leaflets in towns and released
thousands of anti-tuition fee balloons.
</P>
<P>
Until the coming September, the higher education in Britain is
free.
</P>
<P>
Students' response to its call for a walk-out at more than 150
colleges and universities across the country had far exceeded
expectations, the students union said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Government ministers explain the fees are necessary to fund
further expansion of higher education, and only one-third will
actually have to pay the full amount because the fees are means
tested.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Pushed by U.S. Weapon Makers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. weapons makers are playing
a leading role in lobbying for the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), the World Policy Institute said in a
report issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO last July decided to accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic in 1999. The U.S. government said that it will make
America safer, NATO stronger and Europe more stable.
</P>
<P>
The institute said weapons manufacturing companies such as
Lockheed-Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. are major supporters of the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
These companies are eyeing possibly billions in sales of
warplanes to Central European nations, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The big prize in selling to new NATO members will be aircraft.
Poland could buy more than 100 F-16 fighters, built by Lockheed
Martin in Forth Worth, Texas. Boeing is hoping the Czech Republic
will buy a few dozen F-18 fighters, built in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
These and other defense contractors are also hoping to sell
radar and communications systems. Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.,
also of Forth Worth, hopes to sell helicopters to Romania, a
country that hopes to join NATO in later expansion rounds.
</P>
<P>
With lucrative business at stake, these companies have become
actively involved in the NATO expansion lobbying effort, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is a corporate financer of the American Friends of the
Czech Republic. The U.S. Committee to Expand NATO is headed by a
Lockheed Martin vice president.
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed Martin executive, Bernard Schwartz, donated 50,000
U.S. dollars to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last
summer shortly after he appeared at the U.S. Committee to Expand
NATO dinner briefing for a dozen members of the Senate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considers Military Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States might
consider a military intervention in the crisis in Kosovo, an
ethnic Albanian-dominated province of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, said a senior U.S. official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gelbard, U.S. envoy to Bosnia, issued another strong
warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on troubled
Kosovo province when speaking at a meeting of the Defense Writers
Group.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard indicated Washington has not changed its long-standing
policy to respond militarily if the Balkan war in the province
breaks out.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. policy has not changed. We're prepared to try to find new
and other tools to make this effective. But the key is we're going
to have effective means to deal with these problems, and we have
warned Milosevic appropriately," Gelbard said.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, violence occurred in Kosovo, where Albanians make up
90 percent of its population. The Bush administration, then
Clinton's, threatened to intervene if Yugoslavia solved the crisis
through force.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to be prepared to deal with this problem... using
every appropriate tool we have at our command," Gelbard said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will attend an urgent
meeting on Kosovo next Monday in London with foreign ministers
from Germany, Britain, France, Russia and Italy, according to
the envoy.
</P>
<P>
The economy in Yugoslavia is "dismal," and "the situation could
become an awful lot worse and we can make it worse," if Belgrade
uses force in Kosovo, Gelbard said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the reduction of U.S. troops in Bosnia, Gelbard
said he expects a slight reduction, mostly in logistical support,
from about 8,000 troops to about 7,000. Three maneuver battalions
will be maintained in the contingent.
</P>
<P>
The United States, through NATO, will try to get other
countries, particularly Western European nations, to take on some
responsibilities in support tasks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard said the Bosnia mission will become more localized,
focusing on potential civil disturbances that could arise from the
return of refugees and displaced people, installing elected
municipal governments and economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Rural Development Project in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Wednesday the approval of a 20.5 million U.S. dollar loan to
Indonesia for the Bengkulu regional development project to promote
rural economic growth there.
</P>
<P>
This project will introduce new agricultural technologies and
improve village infrastructure to increase farm incomes and living
standards for nearly 40,000 households in 220 villages in
Bengkulu, Sumartra's second poorest province.
</P>
<P>
The village councils will manage village grants to be provided
under the project, to implement the two main components of the
project. One is for village-based adoption of agricultural
technologies and the other is for construction of village
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 25.7 million
dollars. In addition to the World Bank loan, 2.7 million dollars
will come from the participating farmers which will be contributed
in the form of labor and the remaining 2.6 million dollars from
the Indonesian government.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Responds to IMF Criticism of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government Wednesday
said it had been implementing austerity measures for some time to
counter the IMF (International Monetary Fund) criticism of its
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF urged more progress on structural reforms by Belgium,
particularly to combat a growing jobless rate, in its annual
review of the Belgian economy Tuesday. It also asked Belgium to
lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said it remained concerned about "the continuing
serious structural problems in the economy, in particular the high
level of unemployment and the high, albeit declining ratio of
public debt to Gross Domestic Product."
</P>
<P>
Belgian Budget Minister Herman Van Rompuy responded by saying
that Belgium had made good progress in cutting its debt/GDP ratio
though it was still double the 60 percent target laid down for
participation in Europe's single currency.
</P>
<P>
The state debt of Belgium, which was 135 percent in 1993, had
been "drastically" reduced due to the efforts of the government,
according to the budget minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Belgium was going towards 118 percent for 1998 but
admitted that the country would have to maintain a strict budget
policy in coming years.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said Belgium should aim, over the medium term, to
reduce the tax burden, involving reforms in the health care and
pension systems.
</P>
<P>
Spending ceilings were needed for each level of government "to
create scope for significant cut in the tax burden on labor
income, which should reduce labor costs," said the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Van Rompuy said the Belgian government had already planned to
reduce employers' social charges -- "charges that weigh on
employment of people, hiring people."
</P>
<P>
Responding to IMF remarks that the tax burden on labor income
should be cut, he said the Belgian government was planning to
reintroduce the full indexation of tax scales from January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the jobless rate in Flanders region,
the northern half of Belgium, was among the lowest in western
Europe.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves 330 Mln Dlrs for Independent Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank approved Wednesday 330 million U.S. dollars in financing for
rehabilitation and expansion of a power plant that will be the
first independent power project in southern Peru.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which will have a generating capacity of 464
megawatts when completed, will provide a reliable source of
electricity to the largest mining region in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most of the installed capacity of the project, to be located in
two sites near the town of Ilo, will serve the electric needs of
the Southern Peru Limited, and the remainder will be sold on the
spot electricity market.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a 75 million dollar loan from
ordinary capital and 255 million dollars in syndicated funds.
Tractebel S.A. of Belgium, the parent corporation of Energia del
Sur, is providing some 110 million dollars in financing.

<HEADLINE> EU Imposes Dumping Duties on China Steel Alloy Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Wednesday that it had imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on
imports of ferro-silico-manganese, an alloy used in steel making,
from China.
</P>
<P>
The EU announced its decision in a statement published in its
Official Journal. It also said that it would extend duties on
alloy imports from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc, which has decided to end duties on such
imports from Brazil, South Africa and Russia, imposed provisional
dumping duties on Chinese imports last September.
</P>
<P>
Beijing argued that its prices were low because companies had
low labor and operational costs and did not have to pay for any
environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
"Dumped imports, by volume, originating in the People's
Republic of China increased from around 12,000 tonnes in 1993 to
75,400 in 1996, an increase of 526 percent," the EU said in the
journal.
</P>
<P>
It also said the market penetration of dumped Chinese imports
rose to 14 percent from 2.4 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
A duty of 58.3 ECUs (some 68 U.S. dollars) per tonne had been
calculated on the basis of the injury margin to apply to imports
from China.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Debates Future Status of Puerto Rico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Wednesday debated whether to allow Puerto Rico
vote to be the 51st U.S. state, remain a U.S. territory or an
independent nation.
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to vote later Wednesday on the bill
sponsored by Alaska Republican Don Young, which called for a
plebiscite on the territory by the end of the year to decide its
future status.
</P>
<P>
The former Spanish colony became a U.S. possession after the
1898 Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
As a commonwealth, Puerto Ricans, represented in the U.S.
Congress by a delegate without voting right, are U.S. citizens but
cannot vote in U.S. elections.
</P>
<P>
"This is a bill that establishes the right of Puerto Rico to
self-determination for the first time in 100 years," said Young.
</P>
<P>
"The 3.8 million citizens in Puerto Rico have waited an entire
century for the United States to provide them with this
opportunity," Young told a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the bill was threatened by conservative
Republicans who insisted English should be the Spanish-speaking
island's only official language if it gains U.S. statehood.
</P>
<P>
An amendment sponsored by New York Republican Gerald Solomon
proposed making English the only official language in Puerto Rico
if it becomes a state. The amendment would also require Puerto
Rican public schools to teach in English.
</P>
<P>
"Admitting a state requires the assimilation of a territory
within the union of states and language differences are the number
one barrier to actual assimilation," Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill said the English-only requirement was a
"poisoned" amendment that had no place in the discussion. They
said that Hawaii and New Mexico have two official languages.
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt called the amendment a
"slap in the face" to the Puerto Rican people who deserved the
opportunity to decide their political future. "It is a simple
issue of basic human rights," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bonn to Reverse Nazi Court Convictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament Wednesday gave
preliminary approval to a bill which will reverse an estimated
several hundred thousand convictions of the courts in Nazi Germany
more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It is unworthy of a state which abides by the rule of law...
when convictions still stand which were clearly based on Nazi
injustice," said Justice Minister Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which still needs the parliament's final
approval, will lift all convictions of Nazi's notorious
Volksgericht (People's Court), which was set up in Berlin to give
quick verdicts to accused traitors.
</P>
<P>
It will also quash convictions of temporary courts set up
shortly before the 1945 Nazi defeat and all other convictions
leading to the death penalty or based on 57 Nazi laws.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill will not apply to the conviction of soldiers
sentenced to death under military law as the military practice
existed before the Nazis took power in 1933.

<HEADLINE> Syria Reaffirms Coordination With Lebanon On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa Wednesday stressed that his country will
coordinate with Lebanon on the Israeli proposal to withdraw from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with his Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz, al-Sharaa said that the Israeli proposal
deformed the United Nations resolution 425, which calls on Israel
to end its occupation of south Lebanon without conditions.
</P>
<P>
It aims to drag Lebanon into an unknown condition, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel had said it is willing to implement the United Nations
Resolution 425 provided the Lebanese government agrees Israeli security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
After the proposal was rejected by both Lebanon and Syria on
grounds that Israel attached preconditions for the resolution,
the Israeli government is seeking France's help for a mediation
mission in view of Paris's close ties with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa said that France will never carry out this task if it
does not gain the approval from Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He added that he had discussed with Boueiz about the role
France will play on the issue, stressing that France should play
an efficient role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with some 40,000
troops deployed on Lebanese soil as peacekeepers. The two
countries have vowed to hold negotiations with Israel
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister arrived here Wednesday night. He will also
hold talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and House Speaker Nabih Berri.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Strategy to Improve Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive arm, Wednesday proposed a strategy
for deepening Turkey's ties with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Commission Wednesday made the proposal in a bid to improve
its badly soured relations with Turkey over Ankara's frustrated
efforts to be accepted as a candidate for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
It urged the EU members to release a fund of some 375 million
ECUs (around 400 million U.S. dollars) to finance the strategy,
which includes a broader customs union and cooperation in
industry, services and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The European strategy which we proposed for Turkey will lead
to a deepening of our relations. This will be to the benefit of
all our citizens," EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den
Broek said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that Turkey's democratic institutions and human
rights records must be improved in order to prepare itself for the
eventual EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have made clear what we expect from Turkey and what
we have to offer for Turkey," said the commissioner, who also said
that Ankara was now not interested in political dialogue with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
In a second report to the European Parliament, the Commission
said the Turkish government's program for improving the human
rights situation and democratization "has not yet had sufficient
impact on the situation."
