HERTZ, ENTERPRISE TOP J.D. POWER SURVEY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Flying into town and need to rent a car?
</P>
<P>
   You'll get the least hassle from Hertz and Enterprise, according
to a new survey by the for-profit public opinion research firm J.D.
Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 1999 domestic rental car survey processed
questionnaires from 7,500 customers who last year picked up and
dropped off cars at agencies in and around U.S. airports. The study
found that price figured in less to overall satisfaction than how
quickly an agency could get a customer behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``After getting off a plane, you want to get your rental car and
go,'' said Steve Cohen, research manager at J.D. Power, based in
the Agoura Hills community of Los Angeles. ``The return process,
too: If you're trying to catch a flight and have to wait in a long
line (to drop off a vehicle), you might miss your plane.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Enterprise and Hertz, Avis and National also
rated well in the fourth annual survey, while Alamo, Budget, Dollar
and Thrifty came in below average.
</P>
<P>
   The J.D. Power study found the average wait time to be picked up
by a shuttle bus en route to a rental counter was nine minutes,
while returning a rental car typically took seven minutes. Rental
companies that can cut the wait time to six minutes and the return
time to four minutes will emerge as customer favorites, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond speed, customers said affordability, a good selection of
cars and a smooth reservation process were all roughly equally
important in determining satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Donahue, a spokesman for Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Alamo,
said he had not seen the J.D. Power study but agreed that speed was
a key ingredient to success. Donahue said he didn't know why Alamo
had rated below average. ``Our objective is to make people happy,
not to get poor marks in surveys,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: THE RATIONALE FOR AIR STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 24:
</P>
<P>
   As Slobodan Milosevic's army continues to shell and murder its
way through Kosovo, the United States and its NATO allies appear
ready to bomb Serbian military targets, perhaps today. Milosevic
has been given every chance to end his aggression, and every
warning of what would happen if he did not. He has ignored them,
and the bombing must begin quickly before his rampage takes more
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday after Richard Holbrooke, the special American envoy,
reported that last-minute talks with Milosevic had failed to yield
a peaceful solution, President Clinton set out a persuasive
rationale for American military involvement in Kosovo. The Senate
was right to support him. Bombing is no sure thing, he said, but
the dangers of acting must be weighed against the dangers of
inaction. The purpose is to limit Milosevic's ability to attack the
people of Kosovo, and get him to sign the peace plan that would be
safeguarded by NATO peacekeeping troops. There is also American
interest in keeping war from spreading, possibly to the NATO
members Greece and Turkey. Moreover, carrying out a threat that the
West has been making since October is necessary to deter others who
would kill innocents in the future.
</P>
<P>
   We would add that since Kosovo's ethnic Albanians did sign the
peace plan, and the West has pulled its observers from Kosovo, it
would be an act of betrayal to allow Milosevic to massacre the
Kosovars. Serbian forces are shelling and burning villages, forcing
tens of thousands to flee. They have also been killing ethnic
Albanian civilians. Macedonia, unconscionably, has closed its
border with Kosovo, leaving thousands of refugees to the mercy of
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Any bombing campaign is bound to produce casualties, both among
civilians on the ground and allied aviators. The Yugoslav armed
forces that NATO planes would attack are tough and well equipped,
with a sophisticated air defense system. Thus the air war is likely
to be more dangerous for Western pilots than the bombing campaign
in Bosnia four years ago or the flights over Iraq that continue
today. There is some risk that the bombing campaign will lead the
Serbs to retaliate against ethnic Albanians with even greater
ferocity. But that is a risk the Albanians are willing to take in
hopes that bombing will contain the Serbian assault.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic complications of bombing were underscored
yesterday when the Russian prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov,
abandoned his planned trip to Washington to express opposition to
the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic is true to past behavior, he may fight for a few
days and then ask for a bombing pause and more negotiations while
continuing his assault on Kosovo, gambling that NATO's will to
restart bombing will weaken. NATO must assure that any pause is
linked to real progress toward getting Milosevic's signature for
the peace plan and curtailing his ability to wage war in Kosovo.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ Baylor officials got the big name they were hoping for when
they made New Mexico basketball coach Dave Bliss an offer he
couldn't refuse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After taking several days to mull it over, Bliss on Tuesday
agreed to take the job at Baylor and become one of the highest-paid
basketball coaches in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Bliss agreed to a five-year deal worth $3 million,
which would put him No. 3 in the Big 12 behind Texas coach Rick
Barnes ($700,000 annually) and Oklahoma's Kelvin Sampson ($610,000
a year).
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to persuade Bliss to make the move, and it proves
Baylor is serious about doing whatever it takes to be competitive
in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a banner day for Baylor basketball,'' said athletic
director Tom Stanton, a former Baylor basketball player. ``If you
had a guy on your dream list and you could make it happen, who
would it be? Dave was that individual for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this university will embrace one of the finest college
basketball coaches in this country. His record speaks for itself.
We now have a proven coach in big-time basketball, and we have a
cornerstone for Baylor athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary package will make Bliss the highest-paid employee in
the Baylor athletic department, and probably at the entire
university.
</P>
<P>
   But it still is a surprise to many people that Bliss, who has
taken the Lobos to the NCAA Tournament in seven of the last nine
seasons, would be willing to leave an established program and take
the job at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people will scratch their heads,'' said Bliss,
who also has coached at Oklahoma and Southern Methodist. ``A lot of
people won't understand it. They will say you are leaving a Top 25
program and an arena that puts 17,000 people in the seats. But life
is more than that. We know what's important in our life, and Baylor
represents a lot of those things for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation here is a unique one. Baylor is about more than
just winning. It's about how you win and how you teach young
people. We are Christians, and we looked at the mission statement
of this university. The simple fact is we think the world of
Baylor. It's a new adventure in our life.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial package Bliss will receive is an indication that
officials of the Baptist-affiliated school were determined to hire
an experienced, well-respected coach who could bring instant
credibility to a struggling program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest: We were recruiting him all the way,'' Stanton
said. ``This is the person we wanted to head our basketball
program, and we did everything we could to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Turner, a former Baylor basketball player who is the chief
executive officer of Dr Pepper Bottling Co. of Dallas, was a member
of the school's advisory committee in the search for a new coach.
Sources say Turner told friends he would help the school
financially to get a well-known new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss, 55, replaces Harry Miller, who was the Baylor coach for
the last five seasons. Miller resigned March 5 after the Bears
ended the 1998-99 season with a 6-24 record, including 17
consecutive losses to close out the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we have a lot of work ahead, but Texas is a
can-do state,'' Bliss said. ``We are going to start at point zero
and add to it. I know we have some needs that must be filled in
with recruiting. It's going to be a tough and hard road, but I
really believe we have the wherewithal here to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot of the players on this team because we recruited
some of them. And I believe in Texas high school basketball. Four
of our five starting players this season (at New Mexico) were from
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss met with the Baylor players Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of disappointment with them about this year's
season,'' Bliss said. ``They had a tough year, but I told them
success isn't always measured in how much you win; it's measured in
how much you overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   During his news conference Tuesday, Bliss talked about his
coaching style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in the 3-point shot,'' Bliss said. ``It has
allowed a lot of schools besides the Dukes of the world to be
competitive. Every year we are in the top 10 in number of 3s shot.
I just wish one year we would be in the top 10 in the number
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor guard Tevis Stukes, who was the team's leading scorer
before being suspended at the start of conference play over a
dispute with Miller, said Bliss' comments on 3-point shooting were
music to his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as those words came out of his mouth, I started
smiling,'' Stukes said. ``That's the way I've played all my life.
Just to get coach Bliss is a big step for Baylor. He is one of the
best-known coaches in America. I think this gives us a chance to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he spoke to us, he said he wanted to make sure what
happened to us this year doesn't happen again. He told us he
believes we can turn things around next year. We're all really
excited about getting to play under him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss said he will bring his longtime assistant coach Doug Ash
with him to Baylor. Ash has been with Bliss since his head coaching
career began in 1975 at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug is in charge of keeping me from getting technicals,''
Bliss said. ``But he wasn't too damn good at it this year.''

BUSY LAST DAY FOR NHL TRADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings will look back on the
Steve Duchesne signing as a mistake and an education _ a costly
education.
</P>
<P>
   Beating Tuesday's NHL trading deadline, the Kings gave the
disappointing Duchesne a $4.25-million parting handshake, then
traded him to the Philadelphia Flyers, squeezing their way out of
the mistake as best they could. Time will tell if they learned from
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very difficult, very expensive lesson,'' Kings
general manager Dave Taylor said after sending Duchesne to the
Flyers for veteran defenseman Dave Babych and a fifth-round draft
choice in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Duchesne were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also traded center Yanic Perreault to Toronto for
minor-league right wing Jason Podollan and a third-round choice in
this year's draft. Podollan was playing for St. John's in the AHL
and was leading the league with 42 goals.
</P>
<P>
   On a busy day in the NHL, there were 21 deals involving 30
players, with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks picking up veteran center
Peter Zezel from Vancouver for future considerations. The Detroit
Red Wings made the biggest splash, acquiring Chicago defenseman
Chris Chelios, New York Rangers defenseman Ulf Samuelsson and Tampa
Bay left wing Wendel Clark to bolster their hopes for a third
consecutive Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kings, the lesson they hope they learned cost them
$4.25 million _ the amount they had to pay Duchesne so he would
permit them to tear up the remaining three years of his contract,
worth $11.25 million. The Kings avoided a pure buyout of Duchesne's
contract, which would have cost them $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the old deal was scrapped, Duchesne signed a new contract
with the Kings for the rest of this season at a rate comparable to
the $3.75 million he had been earning under his former contract,
and the team then traded him to the Flyers. He will be an
unrestricted free agent after the season, as he was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world of free agency,'' Taylor said, ``you generally
have to commit to more dollars and more years than you feel a
player is worth and in a lot of cases, you don't get a fair return
for your investment. . . . I don't know if you will see us too
active in the free-agent market in the future. The thing that
bothers me is if a player has a great year, he's looking for top
dollar, and when he doesn't have a great year, the risk is still
with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings signed Duchesne last July 2 to a four-year deal worth
$15 million. With Tuesday's settlement, the Kings wound up paying
Duchesne roughly half of the contract in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The fiscal effect of their other dealings Tuesday were
negligible. Perreault ($750,000 this year), Babych ($1 million) and
Podollan ($400,000) are in the final years of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Perreault, 27, began his career with Toronto and last season was
second on the Kings with 28 goals. He had only 10 this season and
only six in his previous 61 games.
</P>
<P>
   Podollan, 23, was assigned to the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the
IHL. ``He has been improving every year,'' Taylor said of Podollan,
adding that the Kings hope to have him play for them this season.
``If his skating improves slightly, it's just a matter of working
on a consistent basis and he'll be an NHL player.''
</P>
<P>
   In other trades Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   __ Montreal traded center Vincent Damphousse to San Jose for a
fifth-round pick in 1999 and a conditional draft pick or picks in
2000.

EDITORIAL: 10 YEARS AFTER THE BIG SPILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 24:
</P>
<P>
   With the administration's backing, a bill will be introduced in
Congress today to give permanent wilderness protection to one of
America's great natural treasures, the coastal plain of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge. The timing could not be more apt. Today
is also the 10th anniversary of the day the Exxon Valdez ran
aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound, spreading 11 million
gallons of crude oil over 3,000 square miles and causing horrendous
damage to one of the nation's most sensitive ecosystems. Placing
1.6 million acres of Alaskan wilderness permanently beyond the
reach of the oil companies would provide a measure of expiation for
a major calamity.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the Exxon Valdez incident has already left an
important mark on the long struggle to achieve a better balance
between energy and the environment. The spill forced President Bush
to abandon his drive to allow drilling in the coastal plain and, in
further repudiation of his friends in the oil business, to impose a
10-year moratorium on exploration in much of America's coastal
waters, including the California coast and the Florida Keys. The
spill also led to the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, which imposed severe
penalties on oil companies and shippers for negligence and required
safer double-hulled tankers by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the sheer scope of the disaster did much to raise
the country's environmental consciousness and taught it that a
single accident could effectively cripple an entire ecosystem. In
1981, only 25 percent of Americans believed that the risks of
offshore drilling outweighed the benefits. A year after the spill,
that figure had risen to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are still deep wounds, some of which only time and nature
can heal. Of 20 animal and bird species affected by the spill, only
2 _ the bald eagle and the river otter _ have fully recovered.
Eight others, including the economically vital herring and pink
salmon, are slowly coming back, and 10 have shown no significant
recovery. Exxon has shelled out more than $3 billion in cleanup
costs and civil and criminal fines. But it has yet to pay $5
billion in punitive damages to thousands of Indians and commercial
fishermen whose culture and livelihoods suffered severe damage. Nor
has the federal government cracked down as hard as it could on the
oil industry to upgrade its aging tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the companies and their congressional allies are
again hatching an assault on the coastal plain, which was left
unprotected when Congress gave the rest of the refuge wilderness
status in 1980. A narrow, breathtakingly beautiful stretch of land
flanking the Beaufort Sea, the plain is home to an extraordinary
variety of wildlife and, quite possibly, a major undiscovered
oilfield. The Contract With America Republicans tried to open it up
in the 1995 budget bill, only to be thwarted by President Clinton's
veto. This year's vehicle is an innocuous-looking measure
authorizing seismic tests that, if they showed oil, would
inevitably strengthen the case for drilling.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Rep. Bruce Vento of Minnesota has offered his bill
to put the coastal plain permanently off limits. As Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt once observed, drilling the refuge would be
an ethical calamity, the equivalent of offering Yellowstone
National Park for geothermal drilling. Furthermore, as this day
reminds us, Alaska's landscape has suffered enough.

LOSS OF BAKER IS SONICS' GAIN _ TEMPORARILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For Sonic fans, here's the good news about Vin Baker's
injury: It's his eating hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even better news: The Sonics are looking good without him.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not joining the growing legions
who think the Sonics are better off without their All-Star power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not permanently, anyway. But for the past six quarters, the
Sonics have looked as good as they have all season. Granted, that's
not saying much, but when their new, 13-11 neighborhood includes
the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot, any
compliment is gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we can't win without Vin playing the way he
did last season,'' said teammate Dale Ellis. ``We've got a new
system, but it's a simple system. If you fight it, it just makes it
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems Baker has been fighting things, though ``fighting''
isn't an apt description of the Baker style. It's more like
``passive aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Paul Westphal's system emphasizes a faster tempo and a
more even distribution of scoring than last year, when the offense
went almost exclusively through the hands of Baker and Gary Payton.
But Baker, whether through attitude or ampleness, has been slow to
accept and adjust.
</P>
<P>
   For the second half of the Denver game Sunday and throughout the
win over Philadelphia on Monday, the Baker-less Sonics had life and
movement, two elements that appeared to have been inadvertently
waived at the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the uptick had to do with the fact that Billy Owens has
finally become a solid contributor, and Detlef Schrempf has
returned to his old, albeit older, self.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that the Sonics no longer had to wait for Baker
to lumber upcourt and snuggle himself into the low post, from where
he had spent much of the season throwing the ball back from whence
it came _ not exactly evoking the image of a Karl Malone buffalo
move to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's teammates are reluctant to say much publicly, because
he's such a likable and ultimately valuable guy, but it's obvious
they have been tired of dragging his corpulent self up and down the
court with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Vin goes down, Billy getting healthy and in shape can't be
underestimated, but we seem to have hit on a way to play that suits
our players,'' was how Westphal on Tuesday summed up the past six
quarters. ``We've had the plays in before this. Now we're a little
quicker and more wide open. Before, we tended to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   For too much of the season, the Sonic offense tried to
jump-start Baker by forcing matters when he wasn't in shape to
respond. The ripple effect for a team already adjusting to six new
faces, including three rookies, was severe.
</P>
<P>
   The failed offense led to Payton's tendency to go messianic,
which was off-putting to teammates. When Payton hit the inevitable
wall, the Sonics found themselves trailing the Nuggets and Warriors
last week by more points than Holyfield trailed Lewis.
Unfortunately for the Sonics, Don King was not available to make up
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But that constipation figures to be ending, now that Baker
doesn't have to be accounted for. At the midpoint of the NBA's
Stupidest Season, the Sonics have rendered the first half of their
compressed schedule into a glorified training camp. Tuesday, they
broke camp with the long-sought veteran backup point guard, John
Crotty.
</P>
<P>
   The new starting lineup of Payton, Schrempf, Owens, Hersey
Hawkins and Olden Polynice is a little elderly _ by the playoffs,
none will be under 30 _ and a little small, but it is sufficiently
savvy and conditioned to make up for those deficiencies and then
some.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's major coaching task is to get bench production from
high energy rookies Vladimir Stepania and Rashard Lewis, each of
whom is capable of breaking a game either way. Stepania's 17-minute
contribution against the Sixers was a good example: four points,
four rebounds, four fouls, three blocks and five turnovers. For
better or worse, the man is a happening.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the past six regular seasons, the Sonics have been a
mess. But so is the league. Even without Baker, a 16-9 run over the
second half is within reason.
</P>
<P>
   The trick will be incorporating Baker upon his return to health,
be it in two weeks or six weeks. If it's the latter, Baker will be
coming back on postseason's eve, which under old coach George Karl
was the traditional time for a panicky change in the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were supposed to be getting away from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned in the NBA is that it's hard to project
six days ahead, much less six weeks,'' said Westphal, deferring any
talk about Baker's future except to say that the guy has to come
back in top shape.
</P>
<P>
   Baker would seem to have little choice. He can file for free
agency after this season, but the market would appear to be _
pardon the expression _ slim for players who make their teammates
better while reposing on the injured list.

CELTICS ARE DEFENSELESS 
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-CELTICS-CAVALIERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The experiment lasted a little more than 48 hours.
On Sunday, Rick Pitino said he would try to be Cool Hand Rick. He
couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday night, Pitino is now the angriest man in the
business. He said his team pushed him to his breaking point. He
said he could take a CBA team and make it better than the current
Celtics. And, the coach promised, if he sees another performance
similar to the most recent one at Gund Arena, his players will be
unhappy as well. Not to mention unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for Pitino to gather himself and speak.
Immediately after the Cavaliers put on a Dunk/Layup Festival in
their 113-86 win over the Celtics, Pitino went to the visiting
coach's office here and slammed the door. He stayed there for a
while, his head down, staring at a wretched box score. When he
emerged several minutes later, he appeared to be as depressed as
he's ever been in his two seasons as Celtics coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to stay positive and upbeat,'' he said, ``but that's
humiliating defense. I've seen the Washington Generals play better
defense than that.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't come close to cracking a smile when he compared his
team to the ragged bunch that the Harlem Globetrotters used to
abuse. The Celtics were that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team that I haven't raised my voice this year,''
said Pitino. ``And I understand the lockout has prevented us from
teaching the little things of the game. There reaches a point,
though, where I won't be humiliated. I'm going to watch this film,
and if people are humiliating the Boston Celtics, they will not
start (Wednesday) or (Wednesday) is their last day. They're not
going to play anymore. It's as simple as that. I've reached my
breaking point and I think even Dr. Norman Vincent Peale would have
cracked a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino knew he didn't need to see any doctors Tuesday night. You
don't need an M.D. to understand that when a team shoots 58 percent
against you, you lose. But it was more than the percentage. The
Celtics gave up dunks and layups. The Cavs scored more than half of
their points _ 62 of them _ inside the paint. Which is to say they
dunked all night. Former Celtic Andrew DeClercq looked like a young
Julius Erving, making seven field goals. Four of them were dunks.
The other three were layups.
</P>
<P>
   That's all anyone in Cleveland could talk about afterward, the
non-defense of the Celtics. That annoyed the coach. He hates to be
embarrassed that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've reached my breaking point,'' he repeated. ``And it won't
go beyond (tonight). If we lose, we're going to lose fighting with
the people that want to fight and not, `If I get my points, I will
play defense . . .'
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to think of team, winning defense. If they
don't want to think of that, they can sit there and watch the other
guys do it. It's not one person. It's a bunch of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The more you heard Pitino speak, the more you thought that he
somehow regretted leaving the University of Kentucky and signing a
10-year, $50 million contract with the Celtics in May 1997. The
first six years of that contract, at $7 million per season, are for
president/coach Pitino. The last four years are for president
Pitino. That's the way Chairman of the Board Paul Gaston structured
the contract. But Pitino sounded as if he didn't want a part of it.
He didn't say that. This is what he did say:
</P>
<P>
   ``You get what you deserve in life, and we deserved the thump
beating. I'm glad we got booed the other night because we deserved
it. The only thing I feel terrible about is the fact that Paul
Gaston had to bring me in here to show the Boston Celtics that
(type of discouraging atmosphere). I feel bad that he had to sign
me to that type of contract because I'm not living up to my
abilities, either. I feel bad for the Gaston family and Celtic
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're wondering what caused the coach to ramble this way.
Answer: The game. The Celtics were in it briefly. But they couldn't
guard anybody. They didn't shoot so well, either. It was their
ninth consecutive loss on the road, four away from the team record
set in 1979. Tuesday night, they were so bad that Pitino cleared
his bench late in the third quarter. He called his team's lack of
defense a ``disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I could get a CBA team to play better than they
are on the defensive end,'' he said. ``I really believe that. I
really believe that I can take a CBA team and win more games than
these guys, off their defense. Or lack of defense. There is
absolutely no pride in defense at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense and free throw shooting were problems Tuesday night as
well. But the coach didn't get into that. That's a monologue for
another time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even able to contain a man off a simple screen or a
simple dribble,'' he said. ``We're not talking about Allen Iverson
here. I give credit to the Cavaliers, but we're not talking about
Allen Iverson moves.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that the coach mentioned the 76ers point guard.
Because after Wednesday's game against the Timberwolves, the 8-16
Celtics face Iverson and the Sixers. Imagine what he will say after
he sees the real thing.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ While the Detroit Red Wings stole the
headlines on Tuesdsay, Anaheim Mighty Ducks Mighty Ducks general
manager Pierre Gauthier was content to add veteran center Peter
Zezel without disrupting his team's chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim acquired Zezel, known as one of the league's top face
off experts, from Vancouver in exchange for future considerations,
likely a low draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``(We) looked at an area we wanted more depth at and it was up
front,'' said Gauthier. ``Basically it was a chance to get a
veteran who has played in a lot of playoff games.''
</P>
<P>
   Zezel,33, gives coach Craig Hartsburg another option at center,
where the Ducks have been playing two youngsters -- rookie Johann
Davidsson and second-year man Matt Cullen -- most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center ice is a critical position,'' said Hartsburg. ``He
(Zezel) is dependable defensively, a good penalty killer and has
provided some offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Zezel had six goals and 14 points in 41 games for the Canucks
this season. His best offensive season was 1986-87 when he scored
33 goals and 72 points for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams may have been wheeling and dealing, but Teemu
Selanne seemed very satisfied that Gauthier chose to basically
stand pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice confidence boost for the team that organization
trusts the players,'' he said. ``We know we can win with this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier said he didn't feel pressure to pull off a big deal,
even though his team is in a 1-3-2 slump. He's happy with the
progress the Ducks have made.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 12 games to go it was very important to keep growing and
not change things,'' he explained. ``You go through ups and downs.
We're a little down now, but the best way to get it back is with
the guys we have.''
</P>
<P>
   A reluctant trader, Gauthier says every deal has two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll read teams got this and that, but don't forget to what
they gave up,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: IT'S WHAT A MAYOR SAYS AND HOW HE SAYS IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mayor could not understand why he had such a
problem with black and Latino New Yorkers. He had met with a group
of minority officials and explained how he believed in a level
playing field, not playing favorites. The officials twitched
restlessly, and left unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime city politician who had watched the meeting go down
the drain tried to explain the problem. ``I got two sons,'' he told
the mayor. ``I love them both the same. I really think I do. But
when one of them is sick, I love him more. I do.'' The people who
live in minority neighborhoods, he said, have more problems than
white New Yorkers, and because of that ``we have to love them a
little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor just looked at him quizzically. Life went on.
</P>
<P>
   That particular mayor was Edward Koch, and the politician was
Stanley Fink, the Assembly speaker. Before his death in 1997, Fink
told this story for the biography ``I, Koch.'' Rereading it, I was
reminded that we have been down this road before. New York City,
which is defined by its multiracial heritage, often produces
leaders who seem tone-deaf to the nuances of racial experience.
After Koch came David Dinkins, whose administration was so open to
input from almost everybody that the main message communicated to
the public was slightly depressive paralysis. The white and Asian
sections of New York were eager for a sign that Dinkins would take
their side when black activists behaved unfairly. But when the
chance came with the Korean grocery store boycott, Dinkins just
kept waiting and listening.
</P>
<P>
   Since Amadou Diallo was killed by police officers of the Street
Crimes Unit, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has done some good things. He
attended the funeral and made at least two attempts to meet with
Diallo's parents. He has met privately with representatives of the
African immigrant community and with black teen-agers. His police
commissioner has announced retraining for the Street Crimes Unit
and appointed a black officer to its No. 2 position.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the mood in the city and the numbers of people being
arrested in peaceful protests at Police Headquarters, none of this
has worked. That is because Giuliani has not carried on a public
conversation that makes the city's black and Latino residents feel
he understands and honors the roots of their anger.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference on Tuesday, Giuliani once again tried to
express an impartiality that he seems to feel will solve the
problem. Yes, he is concerned that police officers might be
treating some blacks and Hispanics unfairly. But he is also
concerned that people are stereotyping the Police Department as
racist and violent. If New York's police are not given credit for
the things they do well, he warned, ``it's very, very
counterproductive _ because I know cops. You're going to make
things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those statements so evenhanded they are
meaningless. When people are in a rage over a clear injustice, it
does not help to point out that there are good folks and bad folks
everywhere. A good leader understands that the first step toward
healing is demonstrated empathy. The Rev. Floyd Flake, the powerful
Queens minister whom Giuliani cites as one of his allies in the
black community, says he advised the mayor to speak out more
forcefully. ``I suggested he say . . . `I'm going to stand with the
citizens to make sure the judicial process works fairly.'''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the mayor wants the judicial process to work fairly,
but Flake was looking for an expression of angry solidarity that
the mayor never delivered. ``I don't think it's in his
personality,'' he said. Giuliani needed to show, somehow, that he
had heard the stories middle-class black New Yorkers told of being
stopped by the police for no apparent reason, that he knew they
feared that their children might be killed by a frightened or
vicious police officer. Giuliani has statistics showing it is more
likely that a young black man will be killed by another young black
man than by a police officer. Flake has heard them. He believes
they are right, but for a community that has its roots in the
Southern experience of racism and abuse by the police, the
statistics are not much comfort.
</P>
<P>
   What Flake may have been waiting for is a statement that says to
the black community that although Giuliani understands and cares
about the police, for one moment he is going to understand and care
about the feelings of Flake's parishioners more, because right now
they are feeling sick and wounded. It was, perhaps, simply a matter
of tone. As a preacher, Flake says, he knows ``your delivery is
quite different depending on what you're trying to say.'' On
Wednesday Flake plans to go to the protest and get himself
arrested.

MODANO INJURES EYE IN STARS' CLOSE WIN

   The incident happened a year and 11 days after Modano suffered a
separated shoulder on the hard glass at America West Arena that
kept him out of the lineup for 17 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Stars return April 17, should Modano be allowed to
stay away from his personal ``House of Pain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't hurt my feelings at all.'' Modano said. ``Maybe I
could get in 36 \Rholes of golf\S while the guys are out playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars looked like they were playing golf in the game's final
four minutes as they almost blew a third-period lead for the second
consecutive game. Keith Tkachuk and Rick Tocchet scored for the
Coyotes, but the Stars held on for a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Stars moved their league-best record to
44-14-12 and hit the 100-point mark for the third time in the past
three seasons. In addition, they opened their largest lead of the
season in the Pacific Division at 20 points over the second-place
Coyotes, who fell to 34-25-12.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some purple and blue around the eye, Modano said he
likely will play tomorrow against the Los Angeles Kings. Roenick
received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct penalty
for boarding on the play, although Modano said the injury came from
an elbow and not from his head hitting the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick could also face a possible suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Modano was behind the Coyotes' net and had tried to pick up the
puck 10 feet earlier. However, he missed the puck and was looking
backward at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I had the puck, he would have laid me out. The elbow
caught me right in the socket,'' Modano said. ``It's kind of
frustrating, he tries to catch people by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars then scored a controversial goal on the ensuing
five-minute power play that would help them on their way to a 3-0
lead. Brett Hull was credited with the goal, his 27th of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The play had to be reviewed for five minutes before the Stars
were given the goal. Hull had taken a rebound shot in a scramble in
front of the net and the puck somehow slipped behind Coyotes goalie
Nikolai Khabibulin. As Coyotes defenseman Teppo Numminen and Stars
winger Dave Reid fought to get to the loose puck that was sitting
just in front of the goal line, the puck somehow was pushed in at
the 13:18 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' next two goals were much prettier. Jere Lehtinen
bagged the second in the second period as he swooped behind the
Coyotes' net, came out to the right of Khabibulin and lifted a
perfect wrister in for a 2-0 lead. Jamie Langenbrunner then set up
Joe Nieuwendyk on a breakaway in the third period and that goal
would prove to be the game-winner. It was the sixth game-winner for
Nieuwendyk this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes refused to go quietly, though. Ed Belfour took a
shutout into the game's 57th minute for the second consecutive
game, but then watched as two pucks slipped past him. The first
came when Tkachuk was left in front of the net for an easy rebound.
The second came when Tkachuk fed Tocchet for an easy goal after
Belfour failed to play the puck cleanly behind his net.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stars held on and held a road opponent under three
goals for the 26th consecutive road game. It's the longest such
streak in the NHL since the Detroit Red Wings held 30 consecutive
road opponents to three goals or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also pushed their road record to 20-7-8 and their
record against the Pacific Division to 14-2-2. Modano's teammates
had strong words for Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cheap, gutless; there's no room for that in the game,''
defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``It was intent to injure. As a
player, you know the puck's not there. Even if it was, he went
right for the head. \RModano's\S had concussions before, it could
have been just like \RPaul\S Kariya, he could have been done for
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes coach Jim Schoenfeld ``disagreed'' with the call and
Roenick's ejection. But Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk called it a ``a
total cheap shot.''

AGENT: COWBOYS ATOP ISMAIL'S LIST

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The deal is not done, but it does appear that
the Cowboys are on the verge of finally landing speedy receiver
Raghib Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail's agent, Jack Mula, acknowledged yesterday that he was
negotiating only with the Cowboys at the moment _ though he's still
in contact with the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are negotiating with Dallas right now,'' Mula said. ``But
it's not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones: ``We are still
working on it. Nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mula, who has stated at least four deadlines for a deal in the
past 10 days, said he hopes to get everything finalized by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have offered Ismail a multiyear contract worth
roughly $3 million per season, including a $5 million signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Once Ismail's deal is done, the Cowboys will turn their
attention toward signing free-agent center Mark Stepnoski and
free-agent linebacker Quentin Coryatt.
</P>
<P>
   Situations with several other players could also begin to
stabilize. Washington Redskins free-agent receiver Leslie Sheppard,
who is second on the Cowboys' list behind Ismail, likely will
return to the Redskins or replace Ismail with the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys unrestricted free-agent receiver Patrick Jeffers also
expects to get an offer from the Panthers, who said they would be
interested in him if they lost Ismail. The St. Louis Rams will also
make a run at Jeffers with an offer sheet in the near future.

CAL CRUISES IN SECOND HALF; CLEMSON WINS IN A STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For California, without a player who had played in a
post-season game before this season, the National Invitation
Tournament presented a precious opportunity, one the Golden Bears
used to reach the semifinals at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday
night. But for the opening 20 minutes of their game against Oregon,
Michael Gill mostly just watched and wondered if this moment had
passed him by.
</P>
<P>
   Gill picked up two fouls in the opening 1 minute 17 seconds of
the semifinal and then just watched. Gill, one of four seniors who
had transferred to Cal last year, arriving to find the school
serving a one-year ban for sins committed before any of the current
players or coaches had arrived in Berkeley, knew that this
tournament was the only reward, and he was missing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed in myself,'' Gill said. ``I was just
sitting, thinking about the season passing in front of me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After missing his only shot of the first half, Gill went out and
tried to get himself involved immediately in the second half. He
hit a short jumper on his first shot. He tried again on a jumper a
minute later, and it went down. He kept shooting. In the first nine
minutes of the second half, he made up for what he had missed in
the first, scoring 17 of his career-high 22 points in that span as
Cal turned a close game into an 85-69 victory over the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reaches a point where you don't know how many points you've
scored,'' said Gill, who had tied a career high with 18 points in
the quarterfinals against Colorado State. ``You're just playing
ball.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's championship game, Cal will face Clemson,
which defeated Xavier, 79-76, in the second semifinal. Oregon and
Xavier will settle for the consolation game.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson turned a 21-15 deficit midway through the first half
into a 40-29 halftime lead. The Tigers stretched the lead to as
much as 24 points in the second half before the Musketeers mounted
a late rally. Xavier, which had overcome a 15-point deficit against
Princeton in the third round, ran off 12 straight points to take a
76-73 lead with 1:26 left when Lenny Brown drained the Musketeers'
14th 3-pointer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Clemson responded, getting two free throws from Harold
Jamison with 1:07 left and two more by Tom Wideman, a 55 percent
free-throw shooter, with 29.3 seconds to play. Brown then missed a
3-pointer, and Andrius Jurkunas grabbed the rebound and closed the
scoring with two foul shots. Brown missed a desperation attempt
from 25 feet as time expired. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California, in earning its first shot at a post-season
championship in 40 years, avenged a pair of regular-season losses
to the Ducks and put its senior-laden squad one victory from a
storybook ending for a squad assembled of odd parts from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me if this was a rewarding win,'' Coach Ben
Braun said. ``The obvious answer is yes. Just the look of the
seniors, that makes it all worthwhile. I really feel for those
guys. They came to Cal at a tough time and I don't think anyone has
any idea how much they contributed to our program.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Gill and the Golden Bears have another game waiting, this
was already a dream ending to a rocky collegiate career for the
6-foot-6-inch Gill. He started his career at Pittsburgh, appearing
at the Garden in the Big East tournament as a freshman, then
transferred to Compton (Calif.) Community College before arriving
at Cal last year as part of a group of four transfer students that
helped rebuild the Golden Bears' program.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half of the first game, Cal's Francisco Elson,
a 7-foot center from the Netherlands by way of Kilgore (Tex.)
College, stole the ball from Oregon guard Yasir Rosemond, turned
and slammed in a dunk that shook the basket, knocking out the game
clocks at the Garden. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Play was halted while the clocks were reset, but no amount of
rolling back the clock could bring back the time when the Garden
rocked regularly during the NIT, and players like Pete Maravich and
Rick Barry drew huge crowds.
</P>
<P>
   A tournament that once drew better than 18,000 fans a game
opened on Tuesday night with a few thousand fans scattered
throughout the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   They were there to see four flawed teams hoping to use the
tournament as a building block for another season when they could
qualify for the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
or recapture a bit of pride for this season.
</P>
<P>
   No team fit that last description better than Cal, which
returned to post-season play this season after serving a one-year
tournament ban for an alleged illegal payment by the former head
coach Todd Bozeman's staff to a recruit.

MUNOZ SHOWING WHY HE BELONGS IN MAJORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ Left-hander Mike Munoz's grasp on an Opening Day
roster berth could be described as a stranglehold.
</P>
<P>
   His grip grew firmer yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz pitched two scoreless innings during the Rangers' 4-3
victory against the Toronto Blue Jays at Dunedin Stadium, and one
sixth-inning pitch to Carlos Delgado demonstrated why the
33-year-old left-hander likely will begin this season in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz surrendered consecutive two-out singles to Toronto's Homer
Bush and Shawn Green, and that brought Delgado to the plate with
runners aboard first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, a left-handed power threat who during 1998 hit .292
with 38 home runs, found himself at an early disadvantage with a
1-2 count. Munoz wasted one pitch and then induced a weak,
inning-ending ground ball to squelch the Blue Jays' scoring
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys who leaves the manager pacing in the
dugout,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``The reason he's
survived is because he's able to get guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   Relievers in search of a roster berth describe outs as a
precious commodity during March, and Munoz continues to deliver
those for the Rangers despite his deceiving 4.65 earned-run average
through seven appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Subtract his first appearance _ a horrendous March 6 outing
against the Pittsburgh Pirates _ and Munoz's ERA would be 1.04 with
opponents hitting only .257 against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did today is what he's done all of his career,'' Oates
said. ``He's a guy who's got good stuff. He's a high-walk guy, and
he throws a lot of pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, though, did not issue a walk yesterday and required only
nine pitches for the seventh inning after throwing 19 during the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Tony Fossas, who stands as the only legitimate
challenger between Munoz and a roster berth, surrendered a
ninth-inning run on two hits yesterday. That gave Fossas a 5.14 ERA
through his six appearances this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz appears well on his way to joining Eric Gunderson as the
Rangers' specialists for late-inning situational matchups.
Left-handed batters hit .359 (23-for-64) against Munoz the previous
season, but Oates said he views the former Colorado Rockies
reliever ``more than capable'' against lefties.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado serves as one example.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten the job done the last four or five outings,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Munoz has surrendered only one run during his past six
appearances spanning 8 2/3 innings. The stranglehold grows
stronger.

BAYLOR PAYS BIG TO SECURE BLISS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Many people connected with Baylor felt it was
imperative for the university to make a competitive statement to
the Big 12 when it hired a new men's basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing now-former New Mexico coach Dave Bliss yesterday,
and signing him to what a knowledgeable source said was a
five-year, $3 million contract, was just that kind of declaration,
search committee member Jim Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss' yearly package ranks him behind only Texas' Rick Barnes
($700,000) and Oklahoma's Kelvin Sampson ($610,000) among Big 12
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we could have done any better for Baylor,'' said
Turner, a former Baylor basketball letterman who is chief executive
officer of Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we wanted the very best coach we could get to
win games. At the same time, we needed to make a statement that
shows Baylor has a commitment to basketball as well and I think
this does that. We want to stay in the Big 12, and it's important
for us to win both in football and basketball. Dave has been a
winner wherever he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Tom Stanton said, ``If you had a guy on your
dream list and you could make it happen, who would it be? Dave was
that individual for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss brings a 24-year coaching record of 465-271 compiled at
Oklahoma, SMU and New Mexico and a history of 11 NCAA Tournament
appearances to a program that has been in the tournament once
(1988) in 49 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to bring his assistant of 24 years, Doug Ash,
with him to Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hide the fact it was a difficult decision _ not for
what we are coming to, but for what we are leaving,'' said Bliss,
55, who wrestled with the decision to accept Baylor's offer for
more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a program that regularly drew crowds of 17,000 and
played in seven NCAA Tournaments. Baylor's average attendance last
season was 2,689. He inherits a team short on major-college talent
that won only six of 30 games and was winless in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the opportunity came to apply, a lot of people scratched
their heads and said why leave \Rcrowds of\S 17,000 people, the Top
25,'' Bliss conceded. ``But when you get older, life is more than
the Top 25, more than being in the NCAA Tournament _ though that's
what we're going to be trying for here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation here is a unique one. Baylor is about more than
just winning. It's about how you win.''
</P>
<P>
   From a top program in the Western Athletic Conference, Bliss
turns to one at the bottom of the Big 12 that paid its last coach
about $150,000 yearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm aware of how good the Big 12 is,'' Bliss said. ``But that
allows us to recruit better; it allows us a lot of positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone \Rin the Big 12\S is doggoned serious about
basketball now. It's going to be a tough, hard road. But I believe
we have the wherewithal, the support and energy to do it. No doubt
we have a lot of work ahead. But that's never bothered anyone in
this room.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes called Bliss a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he'll do a great job there,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss cited his previously stated fondness for the Texas
lifestyle and his past successes in recruiting the state _ four of
last season's five starters at New Mexico are Texans, as are 11 of
15 scholarship players.
</P>
<P>
   He also said new football coach Kevin Steele and the
athletic-facility expansion were testament to a new direction for
Baylor's entire athletic program. And he downplayed reports that he
wearied of constant criticism for not getting his Lobos teams to
the Sweet 16, a factor associates say influenced his decision to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the contrary,'' he said. ``I'm grateful for 11 terrific
years. We won a bunch of games and had fun doing it. But there are
other adventures in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor will be one of those.

DUVAL WANTS REDEMPTION IN HIS BACK YARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ David Duval, the winningest player on
the PGA Tour the past three seasons, walked off the TPC at Sawgrass
layout after a second-round 77. Convinced he had missed the cut,
Duval was steamed and silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather someone beat me in a playoff than miss a cut,''
Duval said. ``That's the one failure in golf ... I don't handle it
well mentally. Especially when it happens at home.''
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, the Florida winds increased after Duval
left the course that day in 1998. Competitors' scores soared, and
the Jacksonville native eventually survived the 36-hole cut by a
stroke and went on to finish 18th.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling of disappointment that he had failed in front of
the home folks still gnaws at Duval, even a year later. It is
something he hopes to rectify this week at The Players
Championship, an event that Duval, 27, has attended every year
since he was a junior golfer who spent hours watching his heroes
pound practice balls on Sawgrass' driving range.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he was invited to play as a marker with Joey
Sindelar because of an odd-numbered cut. Duval, then 18, responded
by shooting 1-under through five holes before a back injury forced
Scott Hoch to withdraw and Sindelar joined forces with Hoch's
playing partner, Greg Norman, for the final 13 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Duval still counts the experience as one of his golf highlights,
although he said it was ``terrible'' having to leave the course in
mid-round with an under-par score.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Duval shined for the first time at TPC in front of
family and friends. This week, the game's hottest player _ eight
wins in the past 17 months _ hopes to finish the job in his first
competitive appearance in three weeks at a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably would be one of the most difficult victories for
me to achieve in my career because it's at home,'' Duval said.
``Since the people know you, they feel a little more easy about
approaching you and talking between holes. It's a bigger challenge
to block that out, but it would be more special if you could
overcome that and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting week for me. Other than the majors, this
is the most important tournament you'd want to win. Having it in my
back yard ... makes this even that much more desirable for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And even more imperative that, above all else, the PGA Tour's
winningest golfer survives the cut in front of family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON ...Karrie Webb
Webb seems poised to win at Dinah Shore
</P>
<P>
   She is, without question, the hottest golfer on the planet. With
three victories in six starts, LPGA participant Karrie Webb has
more 1999 triumphs than any professional on any tour and is batting
1.000 in top-10 finishes (6-for-6).
</P>
<P>
   All signs point to Webb, winner of last week's Standard Register
Ping event, as a favorite to win the first major championship of
the season when the LPGA tour visits Mission Hills Country Club for
tomorrow's opening round of the Nabisco Dinah Shore tournament. All
signs except one, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, the 1996 rookie of the year and 1997 Vare Trophy
recipient, has yet to record a major title among her 13 career
victories. And she's getting antsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am goal-oriented. I would like to play well in the major
championships and start winning some of those tournaments,'' said
Webb, who tops the LPGA season money list with $419,063. ``It's
time for me to break through. My expectations are really high ...
and I tend to be hard on myself. But that's why I'm where I am
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb said she has refocused after a 1998 season in which she won
just two tournaments, her lowest total as an LPGA participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two great years, I kind of relaxed. I found it tough to
set goals last year,'' Webb said. ``But during the winter, I took
some time off and got the hunger back. That's made a big
difference. It's got me going again.''
SHORT PUTTS
Seeking a bag
</P>
<P>
   A familiar figure roamed the grounds yesterday at The Players
Championship in search of work. But it remains unclear if Mike
``Fluff'' Cowan, former caddie for Tiger Woods, will work this week
or even remain a regular presence at PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan, dismissed last month by Woods, said reports of heightened
tensions prior to their breakup were ``way overblown'' and that he
holds no animosity toward his former employer. In fact, Cowan said
he was surprised when he received the news because the two had no
major disagreements, in his estimation.
</P>
<P>
   He declined further comment, saying changes in player-caddie
relationships are a regular part of PGA Tour life. Cowan said he is
interested in working with another player but would not be
disappointed if he does not pick up another bag on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to approach another player about it. As a
caddie, you just don't do that,'' said Cowan, a longtime caddie for
Peter Jacobsen before joining Woods in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance Cowan might work this week for Curtis Strange,
whose regular caddie will not be at TPC because of death in the
family.
Mixed results
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard Colonial officials have dispatched representatives to
TPC. Their mission: entice as many players as possible to compete
in Fort Worth at the May 20-23 event.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Colonial contingent can wave goodbye to Tiger
Woods, Ernie Els, Nick Price, Mark O'Meara and Lee Westwood. Those
five have committed to play in the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open in
Heidelberg, Germany, held the same week as Colonial. For O'Meara,
it marks a second consecutive trip to the event in pursuit of a
six-figure appearance guarantee, and O'Meara was instrumental in
enticing Woods to join him in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the brighter side, the PGA Tour's only multiple-event winner
this season, David Duval, said yesterday that he plans to play in
both the Colonial and the GTE Byron Nelson Classic (May 13-16). In
addition, Colonial has landed early commitments from Justin
Leonard, Steve Elkington, Phil Mickelson, Ben Crenshaw, Tom Kite,
Craig Stadler and defending champ Tom Watson.
Solheim Cup changes
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a new captain for the U.S. team, there will be a
change in the format of the 2000 Solheim Cup when the biennial
matches are held in Glasgow, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bradley, a 26-year veteran of the LPGA tour and a three-time
Solheim Cup participant, has been selected captain of the U.S.
squad. But she will have two fewer matches to oversee than her
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the event, which will be played Oct. 6-8, 2000, at
Loch Lomond Golf Club, announced that the new format will include
eight foursomes matches on Friday, six four-ball matches on
Saturday and 12 singles matches on Sunday. Previous competitions
have included eight foursomes, eight four-ball and 12 singles
matches.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were made to minimize chances for matches being
suspended because of limited daylight hours in Scotland during the
fall.

SAFIR FLEW TO OSCARS CEREMONY IN REVLON'S JET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A trip to the Academy Awards ceremony that Police
Commissioner Howard Safir and his wife took last weekend was paid
for by a cosmetics company executive, spokesmen for the company and
the Police Department said on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Safir and his wife, Carol, were guests of George Fellows, the
president and chief executive of Revlon, said Howard J. Rubenstein,
a spokesman for the company. ``They're personal friends,''
Rubenstein said, adding that Fellows, and not Revlon, paid for the
visit, which included hotel accommodations and seats on the
company's private jet. It was not clear on Tuesday night how the
Safirs obtained tickets to the awards ceremony. Details of the trip
were first reported on Tuesday night in The New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   After reports of the weekend emerged on Tuesday, Safir asked
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to have the City Corporation Counsel review
the trip to see if it violated city ethics codes, said Marilyn
Mode, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for public
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revlon does not do any business with the city,'' Ms. Mode
said, ``but nevertheless, the commissioner wants to make sure that
it is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the City Charter, public officials are prohibited
from taking gifts and gratuities from companies and individuals who
do business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   After the commissioner was seen on television at the Oscars
Sunday night, questions were raised about his decision to attend
such an event during the crisis over the police shooting of Amadou
Diallo. Safir initially refused to disclose details about the trip,
although he said he did not travel at city expense.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner and his wife flew on an airplane leased by
Revlon that took off from Teterboro airport in New Jersey,
Rubenstein said. He said he did not know where the Safirs stayed or
the total value of the trip. The Safirs, however, flew back to New
York on Sunday night on a commercial airline, which they paid for
themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani knew about Safir's visit Los Angeles, although he did
not know the trip included a night at the Oscars. The mayor's press
office referred all calls to the police department.
</P>
<P>
   The City Charter bans city officials from knowingly accepting
``any gratuity'' from persons who may be affected by official
action.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the charter bans officials from accepting
``any valuable gift'' except those that are ``customary on family
and social occasions.''

DEVILS AND SABRES TIE, 1-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Every time there is a confrontation
between the Devils and the Sabres, Martin Brodeur and Dominik Hasek
are the focus of attention.
</P>
<P>
   With 48 seconds left in overtime on Tuesday night, all eyes were
on Hasek. That was not because of his customary superb play; it was
the result of a frightening collision. Hasek was on his back and
kicking his legs after the Devils' Brendan Morrison ran into him.
</P>
<P>
   He rose to the applause of the 17,089 fans and the game finished
in a 1-1 tie. The Sabres announced afterward that Hasek had twisted
his upper back.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' Scott Niedermayer managed to shoot the puck into the
net, but time had expired in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Sergei Nemchinov, who made his debut for the Devils
after his acquisition from the Islanders a night earlier, took
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Nemchinov scored the only goal for the Devils,
who now are 1 point ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins in the battle
for the Atlantic Division lead. The Penguins visit the Devils on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nemchinov played with intensity and intelligence as the right
wing on a line with Morrison at center and Sergei Brylin at left
wing. Brylin made the pass to Nemchinov that resulted in his ninth
goal of the season, at 2 minutes 57 seconds into the middle period,
when he beat Hasek under the stick with a shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergei made a nice pass,'' Nemchinov said of his fellow
Russian. ``All I did was shoot. I'm happy to be with one of the
best teams in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemchinov had a great chance to score on the play Hasek was
hurt, but he chose to make a pass across the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek said he was pleased with the way Nemchinov
played in his debut. ``He's a real intelligent player and he scored
a nice goal,'' Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
   Nemchinov joined Pat Conacher as the only players to have
appeared for the Rangers, Islanders and Devils. Nemchinov played
for six years with the Rangers and nearly two seasons with the
Islanders, who signed him as a free agent from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Scott Stevens (groin strain) and Lyle Odelein
(bruised right knee) were out and Ken Sutton played only his third
game of the season, the Devils' defense looked secure, especially
in the opening period, when Brodeur faced only four shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils (38-22-9) also played without Bobby Holik, who was
suspended for two games by the league earlier in the day for
slashing and breaking the left index finger of Toronto's Igor
Korolev last Saturday in Toronto. It was the second suspension of
the year for Holik, who served a two-game suspension in November
for slew-footing Florida's Paul Laus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intention to injure and no carelessness,'' Holik
said in defense of his action.
</P>
<P>
   While Hasek had a busy night, facing 32, shots, including three
in the overtime, Brodeur was a spectator for much of night until
the late stages of the third period, when the Sabres tied the score
on a goal by Miroslav Satan with 3:37 left.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur faced 19 shots, none in the overtime, and improved his
record to 6-3-2 in his personal confrontations with Hasek. &QL;

SAMPRAS FALLS TO KRAJICEK IN QUARTERFINALS OF LIPTON
CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting) (sw) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ The shoulders were sunken, the head was
bowed, the racquet spewed sour notes like an out-of-tune piano.
Though Pete Sampras is again back in his accustomed perch as the
men's No. 1 player in the world, he and his game have not yet
caught up to his numeral. The bludgeoned backhand volley that
missed the court and set up his adversary's second match point on
Tuesday was visible proof of his current shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who entered the 1999 race belatedly after opting for a
Hawaiian vacation instead of the Australian Open, was gaining the
momentum to match his restored ranking here at the Lipton
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   But he was treated like a doormat on Tuesday in the
quarterfinals by his nemesis, Richard Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   A day after regaining the top spot, the second-seeded Sampras, a
two-time Lipton champion who hasn't won this title in five years,
played the shrinking violet against the seventh-seeded Krajicek and
made a 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) exit that was exceptional for its meekness.
And for its many flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Along with giving away a 4-1 lead in the tie breaker, where he
double faulted at 4-3, Sampras undermined his nine aces with eight
double faults. And he undercut his 30 winners with 32 unforced
errors, 22 more than Krajicek, now the highest remaining seeded
player here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's O.K., as long as I can live up to it,'' Krajicek said,
electing to take it as a positive omen that the last time he
defeated Sampras in a high-stakes quarterfinal, he captured his
only grand slam crown, at Wimbledon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek's latest subjugation of Sampras, whose exit leaves the
Lipton men's draw without an American semifinalist for the first
time in a decade, marked his fourth consecutive victory over him.
Just two other players, Michael Chang and Wayne Ferriera, have been
able to beat Sampras with such regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras followed last week's No. 1, Carlos Moya, and last year's
Lipton champion and No. 1, Marcelo Rios, to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   In women's play, the defending champion Venus Williams was
forced to fend off a surprisingly tenacious 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (7-4)
twilight challenge from 27th-ranked Anke Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was a mutually brutal exchange of baseline ballistics in
which Huber pinned the sixth-seeded Williams to the backcourt by
design. Searing returns from the German, whose forehand repeatedly
provoked last-gasp backhand mistakes from Williams, twice denied
Williams when she served for the match in the third set. But once
in the tie breaker, Williams charged to a 4-1 lead and nailed her
first match point when Huber soared a forehand wide.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion's 17-year-old sister, Serena, who surfed
into the Lipton on the high note of back-to-back titles at Paris
and Indian Wells, Calif., extended her unbeaten streak to 14
matches tonight with a cursory 6-2, 6-3 demolition of third-seeded
Monica Seles. Knowing that Seles has made a meal of her opponents
by taking the ball early and on the rise, the 16th-seeded Williams
simply took the ball even earlier, screeched even louder, and
earned her a quarterfinal berth against ninth-seeded Amanda
Coetzer.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kournikova, seeded 13th, failed to survive an erratic
outing against Austria's Barbara Schett, 6-1, 1-6, 6-1, today in
the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Martina Hingis eliminated Marlene Weingartner, 6-0,
6-2; second-seeded Lindsay Davenport ousted Yelena Likhovsetva,
6-2, 6-0, and seventh-seeded Steffi Graf trampled Natasha Zvereva,
6-2, 6-4.  &QL;

ALL QUIET ON BENDER FRONT AT WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bob Bender toured the Vanderbilt campus. He spoke with
the athletic director, again. He talked to the chancellor. He went
to spring football practice and met the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   But the University of Washington men's basketball coach did not
agree to become the Commodores' next head basketball coach. A news
conference was not held, nor is there one scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like a ball at tipoff, the Bender situation remained up in the
air. The Tennessean newspaper in Nashville reported Tuesday that
Bender is expected to be hired by today. If so, no word of his
imminent hiring was evident Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington athletic director Barbara Hedges has had daily
conversations with Bender for the past week and a half. But as of
late yesterday afternoon, she had yet to hear from him again.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges remains hopeful that Bender will stay at Washington,
indicating that she believes the coach is totally happy here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is that he's not (leaving),'' Hedges said. ``But
I'm certainly concerned about it. I don't want to lose Bob. He's
been absolutely wonderful as a coach and a person in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Bender makes a decision on Vanderbilt, Hedges plans to
talk with him in person. If that happens, it likely would be next
week after Bender returns from the Final Four in St. Petersburg,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   That would prolong matters. Vanderbilt athletic director Todd
Turner said he hoped to have a new coach in place before the Final
Four begins on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges said she does not think Bender will want an increase in
pay. Bender's salary is approximately $370,000, but with
incentives, the total package is worth $464,000, Hedges said.
Vanderbilt is believed to be offering $500,000, a negligible
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is not going to leverage anything,'' Hedges said. ``That's
not Bob Bender. There has never been an issue of money with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges is confident that when Bender compares both universities,
he will choose to stay put. Both schools are renovating their
arenas. Washington also is building new athletic facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is not right to go anyplace,'' Hedges said.
</P>
<P>
   If Bender is on the verge of signing a deal with Vanderbilt, it
would be news to two of his assistants, Eric Hughes and Byron
Boudreaux. While Hughes was out for a run early last night, Bender
left him a message that revealed little.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was matter-of-fact,'' Hughes said. ``He's got a lot of
stuff on his mind, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender is expected to return to St. Petersburg Wednesday in time
to attend the college basketball coaches convention at the Sheraton
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hedges, there is at least one other athletic director in
the state that hopes Bender stays at Washington. Gonzaga's Mike
Roth is concerned that the UW would be an attractive opportunity
for the hottest coaching prospect around, the Bulldogs' Dan Monson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason he would leave Gonzaga is if a dream job
opened up,'' said Roth, noting that Washington qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego State and Washington State called Roth, inquiring
about Monson. New Mexico called Tuesday after Dave Bliss resigned
to take the job at Baylor. Monson pulled his name from
consideration at San Diego State and does not consider WSU to be a
dream job even though he was raised in Pasco and graduated from
Idaho, eight miles from Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're from this state, you're either a Coug or a Husky,''
Roth said. ``If WSU is not his dream job, you can read into it what
you want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a lot of fear of San Diego State or Washington
State stealing Dan Monson away from Gonzaga. I'm not so sure I can
say that about the University of Washington. Bob Bender, please
stay at Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson's Gonzaga deal was sweetened in February. Roth wanted to
be proactive and reward Monson for the job that he had done to that
point. A month later, everyone knows the name. Gonzaga nearly
advanced to the Final Four, captivating a nation in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm an A.D. anywhere in the country and I have a basketball
opening, why wouldn't I call Dan Monson,'' Roth said. ``But it will
take a tremendous opportunity for him to leave.''

 DAVID STRICKLAND, 29, ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Strickland, an actor who regularly appeared on the
television comedy ``Suddenly Susan'' and had a supporting role in
the recently released film ``Forces of Nature,'' was found dead on
Monday in a Las Vegas motel room. He was 29.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the death appeared to be a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland appeared to be in good spirits late last week and did
not have any known work or personal problems, according to a friend
in Los Angeles, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``This was
out of the blue,'' the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   A brief statement released Tuesday by Las Vegas police said that
Strickland, whose full name was David Gordon Strickland Jr., rented
a room at the Oasis Motel on Las Vegas Boulevard South early Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Napoli, owner of the Oasis, which he described as an
adult-oriented motel, said Strickland had rented the $64 room at
2:30 a.m. At about 10:30 a.m., a call was made to the room by a
desk clerk, and when no one answered, Napoli said, he and a friend
entered the room and found the actor hanging from a ceiling beam by
a bed sheet, a chair near his legs, a six-pack of beer nearby.
Shortly afterward, Strickland was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Rick Alba of the Las Vegas Police Department said there was
no suicide note, nor any evidence that anyone else was involved in
the actor's death. ``There was nothing to indicate that it was
planned,'' he said. ``It just looks like a suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland played the writer Todd on ``Suddenly Susan'' and had
been on the show for the last three seasons. He also appears in a
small part in ``Forces of Nature,'' as Sandra Bullock's jilted
boyfriend. The movie opened last week and over the weekend was
ranked No. 1 in box office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good man and a truly gifted comic actor,'' said the
actor Judd Nelson, who also appeared on ``Suddenly Susan.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland was born in Glen Cove, L.I., and raised in Princeton,
N.J.; he moved to Pacific Palisades near Los Angeles while he was
in high school. Before his role on ``Suddenly Susan,'' he worked on
student films. He also appeared on ``Roseanne,'' ``Dave's World,''
``Sister, Sister'' and ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   No information was immediately available about survivors.

 MILTON GOULD, 89, LEGAL GIANT IN A CITY OF LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Milton Gould, a classicist turned storied courtroom
litigator who for years played the scholarly Inside to William
Shea's gregarious Outside as a managing partner of one of New York
City's most politically connected and ethnically balanced law
firms, died Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89 and since
the disbanding of Shea &AMP; Gould in 1994 had continued his 65-year
legal career with the firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &AMP; MacRae.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he and Shea engineered the 1964 law firm merger that
created what became Shea &AMP; Gould, Gould was already a prominent
litigator and Shea had already developed his reputation as a master
of the back-room deal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two decades as the firm became closely associated
with the local Democratic Party and a succession of mayors, it was
the backslapping Shea who emerged as its media star, especially
after his successful efforts to obtain a replacement team for the
defecting Brooklyn Dodgers led the city to name the Mets' stadium
after him.
</P>
<P>
   But while Shea, who died in 1991, is recalled by former
colleagues as having had a much sharper legal mind than he was
generally given credit for, it was the largely apolitical Gould who
built the firm's reputation as an effective courtroom advocate in
corporate and other litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a career in which he represented clients in major business
upheavals _ involving the likes of Twentieth Century Fox, Columbia
Pictures and Curtis Publishing _ Gould became famous for winning
millions for the stockholders of the old Fifth Avenue Coach lines
after it was taken over by the city, and for restoring the
reputation of Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli defense minister, in
a libel action against Time magazine, which had written that he had
encouraged a murderous Christian attack on Palestinian camps in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, informal man whose wardrobe tended to be more
off-the-rack rumpled than courtroom chic, Gould had such a
deceptively low-key manner during cross-examinations that rivals
were sometimes lulled into complacency.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time, for example, when Gould, defending a client
in an apparently open-and-shut municipal corruption case, asked the
key witness, an informant who had spent 10 months in the federal
witness protection program, how he had been spending his time, and
the man replied that he had been reviewing, embellishing and
clarifying his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, no doubt grateful that Gould had quickly gone on
to other matters and had not underscored the implications of the
statement with follow-up questions, obligingly passed up an
opportunity to ask the witness to clarify what he had meant by
``embellishing'' and ``clarifying,'' questions that would no doubt
have elicited an explanation that the man had certainly not meant
that he had altered his testimony or deviated from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nothing more was heard about the statement until Gould
got up to deliver his summation, one in which the word
``embellishing'' was used so often and with such effect that the
jury disregarded the informant's damaging testimony and found
Gould's client not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhattan who grew up reading Latin and Greek, Gould
never abandoned his love of classics, but at Cornell, where he
received a bachelor's degree in 1930, he gave up his plans to
become a college professor and switched his allegiance to the law.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the city's white-shoe law firms were notorious
for shunning Jewish lawyers, Gould was surprised to receive an
offer from the old line firm of White &AMP; Case, but when he learned
he was to be assigned to strictly research duties and forbidden
contact with clients, he quit and joined a new and energetic Jewish
firm, Kaufman, Weiztner &AMP; Celler, whose partners included a future
federal judge, Samuel Kaufman, and a powerful Brooklyn congressman,
Emmanuel Celler.
</P>
<P>
   As a Catholic lawyer, Shea had similarly been stung by the
city's Protestant legal establishment, and when Gould's firm, by
then known as Gallop, Climenko &AMP; Gould, merged with Shea's firm,
Manning, Hollinger &AMP; Shea, to create what was initially known as
Shea, Gallop, Climenko &AMP; Gould, it was no accident that one firm
was Jewish and the other Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with their new firm instantly dubbed Blarney &AMP; Chutzpah,
the partners took pains to make sure the percentages of Christian
and Jewish lawyers remained in the 40-60 range, although it did
hire Protestant and non-Catholic minority lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Gould and Shea, who rode to and from work
together, ran the firm. As Gould once put it, ``There was only one
boss, Shea and I.''
</P>
<P>
   As the firm grew, some of the younger lawyers chaffed at the
managing partners' high-handed ways, and after Gould, then 74, had
heart bypass surgery in 1984, the two men ceded power to a five-man
executive committee, which proceeded to expand the firm so rapidly
it never recovered after a downturn in the economy and was
dissolved in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, whose wife, Eleanor Greenburg Gould, died last year after
61 years of marriage, is survived by three children, Jonathan of
Woodstock, N.Y., Judson of Washington and Patricia Booth of New
York; a sister, Hinda Rosenthal, and five grandchildren.

WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION MAY HAVE TIMES SQUARE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shunned by landlords on newly scrubbed 42nd Street,
the World Wrestling Federation may have finally found a home in the
middle of Times Square for a theme restaurant with the company's
own bizarre blend of athletics and theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant and entertainment complex, which may be called
Raw Restaurant in a reference to the cable television show ``WWF
Raw,'' would have about 650 seats and feature guest appearances by
wrestling stars like Stone Cold Steve Austin and Sable. It would
also feature live music and broadcasts, as well as occasional
wrestling matches.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives active in Times Square said the WWF might
sign a deal as soon as Thursday for more than 45,000 square feet in
the basement and ground floor at 1501 Broadway, at the northwest
corner of 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is struck as expected, the restaurant would be in
the same building where Frank Sinatra once sang to adoring fans in
the Paramount Theater, and across Broadway from where ABC-TV plans
to open studios for ``Good Morning America'' later this year.
Although theme restaurants have fallen into disfavor recently, the
WWF is betting that its phenomenal popularity and ever-changing
cast of characters will prove a winning combination.
</P>
<P>
   James Bell, senior vice president for licensing at the WWF,
confirmed Tuesday that he was ``pursuing'' a deal at 1501 Broadway.
The space there was being built for a live music restaurant by
Planet Hollywood called Sound Republic, but those plans were
shelved amid the company's financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the space, and we have an idea that can make it
work,'' Bell said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the restaurant would be about more than simply
professional wrestling, where the action is faked, or as the WWF
would prefer to describe it, choreographed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would fill that venue with a more varied entertainment
package,'' Bell said. ``We are a soap opera that just happens to
have wrestling as a backdrop. The rest of it is pure
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   A partnership headed by Robert Gries Jr., an investment banker
from Tampa, Fla., whose family once owned an interest in the
Cleveland Browns football team, and George Simon, a Cleveland
restaurateur, would operate the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   With some critics calling the entertainment vulgar and
offensive, the Wrestling Federation has not had an easy time
finding a home in Manhattan. For a variety of reasons, it failed to
make deals at the Bertelsmann Building on Broadway at 45th Street,
the New York Times Building on 43rd Street and the E-Walk
entertainment complex being built on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the Wrestling Federation offered to rent the vacant
Times Square Theater on 42nd Street, between Eighth Avenue and
Broadway. Instead, the landlord, New 42nd Street, accepted a less
lucrative offer from Livent Inc., which planned to open a live
theater. Livent has since fallen into bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater seems to think we're lowbrow entertainment,'' Bell
said at the time, ``but we're the No. 1-rated show for teen-agers
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wrestling Federation now has the top show on cable
television and often outdraws ``Monday Night Football'' among male
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales of WWF's action dolls, videos, music albums and
T-shirts skyrocketed to $500 million last year. The company also
plans to demolish the Debbie Reynolds Hotel in Las Vegas to build a
theme hotel, casino and theater.
</P>
<P>
   But the WWF is paying a high price to enter Times Square. Planet
Hollywood had spent about $13.5 million carving out a spectacular
space at 1501 Broadway before it abandoned the concept. Planet
Hollywood, which like many other theme restaurants has suffered
from declining attendance and a falling stock price, decided to
sell the space, as well as its Official All Star Cafe chain of
restaurants. Planet Hollywood still plans to move its flagship
restaurant from 57th Street to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   According to real estate executives, the wrestling operators
have tentatively agreed to pay Planet Hollywood more than $8
million for the space and a steep rent of more than $2 million a
year. The group would probably have to spend another $4 million to
complete the restaurant and entertainment complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is hard to predict,'' said Jeff Rochlis, a real
estate consultant for theme parks and resorts at Rochlis &AMP; DeMayer
in Washington. ``There's almost a cult following. Who knows how
that translates into a restaurant experience?''

</HEADLINE>

 Adam Shatz's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was on DJ
interpretations of Steve Reich's music.  
 By ADAM SHATZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1937 John Cage inaugurated a musical revolution in three
sentences of typically Zenlike simplicity: ``Wherever we are, what
we hear is mostly noise. When we ignore it, it disturbs us. When we
listen to it, we find it fascinating.'' In the future, he declared,
music would be replaced by a broader field of creativity, which he
called ``the organization of sound.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 Roscoe Mitchell, then a 26-year-old saxophonist living
on the South Side of Chicago, released a stunning album called
``Sound.'' Mitchell's band looked like a jazz sextet, but it didn't
play like one.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the music had no fixed pulse: the drums were used
atmospherically, not rhythmically. The solos were explorations of
timbre and noise punctuated by long silences; the overall effect
was a trippy suspension of time. ``Sound'' belonged as much to the
future Cage envisioned as to the jazz tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Any similarities to Cage, however, were serendipitous. Unlike
Cage, a privileged insider who delighted in mischief, Mitchell was
a purposeful outsider, intent on claiming new rights for himself
and his peers. ``Sound'' was no mere esthetic experiment. It was a
pointed challenge to what Mitchell's fellow Chicagoan Anthony
Braxton has called ``the myth of the sweating brow'' _ the notion
that black music is an expression of native grace rather than
introspection.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1966, the year Stokely Carmichael raised the cry of black
power, ``Sound'' had the force of a manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe Mitchell, whose album ``Nine to Get Ready'' has just
appeared, is a leading member of jazz's forgotten avant-garde. Once
hailed as an heir to Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler, Mitchell
found himself pushed to the margins in the 1980s by Wynton Marsalis
and his traditionalist followers, who viewed free jazz as an evil
second only to fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 90s, Mitchell has been staging a comeback,
recording and performing at a furious clip. He might not be welcome
at Lincoln Center, where musicians are expected to adhere to
blues-derived forms and steer clear of European dissonances. But
among younger jazz players who chafe at such restrictions, Mitchell
is increasingly recognized as an elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz,'' he said recently, ``is a part of the whole picture,
but the communication lines are all over the place now. If you're
truly in love with music, you can't help being affected by that
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   A small, wiry man with close-cropped, salt-and-pepper hair,
Mitchell, 59, is best known as a member of the Art Ensemble of
Chicago, one of the most important free-jazz groups since Coleman's
1960s quartet. But it is in Mitchell's work as a solo performer and
as a leader that he has expressed his vision most rigorously.
</P>
<P>
   A saxophonist and flutist with a hard, acerbic sound reminiscent
of Eric Dolphy, Mitchell has a predilection for unusual effects
like circular breathing, a technique of simultaneously inhaling
through the nose and exhaling through the mouth that allows a
musician to blow for marathon stretches.
</P>
<P>
   His compositions have been performed by a wide array of
ensembles, ranging from his own experimental jazz bands to
contemporary classical groups like the S.E.M. Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been accused of making self-consciously cerebral
music, he said: ``It does not bother me to hear my music described
that way. I am a scientist involved in the study of music, and it
may well be that my work possesses some of those qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Nine to Get Ready,'' the scientist has unbuttoned his lab
coat and delivered some of the most lyrically accessible music of
his career. Half the album is devoted to Mitchell's thorny,
stylishly polytonal chamber music. But the jazzier half blazes with
feelings that Mitchell once seemed bent on renouncing in his
pursuit of sonic invention.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual nine-piece band on ``Nine to Get Ready'' is composed
of Mitchell on reeds, his longtime associate George Lewis on
trombone and Hugh Ragin on trumpet, simultaneously backed by two
full rhythm sections: the pianists Craig Taborn and Matthew Shipp,
the bassists Jaribu Shahid and William Parker and the drummers Tani
Tabbal and Gerald Cleaver. As Mitchell pointed out, the rhythm
sections ``can function together or separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the music on ``Nine to Get Ready'' is notated,
Mitchell's composing methods blur the line between written and
improvised music. To preserve the spontaneity of improvised music,
he uses written instructions and graphic symbols as well as notes
in his sheet music. (In one concert, Mitchell divided a stage into
squares, each containing suggestions for the performers, who would
move from one to the next.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mitchell abhors off-the-cuff expressiveness;
he expects musicians to shape each improvisation as if it were
composed. As he put it, ``You've got to know your part in
improvised music, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who was born and reared in Chicago, reached musical
maturity at a time when the South Side nearly surpassed New York as
a center of jazz innovation. In the early 60s, Mitchell began
playing in the pianist and composer Muhal Richard Abrams'
Experimental Band, which gave birth to the Association for the
Advancement of Creative Musicians (now better known as simply
AACM).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Drawing inspiration from the music of Coleman and from the
politics of Malcolm X, the collective staged concerts and provided
music lessons to inner-city children. ``We knew what happened to
people who were out there on their own, and we didn't want to end
up like that,'' Mitchell recalled. ``We wanted to have a scene that
we controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   The collective nurtured some of the most significant composers
of the 70s and 80s, including Mitchell, Braxton and Henry
Threadgill. ``There was a feeling of not waiting around for someone
to say you're OK'' said Mitchell. ``You'd go to someone's concert,
get really inspired and go back home to prepare for your own
concert.''
</P>
<P>
   A distinctive regional sound arose, one that valued shadings of
color and structural experiments over rhythmic motion and soloing.
If New York loft musicians were the action painters of free jazz,
these Chicagoans were its constructivists, working through
appropriation and collage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Mitchell founded the collective's flagship band, the
Art Ensemble of Chicago, with the bassist Malachi Favors, the
trumpeter Lester Bowie and the saxophonist Joseph Jarman.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling in France the next year, the Art Ensemble added
the drummer Don Moye. Its motto was ``Great Black Music: Past,
Present and Future.'' (Early album titles like ``Certain Blacks Do
What They Wanna! _ Join Them!'' gave the band a certain radical
chic cachet.) The Art Ensemble produced sophisticated pastiches of
advanced jazz, big band music, blues, African percussion and reggae
that honored _ and sent up _ the black musical tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was the band's intellectual-in-residence. ( Bowie was
its jester, Jarman its mystic.) He was also the only member to
appear on stage in street clothes. Since Moye, Favors and Jarman
covered their faces with tribal paint and Bowie wore a physician's
suit, Mitchell's appearance was a symbolic rejection of ornament.
It reflected the lean, analytic style he was cultivating as a
composer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mitchell still performs with the Art Ensemble, since
the late 70s he has focused on his work as a composer and leader.
In 1976, he moved with his family to a big farm in Wisconsin, where
he could finally hear, he said, ``silence and the way things move
in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   As he explained: ``When you're in the city you're always being
influenced by what's going on around you. I needed to get out of
the city to find myself, though I admit when I first looked in the
mirror I didn't see all that much. I found that I wasn't all that
great and I kept working, from morning to night.''
</P>
<P>
   On his records, Mitchell has painstakingly documented this
process of self-examination. Although he has produced marvels like
the 1981 album ``Snurdy McGurdy and Her Dancin' Shoes,'' some of
his records demonstrated that avant-garde jazz could be as arid as
academic serialism.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Nine to Get Ready'' _ his best record since ``Snurdy'' _
Mitchell has succeeded in fusing his scientific investigations of
sound with the humanism of his Art Ensemble work. The chamber
pieces have an unusual suppleness; the ballads are almost
voluptuous. The opening track, ``Leola,'' is a breathtaking requiem
for the composer's stepmother. In ``Jamaican Farewell,'' a
beautiful, cloud-like formation, Ragin's trumpeting sounds
virtually Coplandesque.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who now lives in Madison, Wis., leads a fairly ascetic
life for a jazz musician. He often wakes up early to run through
Bach's flute sonatas with Joan Wildman, a pianist on the faculty of
the University of Wisconsin, where he occasionally teaches. He
spends most of the day composing, studying and practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Baroque music is his latest obsession, and he has been
transcribing some of his compositions for a recorder orchestra.
``Berkeley Fudge, a saxophonist, gave me my recorder, and it felt
so natural, just the one key and the six holes,'' he said. ``And of
course the sound is just incredible. I've been in a lot of halls in
Italy that were just built for that sound.''
</P>
<P>
   If all of this seems a long way from his Chicago jazz roots,
Mitchell continues to uphold what he calls ``AACM philosophy.'' His
dream, he said, is to set up a collective of his own _ in the
country, of course: ``I'd love to have a school and a big
performance space. And I'd love to have a state of the art video
studio because the only example we have is MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added: ``I'd never have to leave the house. Can
you think of a hipper life than that?''

AN IMPROVED LIGETI MASTERPIECE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably no opera of the last quarter-century has been seen by
more people than Gyorgy Ligeti's ``Grand Macabre.'' Since its
premiere in Stockholm in 1978, the work has had several different
stagings in Europe, though none so far in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes its second recording, taken from public performances
in Paris a year ago of the production made for the 1997 Salzburg
Festival (Sony SK2 62312; two CDs). Esa-Pekka Salonen leads the
Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta Voices and an
excellent cast, most of whom will be returning in December, when
the production moves into the newly reopened Royal Opera House in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The work's success is understandable. It is the biggest
achievement by one of the outstanding composers of our time, a
score with characteristic moments of aural magic, equally typical
snarls of savage comedy and more surprising touches of movingly
expressed anguish. Besides all that, it has a narrative as clear as
a comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   Nekrotzar, the ``Great Macabre'' of the title, arrives in
Breughelland to announce the end of the world. He meets various
inhabitants, including a drunken peasant (Piet), the royal
astrologer (Astradamors) and his sexually unassuageable wife
(Mescalina), two young lovers in heat (Amando and Amanda, both
high-soaring female voices) and the boy monarch (Go-Go, a
countertenor).
</P>
<P>
   Midnight strikes, and the world duly ends, but the only person
to disappear is Nekrotzar, once he discovers that his threat of
universal annihilation has not been fulfilled. The others,
meanwhile, are left floating in a new existence that seems not too
much different from the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this story and a brilliant score, the opera made rapid
progress from theter to theater through the 1980s, yet all the
while, its composer was becoming dissatisfied with it. No doubt he
was growing away from its lusty vulgarity and its occasional
traffic in musical quotes. (Stravinsky's ``Sacre du Printemps'' and
Offenbach's cancan crop up in quick succession when Mescalina is
taking it out on her husband.)
</P>
<P>
   But also, as he points out in the booklet that comes with the
recording, he was troubled by practical problems: awkwardnesses in
the scoring that made the piece difficult to rehearse, and long
stretches of speech that held up the musical action. So for the
Salzburg production he spent almost a year making revisions, and
since the earlier version also exists in a recording (on Wergo),
anyone can hear what that process entailed.
</P>
<P>
   To take an example from the first scene, a whole spoken passage
in which Piet asks Nekrotzar about his part in ``this public
catastrophe'' is simply cut, and here Ligeti was surely motivated
by a desire to excise rather naive touches of self-reference as
well as to speed things up and relieve singers of the difficulties
many would find in delivering spoken lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the original version, Nekrotzar to Piet, like Christ to
Peter, turns the identity question back, and Piet guesses ``an
actor _ an opera singer or something.'' All this, happily, goes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if one compares the two recordings at this point, what is
most striking is the superiority of the later performance, in every
respect. Willard White, as Nekrotzar, is much steadier in tone,
more expressive and more ominous than his predecessor. Laura
Claycomb, the new Amanda, sings into the extreme high register that
was sketched before.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the orchestral performance is far better, whether in
the quick, snappy gestures that make a lot of the score sound like
cartoon music or in the wonderful cloud of orchestral trills that
projects, better than any spoken words, the miasma that Nekrotzar
has instead of a personality.
</P>
<P>
   Another unmissable difference is that the language has changed.
Ligeti's treatment of this issue in his booklet essay is unclear.
He says he composed the opera to a German libretto, then ``made the
appropriate rhythmic changes'' to fit the Swedish translation used
at the first performance.
</P>
<P>
   But he says nothing about the revised version, which, though so
far it has been seen only in Austria and France, has always been
sung in English.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably the original German setting was used for the
published score, and thus for the post-Stockholm performances,
including the 1987 Vienna concert performance perpetuated in the
Wergo recording. In revising this score, Ligeti appears not to have
made rhythmic changes to fit the English words: ``paradise,'' for
example, is stressed on the third syllable, as in the German
``Paradies.'' And where he was newly setting lines originally
spoken, he seems often to have been thinking in German, not
English.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, what is heard in the Sony recording sounds like a
translation. And it would do so even without the rhythmic oddities,
for ``Le Grand Macabre'' has its feet partly in a world of
Expressionist drama that is emphatically German, linguistically.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn that world upside down, mock the hysteria and the
histrionics, but it does so from a position of close acquaintance,
not from the safe distance of another language. Of the two
recordings, therefore, one provides the wrong text in the right
language, the other the right text in the wrong language.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for preferring the new version must include the musical
changes and the excellence of Salonen, his orchestra, his chorus
and his soloists. Apart from those already mentioned, Sibylle
Ehlert is wonderful in the scary-absurd coloratura arias of Gepopo,
the head of Breughelland's secret service, and in her contributions
as Venus to the brilliant star music that contrasts with robust
human behavior in the scene between Astradamors and Mescalina.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ligeti's alterations to the score, these are relatively
small but crucial. His deletions consist mostly of sequences
previously spoken without accompaniment, and the new music includes
lyrical lines to replace speech (sometimes involving choice
developments in the orchestration) and a finer ending.
</P>
<P>
   The old score finished rather heavily, with the orchestra. Now
the voices go to the end, in long farewells, while the orchestra
makes strange, wide-spanning, soft sounds, like felt bells.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than it was before, ``Le Grand Macabre'' is a wonder.

EXPLORING LOVE IN THE ARCTIC, FINDING SUCCESS IN SPAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   Leslie Camhi's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the French director Catherine Breillat.  
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julio Medem, 40, makes sophisticated, elegantly constructed
films whose characters seem to wander blindly through a maze of
experience. The director has earned a reputation as Spain's most
promising auteur; but as an artist, he prefers not knowing where
he's going.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm working,'' he said by telephone from Madrid, ``if I
come up with something that has a very clear and concrete meaning,
I almost always put it aside.'' Instead, he proceeds intuitively,
building stories through the poetic juxtaposition of simple,
evocative images.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish audiences have had no trouble connecting with ``Lovers
of the Arctic Circle'' (``Los Amantes del Circulo Polar''), Medem's
fourth feature and a surprise hit there. The movie will be
presented in the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of
Modern Art on April 7 and 8, and will open theatrically the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   Highly stylized, the film is a love story told alternately from
the perspective of each of the lovers, and it plays with the
tension between the lovers' fairy-tale idealism and the hazards
that govern their fate. The couple, Otto and Ana, meet and fall in
love as children. When their parents, who are both single, marry,
they become entwined in an odyssey that spans 17 years and takes
them to the fringes of Europe, from Iberia to Lapland.
</P>
<P>
   A complicated sense of identity and a feeling for far-flung
geography seem to come naturally to Medem, who is one of a number
of prominent young directors to have emerged from the Basque
provinces, the region of northern Spain whose drive for
independence has been a source of political conflict for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Medem was born in San Sebastian. His family left for Madrid when
he was 6 but spent vacations in the Basque region, and he returned
to live there when he was 22, moving back to Madrid just three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, the pressures surrounding the political situation
marked me very deeply,'' he said. ``Among bourgeois circles in
Madrid, people were largely unaware of all that Franco's
dictatorship implied. But in the Basque country, his rule was much
harsher. He prohibited the Basque language, which my mother spoke.
Some of my uncles and cousins were imprisoned. My moving back was a
very conscious ideological decision, to reconnect with that
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Medem experimented with his father's Super 8
camera. Then, while completing medical studies at the Basque
Country University, he wrote film criticism for a San Sebastian
newspaper; upon graduation, he founded a production company and
directed two short films.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he made ``Vacas'' (``Cows''), a lyrical and visceral
first feature, set in one of the region's lush, isolated valleys.
It opens in 1875, in the trenches of a fierce civil conflict, the
Second Carlist War, and ends, some 60 years later, on the
battlefields of another, the Spanish Civil War. The same actors
play three generations of Basque peasants, locked in bitter
familial and political rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to create a claustrophobic atmosphere, to portray
that repetitive violence, that cycle of wars without exit,'' he
said. The film's fertile mysticism, epic scope, and absurdist
sensibility recall the work of magical realist and surrealist
writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Jorge Luis Borges, whom
Medem read widely in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cows'' was followed by ``The Red Squirrel'' (``La Ardilla
Roja''), a 1993 feature about a musician's efforts to persuade a
pretty amnesiac that she is his girlfriend. Three years later,
Medem made ``Earth'' (``Tierra''), a metaphysical love story that
focuses on a lonely man sent to fumigate the vineyards of a
desolate patch of Spanish countryside. A sense of isolation unites
these rather disparate films, as well as a consciousness of the
fragility of individual experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovers'' draws on a similar psychological terrain, concluding
in the solitude of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two lovers always create a space that they can share alone
together,'' Medem said. ``The Arctic Circle represents their
idealized, dream destiny. It's an impossible place, where there's
no one, where time doesn't exist. And that's the wonderful thing,
and also the dangerous thing, about running away and following a
romantic ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   With its focus on amorous themes, ``Lovers'' seems to share the
preoccupations of a new wave of Spanish directors who are turning
away from the politics of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex, death and the Civil War were the concerns of the
preceding generation,'' said Geoffrey Gilmore, the co-director of
the Sundance Film Festival. ``To some degree, young filmmakers are
trying to do anything but that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Medem's complex, allusive film language also makes him an
anomaly among his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julio Medem is a happy throwback to an earlier era of Spanish
cinema,'' said Richard Pena, the director of the Film Society at
Lincoln Center, ``to people like Manuel Gutierrez Aragon and Carlos
Saura, who worked under the dictatorship, and created a cinema of
codes and messages, with densely metaphorical, elaborately
constructed films whose meanings had to be teased out. After
Franco's death, Pedro Almodovar and the directors who followed
turned to a very up-front, in-your-face kind of filmmaking. But
that Cabalistic strain in Spanish cinema runs very deep, and Medem
is part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His work is also informed by a highly personal sense of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was tension in my family,'' Medem said, ``because my
mother was Basque and my father, whose family was German in origin,
was supportive of Franco. There's a sequence in `Lovers' that goes
back in history, to show a Basque peasant sharing a cigar with a
German pilot whose plane was shot down during the bombing of
Guernica. For me it was a way of bringing together those two sides
of my family, in a gesture granting forgiveness, since my film is
also about finding forgiveness through love.''
</P>
<P>
   For Medem, filmmaking is a transformative experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each film is a journey that takes you very far away, with
everything you have, to a place where you always leave something
behind,'' he said. ``You create a hole in yourself. And with the
next film, you try to fill up that hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look back,'' he continued, ``or make calculations
about where I'm heading. I want each film to be the living
expression of who I am at that moment.''

 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from London.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ian Rickson says he admires auteur stage directors like
Robert Wilson and Anne Bogart, who leave their emphatic imprint on
a production. But he prefers to burrow out from the inside of a
play. And if people don't notice what he has done, that may be the
highest compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Rickson's work is on display in ``The Weir,'' by the Irish
playwright Conor McPherson, 27, which opens on Thursday at the
Walter Kerr Theater. This meditative drama of barroom blarney that
gives way to a sense of loss and then of healing is the director's
first Broadway effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people talk about the play, then you've done your job,''
said Rickson, who is 35 and has spent most of his career directing
British premieres of works like ``The Lights,'' by Howard Korder,
an American; ``The Day I Stood Still,'' by Kevin Elyot, and
``Mojo,'' by Jez Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job in `The Weir,''' Rickson said, ``is to release and
realize the text, not to scribble on it. I suppose that's why
directing a new play is a specific skill; if the critics say `ably
directed' or `deftly directed,' it's the best you can hope for.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in a remote pub in rural northwest Ireland, one of the
country's poorest regions, ``The Weir'' brings together four men,
three of whom trade eerie tales of personal experience as they try
to impress a Dublin woman, Valerie (portrayed by Michelle Fairley),
who is newly arrived in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   But Valerie has her own story to tell, which alters the stakes _
particularly for the aging, solitary Jack (Jim Norton) _ and
captivates the bartender, Brendan (Brendan Coyle), whose compassion
speaks volumes, even if the character does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir,'' which had its premiere in London two summers ago,
was the first play by McPherson to incorporate dialogue. Both ``St.
Nicholas,'' a solo work that was well received Off Broadway at
Primary Stages last season with Brian Cox, and ``This Lime Tree
Bower,'' which opens at the same theater in May, are written as
monologues.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson is also the author of the 1998 gangster comedy ``I
Went Down,'' which has proved to be a very successful independent
Irish film.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet, reflective mood of ``The Weir'' is in almost direct
contrast to the combative tone of the Walter Kerr's previous
occupant, ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' by Martin McDonagh,
another drama set in an Irish backwater. As was true of ``Beauty
Queen,'' ``The Weir'' is arriving on Broadway in the same
production that played in London, where last month it won an
Olivier Award for best play. (Coyle won an Olivier as well, for his
bartender role.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The play is saying you must speak what is inside you,'' said
Rickson. ``It allows you to go on a human journey that is so
necessary and desired.''
</P>
<P>
   He linked the title ``The Weir'' _ which literally refers to a
dam and metaphorically to the flood of feeling released during the
storytelling _ to the lone woman, Valerie. ``The image of the weir
is important,'' the director said, ``because, if you like, water is
the unconscious, the paranormal, the feminine, and we're in a
thoroughly male world into which comes the feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance of masculine and feminine occurs,'' Rickson
continued. ``Jack is sort of feminized by Valerie. He's able to
tell a story about himself that he never would have at the
beginning of the play.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rickson can speak of feminine influences, similar words have
been used to describe his strengths as a director. ``Ian finds the
femininity in you,'' said Ray Winstone, the burly film actor who
has appeared in two productions for Rickson at the Royal Court,
``Some Voices'' and ``Pale Horse,'' both by Joe Penhall; Winstone
also played the brutish father in Gary Oldman's film ``Nil By
Mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of male directors who think about the macho
side of man,'' Winstone said. ``I like the other side of it, and
Ian does also _ the weaknesses that make someone a human being.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Daldry, who preceded Rickson as artistic director of the
Royal Court, said Rickson's work ``is not about showing off in a
conceptual way; Ian gets into the heart of a play and manages to
reveal that heart.'' (Daldry is currently represented on Broadway
as the director of ``Via Dolorosa,'' written by and starring David
Hare, the British playwright.)
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kent, co-artistic director of the Almeida Theater in
North London, mentioned the challenge Rickson would face in the
fall. It is then that the Royal Court returns to its venerable home
for new writing. It has been encamped in several West End theaters
while its headquarters in Chelsea were rebuilt at a cost of more
than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about going back in,'' Kent said, ``and re-engendering
the excitement and sense of place that any theater, or at least any
building-based theater, needs. That's going to be Ian's task.''

<P>
   Rickson said he felt up to it. The director attributes at least
some of his maturity and point of view to the fact that he was just
21 when he became a father. Jack, his son, is now 13 and lives half
the time with each parent; Rickson lives in South London with Polly
Teale, a theater director and his companion of nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bringing up a child for three years on my own,'' Rickson
recalled, ``pretty much because his mum had gone back to
university. In a way, you either have empathy or you don't. When
you have a child, it's a powerful emotional experience. What it did
for me was center me as an artist. You learn to really focus on
what's important to you.''

   PARIS _ Slobodan Milosevic has again forced intermediaries to
extend the deadline for agreement on autonomy for Kosovo. This
adjournment poses more urgently than ever the question of
protection of civilian populations.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians have been forgotten in the negotiation process. Their
fate is being left exclusively to humanitarian aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Kosovo's civilians worsens by the hour as the
fighting between Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army escalates.
Once again, entire families are being forced to flee their
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile clinics operated by Medecins du Monde in four
municipalities are assisting thousands of displaced persons, many
of them destitute, terrorized and exhausted after trekking for
several days without sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   These newly displaced persons join other thousands already in
the four towns, which were partly destroyed during Serbian
offensives last year.
</P>
<P>
   A study of the four zones by Medecins du Monde found that close
to 7,000 homes were destroyed. Yet 30,000 refugees were on hand
last month before the current influx.
</P>
<P>
   The health and food situation is extremely precarious. As many
as 50 men, women and children can be found sharing a single room.
They take turns sleeping and keeping warm.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new arrivals say they had to leave elderly people or
invalids behind in their home villages. Some families have
abandoned their homes for the second or third time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the displaced children are unable to attend school
because the schools are already overcrowded. Many show signs of
extreme anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty with which these people are confronted, as they
constantly fear a new attack, aggravates the general deterioration
of health.
</P>
<P>
   Medecins du Monde is trying as best it can to protect these
people. As a humanitarian organization, it cannot interfere in the
fighting or prevent the flow of displaced persons. It can only
provide health care and food, and let these refugees know that they
have not been completely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians of Kosovo should not have to pay the price for the
slow pace of negotiations and the power struggle between Milosevic
and the international community.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a case of a disembodied diplomatic negotiation. The
lives of many thousands of people are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Every day that passes without a political resolution results in
more displaced persons and heightens the humanitarian emergency in
Kosovo. &QL;

A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR CHOPIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another anniversary is upon us, yet the music business is
strangely muted. Frederic Chopin died 150 years ago, and the
relative silence has less to do with our forgetfulness than with
our despair. For what are we to give the man who has everything?
</P>
<P>
   Centennials _ bi-, tri-, sesqui- or of whatever nature _ promise
concentrated looks, resuscitations of neglected works,
re-evaluations of worth, new editions and musicological
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Bach's 300th birthday, in 1985, made us pay attention to
cantatas rarely heard outside the church these days, if even there.
The Telemann 300th in 1981, the longest of my years as a junior
critic, established the Baroque master as (alas) among the most
prolific of German composers.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart, in 1991, 200 years after his death, got Lincoln Center
into the accounting business, its various performing arms ticking
off every piece in Kochel's famous list and then some. Mozart also
gave concert presenters a ready-made way to interest listeners and
sell them tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, anniversaries have become a marketing strategy. The
Brahms year in 1997 prospered because Brahms fits modern orchestra
and concert-hall formats. Everybody played the Brahms symphonies
anyway, so why not just stick on the centennial label to add a
little tone?
</P>
<P>
   Some music schools are advertising Chopin quasi-marathons,
featuring their star pupils. This again continues what these young
people do everyday anyhow and simply gives it a name. If the FBI
kept statistics, I'm sure it would tell us that crimes against
Chopin's etudes are committed about every 30 seconds in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestras don't have to worry. Chopin's teen-age piano
concertos, near-miracles of invention, use them as backdrops, and
thin ones at that. There are songs and pieces for the composer's
beloved cello, but most everything else rests on the keyboard, and
these we know about already.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chopin rings from every stage, every car radio and
every living-room loudspeaker; he is so beloved that we are dulled
to his qualities. The G minor Ballade has astonishing originality
and force, but its opening measures send me screaming from the
room.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful militance of the polonaises has become a cliche.
As Lincoln Center's recent film festival of historic pianists told
us over and over, Chopin remains a touchstone. I still respond to
the mazurkas: first, because of their adventure; second, because
their relative technical simplicity has been largely shunned by
virtuosos.
</P>
<P>
   So what gift can we give a man like this? Reformed performance
practices? Perhaps. Emanuel Ax has been playing Chopin on the
lighter instruments of the period; and though I don't think their
clarity compensates for their weakness, Ax plays his old Erard
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to forget Chopin's Classical origins; he probably played
ornaments as Beethoven or even Mozart might have, not according to
the ``modern'' usage that came from editions made many years after
his death.
</P>
<P>
   But the influences seem pale next to the sui generis that was
Chopin. Even the early piano concertos are startlingly different
from anything around them. No one else explored diatonic harmony
with such vision or captured the modal flavors of Central European
folk music with such subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   By accident or on purpose, 20th-century composers (Mahler and
some American songwriters excepted) lost Chopin's endless gift for
melody. From a ground zero arrived at perhaps from outer space,
Chopin set about laying ground rules for piano writing that have
never lost their influence.
</P>
<P>
   Are we in for other marathons? Garrick Ohlsson recently gave us
Chopin complete in a brilliant series of recitals at Alice Tully
Hall extended over two seasons. Do we need more Chopin recordings?
My copy of the Schwann catalog is not quite up to date, but before
my fingers got tired of counting, I was up to 52 entries for the
preludes, 40 for the waltzes and 37 for the polonaises. Releases
drop in and out of print, but I would be surprised if the totals
weren't pretty much the same now.
</P>
<P>
   I have a modest proposal for the 150th anniversary of Chopin's
death. It is one that no one will pay the slightest attention to,
but here it is anyway. Let us remember this great man with a year
of silence. Let us ban his music from the airwaves and empty his
CDs from the bins.
</P>
<P>
   Images of Chopin will be turned to the wall. All editions of his
music _ from Paderewski to Cortot to Henle _ will be confiscated
and stored. Teachers caught teaching his sonatas will be subject to
arrest; private citizens heard whistling his wonderful tunes will
receive summonses (citizen's arrests recommended). No new
biographies, no studies, no lectures, no newspaper or magazine
articles.
</P>
<P>
   If the necessary legislation runs into trouble (it might not,
given how few Congressmen probably know or care who Chopin was),
then take this silence upon yourselves. Earplugs will be necessary;
also a hammer big enough to damage offending apparatuses.
</P>
<P>
   A great sorrow of my musical life is that that I shall never
again know the rush of delight that ought to accompany a hearing of
the Barcarolle, the D flat Nocturne, the slow movement of the
Second Piano Concerto or the great A minor Mazurka.
</P>
<P>
   I remember driving back from a Maine vacation that had been
devoid of music, turning on the radio and discovering, on the way
to the nearest country-and-western station, a Haydn quartet. What a
shock of delight it sent out. With what freshness it was received.
Silence renews, and no one needs it more than Chopin. Stop
listening.

NEW INSIGHTS FOR A DISTINCTIVE MODERNIST VISION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rehash or celebration? As a work in progress, the New York City
Ballet's 50th anniversary year looks like both. The celebration is,
in effect, a retrospective: Now halfway through the 100 ballets it
plans to present through June, the company leaned toward the
familiar in its recent winter season. Yet the packaging was often
different, and new contexts made for new insights.
</P>
<P>
   The festive colors were waved early in this first of two
anniversary segments. There was a spectacular party for 50 years'
worth of company alumni, most of whom turned up two days later for
a mammoth curtain call at the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a strange parade of guest conductors auditioning
in public for a City Ballet job, or at least offering welcome gusto
in the pit.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the winter season was business as usual. This meant that
the dancing was glorious and that fresh talent continued to come
forward. (The young Adam Hendrickson, exciting in his tensile
energy, was this season's revelation.) Just as clearly, there was
none of the daring of the 1993 Balanchine celebration, which
attempted to revive works no longer danced at the City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the ballets were the same we have seen for
years, with a few exceptions. Jacques d'Amboise's 1964 ``Irish
Fantasy,'' which had been out of the repertory since 1982, returned
as a solid and sprightly neo-Balanchinian exercise. ``Les
Gentilhommes,'' Peter Martins' 1987 tribute to male classical
dancing, was better performed in the past. By contrast, his
``Beethoven Romance,''from 1989, preserved its romantic perfume.
</P>
<P>
   The major works presented, however, were not revivals but the
ballets by Balanchine and Jerome Robbins that are the company's
soul. As artistic director, Martins had to make the season special,
and the surprise is the success of his old-wine-in-new-bottles
approach. Theme programs, including tributes to composers,
abounded. Unexpectedly these marketing gimmicks provided fresh
esthetic insight.
</P>
<P>
   There were Russian, English, French, Austrian, German, Italian
and Polish ``tributes'' with a relevant diplomat on hand to
introduce ballets whose composers came from his country. Sometimes
the composers themselves were given a tribute, as in the all-Ravel
and all-Brahms evenings.
</P>
<P>
   One could see and hear differently and make connections when
ballets, usually spread out over seasons, were clustered together.
Martins' most brilliant packaging was in the weeklong ``Balanchine
Black and White Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   To take in this highly concentrated dose of Balanchine's
avant-garde ``leotard'' ballets, danced mostly to 20th-century
music, was to experience the City Ballet at its essence: a
modernist company, unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one premiere, Martins' ``Walton Cello Concerto,''
whose abstracted love triangle was fervently embodied by Damian
Woetzel, Miranda Weese and Alexandra Ansanelli. The choice of
William Walton's music came out of the woodwork, but the ballet was
superbly polished, deftly chiseled.

WHAT ROCK COULD LEARN FROM THE WWF  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most telling moments in modern professional wrestling
came during Wrestlemania XIV, last year's World Wrestling
Federation event that featured not only Mike Tyson in the ring but
also Gennifer Flowers. (``Everyone likes Gennifer Flowers,''
commented the announcer on her role as a timekeeper.)
</P>
<P>
   During one match, Chyna _ a raven-haired woman with arms the
size of barstools _ was handcuffed to a WWF commissioner, forced to
watch helplessly as her partner, Hunter Hearst Helmsley (known as
HHH), lay unconscious in the ring, being punched silly by Owen
Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nowhere, a handful of lye appeared in Chyna's gargantuan
hand. She threw it in the eyes of the commissioner, blinding him,
and dragged him to the ring, where she proceeded to crack Hart in
the groin, thus winning the match for HHH.
</P>
<P>
   In the slow-motion replay afterward, viewers watched the lye
gradually, grain by grain, enter the eyes of the commissioner.
Commenting on the blinding, the ringside announcers didn't see any
rules being broken. ``This is a brilliant, brilliant maneuver!''
they exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Later in that same Wrestlemania, when Pete Rose (yes, the
baseball player) was slammed head first onto the mat and hauled
away on a stretcher, the commentators were just as glib. ``Watch
Rose's head,'' they instructed gleefully during the slow-motion
replay.
</P>
<P>
   Some 19,000 people feasted on the carnage in the Fleet Center in
Boston. Tickets sold out in about 90 seconds, making it the
highest-grossing indoor show ever held in Boston. Another 700,000
people were watching on pay-per-view, landing the match on the
service's list of the top five events and bringing total
Wrestlemania XIV revenue to $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   A music fan watching from the side-lines might wonder why rock
bands aren't doing this well. After all, professional wrestling may
be a macho soap opera incorporating pieces of Japanese anime, P.T.
Barnum circus, cold war politics, ``Rocky'' movie, vaudeville,
Shakespeare and lucha libre (masked Mexican wrestling).
</P>
<P>
   But at its heart it's a heavy-metal arena show. It's got the
flash pots, the testosterone, the portentous music, the violent
invective, the satanic mythology, the crotch grabs and the
self-invented characters who speak in monosyllables. Before Vince
McMahon turned wrestling into a theatrical spectacle, there was
Kiss with its makeup, rocket-launching guitars and blood spitting.
And the main thing professional wrestling has that Kiss doesn't is
the illusion of violence and danger.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the reason professional wrestling continues to grow
since its reinvention in the 1980s is that it constantly finds new
ways to up the violence and danger ante. Why just hit someone in
the face when you can grab a folding chair from the audience and
bash your opponent with that? Why simply body-slam someone when you
can grab a ladder from under the stage and perform a flying drop
from 10 feet in the air? Why stop at knocking out your opponent
when you can bury him alive or stuff him in a coffin and set him on
fire? All of these events took place _ and many times _ during
wrestling matches last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, the voodoo-loving New Orleans
rhythm-and-blues singer (and a former boxing champion), used to
appear on stage in a flaming coffin. But that was decades ago.
Today, rock is having problems. Promoters say there are no new
bands with members under 40 that can sell out stadiums the way
wrestling can.
</P>
<P>
   Monster truck shows, on the other hand, have no problem selling
out stadiums night after night. And monster truck shows don't even
have real celebrities, as wrestling does: just unseen drivers like
Gravedigger, who is basically loved because he takes his turns too
fast and too tight and likes to drive through stadiums destroying
props. There's that violence and danger again. And maybe that's
what rock-and-roll needs.
</P>
<P>
   Sports once had the problem rock did. Like rock-and-roll, sports
events demand credibility: the game has to be real, the outcome
just. Nobody likes a fixed game. Wrestling was once credible: even
Abraham (Honest Abe) Lincoln served his time in several hundred
wrestling matches in the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Classy Freddie Blassie and Killer Kowalski in the
1950s, with larger-than-life personas, overblown moves like
spinning airplane body slams and a love of cheating _ pulling hair,
beating up referees, using canes and two-by-fours. Suddenly
wrestling became the most popular sport on television.
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional sports fans, music audiences like their stars
to be real. Concepts of credibility and authenticity are important.
Music fans create an intimate bond with a singer, who is somehow
able to voice their feelings in song and make them feel that they
are not alone in the world anymore.
</P>
<P>
   At a concert, all these loners and small cliques of friends come
together and magically, for one night, they are a community. But
maybe rock should take a tip from Vince McMahon and stop pretending
to be so real all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, rock-and-roll is in a huge decline; rap music, full of
wrestling-type personas like Ol' Dirty Bastard and Big Punisher, is
dominating the market. Many put the blame for this on alternative
rock, and on its performers' insistence on keeping the music real
by eschewing spectacle and performing concerts in which they stand
still and wear everyday clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all alternative rock's fault: in forming such deep
personal relationships, music has fragmented into hundreds of
sub-genres in order to satisfy every personality type. Those who
worship violence must choose to identify with either heavy metal or
hardcore rap, and if you choose heavy metal, then there is speed
metal, black metal, hair metal, Christian metal and dozens of other
spinoffs to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Can't we just come together and share in something we all love,
like violence and danger? By banking on the generation gap instead,
rock only divides and limits its audience, while professional
wrestling and monster truck shows rake in the cash because they
are, believe it or not, family events.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a proposal to make music concerts big again, to
take a tip from professional wrestling and monster truck shows and
sell out stadiums. After all, professional wrestling stole its
thunder from arena rock, so maybe it's time for rock to steal it
back.
</P>
<P>
   A new tour, a battle of the bands, must be created. At every
performance, there would be a routine of competitive contests
interspersed with rock and rap theater. At these events,
established performers would have to change their names slightly to
become Mick (the Lip) Jagger, Dave (Madman) Matthews and the Great
Big Punisher.
</P>
<P>
   On tour, they would join a new breed of battling rockers,
guitarists like the Mad Axman and rappers like M.C.
Kick-You-in-the-Head. Managers would become important characters,
representing forces of evil who manipulate musicians to rock or rap
harder and destroy one another.
</P>
<P>
   Each monster rock show would open slowly, with local bands
performing on either side of the theater in a contest to see who
could play at the loudest volume and blast the other out of the
stadium. Cheating tactics, like sabotaging each other's equipment,
would be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   For the second event, a Kenny G or Vanilla Ice impersonator
would come on stage to perform, only to be crushed by a falling
lighting rig or beaten up by a marauding rock band. Following that,
there could be rap battles in which rhyming insults spur violent
reactions from opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In another event, the stage would be set up with enough gear for
one rock band. Yet three or four rock bands would be sent on stage
to fight one another to get to the instruments. In the meantime,
rappers would drive through the arena in monster trucks, firing
guns at one another.
</P>
<P>
   Music concerts already have their own built-in battles between
good and evil, with concert security guards, police officers and
picketing fundamentalists representing the dark side. Events could
be choreographed in which security guards rush the stage and try to
keep a band from playing, resulting in plenty of guitar bashing and
microphone stand fencing.
</P>
<P>
   After all, every instrument on stage is a potential weapon:
bands need to do more than just smash them after a concert. In the
same way the wrestler Undertaker can summon lightning bolts from
the sky to strike down innocent bystanders, lead singers need
magical powers besides charisma. They need to be able to fly, see
through people's clothes and shoot lasers through their gold teeth;
this way they can come to the superheroic aid of an audience member
being roughed up by a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Between events, the camera would take audience members
backstage, where various bands could be seen feuding, fighting,
doing drugs, destroying dressing rooms and entertaining groupies.
This would culminate in a finale in which the headlining act went
on stage to play, only to be continually attacked by the enemy it
had been fighting with backstage.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy would come at the band, struggling to perform, with
bulldozers, bombers and armies of right-wing Congressmen.
Eventually, the enemy would be vanquished and the headlining band
would perform a few victory songs full of pyrotechnics, leaving the
audience exhilarated and the promoters millionaires.

<P>
   On the surface, board games seem intended to amuse and
entertain, but on closer look they have much in common with
military campaigns or religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Chinese legend from the Qin Dynasty, to avoid
further bloodshed, a war between an uncle and nephew was settled by
a game of weiqi, a kind of chess.
</P>
<P>
   This and many other stories are charmingly related through the
nearly 100 objects exhibited in ``Games People Play: Ancient
Pastimes of Asia'' at the E.&AMP;J. Frankel gallery in Manhattan until
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   While the games and pottery images of players on view date to
the third century B.C., the show also has a contemporary air, at
least for anyone who recalls hearing the click, click of mah-jongg
tiles. Mah-jongg, in fact, derives from the Chinese word majiang,
meaning sparrow, suggestive of the clicking or chirping sound made
by the tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The show presents a concise history of such games, their spread
from China east to Japan and west to India and Persia and later to
Europe and America. The pottery sculptures and scroll paintings
that show how these games were played in Asia, whether at imperial
courts or by scholars on retreat, also give a picture of highly
ordered societies.
</P>
<P>
   The depictions of badminton, kite flying, dragon boats, court
dances, theater and music making in paintings, sculpture and
pottery are linked by their devotion to leisure pursuits. Although
the games that were produced by the Chinese for export to the West
in the 19th century are also meticulously made and lacquered _
especially a box with nine ivory games and a majiang set in a
rosewood box _ they lack the patina of the earlier ones.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery's owners, Edith and Joel Frankel, who travel to Hong
Kong and China four times a year, began amassing material for this
show five years ago. As a result, their collection of games and
entertainments is arguably as complete as any museum exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankels' array of ancient rosewood game boards underscores
the well-established connection between games and military matters.
Boards are, for example, scored into sections, some marked with
rivers to be navigated. Likewise, pieces used in games, made of
smooth pebbles, shell, wood, bone or bamboo, are meant to represent
advancing armies making strategic territorial claims.
</P>
<P>
   In xiangqi, another chesslike game, the opposing sides are
divided between red and black pieces. To store the game pieces,
there are elegant containers like red-lacquered, melon-shaped boxes
or ceramic ware incised with twining vines.
</P>
<P>
   The objects in the show also reveal details of those who played
the games and how they were played. In a 17th-century porcelain
sculpture, two deities _ one representing longevity, the other
fortune _ play weiqi so intensely that they are oblivious to the
plight of a doomed youth standing by.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene from an 18th-century carving on a cylindrical bamboo
sachet, scholars play weiqi in a garden under a canopy of trees.
The absolute concentration seen in their faces is much like that on
the scholars in a 19th-century scroll who play in a bamboo grove as
others nearby write poetry.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the game is called go, and in a delicate 17th-century
scroll depicting ``The Tale of Genji,'' women are playing go in a
pavilion under blossoming cherry trees. This scroll is shown in
tandem with a hand-tinted photograph by Baron von Stillfried of
Japanese women playing go in the 19th century. Tradition endures,
is the message.
</P>
<P>
   While many games ape aggression, cricket fights were the real
thing. A man would carry his champion cricket around in his pocket
in a gourd with a cover decorated in ivory or tortoise shell. Some
of these gourds were etched with scenes, like one of four boys
playing in a garden, while others were grown in molds with the skin
of the gourd taking on the pattern of dragons and phoenixes.
</P>
<P>
   Special tunnel-like containers were devised for feeding;
crickets, it seems, like to eat in private. They also did not kill
each other; the winner was content to force its adversary into
submission.
</P>
<P>
   Polo and archery were other diversions that derived from
military activity. Turkish merchants in China played polo, as can
be seen in painted pottery from the Tang Dynasty in the shape of a
handsome pair of players on horseback. After polo traveled to
India, the British discovered it and made it an English sport.
</P>
<P>
   And archery, one of the gentlemanly arts, became a ritualistic
sport accompanied by special costumes and festivities. One gets a
sense of such grandeur from the stylish robe and headdress worn by
an archer made of painted pottery.
</P>
<P>
   This game, above all others, gives a view of a Chinese world in
which, as stated in the ``Analects'' of Confucius, ``even when
competing they remain gentlemen.''

<P>
   This is a crisis without a happy ending. Unless there is some
extraordinary change of heart by the Serbs _ and the violence this
past weekend makes it clear there is little chance of that _ the
Kosovo war is either going to end in a NATO bombardment or the
betrayal of the Kosovo Albanians who so credulously signed up for
``peace'' in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible that we could both bomb the Serbs and betray
the Kosovars. We could even betray our own high principles _
democracy, human rights, and so on _ if we find that the Muslims of
Kosovo insist on independence rather than autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The approach of international conflict in the Balkans has been
so slow, and so littered with the usual cliches of threat and
counter-threat, that it is difficult to realize that we are
approaching the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and Slobodan Milosevic have reached _ cliche again _
the point of no return. Serbia cannot surrender Kosovo to foreign
forces. NATO cannot back down from its obligations to the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the Kosovo delegation coldly signed away their
independence in return for limited self-government, the men and
women who had hitherto played a starring role in the drama
preferred to stay away. British foreign secretary Robin Cook was in
Bonn, as was French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright said she ``wished she could be there'' _ she
could have been, of course _ but stayed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stars suddenly wanted out of the movie. No one _ save the
luckless U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, his Austrian EU colleague and
Russian negotiator Boris Mayorski wanted to be there. And Mayorski
sullenly refused to sign the documents as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was not going to be a party to this particular surrender
of Serb sovereignty, nor lend its name to a treaty which may lead
to a NATO war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov may still warn
Milosevic of his behavior _ and condemn the slaughter of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo _ but his cancelled trip to Washington shows
that Moscow is not going to join the NATO crusade. Nor are the
Russians unaware of the divisions within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   American enthusiasm for an offensive against Serbia has scarcely
wavered during the weeks of negotiations at Rambouillet and Paris.
But Europe's threats _ symbolized by Cook's finger-wagging
diplomacy _ have grown steadily fainter as the prospect of conflict
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East invariably spread to
neighboring countries, their effect rippling like an earthquake
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Europe be any different? And this, remember, will be
a European war _ far from the United States, but well inside our
own continent.
</P>
<P>
   Once we start bombing Serbia, will Montenegro seek independence
_ and our protection _ from Belgrade? Will the Albanians of
Macedonia declare for the Albanians of Kosovo _ or, worse, a
greater Albania? Could Greece tolerate internal dissent in
Macedonia?
</P>
<P>
   Would the Bosnian Muslims _ an outside chance, this, but one
that NATO has thought about _ choose this moment to conclude
unfinished business with the Bosnian Serbs and retake the Drina
Valley?
</P>
<P>
   In London, we are backing the Americans (more or less). But the
closer they are to the Balkans, the less enthusiastic are our
European partners. Italy and Austria and Greece really do not want
a war. And who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are cracks in the Serbian edifice. Milosevic's
opponents are being quietly wooed by NATO ambassadors who know that
two of Serbia's top military strategists were fired by the Yugoslav
president earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Serb ``democrats'' fear that a war will give Milosevic the
opportunity to declare martial law, crush the remaining free press
in Belgrade, arrest dissidents and, perhaps, seize back control of
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians would then be fair game for the Yugoslav armed
forces; since the Kosovars would invariably support NATO, they
would be regarded as a fifth column, vicious traitors who must be
ruthlessly exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   As usual this past weekend, we were looking after our own,
hoping to extract the Kosovo monitors before the Serbs could take
them hostage _ while leaving the Kosovars to their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA will, for a while, abide by the treaty signed in Paris
last Thursday; they will wait for the autonomy that NATO guarantees
_ until it becomes clear that NATO will not ride to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO bombs the Serbs, will the KLA remain in their villages?
And if they do not _ and the Serbs attack the Kosovars _ will the
western armies in Macedonia help them? Alas, that is not what the
Kosovo delegation signed up for in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   So will the Kosovars themselves stay united? The Americans are
desperately worried that they will not; hence their insistence last
week that the Kosovo delegation should return to Pristina for
``necessary consultations,'' the need to remain unified and ``stay
in touch'' with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the sudden invitation to the Kosovo delegation to visit
NATO headquarters for a briefing on what they can expect _ and not
expect _ in the way of support.
</P>
<P>
   For if the Kosovo Albanians seek independence rather than
autonomy once a NATO bombardment begins, the European casus belli _
the refusal of the Serbs to abide by the Paris peace agreement
which they refused to sign _ disappears. And then the world will
ask why NATO has gone to war.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Milosevic might still, at the very last moment, give way.
But the odds are increasingly against it. Serb president Milan
Milutinovic promised in Paris last week that the Yugoslav armed
forces would fight in the event of a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Milosevic allowed the Serbs of Krajina to be driven
from their homes by the Croatians, and abandoned the Serbs of
western Bosnia. He is unlikely to bow to American pressure in order
to save Serb lives in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So what chance of a happy ending? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For musicals with big bold intentions, they certainly didn't
make much noise. The first to come and go quietly was ``Parade,''
the funereal $5.5 million Lincoln Center Theater show about the
lynching of Leo Frank. Next was ``Bright Lights Big City,'' the
$500,000 musical adaptation of the Jay McInerney novel that opened
and closed at New York Theater Workshop in what seemed like the
span of a single yawn.
</P>
<P>
   The last to depart, ``Captains Courageous,'' a $1 million
musical that opened in mid-February to the equivalent of a citywide
shrug, is to vacate the Manhattan Theater Club next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. Over the course of a few punishing winter
months, the musical hopes of three of New York's most successful
nonprofit theaters were smothered in a blizzard of
mixed-to-negative reviews. And the seeming indifference of
theater-goers didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the wounds to careers and reputations _ the productions
represented highly visible New York debuts for all the composers
and lyricists involved _ was the magnitude of the setbacks: an
entire season of ambitious new musicals at institutional theaters
wiped out in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Major nonprofit theaters usually pride themselves on producing
new work intended to extend theatrical forms, not necessarily to
extend into open-ended runs on Broadway. But let's be real: an
optimal outcome would be a blending of both. No large theater today
undertakes the costly and exhausting task of creating a new musical
without the hope of a big payoff, in terms of prestige, dollars or
both. And that is why the disappearance of three shows in the space
of five weeks amounts to a fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   That the collective impact of these works has been fairly
negligible suggests a breakdown in the machinery the institutions
have in place for the hard job of developing and nurturing new
musicals. Have these theaters lost the knack of connecting with
popular musical taste?
</P>
<P>
   All of them, after all, had been successful at that in the past.
In the late 1970s, the Manhattan Theater Club broke out with
``Ain't Misbehavin' ''; a decade later, Lincoln Center Theater
triumphed with a hugely entertaining revival of ``Anything Goes''
and showed, in the success of Michael John LaChiusa's much admired
``Hello Again'' in 1994, that it could impress with new work as
well. And then, three years ago, New York Theater Workshop jolted
the theater world with Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer Prize-winning
rock opera ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   The irregularity with which hits occur indicates how difficult
it is for any theatrical enterprise _ commercial or nonprofit _ to
make them happen. And no, as delicious as the prospect might be,
not every new musical has to rank as an unqualified delight. But
``Parade,'' ``Bright Lights Big City'' and ``Captains Courageous''
are more than routine misfires.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely because of the efforts made in each case to
develop subject matter for a constituency broader than that
represented by the theaters' subscription lists that the mistakes
loom so large. (Indeed, ``Parade'' was produced by Lincoln Center
Theater in partnership with the commercial Livent, the financially
troubled presenters of the Broadway shows ``Ragtime'' and
``Fosse.'')
</P>
<P>
   Somber, plodding and occasionally inept, the three new musicals
were peculiarly joyless experiences that left the impression that
an audience's pleasure is no longer a primary concern. This raises
the question of exactly what kind of ``serious'' musicals are being
created and whether that designation is becoming synonymous with
``inaccessible.''
</P>
<P>
   You have only to try listening to the songs that Audra McDonald
recorded recently on ``Way Back to Paradise,'' her debut album of
works by LaChiusa and other up-and-coming musical-theater composers
like Adam Guettel (``Floyd Collins'') and Jason Robert Brown
(``Parade''), to get a sense of some of the musically complex if
unmelodious directions in which these young people are taking the
form.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences desperate for someone who can write tunefully, in a
pop vernacular, must turn by default to lesser talents like Frank
Wildhorn, the composer of the current Broadway productions of
``Jekyll and Hyde,'' ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and ``The Civil
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from isolated moments in the three failed new productions
_ Brent Carver's intoxicating courtroom two-step in ``Parade'';
Annmarie Milazzo's affecting solo as a cooing mom in ``Bright
Lights Big City'' _ the shows rarely gave off illuminating sparks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they stumbled over what is one of the essentials of
musical storytelling: the ability not just to represent or
recreate, but to ignite the imagination, to heighten ordinary
experience through song.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, nonprofit theaters have had critical successes
with smaller chamber musicals; Polly Pen's ``Bed and Sofa'' at the
Vineyard Theater comes to mind. And arguably, the two most
significant new musicals of the 1990s, ``Rent'' and ``Bring In da
Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' were nonprofit babies, ``Noise/Funk''
having originated at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Other potentially interesting projects are on the way: Ricky Ian
Gordon and Tina Landau's ``Dream True'' opens next month at the
Vineyard, while a pair of musicals by LaChiusa, ``The Wild Party''
at the Public and ``Marie Christine'' at Lincoln Center Theater,
are scheduled for next season.
</P>
<P>
   But the three missed opportunities this season are
disheartening. Perhaps the saddest is ``Bright Lights Big City'' _
for which Paul Scott Goodman wrote the music, lyrics and book _
because under different circumstances it might have beat the odds.
It is also the clearest instance of a failure of leadership. As
staged by Michael Greif, who directed ``Rent'' to greater
satisfying effect, the show never seemed to stand much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop's apparent decision to evoke memories of ``Rent''
in ``Bright Lights Big City,'' whose shared characteristics with
Larson's musical should have been confined to the theater's street
address, robbed it of a distinct identity.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, a Scottish songwriter and rock performer, knows his way
around a pop tune. But in stitching together his first major
musical, he was left disastrously to his own devices.
</P>
<P>
   The most egregious example of the disservice done him was
Greif's decision to have him roam the stage as a grungy commentator
on the degradations heaped upon the musical's slick hero, played by
Patrick Wilson. This bizarre mishandling of the material almost
came across as an act of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captains Courageous'' and ``Parade'' also encountered a
variety of difficulties, but one of the most fundamental was that
of scale. With only minimal attention to some basic elements, like
choreography and comic relief that traditionally have allowed
musicals to breathe in big spaces, neither work flourished in the
lavish style in which it was staged by, respectively, Lynne Meadow
and the eminent Harold Prince, who has directed some of the most
important musicals of the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The characters and plot of ``Captains Courageous'' were
undramatic, while the relentless solemnity of ``Parade'' weighed
down the story. By the second act of the latter, when the most
absorbing relationship _ that of Leo Frank (Carver) and his wife
(Carolee Carmello) _ began to deepen, it was too late. Any concern
for them had cooled in the production's atmosphere of chilly
self-importance.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that, as seems likely with ``Bright Lights Big
City,'' the strengths that the three shows might have possessed at
an earlier point were lost in the yearslong development process?
That in raising the stakes, in packaging them as big,
Broadway-style musicals, their flaws were magnified?
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that when the scale of a show matches the scope of
its ambitions, wonderful things can happen, as evidenced by the
recent artistic success of the Music Theater Group's ``Running
Man,'' which recently ended a brief appearance at Here in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The musical-theater piece, created by the poet Cornelius Eady
and the jazz composer Diedre Murray, sparely and elegantly told a
story _ not unlike that of ``Bright Lights Big City,'' incidentally
_ of a damaged young man whose promise drowns in drug use.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, ``Running Man'' has an arresting score that
is both discordant and idiosyncratic; the audience was not likely
to leave the theater whistling a familiar tune. But with six actors
onstage for just 75 minutes, it disclosed more about the human
heart than the other three shows combined.

<P>
   This is a crisis without a happy ending. Unless there is some
extraordinary change of heart by the Serbs _ and the violence this
past weekend makes it clear there is little chance of that _ the
Kosovo war is either going to end in a NATO bombardment or the
betrayal of the Kosovo Albanians who so credulously signed up for
``peace'' in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible that we could both bomb the Serbs and betray
the Kosovars. We could even betray our own high principles _
democracy, human rights, and so on _ if we find that the Muslims of
Kosovo insist on independence rather than autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The approach of international conflict in the Balkans has been
so slow, and so littered with the usual cliches of threat and
counter-threat, that it is difficult to realize that we are
approaching the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and Slobodan Milosevic have reached _ cliche again _
the point of no return. Serbia cannot surrender Kosovo to foreign
forces. NATO cannot back down from its obligations to the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the Kosovo delegation coldly signed away their
independence in return for limited self-government, the men and
women who had hitherto played a starring role in the drama
preferred to stay away. British foreign secretary Robin Cook was in
Bonn, as was French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright said she ``wished she could be there'' _ she
could have been, of course _ but stayed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stars suddenly wanted out of the movie. No one _ save the
luckless U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, his Austrian EU colleague and
Russian negotiator Boris Mayorski wanted to be there. And Mayorski
sullenly refused to sign the documents as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was not going to be a party to this particular surrender
of Serb sovereignty, nor lend its name to a treaty which may lead
to a NATO war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov may still warn
Milosevic of his behavior _ and condemn the slaughter of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo _ but his cancelled trip to Washington shows
that Moscow is not going to join the NATO crusade. Nor are the
Russians unaware of the divisions within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   American enthusiasm for an offensive against Serbia has scarcely
wavered during the weeks of negotiations at Rambouillet and Paris.
But Europe's threats _ symbolized by Cook's finger-wagging
diplomacy _ have grown steadily fainter as the prospect of conflict
approached.
</P>
<P>
   Wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East invariably spread to
neighboring countries, their effect rippling like an earthquake
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Europe be any different? And this, remember, will be
a European war _ far from the United States, but well inside our
own continent.
</P>
<P>
   Once we start bombing Serbia, will Montenegro seek independence
_ and our protection _ from Belgrade? Will the Albanians of
Macedonia declare for the Albanians of Kosovo _ or, worse, a
greater Albania? Could Greece tolerate internal dissent in
Macedonia?
</P>
<P>
   Would the Bosnian Muslims _ an outside chance, this, but one
that NATO has thought about _ choose this moment to conclude
unfinished business with the Bosnian Serbs and retake the Drina
Valley?
</P>
<P>
   In London, we are backing the Americans (more or less). But the
closer they are to the Balkans, the less enthusiastic are our
European partners. Italy and Austria and Greece really do not want
a war. And who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are cracks in the Serbian edifice. Milosevic's
opponents are being quietly wooed by NATO ambassadors who know that
two of Serbia's top military strategists were fired by the Yugoslav
president earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Serb ``democrats'' fear that a war will give Milosevic the
opportunity to declare martial law, crush the remaining free press
in Belgrade, arrest dissidents and, perhaps, seize back control of
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians would then be fair game for the Yugoslav armed
forces; since the Kosovars would invariably support NATO, they
would be regarded as a fifth column, vicious traitors who must be
ruthlessly exterminated.
</P>
<P>
   As usual this past weekend, we were looking after our own,
hoping to extract the Kosovo monitors before the Serbs could take
them hostage _ while leaving the Kosovars to their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA will, for a while, abide by the treaty signed in Paris
last Thursday; they will wait for the autonomy that NATO guarantees
_ until it becomes clear that NATO will not ride to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO bombs the Serbs, will the KLA remain in their villages?
And if they do not _ and the Serbs attack the Kosovars _ will the
western armies in Macedonia help them? Alas, that is not what the
Kosovo delegation signed up for in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
   So will the Kosovars themselves stay united? The Americans are
desperately worried that they will not; hence their insistence last
week that the Kosovo delegation should return to Pristina for
``necessary consultations,'' the need to remain unified and ``stay
in touch'' with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the sudden invitation to the Kosovo delegation to visit
NATO headquarters for a briefing on what they can expect _ and not
expect _ in the way of support.
</P>
<P>
   For if the Kosovo Albanians seek independence rather than
autonomy once a NATO bombardment begins, the European casus belli _
the refusal of the Serbs to abide by the Paris peace agreement
which they refused to sign _ disappears. And then the world will
ask why NATO has gone to war.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Milosevic might still, at the very last moment, give way.
But the odds are increasingly against it. Serb president Milan
Milutinovic promised in Paris last week that the Yugoslav armed
forces would fight in the event of a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Milosevic allowed the Serbs of Krajina to be driven
from their homes by the Croatians, and abandoned the Serbs of
western Bosnia. He is unlikely to bow to American pressure in order
to save Serb lives in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So what chance of a happy ending? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the West prepares for war against Serbia, fears
inevitably are being voiced that the conflict will throw the entire
region into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Balkan tinderbox'' theory was frequently wheeled out by
Western politicians in the early Nineties to justify a ``hands
off'' policy towards the conflict then raging in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Balkan chaos theories have a long pedigree, dating back at the
very least to the first and second Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913,
which involved Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and
the Ottoman Empire in a series of constantly shifting, short-lived
combinations.
</P>
<P>
   General Sir Michael Rose, former commander of the U.N. troops in
Bosnia, revived the tinderbox theory Tuesday on the ``Today'' (BBC
Radio) program.
</P>
<P>
   Warning of a possible ``third Balkan war,'' he said: ``There's a
grave danger that an act of war carried out against Serbia by NATO
will spread into Bosnia and possibly into Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The general's worries about Macedonia are certainly shared by
most observers, and by many Macedonians, too. Serbia's southern
neighbor declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and is
an inherently unstable state, in spite of the presence of more than
10,000 NATO peacekeepers on its northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Macedonia closed its two border crossings with Kosovo,
while President Kiro Gligorov appealed to NATO to lend his country
extra security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of Albanian refugees into Macedonia already threatens
to destabilize the country's explosive ethnic mixture, pitting the
dominant Slavs against a large and restive Albanian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Relief organization officials said about 1,000 Kosovars crossed
the border in the last 24 hours alone.
</P>
<P>
   Albania itself is another obvious worry. Although the left-wing
government is less inclined to pander to pan-Albanian rhetoric than
its right-wing predecessor, Tirana would still find it extremely
hard to stay aloof from all-out war on the ground, especially if a
massive Serbian assault on the population threatened them with
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   Further afield, there are other potential actors in the Serbian
drama; Turkey for one, the former ruling power in the Balkans and
self-appointed protector of Balkan Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Bulgaria. Sofia has no direct interest in war with
Belgrade, other than exaggerated worries that its nuclear power
station might be hit by accident if missiles start flying around.
What it has does have is a very real stake in Macedonia, which
Bulgarian nationalists have always considered an integral part of
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Their predatory interest is shared by the Serbs, who ruled
Macedonia in the 14th century and seized it back from Turkey _ to
the fury of the Bulgarians _ in the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the collapse of Macedonia, rather than war in Serbia
and Kosovo, that is most likely to make the Balkan ``tinderbox''
theory a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Two countries in the region that are not likely to join any new
Balkan war are Romania and Greece. In Bucharest, there is a
principled opposition to the notion of outsiders interfering in a
sovereign state. But those worries are more than balanced out by a
strong commitment to joining the EU and NATO. So no opposition to
the West there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Greeks, although they provided their Orthodox
brothers with a valued diplomatic lifeline when Belgrade was at war
in Bosnia, ties have cooled since then. Greek diplomats are
dismissing the chances of Athens being involved _ or even affected
_ by air strikes on Serbia. &QL;

<P>
   Now that the presidential impeachment trial is over and its
ennobling lessons in constitutional responsibility and high-minded
judicial oratory have left an impression on our American conscience
no less indelible than a Dean Martin celebrity roast featuring
Professor Irwin Corey, many of you are no doubt wondering what will
become of your favorite media analysts.
</P>
<P>
   What will the pan-pundit class have to write about now? What
will the talking heads say? How will they eke out a living? How
feed, clothe and school the young punditae? Whither our windbag
elite now that Ms. Lewinsky has spilled the beans to Ms. Walters
and recedes hereafter into the shadows at the Fawn Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K computer-collapse panic story is no good because there
are only two possible approaches (and a like number of columns or
MSNBC appearances) in it, to wit: ``It's nothing'' or ``Hoard
ammo.'' Recent books notwithstanding, the JonBenet Ramsey case will
remain a nonstarter until they hire Batman or Angela Lansbury to
ramrod the investigation, the suggestion of which might net a few
weeks of play on ``Geraldo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloviating about the collapse of the Asian economy just isn't
very sexy, but deconstructing Hollywood's Employee of the Month
awards, the Oscars, is far too sexy and lacks the planetary,
oracular gravitas that our Sunday morning-show quarterbacks have
come to desire for themselves. Without some imaginative thinking
then, and soon, reading the bones and entrails of popular culture
is at risk of becoming real work again.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, though, for big-name pundits, their families and Ivy
League bursars throughout the Northeast, an answer has been found.
Weirdly, it may have been stumbled upon by the Rev. Jerry Falwell
in his announcement identifying the current earthly incarnation of
Beelzebub, the gist of which (and I may have this wrong) was
something like ``And I looked and behold, a pale Teletubby and his
name was Tinky-Winky and hell followed with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus arrives 1999's red-hot growth sector for media analysis:
apocalypse theory.
</P>
<P>
   Millenarianism is the belief in a battle between good and evil
at the end of the millennium that lays waste to the earth and is
then followed by a thousand years of peace and human perfection.
(Mill(italics)i(end italics)nerianism, on the other hand, is the
belief in, um, hats.) What better way for the pop-cult eggheads and
satraps to earn their living than by pointing out for us the early
warning signs of the death of civilization?
</P>
<P>
   One such harbinger, the seemingly inexplicable resurgence of
professional wrestling, is already being written about and spoken
of by those on the critical edge of the crackpot apocalypse.
Wrestlemania, apparently, is the end of the world as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   In our Age of Incivility, it should come as only a small
surprise that professional wrestling is now the hippest ticket in
town and a regular ratings juggernaut on cable television.
Consistently landing up to 7 of the top 10 spots in the weekly
cable rankings, wrestling is lately attracting the attention of
publications as diverse as The Washington Post, Variety, USA Today,
New York magazine and The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, from Washington's Beltway to the Hollywood
geltway, the lurid billion-dollar-a-year burlesque of professional
wrestling has been startling and saddening our social critics and
business writers with the news that bad taste sells.
</P>
<P>
   Professional wrestling has been a television staple since the
late 1940s. Largely ignored by television critics since then for
being too dopey or downmarket to bother reviewing, it has always
enjoyed a small but devoted following. In decaying war memorial
arenas and on regional one-hour Saturday broadcasts, wrestling was
for decades a blandly predictable battle between good (light
trunks, waxed chest) and evil (black trunks, hairy back).
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as it was both fixed and fake in a nation where one or
the other usually suffices, it had little going for it as a sport.
As entertainment it suffered from a lack of dramatic ingenuity,
relying instead on simple declamation, e.g.:
</P>
<P>
   ANNOUNCER: How about it, Vern?
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLER: I promise to (italics)crush(end italics) the evil
Baron Von Raschke this Saturday for the North American Champion's
belt at the Prom Ballroom! Grrrrrr! 4 P.M.! Grrrrrr! All seats $5!
Grrrrrr!
</P>
<P>
   ANNOUNCER: There you have it, folks!
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLER: Free parking before 3 P.M.! Grrrrrr!
</P>
<P>
   ANNOUNCER: Wow!
</P>
<P>
   The bouts themselves were just as prosaic. Stout older men
grimly banging bellies and throwing punches until the good guy
triumphed and evil sagged to the canvas exhausted. It was like
watching a fight between two beer-truck drivers after a traffic
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Variations on this basic design (four-man tag team, six-man tag
team, women, midgets, etc.) had no effect on the moral
choreography. Good guys usually won and the bad guys glowered and
vowed revenge.

   So things remained until the mid-1980s, when the first
post-modern boomlet occurred in wrestling. Most of the regional
wrestling operations were consolidated into a national tour. Local
broadcasts gave way to national syndication and several small
crossover stars were born (Hulk Hogan, Jesse Ventura, Andre the
Giant).
</P>
<P>
   No longer a mom-and-pop enterprise, it was still limited to a
tiny, almost entirely male audience. The escalation in allowable
violence in all forms of entertainment meant a proportional
increase in graphic forms of hand-to-hand mayhem in the ring, and
the matches themselves became marginally more energetic and a good
deal bloodier as a result. Singlets and nicknames became more
colorful, but the scripted outbursts remained a careful study in
black-and-white.

   WRESTLER: And you kids be sure to drink your milk! Grrrrrr!
</P>
<P>
   ANNOUNCER: Wow!
</P>
<P>
   The simple binary determinism of wrestling remained the same,
and the good guy mostly won.
</P>
<P>
   As we enter professional wrestling's late-century renaissance,
though, everything has changed. Forget good guys; as in real life,
there are none. Now there are only characters portraying various
degrees of stylish, programmatic badness along a continuum that
runs from costumed sociopath to attractively rebellious antihero.
</P>
<P>
   ANNOUNCER: How about it, Steve?
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLER: Bite me.
</P>
<P>
   ANNOUNCER: Wow!
</P>
<P>
   There are five hours of this stuff on prime-time cable on Monday
nights alone. In certain demographics (males 12 to 34, for
example), wrestling even outstripped Monday Night Football last
fall. Wrestlers routinely gab with Jay Leno or horse around with
Regis and Kathie Lee.
</P>
<P>
   April's Playboy cover bunny is a television wrestler. As you
know, a wrestler was just elected governor of Minnesota (although
I'm not sure this is part of the same trend; Minnesota has been
working its way through some community self-esteem issues ever
since the opening of ``Fargo'').
</P>
<P>
   Most telling, perhaps, is this: By the end of 1999, professional
wrestling will have begun opening its own theme restaurants. Dire
portents all, but what do they mean? How did this happen? Who do we
blame? Or, as the pundits will ask, What does this Say About Us as
a Nation?
</P>
<P>
   By shrewdly combining elements present in the most successful
contemporary American entertainments, to wit, sex, violence and a
murderous disregard for authority, professional wrestling at the
millennium has reinvented itself as a kind of antiheroic
speed-metal cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Cruel and slap-happy as a Punch and Judy puppet show, it manages
at once to synthesize every theatrical tradition from Kabuki to
vaudeville. As predictable as a passion play (every match a
simulacrum of ``suffering'' leading to ``death,'' followed quickly
by ``resurrection''), it plays on our universal need for ritualized
catharsis; the human impulse that creates narratives as disparate
as Jerry Springer, manga Japanese comic books and ancient Norse
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing all borders of taste and tradition, like Schwarzenegger
or Van Damme, American professional wrestling is now beamed to more
than a hundred other countries.
</P>
<P>
   There are two organizations driving and benefiting from this
lucrative modernization of the old form: World Championship
Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation. The former is a Ted
Turner property and appears variously (it seems endlessly) on the
cable networks TBS or TNT. The latter, and lately the more watched
of the two, is shown on Barry Diller's USA Network and in
syndication. Both entities also produce expensive pay-per-view
versions of themselves at least once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the WWF is raunchier than the WCW, accounting for its
slight edge in popularity, they appear perfectly interchangeable to
the unschooled viewer. Like touring rock acts or tent revivals,
both emanate live from different arenas every night. The opening
moments include a pyrotechnic display, close-ups of scantily clad
young women (either dancing or just standing around breathing
deeply) and a long-winded recapitulation of action you may have
missed the night before in Buffalo or last week when the show was
in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   These genially moronic synopses (``He may have sustained that
groan injury at Superbrawl, but I'm sure he'll be fighting tonight
with real reckless abandonment!'') are important to the
architecture of each show, however, because they outline the
grudges, blood feuds and byzantine subplots that now lie at the
heart of professional wrestling. Hot pants, hair extensions and
tasers aside, what makes wrestling work in a way it never has
before is (italics)story.(end italics)

 UNDATED: is (italics)story.(end italics)  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Complicated as a Shakespearean comedy and as absurd as anything
by Ionesco, the drama outside the ring is what's driving the new
age in wrestling. The bouts themselves remain strangely lifeless
affairs; so much so that the commercial breaks come (italics)during
the fights(end italics) so as not to interrupt the progress of the
several twining story lines that occur every week. (Paradoxically,
the presence of close-up, hand-held cameras on the ring apron and
on the arena floor reveals wrestling's physical fakery more
completely than ever before, further evidence that it depends, like
the movies, on a viewer's willing suspension of disbelief to
succeed.)
</P>
<P>
   Power, lust and greed are the staples of these weekly steroid
serials. Locker room story lines in recent weeks have included the
betrayal of a powerful father by his own son at the instruction of
a beautiful, mysterious woman; the abduction of a beautiful woman
by an evil man hungry for her attentions; the theft of a soul by
the Lord of Darkness. This isn't wrestling; it's the Metropolitan
Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows have remarkably large casts of remarkably large
performers (like ripe olives, the smallest size of wrestler seems
to be ``jumbo''), all of whom glide in and out of various factions
and splinter groups that add further complication to the dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   The NWO, or New World Order, for example, is a clique within the
WCW made up of even badder bad guys than the normal bad guys. In
the WWF, there's the Ministry of Darkness, a cult of
Satan-worshiping heavyweights who all look like dress extras from
an underfinanced production of ``Rocky Horror Picture Show.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the performers still rely on masks or costumes or
bizarre behavior to define their characters, the two biggest
breakout stars of the last year are also the simplest in their
presentation: Goldberg of the WCW and Stone Cold Steve Austin of
the WWF. Uncannily similar in appearance (goatee, shaved head,
black trunks, neck like a draft horse), each is a natural-born
action figure. Good guys by default, they are the closest things to
heroes offered by either league.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, both leagues utilize a story line wherein the
boss is the most loathed presence in the building. Vince McMahon,
head of the WWF, is one of his own most valuable characters. He is
roundly booed whenever he appears and has actually fought against
his own wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   In real life he is regarded as the P.T. Barnum of pro wrestling.
It was he who consolidated the smaller regional leagues, turned the
heat way up on sex and bad language and then marketed the product
hard to its most gullible potential audience (television
executives). If there is someone to blame for the resurrection of
professional wrestling, it's probably McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is what the pundits and critics are looking
for. Most of the coverage of the wrestling phenomenon coos and
burbles over its financial successes but then clucks its tongue at
the very nature of the product. USA Today is so worried about your
children that it printed a handy table enumerating the 1,658
instances of ``grabbing/pointing to one's crotch'' in 50 WWF
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering whether children will emulate this behavior seems a
little disingenuous at this late date. Of course they will, just as
they did with the Power Rangers and the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja
Turtles and Davy Crockett. Expect several stories in the next year
from the playgrounds of America delineating the rash of injuries
that result from pee-wee atomic drops and flyweight suplexes
inexpertly applied.
</P>
<P>
   Professional wrestling is simply the latest incarnation of our
collective historical appetite for bad entertainment. From the low
comedy of the Greeks to commedia dell'arte to the midway sideshow,
lowest-common-denominator theater has always attracted the largest,
most impressionable audiences.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point, after all, isn't it? ``But who's to blame?''
whine the pundits, for a world full of bad taste and tight clothes,
vulgar language, violence, impure thoughts and shoddy goods? We
are.
</P>
<P>
   And What That Says About Us as a Nation? A public? A television
audience? We are an idiot. The apocalypse (italics)will(end
italics) be televised.

 Ted Loos' most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about the
filmmaker Myles Berkowitz of ``20 Dates.''  
 By TED LOOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERPOOL, N.Y. _ The phrase ``film festival'' conjures
glamorous images: the beaches of Cannes, the slopes of Park City,
Utah, and a crush of photographers aiming at the latest starlet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Cinefest, which prides itself on offering lots of
films and not much festival. Held at a standard-issue Holiday Inn
here off Interstate 81, just northwest of Syracuse, Cinefest has
quietly developed a reputation as the un-Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   For four days, several hundred people gather to sit on banquet
chairs in the hotel ballroom and watch movies that run from 9 a.m.
until well past midnight. The films being screened are not orphans
in search of a distributor or indies hoping to generate buzz, but
rather spirits from the past: rarely seen movies from the silent
and early talkie era.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-frills festival,'' said Leonard Maltin, a film
historian and journalist. ``No one comes here to be seen. This
doesn't score points with anyone. You come here because you love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19th annual Cinefest, held three weeks ago amid intermittent
blizzards, featured its usual eclectic selection of oddities and
rarities. There was a Deanna Durbin musical, ``Spring Parade''
(1940), which hadn't been seen since 1946, when it was shelved by a
legal battle over authors' rights.
</P>
<P>
   There were a series of wise-cracking, tightly structured comic
mysteries that had a large audience roaring for the first time
since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thing is the rarest of the rare,'' said Phil Serling, a
decidedly down-to-earth man, who runs Cinefest with a group of 20
friends known as the Syracuse Cinephile Society. ``The reason
people come to Syracuse is that they know they're not going to get
`Casablanca' or `The Wizard of Oz.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though several films receive brief introductions, there are no
seminars, no panel discussions, no banquets and no parties at
Cinefest. ``I've had big stars call up and say they wanted to come,
but I always say no,'' said Serling, who is too discreet to name
names. ``There are plenty of other events that would love to have
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who work in the movie business and make the festival
rounds, this event is a welcome anomaly. ``It doesn't have anything
to do with other festivals,'' said Emily Russo, the co-president of
Zeitgeist Films, an independent distributor. ``It's pure cinema
pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``If you love movies, how could you not love these
movies?'' she asked. ``It's where everything came from. You see the
seeds of everything we know about film.''
</P>
<P>
   For a $50 registration fee, participants get more than 45 films
spread over four days, and many people try to see every single one.
Free popcorn fuels the bleary-eyed, though some resort to more
extreme measures. ``The key is to bring smelling salts,'' said
Robert Woodward, a diehard from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Cinefest started in 1980 when Serling and his friends, who had
been involved with other revival festivals, decided to show movies
their way. They rented a few rooms in a local hotel, and everyone
brought a movie from their personal collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next year I started getting calls,'' said Serling.
``People said: `What are you guys doing up there? Why wasn't I
invited?'''
</P>
<P>
   The event is still run by the same close-knit group of
volunteers. Andy Eggers mans the 16-mm projector at the Holiday Inn
for every film, as he had done since the beginning, while his wife,
Lois, runs the registration desk. Eggers, whose regular job is
projectionist at the local Imax theater, says that he has
personally shown about 52 ``onlys,'' the single surviving print of
a film.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though the festival has grown, the organizers still don't
publicize it. Word-of-mouth is enough to sell out most of the
Holiday Inn's 280 rooms to guests from all over the United States
and even a few from abroad. About 900 people bought day passes to
attend at least part of this year's festival.
</P>
<P>
   Cinefest's seriousness of purpose attracts film archivists,
writers and historians _ almost anyone with a passion for the
cinematically arcane: audience members laugh heartily at period
jokes and gently correct each other on the career paths of
long-dead character actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more accumulated knowledge about film in this room
than in the rest of the world combined,'' said Maltin, who was
attending his 17th Cinefest. ``That's really no exaggeration.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are regulars, creating the atmosphere of a college
reunion. ``There's a Brigadoon-like quality to this event,'' said
Robert Miller, a professor of film at Northern Illinois University
in DeKalb, Ill. ``You pick up conversations from the previous year
and then continue them a year later.''
</P>
<P>
   That mythical quality is heightened when festival guests are
herded onto yellow school buses and driven to the landmark Loews
State Theater in downtown Syracuse. The 3,000-seat movie palace, an
Orientalist fantasy built in 1928, is host to Cinefest's 35-mm
program each year. This year the British Film Institute sent a
series of recently restored gems from its archive.
</P>
<P>
   Two formerly lost Lon Chaney silents, ``Alas and Alack'' (1915)
and ``Dolly's Scoop'' (1916), survive only on the prints shown
here. ``Madame Pompadour'' (1928), a silent starring Dorothy Gish
that was the most expensive British film ever made at the time,
probably had not been seen since its original release.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain these hard-to-find films, Serling relies on archives
like the George Eastman House in nearby Rochester, as well as
private collectors. One anonymous collector _ no one at the
festival has ever met him or knows his name _ lends one film each
year through a third party. This year's contribution was the only
known print of ``Young as You Feel'' (1931), starring Will Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Even professionals discover films that they didn't know existed.
``It's a busman's holiday for me,'' said Patrick Loughney, head of
the Moving Image Section at the Library of Congress, which holds
250,000 films and the same number of television shows. ``It's a
good chance to meet collectors and see what's out there. So much of
film history has been preserved by private collectors and not by
the studios.''
</P>
<P>
   While Loughney comes partly for the fun of it, he also hopes to
secure donations of films to the Library of Congress. ``We're
living in the archeological era of cinema,'' Loughney said, since
many early films were lost or destroyed. ``Much of what we'll know
about film has yet to be discovered, especially about the silent
era.''
</P>
<P>
   Serling spends all year rounding up these relics so they can
come to life once more. Each silent film at Cinefest was
accompanied by a pianist who improvises scores to movies people had
never seen before and will probably never see again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can preserve films from now until Doomsday,'' said
Serling. ``But they've got to be shown, and they've got to be
talked about.''

NEW INSIGHTS FOR A DISTINCTIVE MODERNIST VISION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rehash or celebration? As a work in progress, the New York City
Ballet's 50th anniversary year looks like both. The celebration is,
in effect, a retrospective: Now halfway through the 100 ballets it
plans to present through June, the company leaned toward the
familiar in its recent winter season. Yet the packaging was often
different, and new contexts made for new insights.
</P>
<P>
   The festive colors were waved early in this first of two
anniversary segments. There was a spectacular party for 50 years'
worth of company alumni, most of whom turned up two days later for
a mammoth curtain call at the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a strange parade of guest conductors auditioning
in public for a City Ballet job, or at least offering welcome gusto
in the pit.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the winter season was business as usual. This meant that
the dancing was glorious and that fresh talent continued to come
forward. (The young Adam Hendrickson, exciting in his tensile
energy, was this season's revelation.) Just as clearly, there was
none of the daring of the 1993 Balanchine celebration, which
attempted to revive works no longer danced at the City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the ballets were the same we have seen for
years, with a few exceptions. Jacques d'Amboise's 1964 ``Irish
Fantasy,'' which had been out of the repertory since 1982, returned
as a solid and sprightly neo-Balanchinian exercise. ``Les
Gentilhommes,'' Peter Martins' 1987 tribute to male classical
dancing, was better performed in the past. By contrast, his
``Beethoven Romance,''from 1989, preserved its romantic perfume.
</P>
<P>
   The major works presented, however, were not revivals but the
ballets by Balanchine and Jerome Robbins that are the company's
soul. As artistic director, Martins had to make the season special,
and the surprise is the success of his old-wine-in-new-bottles
approach. Theme programs, including tributes to composers,
abounded. Unexpectedly these marketing gimmicks provided fresh
esthetic insight.
</P>
<P>
   There were Russian, English, French, Austrian, German, Italian
and Polish ``tributes'' with a relevant diplomat on hand to
introduce ballets whose composers came from his country. Sometimes
the composers themselves were given a tribute, as in the all-Ravel
and all-Brahms evenings.
</P>
<P>
   One could see and hear differently and make connections when
ballets, usually spread out over seasons, were clustered together.
Martins' most brilliant packaging was in the weeklong ``Balanchine
Black and White Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   To take in this highly concentrated dose of Balanchine's
avant-garde ``leotard'' ballets, danced mostly to 20th-century
music, was to experience the City Ballet at its essence: a
modernist company, unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one premiere, Martins' ``Walton Cello Concerto,''
whose abstracted love triangle was fervently embodied by Damian
Woetzel, Miranda Weese and Alexandra Ansanelli. The choice of
William Walton's music came out of the woodwork, but the ballet was
superbly polished, deftly chiseled.

AFTER THE AVALANCHES, EUROPE SKIS IN TO SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For releae Sunday, March 28)  
 (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ Both skiers and ski resort operators in the Alps live
for snow, but some of the heaviest snowfalls this century turned
deadly this winter, setting off a series of avalanches in February.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all but the hardest-hit resort, in Galtuer, Austria, where
32 ski vacationers and 6 villagers died in a devastating slide Feb.
23, fear of more tragedies has gradually receded as warmer weather
has packed down the snow.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the higher resorts in France, Switzerland, Italy and Austria,
tourism officials expect the slopes to remain open through the end
of April, even into May in some cases, with some of the best
late-season skiing in years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In German-speaking Switzerland, skiers in Davos, Klosters and
St. Moritz are going back home with reports of excellent conditions
that are expected to last. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a good amount of snow this winter, not a record
amount, and the season will continue through to April 25,'' said
Hubert Schwarzler, a hotel owner and tourism official in the
Vorarlberg resort of Lech in western Austria, a couple of mountain
ridges away from Galtuer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lech, nearby Zuers and St. Anton were all cut off for nearly two
weeks by the heavy February snowfall when authorities closed roads
and even the rail line from Zurich to Innsbruck because of the
danger of avalanches. ``From the end of February until March 6,
hotels in Lech were only about half full, because people were
afraid and canceled their reservations,'' Schwarzler said, ``but by
mid-March we were back up to about 95 percent capacity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case in Galtuer. ``March is usually the best
month of the year, but hardly anybody came this year after the
avalanche,'' said Walter Gerhard, tourism spokesman for the
village. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, where an avalanche Feb. 21 in the village of
Evolene in the French-speaking Valais region killed seven people,
was also hard hit. ``The fear didn't go away,'' said one tour
operator in the Valais region. Hundreds of thousands of people were
stuck in Swiss ski resorts for days when roads were closed because
of the danger of avalanches. Others couldn't get in to occupy the
rooms they had reserved, or changed their minds about coming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the Valais spent generously on publicity trying
to reassure skiers that the slopes were as safe as ever. That never
means 100 percent safe in any ski resort, and avalanches in the
Alps remain possible as the weather warms up, authorities warn,
particularly if skiers disregard warnings and wander off piste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three skiers who did that in Val di Roia in the Alto Adige
region of the Italian Dolomites on March 11 died in an avalanche
they set off themselves, according to tourism officials there.
Another avalanche, in Morgex, in northern Italy, on Feb. 23 killed
a 52-year-old village woman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The French Alps were also struck by an avalanche at Montroc,
near Chamonix on the slopes of Mont-Blanc, that took 12 lives on
Feb. 9. For three weeks after that, Montroc was practically
deserted, according to officials in that hamlet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When French school vacations started later in February few
people canceled their reservations in Chamonix, according to
Delphine Rey, a village tourism official who said hotels reported
less than 3 percent cancellations for the month as a whole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chamonix Web site (www.chamonix.com) was reporting more than
10 feet of snow on higher slopes and nearly 3 feet even in the
village in mid-March. Similar conditions at Courchevel lured Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin there for a ski weekend with his wife just
before St. Patrick's Day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Estelle Jouand, a tourism official for the Savoie region,
said that resorts there were at only three-quarters capacity in the
last week of February, when avalanches were big news in Switzerland
and Austria. Normally at that time, she said, 85 to 90 percent of
the 423,500 hotel beds in Savoie would be occupied. Lingering fears
about avalanches in the Alps, she added, could have an adverse
effect on next ski season, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Di Giandomenico, the head of the tourist board in
Abruzzo, said that the immediate effect of the avalanches in Italy
was a short-lived, slight dip in hotel bookings. But the tourist
flow quickly returned to normal, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heavy snow cover in many resorts bears watching in the warm
weather, however, and when the thaw really gets started, serious
flooding is expected in Alpine valleys and major waterways like the
Rhine that have been running high since February.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Slobodan Milosevic has turned into a great dictator
with all the trademarks of one: madness, cruelty and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   He began his rise to power by exploiting Serbia's sentiments
about the sanctity of Kosovo and made a stepping stone of personal
ambition and dreams of territorial aggrandisement.
</P>
<P>
   When he ended Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, the Soviet Union was
still in existence and the shrill ravings of a Yugoslav nationalist
seemed to all but the most prescient an insubstantial threat.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the violence began in earnest in Croatia in 1991,
there was something faintly absurd about Serbia's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Early that year, I attended a dinner in Belgrade given by the
government. Milosevic looked and talked like a textbook Eastern
European Marxist-Leninist lecturer _ socially insecure, ham-fisted
but stubbornly bullish about his beliefs under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When he tired of too much preprandial questioning about his
intentions, he announced sharply: ``Let's attack the soup.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember that this hawkishness, applied to the dinner, seemed
rather comical. Not so funny now, after Vukovar, Srebrenica and
Racak.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has outlasted Mikhail Gorbachev, George Bush, Margaret
Thatcher, Helmut Kohl and John Major. The endgame falls to Bill
Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   When people complain that the aim of the NATO mission against
Serbia is unclear, they are wrong. There is one clear goal, without
which peace is impossible: to create a situation in which Milosevic
falls from power and the distorted, rapacious Serbia he has created
is humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Milosevic rouses himself from the nightmare of his own
making in the next few days, this is the course on which NATO will
embark: the most serious engagement in Europe since the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   There is no institutional or legal case for military action
against a sovereign power that has committed atrocities on its own
territory. We must rely on the more subjective assessments of
realpolitik and on the ethical imperative for reasons to act.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday in his Commons statement, Tony Blair entwined the two in
a proposition that can be summarized as: ``Not acting is more
dangerous than acting; and, anyway, it is right to intervene
because of the suffering imposed by Milosevic on Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sound. But the mission is going to be a long and bloody
affair, its price and its outcome uncertain. The prime minister
will need to work harder in the weeks and months ahead to convince
people that Britain's involvement is justified.
</P>
<P>
   When he contemplated the post of prime minister, it is unlikely
that the consensual Blair imagined himself as a war leader. But
high office is unpredictable and this is what he may well be called
upon to become.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's role in Kosovo will be an even more difficult war to sell
than the last Gulf skirmish _ and that was far from being Blair's
most convincing piece of salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing the Serbs on behalf of Kosovo is as near as damn it to a
recognition of Kosovan independence.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be that in order to seal the strategic gains of a
bombing campaign, we will have to commit troops onto this territory
against the will of Milosevic _ indeed this is the outcome he
dreads, because it guarantees his disgrace and downfall. But its
political and human cost would be high.
</P>
<P>
   Given his strong commitment to European institutions, Blair was
a surprisingly reticent European when it came to laying out the
single binding reason why we are obliged to take in the risks of a
long conflict in Kosovo: it is a part of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to Western intervention is to accept that the
Western ideals of basic human rights and freedom from persecution
by the state do not apply to Yugoslavia. I do not believe that
Europe should tolerate such ethical exclusion zones.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite argument of opponents of bombing is that since the
West is neither able nor willing to use force to tackle injustice
everywhere in the world, it should not do so in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe is the point: the Continent's future is our future.
If we are not to fight a brutal aggressor after a delay similar to
that which allowed the carnage of Bosnia, where would we fight?
</P>
<P>
   One of the baleful consequences of the dominance of the single
currency in Western Europe's priorities has been the downgrading of
a wider sense of what it means to be a European, as bestowing some
basic values and duties of care for one another.
</P>
<P>
   Into this vacuum floods the kind of petty selfishness manifested
by the renowned Second World War historian Correlli Barnett in a
baffling and perverse newspaper article in which he compared the
prospect of NATO ground troops in Kosovo with an ``army of
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically , this may be a correct description. But Kosovo is
not the Sudetenland. The overwhelmingly Albanian population sees
NATO as a redeemer, not an invader.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett then worries about the risk of Kosovo distracting our
armed forces from some other pressing threat to British interests.
But what interest can be more pressing than peace in Europe?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the global-reach doctrine of our armed forces has
outlived its usefulness. Forging and maintaining the peace in
Europe and on its borders will be task enough for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a ``far-off corner of the Balkans'' in
a Europe that has a new NATO member in Hungary, bordering on Serbia
and in which refugees spill across open borders. The Iron Curtain
is no longer there to shield us from unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett and the rest of the new British isolationists might like
to cut Britain off from the security interests of Europe. But it is
neither possible nor desirable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a creeping ``I'm all right Jack''-ism is shared by
the sections of the left and right. They are intent on forming a
coalition of apathy and will fight for nothing and no one beyond
their own garden fence.
</P>
<P>
   It is to these latter-day appeasers that Prime Minister Tony
Blair needs to address himself more forcefully if he is to become a
great statesman, as well as great politician. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Kosovo was where the 20th century's final cycle of
Balkan wars began. Now Kosovo is where they will end; not with a
peace agreement but, surely now, with the first attack by NATO in
its 50-year history on a sovereign state _ and, if the worst comes
to the very worst, with the first major European land war since
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, as Serb forces continued to sack Albanian
villages, the final realistic chance of averting allied airstrikes
against Yugoslav targets vanished as first President Slobodan
Milosevic, and then the Serbian parliament which he controls,
rejected demands for a cease-fire and the deployment of a NATO-led
international peacekeeping force in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   In dramatic further confirmation that war may be at hand,
Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, dramatically
cancelled a visit to the U.S. which was due to start Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught, which the White House said would be ``swift and
substantial,'' could be unleashed as soon as early today
(Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   In a grim interview as he left Belgrade for Brussels to report
back to NATO, the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made no bones of the
failure of his last-ditch mission. The circumstances, he declared,
were ``the bleakest'' he had known in his experience of negotiating
in the Balkans..
</P>
<P>
   That experience began in 1995, when Holbrooke took the Bosnia
crisis in hand, browbeat Milosevic and the other protagonists to
the conference table in Dayton, Ohio, and secured a peace which has
turned Bosnia into a virtual NATO protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   Alas Kosovo was omitted then. Four years later it has turned
into perhaps the gravest Balkan conflict of all.
</P>
<P>
   His talks had been a ``watershed moment,'' after nearly a year
of unavailing Western efforts to broker a settlement between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, culminating in proposals put to last month's
Rambouillet conference which Belgrade refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president didn't want even to discuss either the
cease-fire or the foreign peacekeeping force, and ``fully
understood'' the consequences of that refusal, Holbrooke added. In
other words, the time for talking has run out.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was the unvarnished message from Western capitals. In
the House of Commons the British prime minister, Tony Blair, warned
that 65,000 more Kosovars had been driven from their homes by the
latest Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The West had made a solemn promise to the ethnic Albanians, and
would not permit a new humanitarian disaster in Kosovo. Nor would
it tolerate further repression by Belgrade that would probably drag
Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia _ and perhaps Greece and Turkey too _
into ``disintegration, chaos and disorder on the doorstep of the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the prime minister even more plainly donned the mantle of
commander-in-chief, addressing ``those British pilots who may be
called into action, their families...all those people who are part
of the armed forces... I would not ask them to undertake this if I
did not believe it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the mood was equally somber as Congressional
leaders of both parties rallied behind President Bill Clinton's
call for support for military action.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the well-aired misgivings of some senior U.S.
politicians, the sense was that airstrikes were all but inevitable
_ that even the master of brinkmanship Milosevic had finally passed
the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground as well all seemed set for war. As Yugoslav and
Serb forces continued the offensive of recent days in the Drenica
valley north of Kosovo _ a strategy which had prompted some
speculation the Yugoslav president was staking out the ground for a
partition of the province _ an ominous calm descended on the
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   After a spate of bombings, Serb police rampages, and tit-for-tat
killings in the last few days, the city was deathly quiet. The main
market and schools were shut, and the traffic was a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Tightening the vice, the Yugoslav authorities also closed the
southern border, thus preventing Albanians fleeing to safety in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The real question Tuesday night was when the air attacks might
start. Faced with the fresh tide of refugees and Milosevic's almost
mocking intransigence, earlier waverers in the alliance like Italy,
Germany and Greece seem to have thrown their weight, however
reluctantly, behind airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is now united and prepared to carry out its warning,''
President Clinton said. ``If President Milosevic is not willing to
make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat has been heard a dozen times; this time however it
rang true _ perhaps explaining why the Yugoslav leader Tuesday
sacked his army's security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts saw the step as continuation of a purge of senior
officers opposed to a confrontation with the West which could cost
the country much precious military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the main political factor staying NATO's hand
disappeared when Primakov, leader of the country which is
Belgrade's staunchest ally and categorically opposed to NATO
airstrikes, called off his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To have launched them at the very moment Primakov was in the
Oval Office would have been an insult which even the present
wretched state of America's relations with its former superpower
rival would hardly justify.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, however, military preparations are virtually
complete. The hope now is that one crushing blow against key
military installations _ starting probably with Cruise missile
attacks against air defense and communications sites _ will suffice
to convince President Milosevic to change his mind and accept the
international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If not, matters could quickly escalate, even to the point where
a NATO ground invasion _ something the allies have vowed they will
never do _ was the only option left.
</P>
<P>
   That is a nightmare scenario which no NATO leader has yet
publicly confronted, but was implicit in the warning of one NATO
defense minister visiting London Tuesday, ``Kosovo is not Bosnia.
It needs a political solution; a military solution does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, that solution will be up to Milosevic. In 1987,
as an ambitious younger member of the Serbian Communist party's
central committee, he went to Kosovo, the spiritual cradle of
Serbia, and made the speech that launched today's Serbian
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he stripped Kosovo, and the 90 percent ethnic
Albanian majority of its population, of its autonomy _ the autonomy
he refuses to return today.
</P>
<P>
   By then Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia had read the Serb writing
on the wall, and, in wars greater and smaller, left Yugoslavia. But
Kosovo, where it all started, remained a tightly controlled part of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the last Balkan war, Serbia may lose even its heart. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Kosovo was where the 20th century's final cycle of
Balkan wars began. Now Kosovo is where they will end; not with a
peace agreement but, surely now, with the first attack by NATO in
its 50-year history on a sovereign state _ and, if the worst comes
to the very worst, with the first major European land war since
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, as Serb forces continued to sack Albanian
villages, the final realistic chance of averting allied airstrikes
against Yugoslav targets vanished as first President Slobodan
Milosevic, and then the Serbian parliament which he controls,
rejected demands for a cease-fire and the deployment of a NATO-led
international peacekeeping force in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   In dramatic further confirmation that war may be at hand,
Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, dramatically
cancelled a visit to the U.S. which was due to start Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught, which the White House said would be ``swift and
substantial,'' could be unleashed as soon as early today
(Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   In a grim interview as he left Belgrade for Brussels to report
back to NATO, the U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made no bones of the
failure of his last-ditch mission. The circumstances, he declared,
were ``the bleakest'' he had known in his experience of negotiating
in the Balkans..
</P>
<P>
   That experience began in 1995, when Holbrooke took the Bosnia
crisis in hand, browbeat Milosevic and the other protagonists to
the conference table in Dayton, Ohio, and secured a peace which has
turned Bosnia into a virtual NATO protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   Alas Kosovo was omitted then. Four years later it has turned
into perhaps the gravest Balkan conflict of all.
</P>
<P>
   His talks had been a ``watershed moment,'' after nearly a year
of unavailing Western efforts to broker a settlement between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, culminating in proposals put to last month's
Rambouillet conference which Belgrade refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president didn't want even to discuss either the
cease-fire or the foreign peacekeeping force, and ``fully
understood'' the consequences of that refusal, Holbrooke added. In
other words, the time for talking has run out.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was the unvarnished message from Western capitals. In
the House of Commons the British prime minister, Tony Blair, warned
that 65,000 more Kosovars had been driven from their homes by the
latest Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The West had made a solemn promise to the ethnic Albanians, and
would not permit a new humanitarian disaster in Kosovo. Nor would
it tolerate further repression by Belgrade that would probably drag
Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia _ and perhaps Greece and Turkey too _
into ``disintegration, chaos and disorder on the doorstep of the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the prime minister even more plainly donned the mantle of
commander-in-chief, addressing ``those British pilots who may be
called into action, their families...all those people who are part
of the armed forces... I would not ask them to undertake this if I
did not believe it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the mood was equally somber as Congressional
leaders of both parties rallied behind President Bill Clinton's
call for support for military action.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the well-aired misgivings of some senior U.S.
politicians, the sense was that airstrikes were all but inevitable
_ that even the master of brinkmanship Milosevic had finally passed
the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground as well all seemed set for war. As Yugoslav and
Serb forces continued the offensive of recent days in the Drenica
valley north of Kosovo _ a strategy which had prompted some
speculation the Yugoslav president was staking out the ground for a
partition of the province _ an ominous calm descended on the
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   After a spate of bombings, Serb police rampages, and tit-for-tat
killings in the last few days, the city was deathly quiet. The main
market and schools were shut, and the traffic was a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Tightening the vice, the Yugoslav authorities also closed the
southern border, thus preventing Albanians fleeing to safety in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The real question Tuesday night was when the air attacks might
start. Faced with the fresh tide of refugees and Milosevic's almost
mocking intransigence, earlier waverers in the alliance like Italy,
Germany and Greece seem to have thrown their weight, however
reluctantly, behind airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is now united and prepared to carry out its warning,''
President Clinton said. ``If President Milosevic is not willing to
make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat has been heard a dozen times; this time however it
rang true _ perhaps explaining why the Yugoslav leader Tuesday
sacked his army's security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts saw the step as continuation of a purge of senior
officers opposed to a confrontation with the West which could cost
the country much precious military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the main political factor staying NATO's hand
disappeared when Primakov, leader of the country which is
Belgrade's staunchest ally and categorically opposed to NATO
airstrikes, called off his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To have launched them at the very moment Primakov was in the
Oval Office would have been an insult which even the present
wretched state of America's relations with its former superpower
rival would hardly justify.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, however, military preparations are virtually
complete. The hope now is that one crushing blow against key
military installations _ starting probably with Cruise missile
attacks against air defense and communications sites _ will suffice
to convince President Milosevic to change his mind and accept the
international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   If not, matters could quickly escalate, even to the point where
a NATO ground invasion _ something the allies have vowed they will
never do _ was the only option left.
</P>
<P>
   That is a nightmare scenario which no NATO leader has yet
publicly confronted, but was implicit in the warning of one NATO
defense minister visiting London Tuesday, ``Kosovo is not Bosnia.
It needs a political solution; a military solution does not
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, that solution will be up to Milosevic. In 1987,
as an ambitious younger member of the Serbian Communist party's
central committee, he went to Kosovo, the spiritual cradle of
Serbia, and made the speech that launched today's Serbian
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he stripped Kosovo, and the 90 percent ethnic
Albanian majority of its population, of its autonomy _ the autonomy
he refuses to return today.
</P>
<P>
   By then Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia had read the Serb writing
on the wall, and, in wars greater and smaller, left Yugoslavia. But
Kosovo, where it all started, remained a tightly controlled part of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the last Balkan war, Serbia may lose even its heart. &QL;

   Just a few miles away from the place where I write this, a small
coastal town in the Indonesian part of Borneo, human beings are
doing unimaginable things to one another in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Madurese have been burned out of their homes
and scores murdered, and the burning and the killings are
continuing. In the past three days armed warriors have paraded
through their villages carrying severed ears, arms and heads.
</P>
<P>
   The motive is pure racial hatred. The police and army are
impotent or indifferent. And the same kind of communal violence,
for different reasons and by different means, is happening all over
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago I was in the Spice Islands where Christians and
Muslims are locked into their own murderous battle of religion, a
tropical Northern Ireland in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the archipelago, three of Indonesia's 27 provinces
have declared their independence _ one of them, East Timor, is
almost certain to break away from the republic in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, demonstrations against the government are gathering
momentum in the approach to June's elections _ during the last big
demonstration, in November, 13 people were shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   To Europeans, all this should have a disturbingly familiar ring
_ a large state, ethnically and religiously diverse, which throws
off a corrupt dictatorship, only to find itself stricken by
communal violence.
</P>
<P>
   Is the world's fourth largest country breaking up? Will
Indonesia become an Equatorial Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   It is an urgent question because the consequences of instability
here would be serious. Indonesia's 13,000 islands occupy the
crossroads of Asia, an area of profound strategic, political and
environmental importance to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial part of the world's oil passes through the
country's territorial waters _ prolonged disruption to shipping in
the Straits of Malacca, for instance, would seriously affect the
economies of both Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   And Indonesia's sprawling expanse makes it a neighbor to the
whole region. The prospect of an exodus of refugees from a
population of 210 million causes alarm from Canberra to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   This is why foreign governments gave such enthusiastic and
unquestioning support to President Suharto, the man who bears the
greatest responsibility for Indonesia's present turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years, he ruled a country which, from the outside,
appeared to be a model of Third-World development. GDP soared,
population growth was slowed, poverty was reduced and illiteracy
was virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Sukarno, had been an unpredictable demagogue
who flirted with communism and fought a low-intensity war with
Malaysia. No wonder the countries of the west, Britain among them,
were so willing to supply him with arms and to turn a blind eye to
the brutal annexation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that Suharto's rule was based upon fear; the more
astute could see that the benefits of Indonesia's success were
disproportionately concentrated in Suharto's home, the main island
of Java.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, he seemed to have succeeded in bringing
about permanent stability. Only in the last two years it has become
obvious what an illusion that was.
</P>
<P>
   As a nation state, Indonesia was always an unlikely proposition
_ the only thing that its diverse people had in common was their
colonial history as the former Dutch East Indies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than eliminating ethnic and religious difference, Suharto
froze them, forcing unity and stifling dissent with a repressive
military apparatus. Last May the thaw set in, and in the last 10
months the old enmities have emerged pristinely from the ice.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best way of understanding the grisly diversity of
violence presently on display in Indonesia. The hanging of
traditional sorcerers in East Java, and the beheading of Madurese
settlers in Borneo have nothing in common in terms of direct
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   But both are symptoms of the same sickness _ a combination of
economic distress and the breakdown of law and order, among
populations which have no other means of expressing a deep sense of
injustice and pent-up frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But there are huge differences as well as similarities, and for
several reasons the Balkans experience is unlikely to repeat itself
here. The most basic of these is Indonesia's size, a source of
passive strength as well as vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, two religions and a handful of ethnic groups
battle for a geographically and historically uniform region _ they
are fighting for what they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesians are as diverse as any people in the world. To an
ethnically Chinese Christian yuppy in Jakarta, the independence
struggles of animist tribesmen in Irian Jaya are almost as alien as
they are to the inhabitants of London or New York. However
concentrated power may be in Java, no single ethnic or religious
group is powerful enough to threaten the whole.
</P>
<P>
   For all their frustration with their central government,
Indonesia's provinces have much to lose from breaking away. East
Timor is misleading in this respect for in every way it is an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Portuguese colony, it was never part of the Dutch
empire and played no part in the Indonesian war of independence.
Despite its passive capitulation, the U.N. never recognized
Jakarta's annexation.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's announcement that it is prepared to give it
independence came as a result of international pressure, and a
brilliantly effective campaign by NGOs and East Timorese exiles.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's struggle has been one of principle, but in the rest
of the archipelago dissatisfaction has its roots in practical
matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Borneo, Aceh and Irian Jaya, big corporations have made
fortunes in timber, oil and copper with negligible benefit to the
population at large. Resentment for this exploitation has laid the
ground for independence movements and outbreaks of violence. But
what people want is not sovereignty so much as justice.
</P>
<P>
   All now depends on the outcome of general elections to be held
in June _ the closest Indonesia has come to real democracy since
1955.
</P>
<P>
   A decisive victory for a popular and visionary president could
halt the paralysis which the country is experiencing under
Suharto's unpopular successor and appointee, B.J. Habibie. But with
48 parties competing and no clear favorite among a handful of
front-runners, such a clean result is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sudden anarchy or civil war, Indonesia faces decades
of uncertainty, a directionless drift back into the Third World. &QL;

CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK STRUGGLES WITH LEADERSHIP ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (The following story, which was transmitted and held on 3-19, is
now released) (rk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, Gov. George Pataki gave the trustees
of the chronically troubled City University of New York a new
chairwoman, and a mandate to steer the university in a new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five months later, the trustees got a golden chance to
carry out that mandate when Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds resigned
after repeated attacks from the board.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 20 months since, the opening the trustees created has
turned into a yawning gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the board failed to find a permanent chancellor. It
is not even interviewing candidates, the search process having
broken down last summer. And other top executives at the university
have drifted away one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Five of CUNY's top jobs are now filled with temporary
appointees: there is an acting chancellor, an acting deputy
chancellor, two acting vice chancellors and an acting dean for
student services. The presidencies of 5 of its 17 undergraduate
campuses are open or about to open, and at least two more
presidents have been seeking other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The departures have come as CUNY has experienced problems on
other fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Student enrollment has fallen. This semester's total of
193,505 students is off about 2 percent from last year, and down 9
percent from the 1994 peak of 212,634.
</P>
<P>
   _ The university is in severe financial straits. Despite rising
costs, its budget has risen little since the early 1990s after
inflation is taken into account, and state and city support has
fallen. Both the governor and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are refusing
to pay for faculty salary increases that are in the union contract
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ CUNY has come under fire, from the governor and mayor among
others, over academic standards they say are far too lax.
</P>
<P>
   _ The trustees themselves are sharply divided, lacking both
strong leadership and the confidence of elected leaders in Albany
and New York City. Last year Giuliani went so far as to appoint his
own task force, led by the former Yale president Benno C. Schmidt,
Jr., to investigate CUNY and draw up a plan for the future,
including recommendations on privatizing some of its functions. The
report is due next month.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY, the largest urban university in the United States, was
once a beacon in public higher education, and in some ways it still
burns brightly. But in other ways it is an institution under siege,
buffeted by political forces and stretched to its budgetary limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to characterize what happened before as
higher-education nirvana,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of
the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, in San
Jose, Calif. ``But CUNY is now caught in the middle of a partisan,
ideological circus.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual that the trustees are political appointees. At
CUNY, the governor appoints 10 of the 17 trustees and the mayor
five. There is one faculty trustee and one student trustee.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual is the mayor's and governor's close involvement
in shaping CUNY's policies _ and in choosing a new chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the trustees' search committee forwarded three
candidates for chancellor to the governor and the mayor last summer
that the movement to find a permanent chancellor stalled. The list
did not include Peter Salins, the provost at the State University
of New York, who was said to be the mayor's and governor's first
choice. The mayor and the governor never called in the candidates
for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually boards are meant to be a buffer from the politics,''
said Joseph Burke of the Rockefeller Institute of government in
Albany. ``Here it is more like they are a conduit for the
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the governor is happy with the trustees' progress,
his chief of staff, Bradford J. Race, said on Thursday. In
particular, ace commended the passage of a hotly debated measure in
January that will bar students from bachelor's degree programs if
they need remedial work in reading, writing or mathematics,
although they can still enroll in the community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy the remedial battle seems to be over,'' Race said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the governor's office was pleased with CUNY's
chairwoman, Anne A. Paolucci, whom Pataki had attacked after he
grew dissatisfied with the slow pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   But as the trustees themselves note, much of the board's
progress has come in close, hotly contested votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a very contentious board,'' said Herman Badillo, a
mayoral adviser who is the board's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paolucci denies that anyone outside the board is affecting
policy. But others on the board say the mayor has been a key force
in drawing up policies like the one on remedial education. The
mayor's press office did not respond to several requests for
comment about CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   And some board meetings have been so contentious that police
officers have been called to stand guard. At several meetings,
students, faculty members and other protesters _ including a state
assemblyman _ have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Christoph M. Kimmich, the mild-mannered historian who was
appointed interim chancellor in November 1997 and had expected to
return to his job as Brooklyn College's provost long ago, has tried
to provide a calming influence and a sense of direction amid the
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall he worked with the trustees to draw up a five-year
budget proposal for Albany, rather than the usual one-year request.
This month, he led college presidents and other top administrators
on an off-campus retreat to discuss long-term planning. The
trustees may try a similar retreat later this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of my tenure, we need to set targets and engage
people in forward planning process and make sure things do get
done,'' Kimmich said. ``It may not be the norm for someone who is
in a temporary position, but I don't think we can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   He has earned the respect of both faculty members and trustees,
as well as others outside CUNY, including the governor's office,
which says he has done an excellent job. Still, there is a constant
awareness that he and many of his staff are caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't like Christoph Kimmich; he's done an
unbelievably great job under the circumstances,'' said William P.
Kelly, provost at CUNY's graduate center. ``But how can you plan
when you don't know who is going to be in charge in a year or
two?''
</P>
<P>
   Badillo said the interim appointments also color the way the
university is perceived on the outside: ``You have to have a new
chancellor for the governor and the mayor to have confidence in
CUNY,'' he said. ``An interim chancellor doesn't do it, because he
doesn't have the authority to move.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trustees set up a committee to find a new chancellor in late
1997. With the help of a search firm, the committee conducted
interviews and last summer had produced a short list of finalists:
David Adamany, the former president of Wayne State University,
Richard H. Ekman, the secretary of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
and Warren H. Fox, the executive director of the California
Postsecondary Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
   What was most notable about the list, however, was that it did
not include the the mayor's and governor's candidate, Salins.
Although CUNY's search committee interviewed Salins, trustees on
the committee said last summer that his presentation went poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Neither CUNY's bylaws nor state or city law calls for the
governor or mayor to approve the appointment of a chancellor.
CUNY's trustees hold that power. Although the chairwoman called the
forwarding of the three candidates' names to the mayor and the
governor last summer a courtesy, other trustees say it is one more
sign of the governor's and mayor's close involvement in CUNY
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three candidates, Adamany, has since withdrawn, and
there have been no meetings of the search committee since.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paolucci, who heads the search committee, would not comment
on the events so far, but said that the search firm is supposed to
be finding more names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good candidates,'' she said, ``but we want to build up
the list. It is a very important job.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the panel say they have heard nothing about the
search's resumption, but they and others wonder if they can even
find a plausible candidate who will want the job. Some college
presidents who were approached said the position was just too
filled with political land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you get the kind of leadership you want when the
position begins to look like a municipal appointee?'' Callan asked,
referring to Giuliani's role in prescribing policy. ``The person
has got to be accountable, but not in the same way as a municipal
employee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Race, Pataki's chief of staff, said he did not think
candidates should be scared away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, anyone who takes one of these positions takes it
knowing it is a public institution, and that public officials have
a right to express their views,'' he said. ``I don't think that
should discourage anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the turmoil at the top, the university has continued to
function, often in impressive ways: the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching named a Queens College professor the
state's 1998 Teacher of the Year, the third CUNY faculty member in
four years to be so honored. Two CUNY students recently won
prestigious Marshall Scholarships for study in Britain. And City
College was designated as the new home for a biomedical research
center being created by 10 New York medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Campuses are also moving ahead on new educational initiatives.
Manhattan Community College, for example, has begun to offer a
degree in multimedia programming and design. And the trustees
recently approved a new masters degree in creative writing at
Hunter College, although they sought repeated assurances that it
would not increase costs.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY is also working to improve student preparation so more
students can pass its placement tests when they arrive. It has
expanded its ``College Now'' program to 50 high schools, so 10th,
11th and 12th graders can take CUNY's placement examinations and
receive remedial help before they graduate. The university is also
expanding its intensive immersion programs for students who fail
the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they are encouraged that current applications are
running 2 percent ahead of last year and that applicants to the
senior colleges, which are raising their own entrance requirements,
are better prepared than a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The mood on campuses is varied. While some students and faculty
applaud the attempts to remake the university, and see the turmoil
as the cost of making sweeping changes, others say they are worn
down by the constant attacks on their university, using words like
``battle fatigue'' and ``numbness'' to describe how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   Some who follow CUNY politics predict that no serious chancellor
candidate will be put forward until summer, when Pataki has the
opportunity to make new appointments to the board, solidifying
control.
</P>
<P>
   But Race said the governor's office has no such plan, and added
that he believed that the CUNY board was pressing ahead with its
search.
</P>
<P>
   Although he expressed admiration for Salins, he said the
governor had no particular candidate. ``I know Peter well, and he's
doing a great job at SUNY,'' Race said, ``but I would have an
interest in anybody with his qualities who expressed an interest in
the job.''

<P>
   Just a few miles away from the place where I write this, a small
coastal town in the Indonesian part of Borneo, human beings are
doing unimaginable things to one another in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Madurese have been burned out of their homes
and scores murdered, and the burning and the killings are
continuing. In the past three days armed warriors have paraded
through their villages carrying severed ears, arms and heads.
</P>
<P>
   The motive is pure racial hatred. The police and army are
impotent or indifferent. And the same kind of communal violence,
for different reasons and by different means, is happening all over
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago I was in the Spice Islands where Christians and
Muslims are locked into their own murderous battle of religion, a

CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK STRUGGLES WITH LEADERSHIP ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (The following story, which was transmitted and held on 3-19, is
now released) 
(Repeating to correct coding) (rk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, Gov. George Pataki gave the trustees
of the chronically troubled City University of New York a new
chairwoman, and a mandate to steer the university in a new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five months later, the trustees got a golden chance to
carry out that mandate when Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds resigned
after repeated attacks from the board.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 20 months since, the opening the trustees created has
turned into a yawning gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the board failed to find a permanent chancellor. It
is not even interviewing candidates, the search process having
broken down last summer. And other top executives at the university
have drifted away one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Five of CUNY's top jobs are now filled with temporary
appointees: there is an acting chancellor, an acting deputy
chancellor, two acting vice chancellors and an acting dean for
student services. The presidencies of 5 of its 17 undergraduate
campuses are open or about to open, and at least two more
presidents have been seeking other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The departures have come as CUNY has experienced problems on
other fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Student enrollment has fallen. This semester's total of
193,505 students is off about 2 percent from last year, and down 9
percent from the 1994 peak of 212,634.
</P>
<P>
   _ The university is in severe financial straits. Despite rising
costs, its budget has risen little since the early 1990s after
inflation is taken into account, and state and city support has
fallen. Both the governor and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are refusing
to pay for faculty salary increases that are in the union contract
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ CUNY has come under fire, from the governor and mayor among
others, over academic standards they say are far too lax.
</P>
<P>
   _ The trustees themselves are sharply divided, lacking both
strong leadership and the confidence of elected leaders in Albany
and New York City. Last year Giuliani went so far as to appoint his
own task force, led by the former Yale president Benno C. Schmidt,
Jr., to investigate CUNY and draw up a plan for the future,
including recommendations on privatizing some of its functions. The
report is due next month.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY, the largest urban university in the United States, was
once a beacon in public higher education, and in some ways it still
burns brightly. But in other ways it is an institution under siege,
buffeted by political forces and stretched to its budgetary limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to characterize what happened before as
higher-education nirvana,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of
the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, in San
Jose, Calif. ``But CUNY is now caught in the middle of a partisan,
ideological circus.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual that the trustees are political appointees. At
CUNY, the governor appoints 10 of the 17 trustees and the mayor
five. There is one faculty trustee and one student trustee.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual is the mayor's and governor's close involvement
in shaping CUNY's policies _ and in choosing a new chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the trustees' search committee forwarded three
candidates for chancellor to the governor and the mayor last summer
that the movement to find a permanent chancellor stalled. The list
did not include Peter Salins, the provost at the State University
of New York, who was said to be the mayor's and governor's first
choice. The mayor and the governor never called in the candidates
for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually boards are meant to be a buffer from the politics,''
said Joseph Burke of the Rockefeller Institute of government in
Albany. ``Here it is more like they are a conduit for the
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the governor is happy with the trustees' progress,
his chief of staff, Bradford J. Race, said on Thursday. In
particular, ace commended the passage of a hotly debated measure in
January that will bar students from bachelor's degree programs if
they need remedial work in reading, writing or mathematics,
although they can still enroll in the community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy the remedial battle seems to be over,'' Race said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the governor's office was pleased with CUNY's
chairwoman, Anne A. Paolucci, whom Pataki had attacked after he
grew dissatisfied with the slow pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   But as the trustees themselves note, much of the board's
progress has come in close, hotly contested votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a very contentious board,'' said Herman Badillo, a
mayoral adviser who is the board's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paolucci denies that anyone outside the board is affecting
policy. But others on the board say the mayor has been a key force
in drawing up policies like the one on remedial education. The
mayor's press office did not respond to several requests for
comment about CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   And some board meetings have been so contentious that police
officers have been called to stand guard. At several meetings,
students, faculty members and other protesters _ including a state
assemblyman _ have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Christoph M. Kimmich, the mild-mannered historian who was
appointed interim chancellor in November 1997 and had expected to
return to his job as Brooklyn College's provost long ago, has tried
to provide a calming influence and a sense of direction amid the
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall he worked with the trustees to draw up a five-year
budget proposal for Albany, rather than the usual one-year request.
This month, he led college presidents and other top administrators
on an off-campus retreat to discuss long-term planning. The
trustees may try a similar retreat later this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of my tenure, we need to set targets and engage
people in forward planning process and make sure things do get
done,'' Kimmich said. ``It may not be the norm for someone who is
in a temporary position, but I don't think we can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   He has earned the respect of both faculty members and trustees,
as well as others outside CUNY, including the governor's office,
which says he has done an excellent job. Still, there is a constant
awareness that he and many of his staff are caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't like Christoph Kimmich; he's done an
unbelievably great job under the circumstances,'' said William P.
Kelly, provost at CUNY's graduate center. ``But how can you plan
when you don't know who is going to be in charge in a year or
two?''
</P>
<P>
   Badillo said the interim appointments also color the way the
university is perceived on the outside: ``You have to have a new
chancellor for the governor and the mayor to have confidence in
CUNY,'' he said. ``An interim chancellor doesn't do it, because he
doesn't have the authority to move.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trustees set up a committee to find a new chancellor in late
1997. With the help of a search firm, the committee conducted
interviews and last summer had produced a short list of finalists:
David Adamany, the former president of Wayne State University,
Richard H. Ekman, the secretary of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
and Warren H. Fox, the executive director of the California
Postsecondary Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
   What was most notable about the list, however, was that it did
not include the the mayor's and governor's candidate, Salins.
Although CUNY's search committee interviewed Salins, trustees on
the committee said last summer that his presentation went poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Neither CUNY's bylaws nor state or city law calls for the
governor or mayor to approve the appointment of a chancellor.
CUNY's trustees hold that power. Although the chairwoman called the
forwarding of the three candidates' names to the mayor and the
governor last summer a courtesy, other trustees say it is one more
sign of the governor's and mayor's close involvement in CUNY
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three candidates, Adamany, has since withdrawn, and
there have been no meetings of the search committee since.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paolucci, who heads the search committee, would not comment
on the events so far, but said that the search firm is supposed to
be finding more names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good candidates,'' she said, ``but we want to build up
the list. It is a very important job.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the panel say they have heard nothing about the
search's resumption, but they and others wonder if they can even
find a plausible candidate who will want the job. Some college
presidents who were approached said the position was just too
filled with political land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you get the kind of leadership you want when the
position begins to look like a municipal appointee?'' Callan asked,
referring to Giuliani's role in prescribing policy. ``The person
has got to be accountable, but not in the same way as a municipal
employee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Race, Pataki's chief of staff, said he did not think
candidates should be scared away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, anyone who takes one of these positions takes it
knowing it is a public institution, and that public officials have
a right to express their views,'' he said. ``I don't think that
should discourage anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the turmoil at the top, the university has continued to
function, often in impressive ways: the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching named a Queens College professor the
state's 1998 Teacher of the Year, the third CUNY faculty member in
four years to be so honored. Two CUNY students recently won
prestigious Marshall Scholarships for study in Britain. And City
College was designated as the new home for a biomedical research
center being created by 10 New York medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Campuses are also moving ahead on new educational initiatives.
Manhattan Community College, for example, has begun to offer a
degree in multimedia programming and design. And the trustees
recently approved a new masters degree in creative writing at
Hunter College, although they sought repeated assurances that it
would not increase costs.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY is also working to improve student preparation so more
students can pass its placement tests when they arrive. It has
expanded its ``College Now'' program to 50 high schools, so 10th,
11th and 12th graders can take CUNY's placement examinations and
receive remedial help before they graduate. The university is also
expanding its intensive immersion programs for students who fail
the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they are encouraged that current applications are
running 2 percent ahead of last year and that applicants to the
senior colleges, which are raising their own entrance requirements,
are better prepared than a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The mood on campuses is varied. While some students and faculty
applaud the attempts to remake the university, and see the turmoil
as the cost of making sweeping changes, others say they are worn
down by the constant attacks on their university, using words like
``battle fatigue'' and ``numbness'' to describe how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   Some who follow CUNY politics predict that no serious chancellor
candidate will be put forward until summer, when Pataki has the
opportunity to make new appointments to the board, solidifying
control.
</P>
<P>
   But Race said the governor's office has no such plan, and added
that he believed that the CUNY board was pressing ahead with its
search.
</P>
<P>
   Although he expressed admiration for Salins, he said the
governor had no particular candidate. ``I know Peter well, and he's
doing a great job at SUNY,'' Race said, ``but I would have an
interest in anybody with his qualities who expressed an interest in
the job.''

 SMITHSONIAN TO SEND INDIAN'S BRAIN HOME  &HT;     By CARL NOLTE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ The Smithsonian Institution promised Tuesday to
return the brain of Ishi, the last of his tribe, to appropriate
native American groups in California.
<P>
   Ishi's brain had been removed from his body after his death and
has been in storage in the Smithsonian for more than 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to repatriate the remains of Ishi,'' said
Smithsonian spokesman Randall Kremer.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a problem: The Smithsonian is not sure who is
entitled to the remains. Under federal law, remains of Indian
people may be returned to federally recognized tribes or to groups
that can claim a blood relationship with the remains.
</P>
<P>
   The solution may present itself Wednesday, when representatives
of the Smithsonian meet in Washington, D.C., with a delegation from
the Butte County Native American Cultural Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Butte County Indians, who live in the Sacramento Valley and
the nearby country, say they have a cultural affinity with the Yahi
Indians, a small tribe that was exterminated by white settlers in
the late 19th century. Ishi, who was widely believed to be the last
of the Yahi people, emerged from the wilderness near Oroville in
1911.
</P>
<P>
   He died in San Francisco in 1916, and his body was cremated.
</P>
<P>
   But the story took an unusual turn last month, when it was
disclosed that Ishi's brain had been removed from his body,
preserved and sent to the Smithsonian for study.
</P>
<P>
   However, studies were never carried out and Ishi's brain
remained in the Smithsonian's support center in Maryland for more
than 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., wrote the Smithsonian
to urge it to ``do all you can to reunite Ishi's remains and return
them to his native homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   The repatriation of Indian remains held and sometimes exhibited
in museums has become an important issue to native American groups
in recent years. ``According to Indian religious beliefs, a
person's spirits cannot be free unless the person is buried
whole,'' Feinstein wrote in her letter.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian agrees. In the past five years, Kremer said, the
Smithsonian has returned 4,000 remains to Indian groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ishi _ whose name simply means ``man'' in the Yahi language _
spent his last years at the University of California
anthropological museum in San Francisco, now part of UC San
Francisco. He had been befriended by UC Professor Alfred Kroeber,
the leading expert on California's native people, and considered
Kroeber part of his family.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was Kroeber who sent Ishi's brain to the
Smithsonian, a common practice in scientific circles at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arrive at truth through trial and error,'' the
Smithsonian's Kremer said Tuesday. ``And we learn from error.''

 VALDEZ SPILL LEAVES BITTER RESIDUE  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORDOVA, Alaska _ It was a decade ago Wednesday that the Exxon
Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef, hemorrhaging nearly 11 million
gallons of black, viscous crude oil into the pristine waters of
Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   That single incident devastated the sound, killing hundreds of
thousands of seabirds, thousands of marine mammals and untold
numbers of fish and shellfish. Wind and tide carried the vast slick
to the southwest, sullying more than 1,300 miles of shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, one of the richest ecosystems on the planet was
transformed into a reeking charnel house, a virtual ecological
graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the sound appears well on its way to recovery _ but no
one can agree on just what ``recovery'' means.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Corp., which owns the ill-starred ship, claims the sound
shows no long-term damage from the spill, and that fish and
wildlife are at pre-spill levels.
</P>
<P>
   Government biologists believe that most key species are
rebounding to one degree or another, but maintain that the sound's
essential ecological health remains compromised.
</P>
<P>
   And in Cordova _ the biggest settlement on the sound after the
oil port of Valdez, and the heart of the region's once-thriving
fishing industry _ ``recovery'' is just an eight-letter word for
deceit. For a sense of betrayal. For a bitterness so deep and
pervasive that it has become as much an element of daily life as
the craggy Chugach Mountains that tower over the hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, local waters are blue and pellucid and the air is as
crisp and sweet as an autumn apple. Oil? There's no visible sign of
it over the 15,000 square miles of open water, tidal flats, islands
and forested littoral that constitute the sound.
</P>
<P>
   But the great slick disgorged by the Exxon Valdez lingers in the
hearts and minds of the people of Cordova, whose economic and
spiritual connection with the sound has been irrevocably altered.
</P>
<P>
   Before the spill, everyone thought that the future would always
be like the past: Plenty of fish and shellfish to catch, multitudes
of seals and birds to hunt, a sound that was both a groaning board
of food and a source of spiritual solace.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Cordova's 2,500 residents sense that the future will
never be like the past. The town's fishing fleet is little more
than half the size it was in 1988 _ down to 400 boats from 700.
After the spill, three of the town's five canneries closed,
including the biggest. Two have since reopened under new
management, but at reduced production levels. The largest cannery
remains shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   And the malaise that affects the townspeople is deep and
abiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've learned out of all this is that
technological disasters are not like natural disasters,'' said
Brian O'Neill, an acerbic, homespun Minnesota lawyer who,
representing people who live around the sound, won a $5.3 billion
punitive damages award against Exxon in federal district court in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a natural disaster, people still feel connected to their
community and the land,'' said O'Neill. ``But a technological
disaster like this severs people from the planet. The damage is
especially severe in communities like Cordova. They had a
resource-based lifestyle _ the people depended on the land, water,
fish and wildlife for their identities as much as their food.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Prince William Sound is by no means a biological
desert.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 sea otters disport in Orca Inlet next to Cordova.
Pink salmon, bolstered by government hatcheries, are nearing
pre-spill numbers. Bald eagles are back at historic populations _
they perch nonchalantly in spruce trees along the harbor, hopefully
scanning the tidal flats for a fish carcass. And halibut, a fish of
great commercial value, are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon uses these examples to buttress its contention that the
sound is back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has essentially recovered,'' said Frank Sprow, Exxon's vice
president for environment and safety. ``The biological communities
are in good shape. The situation there is similar to what we've
found at other large spill sites. You have acute impacts, but they
are relatively short-term. The oil degrades.''
</P>
<P>
   David Page, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry from
Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, has performed post-spill
scientific analyses of Prince William Sound for Exxon. He agrees
with Sprow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the spill zone recovered in two to three years,'' Page
said. ``Candidly, it was surprising how rapidly the sound
recovered. About 99 percent of the oil was completely gone by
1994.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon spent about $300 million in direct compensation to
fishermen and other residents for economic losses, and shelled out
an additional $1 billion in a civil settlement that is being used
to purchase land around the sound. The company has also prescribed
rigorous safety rules for tanker traffic and oil transport since
the spill, and has bolstered its stockpile of oil-collection booms
and storage barges.
</P>
<P>
   But Exxon is fighting the $5.3 billion punitive damages award,
saying it is excessive. The company appealed the ruling, and it is
now before the U.S. Court of Appeals. Experts close to the case say
they expect the company to appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply not warranted,'' Sprow said. ``We took
responsibility since Day One, we apologized, we moved immediately
to compensate those damaged, and we did our best to clean up the
spill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cordova residents say that the sound is far from healed and
that Exxon is evading its responsibilities by challenging the
punitive damages. When and if Exxon pays, the money will be divided
among the region's fishermen and natives, based on estimates of the
economic losses they have sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sound's important commercial species have recovered
and others haven't. Unfortunately, the one that's doing the best _
pink salmon, which is at about 90 percent of its pre-spill levels _
is no longer esteemed in the marketplace. Prices for the fish have
crashed, a result of farmed Atlantic salmon from Chile and
Scandinavia flooding the world market. And herring _ still an
extremely valuable fishery, because the Japanese pay top prices for
the roe _ remains at very low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the spill, my dad bought a salmon permit for
$320,000,'' said Rob Maxwell, who manages Redden Marine, a maritime
supply store and net mending facility, with his brother Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sold it three years ago for $30,000,'' Maxwell said. ``Then
he lost his boat. Basically, he's lost his entire retirement. He's
65 now, and living on Social Security. So when we see Exxon
fighting the punitive ruling, it makes us pretty mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob and Mike both still fish, but they don't know for how long.
``We're just this far from losing everything,'' said Mike,
separating his thumb and forefinger by a quarter-inch. ``Unless
Exxon pays up, we're finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fishermen have managed to hang on to their boats, but they
are hardly in a celebratory mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going out, but we're not optimistic,'' said Virgil
Carroll, who repaired hydraulic lines last week with his son Doug
on their purse seiner, the Miss Carroll, in preparation for the
spring herring season.
</P>
<P>
   The total herring fishery has plummeted from 135,000 metric tons
before the spill to about 30,000 tons today. ``The herring biomass
is still low out there, and our quota from our fish processor is
only 30 tons,'' Carroll said. ``It isn't going to be a great
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova residents say their beef with Exxon isn't just about
money. They miss the flush times, but they mourn the loss of the
region's extraordinarily abundant wildlife even more. The sound,
they say, was once infused with magic. Now, much of that magic has
been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not the same out there,'' said Bud Janson, a Tlingit
native fisherman, as he nosed his boat, the Fish &AMP; Game, out of
Cordova harbor. ``Birds, marine mammals, a lot of fish and
shellfish species _ they're all down. There's more on our side of
the sound, which wasn't hit as hard as the west side. But it's
still not what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The spill delivered a particularly debilitating blow to natives,
because it has restricted their access to traditional foods. Given
a choice, said Janson, most natives will subsist almost entirely on
wild foods _ game, fish, shellfish, sea vegetables and berries.
Seal meat is especially important because of its high fat content
and its role in native rituals and feasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are afraid to eat the seals now, because they
migrate and you don't know if they've been eating fish that were
contaminated from some (oily) pocket,'' he said. ``It's a terrible
thing, to be afraid of the food that has always sustained you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, said Janson, is the way the spill has undermined
native traditions. ``You can't teach your kid how to hunt and fish
for traditional foods if you can't find those foods, or if you're
afraid to eat them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If some good came out of the spill, it is in the form of the
land purchased by a trust established by the state and federal
governments with the $1 billion civil settlement. About 650,000
acres of inviolate temperate rain forest and riverine habitat along
the sound have been bought for preservation, mostly from native
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But even this is not without controversy. Twenty years ago, the
native corporations acquired vast tracts as part of a settlement
with the federal government. The land represented a guarantee of
both continued access to subsistence hunting and fishing as well as
potential profits in the form of natural resources, such as timber.
</P>
<P>
   Now many natives are questioning the wisdom of selling their
land, even if it's for a good cause. This is especially true in
Cordova. The town's population is 20 percent native, representing
the largest settlement of indigenous people on the sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose the land, everything becomes very shaky,'' said
Patience Andersen Faulkner, a Chugash native who is the housing
coordinator for the Chugash Alaska Corp. ``Many of the native
corporations made the decision to sell because they're desperate,
they're just trying to survive. It's a terrible position to be
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon says the only place to find significant oil is at Sleepy
Bay, a northward facing inlet on LaTouche Island that has extensive
areas of beach and cobble contaminated by subsurface oily residue.
So many reporters have visited the site that locals call it ``Media
Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   The company and many of its scientific contractors say the oil
in Sleepy Bay has negligible environmental impact. ``If you took
all the individual little oil paddies and blobs at Media Beach,
you'd have an area the size of a basketball court,'' said Bowdoin
College biochemistry professor Page.
</P>
<P>
   But many independent and government biologists say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't paint a doom-and-gloom picture of the sound, because
it is definitely getting better every year as storms come in and
churn up and disperse the oil that remains,'' said Stanley ``Jeep''
Rice, a senior toxicologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service who has headed several studies of the Exxon Valdez spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``But having said that, there is still oil out there, and it's
in several places, not just Sleepy Bay,'' Rice said. More
ominously, he noted, recent studies by his team demonstrate that
even minute traces of oil are far more toxic to aquatic life than
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's group sprayed gravel with small quantities of oil, placed
fertilized pink salmon eggs on the gravel, then immersed the gravel
in running water. A control test was simultaneously conducted with
eggs hatched on unoiled gravel. Researchers noted how many eggs
died in both gravel plots. They then inserted tiny metal ID tags in
the noses of the fish that hatched, and released them to the sound.
When the fish returned two years later to spawn, researchers
compared the mortality and deformity ratios of the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Fewer fish from the oiled gravel returned. And those
that did showed a dramatically higher ratio of tumors, lesions and
deformities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this basically means is that oil is toxic to fish eggs
and larvae at spectacularly lower levels than we thought,'' said
Rice. ``It affects them at the parts per billion range rather than
the parts per million range that was previously assumed.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the study points to the essential reason
behind the persistent decline of several of the sound's most
important species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The link between trace levels of oil and damaged plankton,
eggs and larvae is very strong,'' said Riki Ott, a marine biologist
and former fisherwoman who lives in Cordova. ``That has
particularly severe consequences for a fish like herring, which are
on a seven- to eight-year cycle. Once they're down, it takes them a
long time to get back up. And if they're not getting annual
recruitment because their eggs and larvae are being damaged, the
stocks can be permanently depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   That has consequences for the entire sound, said Ott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything eats herring,'' she said. ``Salmon, halibut, seals,
otters, birds _ even big herring eat little herring. They're rich
in fat, making them a tremendous calorie reservoir that keeps
everything going. Without them, it's a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Cordova's woes can be blamed on the spill, of course.
One of the few things that fishermen and Exxon agree on is that
warm water incidents like El Nino may be depressing some fishery
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some species were already in decline before the spill,
including harbor seal, shrimp, king crab and tanner crab. It is not
clear whether the spill exacerbated those trends. And global market
forces, such as the decline in salmon prices, are also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Ott thinks Cordova has to diversify to survive _ but only in
ways that are environmentally sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a heli-ski company that just came in, and we have a
successful marketing program for Copper River king and sockeye
salmon, which are recognized in the Lower 48 for their high
quality,'' she said. ``We need to add value to our other products _
specialty smoked salmon and locally processed roe for the sushi
market, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Cordovans aren't sure that's the best thing for the
town. They say oil _ properly developed and rigorously regulated _
must remain a significant part of the sound's economic mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska has always had a resource-based economy _ fish, gold,
oil, timber,'' observed Margy Johnson, a former mayor of the town
and the owner of its largest hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has always been what has sustained us,'' she said. ``We
don't want _ nor are we set up for _ industrial-strength tourism.
Generally, we have a superb environmental record in this state. If
we don't develop our oil, development will go to the (Middle East
and the republics of the former Soviet Union). And they don't have
our environmental regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 10th anniversary of the spill has Cordova's residents
grimly contemplating the past, it also has them apprehensively
surveying the future. Supertankers continue to ply the sound daily.
And despite the new safety measures, residents feel that another
disastrous accident could happen at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, we didn't know what a spill like this could
mean,'' said Janson, the native fisherman, as he guided his boat
past a pod of sea otters munching on tube worms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we do. I don't care how many tugs they use now _ what
happens if they have a bum tanker that just happens to break up? Or
say there's a quake, and the (trans-Alaska oil) pipeline ruptures _
it crosses several major tributaries of the Copper River. Every
day, you wake up worrying. What will happen next time?''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEMPHIS -- For many people, the recent Amtrak crash in Illinois
was just another sad story reported one night and forgotten the
next. For those of us in Memphis, however, the story has lasted
longer.
 &HT;    Memphis was a stop along the train's route. Several local
families had members injured or killed. The most heartrending story
was of two sisters, ages 8 and 10, who died in the sleeping-car
fire.
 &HT;    In the days preceding their funeral, the parents, members of one
of the city's prominent evangelical churches, appeared on numerous
news programs professing faith in Christ and their confidence in
their daughters' salvation.
 &HT;    Reporters repeatedly commented on their deep faith with one
saying, ``If you miss faith in this story, you miss the story.''
 &HT;    It was impossible to miss the faith story in a Bible-belt town
like Memphis. Sadly, however, the faith presented by the parents
and pastors and the pundits did not seem much more than public
piety. A chance to witness about Jesus with the cameras on.
 &HT;    It pains me to say such a thing about suffering parents -- only
God knows how much they must be suffering. But their public display
of faith shocked me -- as I suspect it shocked Katie Couric on
their ``Today'' show interview.
 &HT;    Instead of tears and anger, they calmly spoke of accepting
Jesus. The mother even said she was ``happy'' for her daughters now
in heaven.
 &HT;    No questioning God's goodness? No doubt? No turning away from
the media glare in grief? No. Keep smiling and talk about Jesus on
NBC. Watching them, I confess I felt more embarrassed than
sympathetic.
 &HT;    The girls were not the only victims of this tragedy. The parents
also have been victims -- victims of bad theology.
 &HT;    Their church promotes this bad theology. Skip over the difficult
questions. Do not worry about pain. God is in control. Everything
is God's will. Come to Jesus and get saved. Your heavenly reward is
what matters.
 &HT;    Jesus, however, neither taught nor lived this theology.
 &HT;    Certainly Holy Week should remind Christians that theology with
easy answers is not God's way.
 &HT;    Jesus taught that his way was fraught with tension. He commanded
his followers to love God and love their neighbors as themselves.
He ordered his disciples to give up family and fortune -- and even
themselves -- to follow God.
 &HT;    He dined with the most objectionable people, touched
untouchables, and embraced outcasts. He broke nearly every rule of
polite religious society. And when cornered about his upsetting
behavior, he answered his critics with riddles and parables. The
way he advocated so threatened the authorities that they executed
him for treason.
 &HT;    Holy Week reminds Christians that Jesus' way was not easy. Jesus
walked a way of sorrow, the way of the cross. His way winds through
doubt, rejection, suffering, and death. He begged, ``Take this cup
from me.'' Instead, he drank from the cup of God's absence: ``My
God, my God, why have you forsaken me?''
 &HT;    Christianity is not a cheerful religion. Holy Week is a
wrenching reminder that the Christian faith is dark and dangerous,
a faith lived for and in the world that the world despises.
 &HT;    It is not easy. It was not easy for Jesus. It is not easy for
those who follow him.
 &HT;    In his new book, ``The Ironic Christian's Companion,'' Patrick
Henry writes, ``The gospel is no neurotic refusal to face death. It
is just the opposite -- a refusal to evade it. God died ... God has
gotten through to the other side by going through despair to get
there.''
 &HT;    The surprise of all this, of course, that this dark way
eventually leads to life. Holy Week leads to Easter -- but only
after loneliness and death. Bad theology gets there too quickly,
passing through death to resurrection without skipping a beat.
 &HT;    Even Jesus was dead for three days. And he was God. Surely, we
humans must pause and listen to the lessons of darkness before we
proclaim the victories of heavenly joy.
 &HT;    If we wait and listen, allowing suffering to shape our souls,
then we will not have facile answers.
 &HT;    I, too, feel certain those little girls are safe in God.
Perhaps, however, this was not the moment to say so. Perhaps we all
need to live with the sorrow and mystery of untimely death to
better love and serve God and God's people. We should not evade
death. We must refuse to evade it.
 &HT;    Who can say what could come from such tragedy? I do not know and
pray I will never know from personal experience.
 &HT;    I do know, however, that we would all be better off if not
victimized by bad theology that bypasses human pain.

 &HT;    Judge bounces Bolivian lawsuit to D.C.
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Call this federal court ruling a joke.
</P>
<P>
   On stage was U.S. District Judge Samuel Kent of Galveston, who
ordered a case filed by the Bolivian government against U.S.
tobacco companies sent to Washington, D.C. The suit had been filed
in a Brazoria County state court before it was transferred to
Kent's federal court in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   But what the judge said in his opinion March 1, not what he did,
caused more than a few guffaws in law offices across Texas as
lawyers circulated it on the Internet in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His tongue firmly in his cheek, the 49-year-old judge wondered
why Bolivia filed its suit in ``the veritable hinterlands of
Brazoria County'' in the first place. ``The Court,'' he wrote,
``seriously doubts whether Brazoria County has ever seen a live
Bolivian . . . even on the Discovery Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia's lawsuit, like the one filed by Texas against the
tobacco companies to recover public costs of treating ill smokers,
is one of several brought by foreign governments in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   But federal courts in Washington, populated by ``genuinely
renowned intellects,'' Kent wrote, ``can certainly better bear and
share the burden of multidistrict litigation than this single judge
division, where the judge moves his lips when he reads. . . .
``Furthermore, as this Judicial District bears no significant
relationship to any of the matters at issue, and the judge of this
Court simply loves cigars, the Plaintiff can be expected to suffer
neither harm nor prejudice by a transfer to Washington, D.C.,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kent said Tuesday he offers occasional humor from the bench.
``Federal judges are boring as hell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, get a grip. This isn't brain surgery, for God's sake.
We're talking about lawsuits.''

 &HT;    I'll take the criticisms as well as the laurels
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ After nearly 17 years of writing a column, the
one thing I've learned is that you never know what is going to set
people off. I have written pieces that I was sure would bring in
loads of nasty mail and gotten nary a word. I have written other
columns that seemed utterly innocuous, only to discover that I have
somehow pushed someone's hot button.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's good to hear from the customers even if they're not
exactly calling to bestow laurels upon you.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first columns I ever wrote, back in the summer of
1982, had to do with my cats, who were having to adapt from living
in the big city of Austin to making do in tiny San Augustine,
population 3,000. I mentioned that my cats were being visited by a
black cat who had taken offense at these big-city cats moving into
town. There had been a few minor skirmishes, the typical antics of
territorial creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The piece was meant to be lighthearted. You want serious, read
George Will.
</P>
<P>
   The morning it appeared, I was visited by a woman who was
convinced I was talking about her cat, even though she lived two
miles down the road. She threatened to sue me. I pointed out it's
hard to libel a cat. Dogs maybe, but truth is always a defense, and
cats are guilty of just about anything you could write about them.
</P>
<P>
   She could not be consoled or calmed. I had ruined her reputation
by talking about her cat. She might have to move or go into the
witness protection program. To this day I have no idea what exactly
caused her to turn into a raving lunatic that Wednesday morning.
She promised her attorney would be in touch, but a few days later
she called to apologize. She had decided it wasn't her cat I was
talking about after all.
</P>
<P>
   I tell this story because a few weeks back I wrote another
allegedly lighthearted column about what the three teen-age boys I
take to school each morning talk about: girls, tongue piercing,
rock videos, which teachers are mean, and which are cool, etc. The
three teens in question had no objection to the piece, though they
requested veto power over future columns that used them as topics.
Tough luck, I told them. Catch another ride if it bothers you.
</P>
<P>
   I have gotten several e-mails and even a handwritten letter from
a few teachers and one teen who read the piece in other newspapers
as far away as Pennsylvania. Two teachers from out of town took the
time to write and tell me that I was:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Full of beans.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Didn't know anything about teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Obviously have not been in a classroom in years, and
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ought to stick to my knitting, as the saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   Yeech. Lighten up, fellas. I'm on your side. I was simply
recounting what the teens I transport had to say. As for knowing
nothing about teen-agers, all I can say in my defense is that this
is the third set of teens I've helped raise. That doesn't mean I
understand them anymore than I have figured out cats or women, but
I do have some on-the-job experience.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite critique came from a young man in Newville, Pa. I
was impressed he took the time to write, even though he was a tad
critical. He wrote, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``We (teen-agers) could care less about body piercing. Why
should we care about our government? They do whatever they please.
The electoral college elects the President. Then the President does
whatever he feels he wants to do. We have no influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you were trying to write an informative essay
on this topic, but if you were, it was a horrible one. My friends
and I can write better essays and articles. We shall be very glad
if you respond to my letter!
</P>
<P>
   Cordially yours,
</P>
<P>
   John Lehman.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Mr. Lehman's letter was flawlessly written, with nary a
misspelling or grammatical error. He must have some good teachers.
</P>
<P>
   I am a bit saddened that he is already so cynical about
politics, and I hope he soon realizes that people do have influence
and voting does matter.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether I was trying to write an informative essay on
teen-agers, the answer would be no. I'll leave that to others more
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'll stick to cats from now on. At least they can't sue
me.

 &HT;    40 years of caring by `The Sweethearts'
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Recently, we celebrate the 40th
anniversary of Las Novias Society in Palm Beach County. Young and
sassy, the 12 women who started the club in 1959 thought ``The
Sweethearts'' in Spanish translation an appropriate
self-description with sufficient panache to distinguish them from
the many other local women's groups in our community.
</P>
<P>
   Many clubs survive because they have national affiliation or
prominent status likely to enhance one's resume when applying for a
job or vying for awards. Las Novias' appeal is more personal. It
has survived four decades mostly because it maintained a core of
members who resolve that committed friendship unified in action
best serves the needs of community.
</P>
<P>
   Though membership has waxed and waned, today there are 22 active
members. Monthly meetings are formal, with a printed agenda
distributed along with financial reports and minutes that are
likely to be scrutinized carefully and corrected in minute detail.
Every protocol and anticipated need of the group, from membership
intake procedures to benevolence guidelines, has been codified in a
handbook. Las Novias has indeed come a long way from the loosely
structured group a dear friend and club founder (now deceased)
invited me to join in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In those days we met bimonthly. The business meeting was a
free-for-all discussion of issues and projects, with the agenda
honored more in departure-from than in adherence-to. Still, we were
able to accomplish goals. We donated to community charities such as
the Shoe Fund for needy children and sponsored deserving youngsters
chosen to go on the annual school patrol trip to Washington but
unable to pay their way. Then as now, we also gave an annual
monetary scholarship award to a graduating senior.
</P>
<P>
   And we had fun: Our ``Mean Jeans'' dances at the Sunset Lounge
provided opportunities for women who came of age during the '50s to
wear jeans to an evening affair, a real breakthrough at the time.
And our annual Super Bowl party, complete with soul foods such as
chitterlings, became a coveted invitation.
</P>
<P>
   As did other members, I belonged to other organizations _ a
sorority and civic and professional clubs. Still, I needed Las
Novias' intimate social crucible to grow in understanding of other
women of different interests and temperaments. The camaraderie
provided a respite from workplace tensions. Also, I learned as much
about entertaining from the club sister who set a perfect table as
from the one who burned the bread, scraped it off and served it
with good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the club developed formal benevolence guidelines, I
felt buoyed during family crises as members spontaneously responded
to my needs. One of my most vivid memories of such support occurred
in 1981, while I was recovering from a second cancer surgery.
Having been initially misdiagnosed by a doctor before going for
treatment, I was overwhelmed with fear. Panic-stricken and feeling
more tired and alone than I ever had, I was re-energized by three
club sisters who after a full workday visited me. Their joking and
teasing transformed my fear to confidence that I need never feel
isolated or without caring friends.
</P>
<P>
   So this morning at our annual Spring Brunch, now an established
community tradition, Las Novias will celebrate 40 years of
friendship with each other and service to our community through
births, deaths, divorce and other transitions. As we showcase the
talents of local youngsters, we take special pride in other
accomplishments such as ``Project Imagination,'' a monthly Saturday
activity day at U.B. Kinsey/Palmview School of the Arts for
students and all youngsters in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Many among our guests also have long allegiances to local
neighborhood clubs, the kind that meet a personal need while
keeping us focused on the unique needs of our community. Las Novias
prays that its survival, strong and vibrant, will help keep the
tradition alive.

 &HT;    Put a garage band in that new hangar
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now, here's a sour note regarding the music
situation at the new Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   No amateur garage bands need apply to have their tunes played in
the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   No garage bands in the airport of the Garage Band Capital of the
World?
</P>
<P>
   That frosts my petunias. The people who are putting the airport
together have been beating their chests about the Austin flavor
they've put into the place.
</P>
<P>
   And they're excluding garage bands?
</P>
<P>
   In a town where the hat is passed more than it is worn, this is
a major blunder.
</P>
<P>
   This would be like Milwaukee excluding bratwurst, Boston
ignoring beans or Amarillo coming out against beef.
</P>
<P>
   City officials should reconsider and have a special ``Garage
Band Night'' once a week at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the new airport will feature recorded Austin music in the
Barbara Jordan Passenger Terminal. I'll admit that's a step up from
the ``Mantovani's Greatest Hits'' that you usually hear in
airports. But if your work isn't on a CD and your song isn't
published, your band won't make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   That means no garage bands. That's preposterous. Garage bands
are as big a part of Austin culture as antihistamine abuse, allergy
season and driving without your directionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airport asked for recognizable favorites,'' explained
Austin composer David Murray, who was hired by the city to do the
initial screening of the music played at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is requiring bands who apply to send in sheets of their
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Lyrics? Austin bands are supposed to have lyrics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know if we can have a hell or a damn in there,''
Murray said. ``You never know who you might offend at a public
place like the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck, under that kind of scrutiny, the Kingsmen couldn't have
snuck ``Louie, Louie'' past the baggage carousel.
</P>
<P>
   Just think what this city would be like if there were no garage
bands. If it weren't for Austin's garage bands, there would be no
Black Cat Lounge, no Joe's Generic Bar, and the expression ``Keep
your day job'' would never have been invented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably the biggest objection to garage bands at the
airport is that they're really worried about people being scared of
crashing airplanes,'' joked Ray Benson, of the Grammy Award-winning
Texas swing band Asleep at the Wheel. ``Some of those garage bands
sound like jet planes going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson is, however, pro-garage band because he used to play in
one called _ you got it _ Asleep At the Wheel. In 1974, the band
practiced in a garage on St. Elmo Road in South Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In most cities, people talk about one- or two-car garages. In
Austin, garage bands are so prevalent that we speak of having one-
or two-band garages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you know who uses their garage to put cars in?'' Benson
asked. ``What's a garage for? It's to store junk or rehearse.''
</P>
<P>
   So if we want the new airport to have an Austin tone, we've got
to include garage band music. May I suggest some heavy metal by the
metal detector?

 &HT;    Hate in the Heartland
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The way Lt. William Willcox saw it, the
protesters and the Klansmen weren't so much polar opposites as
parasites. One couldn't exist without the other. ``If those people
weren't there, this thing would be over in 10 minutes,'' said
Willcox, casting an appraising eye at the 200-plus protesters,
shouting obscenities through bullhorns. ``They're giving the Klan
just what they want _ an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday's KKK rally at the Kettering Civic Center resembled
nothing so much as an open-air Jerry Springer Show, with
choreographed fistfights and dueling profanities (none of them
bleeped). The few residents who turned up for peaceful protest were
appalled, not only by the hateful spewings of the Knights of the
White Kamellia, but also by the crude, combative behavior of the
counter-demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters belonged to Anti-Racist Action, a
Columbus, Ohio-based group known for getting in the face of hate
groups. Some were nearly as sartorially challenged as the Klan,
wearing black Jesse James-style bandannas to avoid being recognized
by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose streets? Our streets!'' they chanted. By yelling
profanity-laden remarks over a megaphone, meanwhile, they cleared
the streets of any self-respecting citizens for miles around. While
most of the protesters were young, and many probably sincere, the
overall impression was that of a mob spoiling for a fight, ready to
rumble. They carried signs declaring, ``This is a hate-free zone,''
yet spewed venom at the Klan, an epithet for an epithet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan is evil and it has to be confronted, but it needs to
be confronted in love,'' said Dave Mehaffie of Dayton, who brought
three of his sons for what he hoped would be prayerful protest.
``It breaks my heart to see this, and it breaks God's heart. We
must be careful how we stand up to evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Evil it was. This was not the new Klan, trying to soft-pedal its
image. Of the three Klan rallies I've covered, this was the most
vile. The Klansmen spat out epithets like poison darts. When they
ran out of things to say, they gave a stiff-armed salute and
screamed ``White power!'' or ``Go home, race traitors!''
</P>
<P>
   The level of ``discourse'' was so low that, after the initial
shock, it bordered on the farcical, even tedious. Then one of the
Klansmen would say something to remind you that evil, however
pathetic, is very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not condone dragging Negroes behind pickup trucks,'' one
Klansman said. ``It decreases the resale value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``James Byrd was a crackhead smoker...with an arrest record as
long as your arm, who saw fit to find himself behind a pickup
truck,'' said another. ``And they've elevated that dude to a
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   This drew applause from the 11 supporters in the fenced-in
pro-Klan spectators section.
</P>
<P>
   James Roesch, the 18-year-old former Kettering resident who
organized the rally, said that he was married Saturday. His bride
is 17-year-old April Letney of Jasper, Texas. The pair met at what
Roesch referred to as a ``cross lighting'' in Jasper after Byrd's
murder.
</P>
<P>
   How does a community respond to such hatred?
</P>
<P>
   Jenni Roer answers in two words: Stay away. The Washington Twp.
woman, executive director of the Dayton region of the National
Conference for Community and Justice (NCCJ), helped to organize the
event. National leaders for NCCJ and the Southern Poverty Law
Center unanimously recommended the same approach to Klan rallies:
Stay away. Organize an alternative event at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``ARA plays into the hands of the Klan,'' Roer said. ``They're
very misguided, very confrontational, and just provide for more
publicity for the Klan.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, 20 organizations planned a community celebration of
diversity at John F. Kennedy Elementary School. ``We worried that
not enough people were going to come, and the next thing we knew,
there weren't enough chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Roer did the math: fewer than 12 Klan supporters vs. more than
1,200 at the celebration. ``The community event by far represents
the region,'' she said. ``We have a long way to go throughout all
our communities. The good that has come from this is that Kettering
has an even stronger commitment to fight racism.''
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful moment occurred when Joyce Dumtschin, a cantor
with Temple Beth Or in Washington Twp., sang, ``Let There Be Peace
on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, spontaneously, row by row, the audience stood up,
swaying, holding hands, singing along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The example of Anti-Racist Action is not how you solve
things,'' Dumtschin said. ``You do something else, and you set an
example. You don't come down to their level.''
</P>
<P>
   In another part of Kettering, imported demonstrators chanted,
``Whose Streets? Our Streets!'' and gave the rag-tag White Knights
of the Kamellia exactly what they wanted _ an audience.
</P>
<P>
   At Kennedy Elementary School, the people of Kettering proved who
really owns these streets.

 &HT;    Internet vs. Library: Research race proves faster isn't always
better
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At the starter's gun, it looked like a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet team blasted out of the blocks into a commanding
lead by coming up with Merrill J. Bateman, president of Brigham
Young University, in one minute, 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The library team stumbled on their first step. Not only did it
take them nearly six minutes to find the name Eric B. Shumway, it
turned out to be the wrong name. Shumway is president of BYU's
Hawaii campus, not the whole university.
</P>
<P>
   But the Battlin' Bibliophiles stood up to the Online Onslaught
by nailing Christoph Willibald Ritter von Gluck's birth date and
Jeffrey Leonard's home run total.
</P>
<P>
   After three laps, the library team was just 45 seconds and one
wrong answer down with seven more chances to make up ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle of the Century ... no, the Battle of the Millennium
was heating up.
</P>
<P>
   Since ancient times, people doing research have traveled to
libraries to tap the wisdom of the ages. These days, though, people
tend to travel no farther than to the nearest computer.
</P>
<P>
   But is the Net always the best way to do research?
</P>
<P>
   To answer that question once and for all, two teams of student
volunteers were assembled to answer the same set of 10 questions _
one team using the resources of the main branch of the Dayton and
Montgomery County Public Library and the other using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Who won? That depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet team was a little faster. It took them a total of
one hour, 11 minutes and 15 seconds to answer the 10 research
questions. The library team took about 10 minutes longer at an
hour, 21 minutes and 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But the library team was more accurate. After flubbing the first
question, the library team found correct answers to each of the
next nine. The Internet team answered two questions incorrectly and
failed to find an answer to a third question within the allotted
time.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson seems to be this: The Internet is a great source for
quick information on certain subjects and clearly is superior for
finding up-to-date data. But the library often is just as quick or
quicker, and its information may be more trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Wright State University English lecturer Jane Blakelock said she
encourages her students to use both the library and the Internet
for research. Her students developed and maintain a rock music Web
site, and they use all available tools to keep the site up to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a research facility here where you have an area full
of Internet computers then you walk out into a room with windows
and reference books,'' Blakelock said. ``Combining sunlight, books
and computers seems to be a very good direction to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE RACE DEMONSTRATED
</P>
<P>
   The research race was conducted on two consecutive days; the
library team was timed answering questions one at a time one day,
and the Internet team was timed answering the same questions the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   The library team was allowed to use any library resources
including reference desk personnel. Team members could use
electronic card catalogs and computers linked to other library
databases. They were not allowed to use the library's Internet
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet team used three computers with fast Internet
connections. They could use any search engine or online directory
they chose. Team members also had access to dictionaries to help
with spelling words for their searches.
</P>
<P>
   Observing the work of both teams and analyzing the results
illustrated some basic rules of research. Here are a few of those
rules:
</P>
<P>
   _ Libraries are better organized than the Internet. It's
sometimes hard to tell whether a library or the Internet has the
most information. But it's clear that libraries are better designed
to lead researchers to the information they seek. Using the
Internet often means wading through tons of irrelevant material
before zeroing in on what you need. Simple information requests on
Internet search engines often generates thousands of sites with the
one site you want placed well down the list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Internet information is more up to date. The Internet blew the
library away on pop culture questions about Buffy the Vampire
Slayer and Hootie and the Blowfish. It also gave reliable
information about the current president of Brigham Young
University. The library team found a 1999 edition of a college
information book but apparently misread the entry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not all Internet sites are created equal. The Internet team
routinely ignored Web sites that appeared to be posted by amateurs
or by companies trying to sell things. When possible they looked
for sites maintained by government agencies and universities. They
also liked sites from news organizations such as CNN. They used
sites established by fans only to get leads that helped them find
more authoritative sources. Blakelock said Internet users must
figure out who put the information on the site and what their
biases may be before accepting the information as factual.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go for primary rather than secondary sources. The Internet
team got information on the Asian population of San Antonio from a
Tejas cultural Web site. The site said the information was from the
1990 Census, but it turned out to be wrong. The library team got
its information direct from the agency responsible for gathering
the numbers; the team looked in a Census Bureau data book.
</P>
<P>
   _ The library is more than books. The library team had a hard
time finding information on ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' in printed
material. The team answered the Buffy question by using the
Electronic Library system. They used library computers to tap into
databases of recent newspaper and magazine articles. Most libraries
also have Internet terminals, but you may not be able to use them
for more than 30 minutes at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Become proficient with more than one Internet search tool. The
members of the Internet team tended to prefer Search.com as the
engine to find information online. On some occasions, team members
directed all three computers to the same search engine to find the
same sites and ended up in the same blind alleys. They were much
more efficient when they used Search.com, Yahoo and other search
engines all at once.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old information you know to be in a book is usually best found
at the library. Despite the speed of the Internet, you still must
find pages, wait for them to load, scan them for relevance and then
start over if you don't find what you want. You can flip the pages
of a book in a fraction of the time, and the information is likely
to be more trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internet can be distracting. The Internet offers music,
video and other flashy effects along with printed material. It's
easy to get caught up with a lively interactive site and lose track
of what you're seeking. On the other hand, using the Internet to
write a report, for example, may help you find pictures and other
visual material to improve your work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just because the Internet has a lot of information, that
doesn't mean it has the exact information you want. The most
surprising result in the research race was the failure of the
Internet to supply a closing price for a particular stock on a
particular day. The Internet is treasured as a resource for
investors, and you might think such information would be easy to
find. Instead the Internet researchers found only graphs that
showed the stock's movement over time. That's great for investors
but was useless for our researchers. The library team found the
answer by leafing through old newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The research materials are only as good as the researcher.
Both teams made errors in which they found a good source for the
information but still failed to get the correct answer. The library
team got a name of a university official from the wrong campus, and
the Internet team apparently miscalculated the time difference
between Naples and Houston though they found a map that showed the
correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   THE TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   The research teams were made up of five students from the
University of Dayton and five students from Dayton's Belmont High
School for Computer Technology and Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Dayton is becoming one of the most wired
campuses in America and will require all students to have a
computer by next year. Belmont's magnet school program focuses on
computer use.
</P>
<P>
   All the students involved in the race had extensive experience
with doing research online.
</P>
<P>
   At the library:
</P>
<P>
   Joe Barger, UD, freshman: Online every day at UD.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Beer, UD, junior: Knew just where to look, Total Baseball,
for Jeffrey Leonard's home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Kilby, Belmont, junior: Noted that not everyone has access
to an Internet computer, but the library is available to all.
</P>
<P>
   Lonista Taylor, Belmont, junior: Tracked down Hootie lyrics
through the library's audio-visual department.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanica Williams, Belmont, senior: Working at the library
reminded this avid Internet user how quick library research can be.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   Renata Napier, UD, freshman: ``I'm looking for Asian population,
and they're talking about seat belts!''
</P>
<P>
   Aimee McCreary, UD, freshman: Pointed out that Internet has
excerpts while periodicals at the library have complete articles.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Palmer, Belmont, junior: Directed the action while her
brother Brandon typed at the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Palmer, Belmont, junior: Key player in translating the
Spanish sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ward, UD, freshman: Aggressively attacked the K Mart
question but was ultimately stymied

 &HT;    Screenphone lets your fingers do the surfing
 &HT;    By James Cummings

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The future of the Internet is probably not in
traditional computers; it will be in other devices that allow
access to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   One such product will be the Alcatel Internet Screenphone. The
screenphone, due on the market this summer, will allow one-button
access to the Internet from any desktop in your home or office.
</P>
<P>
   The screenphone is about the size of a large office phone. But
in the area that would normally hold buttons for various phone
lines, the screenphone will have a small color video screen.
</P>
<P>
   The screen is touch-sensitive, so online users will be able to
navigate on the Internet simply by touching icons on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   When the screenphone is not online, the screen controls normal
telephone functions such as speed dialing and caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   The phone also has a keyboard that retracts into the body of the
phone when the Internet is not being used.
</P>
<P>
   The company also promises foolproof installation. Consumer will
be able to pull it out of its package, plug it into a phone jack
and a power receptacle and go online immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel's screenphone won an innovation award at the
International Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas in
January. It also won several product awards at electronics shows
when it was introduced to retailers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Alcatel, a Virginia-based telecommunications company, plans to
begin marketing the screenphone worldwide in the third quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects the introductory price in the United States
to be about $300.

   Q: Despite all the news coverage about Viagra, I've never seen a
list of ingredients. Exactly what makes up this pill?
</P>
<P>
   A: Pfizer, the manufacturer, describes Viagra as the citrate
salt of sildenafil. You're looking for exactly what goes into each
blue tablet, though, so you want the technical jargon. In addition
to the active ingredient, sildenafil citrate, each tablet contains
these inactive ingredients, according to Pfizer: microcrystalline
cellulose, anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, croscarmellose
sodium, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium
dioxide, lactose, triacetin, and FD &AMP; C Blue 2 aluminum lake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the current condition of boxer Tommy Morrison, who
was diagnosed with HIV several years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: The former World Boxing Organization heavyweight champ
apparently has stopped making public appearances, and at last
report had moved to Fayetteville, Ark., after his Oklahoma home
burned down.
</P>
<P>
   A distant relative of the late actor John Wayne, Morrison was
suspended by the Nevada Athletic Commission Feb. 10, 1996, after
failing a medical examination. Two days later, his former
promoter,Tony Holden, announced that the boxer had tested positive
for HIV, and three days after that Morrison confirmed he was
HIV-positive and vowed never to fight again. Despite that, he
fought Marcus Rhodes on Nov. 4, 1996, knocking Rhodes out. That was
Morrison's last professional bout.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, who says Morrison has stopped giving interviews, said
last November that Morrison is sick but ``is doing OK.'' He added
that the ex-boxer apparently hasn't changed his views about not
taking HIV medicine, believing that the medication is what kills
HIV-infected people. Morrison has said he believes the theories of
Peter Duesber, a University of California-Berkely professor who
wrote ``Inventing the AIDS Virus,'' which promotes the
anti-medication concept. Holden refused to speculate on how much
time Morrison has left, calling it a morbid question.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard on the radio that the Supreme Court issued a decision
against the producers, directors and others involved in the movie
``Natural Born Killers'' on the same day the court denied convicted
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh's appeal of his death
sentence. The court basically said the film was the equivalent of
yelling ``fire'' in a theater. Much was made in the media of the
decision against McVeigh's appeal, but I didn't see anything
further about the other one. Did it happen? Did I miss it?
</P>
<P>
   A: What the Supreme Court did, on March 8, was to refuse to free
filmmaker Oliver Stone from a lawsuit that says his ``Natural Born
Killers'' led a couple to shoot a woman during a robbery in
Louisiana. The court left intact a state appeals court ruling that
allowed the lawsuit to go forward. It alleges the filmmakers
intended to incite viewers to commit similar crimes shortly after
seeing the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The court's action was reported in newspapers on March 9 along
with the court's action letting stand McVeigh's conviction and
death sentence for the 1995 bombing of the federal building and
other court actions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The other night, I watched part of a congressional committee
hearing dealing with airline passenger rights legislation. One of
the committee members was Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. Is
he related to John D. Rockefeller?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Jay, a Democrat, is John Davison Rockefeller IV. His
father, John III, was the oldest son of John Jr., who was the only
son of the wealthy American businessman to whom you refer, John D.
Rockefeller. That makes Jay the great-grandson of the industrialist
and philanthropist, who died in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently explained how the Dow Jones industrial average
is calculated. Can you provide similar information about Nasdaq?
</P>
<P>
   A: To understand the Nasdaq, it helps to relate it to the Dow.
As explained previously, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began as
a simple average of the prices of several industrial stocks. Over
the years, as its component stocks have split, it has been
necessary to adjust the divisor in order to maintain continuity. A
consequence of this adjustment process is that the highest-priced
stocks influence the average more than the lowest-priced stocks. An
average computed in this way is said to be ``price-weighted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite uses a different approach. Instead of
assigning more weight to the highest-priced stocks, it assigns more
weight to the stocks with the highest market value (also called
market capitalization).
</P>
<P>
   The market value of a stock is simply the product of its price
multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. Suppose a stock has
1 million shares outstanding and is priced at 50; its market value
is $50 million. Suppose another stock has 5 million shares
outstanding and is priced at 20; its market value is $100 million.
The second stock is worth twice as much as the first, even though
its price is less.
</P>
<P>
   In computing the Nasdaq Composite, the total market value of all
Nasdaq-listed common stocks is divided by the total market value of
all Nasdaq-listed common stocks on Feb. 5, 1971, and multiplied by
100. The result is a capitalization-weighted index, not an average.
Another example of a capitalization-weighted index is the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average?
</P>
<P>
   A: The companies change from time to time, but not very often.
These are the current components: AT&AMP;T, Alcoa, AlliedSignal,
American Express, Boeing, Caterpillar, Chevron, Citicorp,
Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, DuPont, Eastman Kodak, Exxon, General
Electric, General Motors, Goodyear, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
International Paper, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, McDonald's, Merck,
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M), J.P. Morgan, Philip
Morris, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Sears, Union Carbide, United Technologies
and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The components are listed daily on Page 3 of the Money and
Investing section of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does former House Speaker Jim Wright still get funds to pay
for office expenses? Will ex-Speaker Newt Gingrich also receive
funds for office expenses?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wright (D-Texas) continues to receive about $192,000 a year
for staff expenses (three secretaries and an administrative
assistant), and to cover rent, communication, utilities, supplies
and equipment, according to Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers
Union. Tom Foley (D-Wash.), Wright's successor, receives about
$164,000 a year for running his office, Sepp said. And the same law
allowing benefits for former speakers would apply to Gingrich, Sepp
said, with the Georgia Republican eligible for about the same
amount of money as the others.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.) attempted to introduce legislation to
repeal privileges for former speakers in both the 104th and 105th
Congresses, Sepp added, but those proposals never came to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you name all the actors who have portrayed Tarzan in
films? I know Johnny Weissmuller and Buster Crabbe were among them,
and I think there may have been three others.
</P>
<P>
   A: A complete list is impossible because there have been many
unauthorized foreign Tarzan films over the years made in Russia,
India, France, China and Italy. There also have been various movies
with young actors portraying Tarzan as a child.
</P>
<P>
   The book ``The Name Is Familiar . . . Who Played Who in the
Movies?'' lists these, going back to silent movie days: Elmo
Lincoln, Dempsey Tabler, Weissmuller, Crabbe, Herman Brix, Glenn
Morris, Lex Barker, Gordon Scott, Denny Miller, Jock Mahoney, Mike
Henry, Ron Ely, Miles O'Keefe and Christopher Lambert. Other
Tarzans have been Gene Pollar, James Pierce and Frank Merrill and
Caspar Van Dien. And for future reference, Walt Disney Studios is
unveiling an animated Tarzan this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about bad breath mentioned a mouthwash containing
chlorine dioxide that sells for about $8. What is the name of it,
and where can it be purchased?
</P>
<P>
   A: The mouthwash is one of three products _ along with a tongue
brush and a liquid gel cleanser _ designed for the prevention of
halitosis and sold by Enfresh Products of Roswell, Ga. You can get
information and the products from your dentist, or they can be
ordered by calling Enfresh at 1-877-363-7374. Online information
also is available at http://www.enfresh.com Q: Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.) ran for president of the National Rifle Association last
year and lost to Charleton Heston. Is that position unsalaried and
honorary? If not, was Barr prepared to resign from Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not accurate to say Barr ran for NRA president, said Jim
Manown, spokesman for the organization. What Barr ran for, and was
elected to, is the NRA board, which has 76 members. Positions on
the board, as well as the presidency itself, are unpaid and
``essentially volunteer,'' Manown added. Since Barr didn't run for
NRA president, and since it's not a paid, full-time position, the
idea of giving up his seat in Congress doesn't realistically come
into play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the status of Mark David Chapman, who killed John
Lennon?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chapman is serving his 20-years-to-life sentence at the
Attica Correctional Facility in New York. The 43-year-old's first
parole hearing will be in October 2000 and he is eligible for
release as early as December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   An article last year in the Chicago Sun-Times reported that
Chapman, who killed Lennon in December 1980, spends his time
writing religious tracts or visiting with his wife, who comes to
see him two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognizes and acknowledges the horror of what he did,''
said author Jack Jones, who spent hundreds of hours interviewing
Chapman at prison for a book on the killer. In his 6-by-8-foot
prison cell, Chapman sorts the letters he receives into piles
marked ``nut case,'' ``hate; threat,'' ``autograph seeker,'' ``hero
worshipper,'' ``sincere,'' ``semi-sincere'' or ``fake,'' the
Sun-Times reported. ``He still gets lots of mail,'' Jones said.
``Anybody who gets to know him, one thing comes across: This is
actually a nice guy.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: With all the talk about the ``Star Wars'' defense system, I'm
reminded of the old DEW Line to detect missiles and aircraft coming
toward North America from Russia. I think it was erected in the
1950s in northern Canada. Does it still exist?
</P>
<P>
   A: It still exists, but in an expanded, upgraded form, and with
a new name. The Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, code-named ``Seek
Frost,'' was created in 1958 with 31 U.S. radar stations stretching
across the Arctic Circle from Alaska to Labrador. It was upgraded
between 1987 and 1992 and subsequently renamed North Warning
System.
</P>
<P>
   The NWS consists of 15 long-range air defense radar sites and 39
short-range, unattended radar stations. Jointly funded by the
United States and Canada, the NWS is tied into the North American
Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) military alliance, with
headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base near Colorado Springs,
Colo., and an underground command center at nearby Cheyenne
Mountain. The NWS also is linked to operation control centers at
Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska and North Bay, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I intend to collect the new quarters commemorating the 50
states. When will the second one, which I believe is for
Pennsylvania, come out?
</P>
<P>
   A: It already has. The Pennsylvania coin went into production on
Feb. 22, according to the U.S. Mint, with the first strike ceremony
March 8, attended by U.S. Treasurer Mary Ellen Withrow and
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. Some 750 million of the Pennsylvania
quarters were shipped to the Federal Reserve for distribution to
financial institutions and commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   While the coin is expected to begin appearing in circulation in
late March, the Mint advises that it may not be widely available in
circulation nationwide until this summer. Delaware quarters were
the first to be produced for release in 1999; after Pennsylvania,
the remaining three this year will be New Jersey, Georgia and
Connecticut.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a connection between the word Caucasian and the
Caucasus Mountains of Eastern Europe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins explains that in 1795, German anthropologist Johann
Blumenbach divided mankind into what he termed the Caucasian,
Mongolian, Ethiopian, American and Malayan races. He chose a skull
from the Caucasus _ the region between the Black and Caspian seas
that now includes southeast Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia
_ as the ideal model for his racial type. He also claimed that the
Caucasus area was the home of the hypothetical race known as
``Indo-Europeans,'' to whom many languages can be traced.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenbach's theories proved unscientific and tinged with
racism, the encyclopedia notes. The word Caucasian now is defined
as ``one of the main ethnic divisions of the human race:
(including) the Mediterranean, Alpine and Nordic subdivisions, and
is loosely called the white race.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a U.S. driver's license sufficient to drive in most
foreign countries, or is it necessary to have an international
driver's license?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department says many countries do not recognize a
U.S. license, but most accept an international driver's permit. It
advises travelers who intend to drive overseas to check with the
various embassies or consulates on their requirements. An
international driver's license can be obtained at offices of the
American Automobile Association for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I spent about a year during World War II on Samar Island in
the Philippines, but I haven't seen or heard anything about it
since. What it is like now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Samar is in the Visayas, the main island group of the
Philippines. Lying between south Luzon and Leyte, it is hilly and
steep, with the greater part of the island thickly wooded. Its
inhabitants, who call themselves Waray, grow rice, maize and sweet
potatoes, and live in three provinces. Northern Samar and the
island's west coast are frequented by travelers who like to get off
the beaten path, but central and eastern Samar are ``problem
areas'' where fighting often breaks out between government troops
and the New People's Army. The Lonely Planet guide to the
Philippines notes that Samar's potential tourist attractions
``should not be underestimated,'' but the infrastructure needs
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Pacific World War II sites, Dent Thompson of
Midway Phoenix Corp. in Cartersville, Ga., points out that the
Midway islands also have been opened to visitors, with flights
available twice a week from Honolulu. Midway Phoenix terms the
atoll ``one of the most remote islands on Earth.'' A bachelor
officers quarters has been converted into a lodging facility, and
Midway has several restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A co-worker and I have a bet. Was the movie ``Gone With the
Wind'' filmed in Hollywood, or were some scenes done in Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   A: None of it was filmed in Georgia. Even the scene of the
burning of Atlanta actually was the torching of old ``King Kong''
sets. But even though Georgia wasn't actually used, it's easy to
see how someone could think so. The book ``The Celluloid South''
says producer David O. Selznick was committed so whole-heartedly to
accuracy in detail that the California soil where outdoor scenes
were filmed was colored to match the red Georgia terrain.
</P>
<P>
   While the architecture for the 40-acre Atlanta set was based on
period photographs, sketches and other documents, the Tara set
``owed more to imagination than research, reflecting the mythology
built up for so long by previous films and accepted seemingly
without question by the filmmaker,'' the book reports.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has any man ever served as vice president for four years, and
then been elected president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Four have been elected president directly from the vice
presidency: John Adams, elected president in 1796; Thomas
Jefferson, 1800; Martin Van Buren, 1836; and George Bush, 1988.
Richard Nixon was the first vice president elected president
several years after his vice presidential term. Between Jan. 20,
1961, and Jan. 20, 1969, he ran unsuccessfully for governor of
California, practiced law and wrote a book.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A sign in my post office says it's illegal to reuse a postage
stamp. When I inquired, the postmaster refused to provide any
information about the regulation on this. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The theory is that a ``theft of service'' is involved if a
person doesn't affix a fresh, unused stamp to a piece of mail.
Nancy Ross of the Postal Service cited the United States Code,
Title 18, Section 1720. She said the Postal Service provides the
delivery of a piece of mail for the price of the stamp. Once that
service has been provided, that stamp is voided, whether or not it
has been canceled. Therefore, a new stamp must be purchased in
order for that customer to get another service from USPS.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Julie London, the songstress from the
'60s?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 72-year-old actress and blues singer is recovering from a
stroke in Encino, Calif. She had two careers, the first culminating
with her role in the 1947 film ``The Red House.'' After that, she
married Jack Webb, who was then an obscure radio artist. But when
Webb struck a rich lode with the ``Dragnet'' TV series in the
1950s, she retired from show business, choosing to raise their two
daughters, Stacy and Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   After divorcing Webb in 1953, London went into a period of
inactivity and what she called ``a failure of self-confidence''
before resuming her career, aided in large part by songwriter and
jazz musician Bobby Troup, whom she later married. In the mid-'50s
her career took off again, spurred by her album, ``Julie Is Her
Name,'' which included her biggest hit, ``Cry Me a River.'' She
then made a number of movies, including ``The Crime Against Joe''
(1956), ``Man of the West'' (1958), and ``Night of the Quarter
Moon'' (1959).
</P>
<P>
   London appeared on TV after her film career faded, most notably
in the medical series ``Emergency.'' London and Troup, who died
last month, had three children.

   Q: What are the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average?
</P>
<P>
   A: The companies change from time to time, but not very often.
These are the current components: AT&AMP;T, Alcoa, AlliedSignal,
American Express, Boeing, Caterpillar, Chevron, Citicorp,
Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, DuPont, Eastman Kodak, Exxon, General
Electric, General Motors, Goodyear, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
International Paper, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, McDonald's, Merck,
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M), J.P. Morgan, Philip
Morris, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Sears, Union Carbide, United Technologies
and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The components are listed daily on Page 3 of the Money and
Investing section of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does former House Speaker Jim Wright still get funds to pay
for office expenses? Will ex-Speaker Newt Gingrich also receive
funds for office expenses?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wright (D-Texas) continues to receive about $192,000 a year
for staff expenses (three secretaries and an administrative
assistant), and to cover rent, communication, utilities, supplies
and equipment, according to Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers
Union. Tom Foley (D-Wash.), Wright's successor, receives about
$164,000 a year for running his office, Sepp said. And the same law
allowing benefits for former speakers would apply to Gingrich, Sepp
said, with the Georgia Republican eligible for about the same
amount of money as the others.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.) attempted to introduce legislation to
repeal privileges for former speakers in both the 104th and 105th
Congresses, Sepp added, but those proposals never came to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you name all the actors who have portrayed Tarzan in
films? I know Johnny Weissmuller and Buster Crabbe were among them,
and I think there may have been three others.
</P>
<P>
   A: A complete list is impossible because there have been many
unauthorized foreign Tarzan films over the years made in Russia,
India, France, China and Italy. There also have been various movies
with young actors portraying Tarzan as a child.
</P>
<P>
   The book ``The Name Is Familiar . . . Who Played Who in the
Movies?'' lists these, going back to silent movie days: Elmo
Lincoln, Dempsey Tabler, Weissmuller, Crabbe, Herman Brix, Glenn
Morris, Lex Barker, Gordon Scott, Denny Miller, Jock Mahoney, Mike
Henry, Ron Ely, Miles O'Keefe and Christopher Lambert. Other
Tarzans have been Gene Pollar, James Pierce and Frank Merrill and
Caspar Van Dien. And for future reference, Walt Disney Studios is
unveiling an animated Tarzan this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about bad breath mentioned a mouthwash containing
chlorine dioxide that sells for about $8. What is the name of it,
and where can it be purchased?
</P>
<P>
   A: The mouthwash is one of three products _ along with a tongue
brush and a liquid gel cleanser _ designed for the prevention of
halitosis and sold by Enfresh Products of Roswell, Ga. You can get
information and the products from your dentist, or they can be
ordered by calling Enfresh at 1-877-363-7374. Online information
also is available at http://www.enfresh.com Q: Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.) ran for president of the National Rifle Association last
year and lost to Charleton Heston. Is that position unsalaried and
honorary? If not, was Barr prepared to resign from Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not accurate to say Barr ran for NRA president, said Jim
Manown, spokesman for the organization. What Barr ran for, and was
elected to, is the NRA board, which has 76 members. Positions on
the board, as well as the presidency itself, are unpaid and
``essentially volunteer,'' Manown added. Since Barr didn't run for
NRA president, and since it's not a paid, full-time position, the
idea of giving up his seat in Congress doesn't realistically come
into play.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the status of Mark David Chapman, who killed John
Lennon?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chapman is serving his 20-years-to-life sentence at the
Attica Correctional Facility in New York. The 43-year-old's first
parole hearing will be in October 2000 and he is eligible for
release as early as December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   An article last year in the Chicago Sun-Times reported that
Chapman, who killed Lennon in December 1980, spends his time
writing religious tracts or visiting with his wife, who comes to
see him two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognizes and acknowledges the horror of what he did,''
said author Jack Jones, who spent hundreds of hours interviewing
Chapman at prison for a book on the killer. In his 6-by-8-foot
prison cell, Chapman sorts the letters he receives into piles
marked ``nut case,'' ``hate; threat,'' ``autograph seeker,'' ``hero
worshipper,'' ``sincere,'' ``semi-sincere'' or ``fake,'' the
Sun-Times reported. ``He still gets lots of mail,'' Jones said.
``Anybody who gets to know him, one thing comes across: This is
actually a nice guy.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: With all the talk about the ``Star Wars'' defense system, I'm
reminded of the old DEW Line to detect missiles and aircraft coming
toward North America from Russia. I think it was erected in the
1950s in northern Canada. Does it still exist?
</P>
<P>
   A: It still exists, but in an expanded, upgraded form, and with
a new name. The Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, code-named ``Seek
Frost,'' was created in 1958 with 31 U.S. radar stations stretching
across the Arctic Circle from Alaska to Labrador. It was upgraded
between 1987 and 1992 and subsequently renamed North Warning
System.
</P>
<P>
   The NWS consists of 15 long-range air defense radar sites and 39
short-range, unattended radar stations. Jointly funded by the
United States and Canada, the NWS is tied into the North American
Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) military alliance, with
headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base near Colorado Springs,
Colo., and an underground command center at nearby Cheyenne
Mountain. The NWS also is linked to operation control centers at
Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska and North Bay, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I intend to collect the new quarters commemorating the 50
states. When will the second one, which I believe is for
Pennsylvania, come out?
</P>
<P>
   A: It already has. The Pennsylvania coin went into production on
Feb. 22, according to the U.S. Mint, with the first strike ceremony
March 8, attended by U.S. Treasurer Mary Ellen Withrow and
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. Some 750 million of the Pennsylvania
quarters were shipped to the Federal Reserve for distribution to
financial institutions and commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   While the coin is expected to begin appearing in circulation in
late March, the Mint advises that it may not be widely available in
circulation nationwide until this summer. Delaware quarters were
the first to be produced for release in 1999; after Pennsylvania,
the remaining three this year will be New Jersey, Georgia and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   For online information, check this Internet site:
http://www.usmint.gov/ and click on New 50 States Coins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a connection between the word Caucasian and the
Caucasus Mountains of Eastern Europe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase
Origins explains that in 1795, German anthropologist Johann
Blumenbach divided mankind into what he termed the Caucasian,
Mongolian, Ethiopian, American and Malayan races. He chose a skull
from the Caucasus _ the region between the Black and Caspian seas
that now includes southeast Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia
_ as the ideal model for his racial type. He also claimed that the
Caucasus area was the home of the hypothetical race known as
``Indo-Europeans,'' to whom many languages can be traced.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenbach's theories proved unscientific and tinged with
racism, the encyclopedia notes. The word Caucasian now is defined
as ``one of the main ethnic divisions of the human race:
(including) the Mediterranean, Alpine and Nordic subdivisions, and
is loosely called the white race.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is a U.S. driver's license sufficient to drive in most
foreign countries, or is it necessary to have an international
driver's license?
</P>
<P>
   A: The State Department says many countries do not recognize a
U.S. license, but most accept an international driver's permit. It
advises travelers who intend to drive overseas to check with the
various embassies or consulates on their requirements. An
international driver's license can be obtained at offices of the
American Automobile Association for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I spent about a year during World War II on Samar Island in
the Philippines, but I haven't seen or heard anything about it
since. What it is like now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Samar is in the Visayas, the main island group of the
Philippines. Lying between south Luzon and Leyte, it is hilly and
steep, with the greater part of the island thickly wooded. Its
inhabitants, who call themselves Waray, grow rice, maize and sweet
potatoes, and live in three provinces. Northern Samar and the
island's west coast are frequented by travelers who like to get off
the beaten path, but central and eastern Samar are ``problem
areas'' where fighting often breaks out between government troops
and the New People's Army. The Lonely Planet guide to the
Philippines notes that Samar's potential tourist attractions
``should not be underestimated,'' but the infrastructure needs
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Pacific World War II sites, Dent Thompson of
Midway Phoenix Corp. in Cartersville, Ga., points out that the
Midway islands also have been opened to visitors, with flights
available twice a week from Honolulu. Midway Phoenix terms the
atoll ``one of the most remote islands on Earth.'' A bachelor
officers quarters has been converted into a lodging facility, and
Midway has several restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A co-worker and I have a bet. Was the movie ``Gone With the
Wind'' filmed in Hollywood, or were some scenes done in Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   A: None of it was filmed in Georgia. Even the scene of the
burning of Atlanta actually was the torching of old ``King Kong''
sets. But even though Georgia wasn't actually used, it's easy to
see how someone could think so. The book ``The Celluloid South''
says producer David O. Selznick was committed so whole-heartedly to
accuracy in detail that the California soil where outdoor scenes
were filmed was colored to match the red Georgia terrain.
</P>
<P>
   While the architecture for the 40-acre Atlanta set was based on
period photographs, sketches and other documents, the Tara set
``owed more to imagination than research, reflecting the mythology
built up for so long by previous films and accepted seemingly
without question by the filmmaker,'' the book reports.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has any man ever served as vice president for four years, and
then been elected president?
</P>
<P>
   A: Four have been elected president directly from the vice
presidency: John Adams, elected president in 1796; Thomas
Jefferson, 1800; Martin Van Buren, 1836; and George Bush, 1988.
Richard Nixon was the first vice president elected president
several years after his vice presidential term. Between Jan. 20,
1961, and Jan. 20, 1969, he ran unsuccessfully for governor of
California, practiced law and wrote a book.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A sign in my post office says it's illegal to reuse a postage
stamp. When I inquired, the postmaster refused to provide any
information about the regulation on this. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The theory is that a ``theft of service'' is involved if a
person doesn't affix a fresh, unused stamp to a piece of mail.
Nancy Ross of the Postal Service cited the United States Code,
Title 18, Section 1720. She said the Postal Service provides the
delivery of a piece of mail for the price of the stamp. Once that
service has been provided, that stamp is voided, whether or not it
has been canceled. Therefore, a new stamp must be purchased in
order for that customer to get another service from USPS.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Julie London, the songstress from the
'60s?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 72-year-old actress and blues singer is recovering from a
stroke in Encino, Calif. She had two careers, the first culminating
with her role in the 1947 film ``The Red House.'' After that, she
married Jack Webb, who was then an obscure radio artist. But when
Webb struck a rich lode with the ``Dragnet'' TV series in the
1950s, she retired from show business, choosing to raise their two
daughters, Stacy and Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   After divorcing Webb in 1953, London went into a period of
inactivity and what she called ``a failure of self-confidence''
before resuming her career, aided in large part by songwriter and
jazz musician Bobby Troup, whom she later married. In the mid-'50s
her career took off again, spurred by her album, ``Julie Is Her
Name,'' which included her biggest hit, ``Cry Me a River.'' She
then made a number of movies, including ``The Crime Against Joe''
(1956), ``Man of the West'' (1958), and ``Night of the Quarter
Moon'' (1959).
</P>
<P>
   London appeared on TV after her film career faded, most notably
in the medical series ``Emergency.'' London and Troup, who died
last month, had three children.

 &HT;    Pour on the blue with these drink selections
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Go all out for a Once in a Blue Moon party with
matching drinks.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty out there.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there's Luna di Luna wine from Italy. The
chardonnay/Pinot Grigio blend sports a beautiful label and is
priced at about $11.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider Bravado, another Italian import. This Pinot Grigio
is unremarkable, but the gorgeous blue bottle comes with a stopper
that makes it reusable, maybe for olive oil. It's about $12.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of wine, think beer. Blue Moon beer is around $6 a
six-pack for Abbey Ale, Nut Brown Ale and Belgian White, or, for
more traditional tastes, Labatt Blue, a Canadian Pilsner, for a
little more than $5.
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo beer, which came in a blue bottle, seems to have
disappeared from retail shelves. But if you want to put a blue
bottle you on the table, it's as close as bottled spring water
under the Astia Ridge label, around $1.50. Or pour vodka from a
vivid blue bottle under the Skyy label, or Bombay Sapphire gin,
prettily put up in an embossed aqua bottle.
</P>
<P>
   As for drinks that are really blue, the classic used in
Hawaiian-style restaurants of yesteryear is Blue Curacao, which is
disconcertingly orange-flavored. You also can finish the meal with
Avalanche Blue Peppermint Schnapps in a visually cool bottle (a
small bottle is just $7, making it a nice visual prop).
</P>
<P>
   As for whisky, consider picking one just for the label. Johnnie
Walker Blue Label, of course, isn't blue. At roughly $180 a bottle,
it's pure gold.

 &HT;    Second full lunar view of month is worth celebrating with
colorful dinner party
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ N ext Wednesday is the last chance for a couple
years to do what seems to have been written in the stars: Have a
Once in a Blue Moon dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   On that day the moon will rise full for the second time in the
month, a celestial event that occurs, as they say _ for obscure
reasons _ only once in a blue moon. Actually, it's the second blue
moon of 1999, but a repeat astrological performance won't occur
again until November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   So conjure up the heavenly possibilities for a dinner menu that
focuses on blue food.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a challenge. Blue is not a popular food color. It
almost always borders on gray.
</P>
<P>
   Blue cheese is the first blue food that comes to mind. That
includes Roquefort, which is more green than blue, but then we all
were told once upon a time that the moon is made of green cheese.
Who told us that _ the man in the moon?
</P>
<P>
   Salad with blue cheese dressing is too obvious. What about steak
with blue cheese sauce, an enviable marriage of flavors? Or, for a
blue-collar get-together, blue-cheese-stuffed burgers, perfect to
pair with a Blue Moon beer.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance it seems a Blue moon dinner can be staged around
seafood. Actually, the only fish that is truly blue when it's
brought to the table is the French truite au bleu. Credit the
startling color to a cooking technique in which the live trout is
killed and immediately poached in a vinegar-spiked broth.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the blue seafood possibilities fizzle like a shooting
star. Bluefin tuna would be perfect but it's seasonally in short
supply and terribly expensive. Chesapeake blue crabs, the finest
for making moon-shaped crab cakes, are buried in the sand now,
though pasteurized crab can be used. Cape bluefish is another
possibility, though a bit gamey for all tastes. It's at its best as
smoked bluefish, served as is or as the main ingredient in a creamy
seafood chowder.
</P>
<P>
   The best seafood entree choice may be the colorful Pacific
moonfish, also sold as Opah and available fresh. Midwest Seafood in
Springboro is the place to check for it.
</P>
<P>
   But don't stop there. Consider the first and last courses of
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Because the blue moon isn't really blue but as golden as any
other full moon, I like the idea of starting dinner with a yellow
pepper soup _ served with blue corn tortilla chips.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, fresh blueberries in a cloud of whipped cream are a
natural choice, but if you're lucky enough to find them, $3.50 for
a half-cup seems prohibitive for anything but a garnish.
</P>
<P>
   You could resort to blueberry cheesecake made with frozen
berries. But I settled on James Beard's Moonshine Cake, a
raisin-and nut-filled item that can be made with bourbon instead of
moonshine. I substituted dried blueberries for the raisins in a
double tribute to the occasion. A few fresh blueberries scattered
on top would be as eye-catching as a comet streaking across the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Guests, I predict, would be positively moonstruck.

 &HT;    Injured Reds arms shadow years of what-could-have-been's
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ The Atlanta Braves know when to hold them and
know when to fold them . . . which is why their rotation remains
Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and some strong-armed guys to
fill out the back of the rotation for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   That's where guys like Charlie Leibrandt, Pete Smith, Kent
Mercker, Steve Avery, Terrell Wade and Denny Neagle fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle is the latest to do his thing in Atlanta and move on . .
. to the Cincinnati Reds, who are patiently waiting to see him
pitch at full-bore against a full complement of major-league
hitters as he slowly builds arm strength from a weak shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The question that concerns the Reds should be: Is Neagle another
Leibrandt, Smith, Mercker, Avery or Wade?
</P>
<P>
   The proof:
</P>
<P>
   In three years with the Braves, Leibrandt was 39-31 with a 3.35
earned run average, then 9-10 (4.55) his next and final season.
</P>
<P>
   In two years with the Braves, Smith was 11-8 (3.28), then 17-23
(5.37) the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   In two years with the Braves, Mercker was 16-12 (3.84), then
23-28 (4.98) the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   In six years with the Braves, Avery was 69-51 (3.67), then 16-14
(5.64) the next two years and is now with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   In two years with the Braves, Wade was 7-3 (.3.87), then was 1-1
(5.06) last year.
</P>
<P>
   What all five had in common was that injuries slowed or stopped
their progress.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's Neagle, who was 38-19 (3.51) and trying to shake a
weak shoulder in time to pitch at least once or twice by April.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle pitched in a 10 a.m. 'B' game against the Minnesota Twins
Tuesday with a dozen major-league scouts and about 10 fans in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody concerned _ Neagle, general manager Jim Bowden,
pitching coach Don Gullett, manager Jack McKeon _ called his
four-inning 58-pitch fine-tuning another step toward game-readiness
after he gave up one run, three hits, walked one and struck out
two.
</P>
<P>
   The run was a home run off a misplaced change-up hit by Terry
Steinbach, one of the few Twins regulars who hauled themselves out
of bed early enough to play.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts clocked Neagle's fastball in the first inning at between
80 and 82 miles an hour, then between 83-84 the rest of the way,
with one pitch at 85.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw better today, much better,'' McKeon said, comparing
it to one simulated game appearance and one minor-league appearance
against a Baltimore Class A team. ``That's the best outing he has
thrown. He extended himself and had more velocity. We're not
concerned about that. He isn't a power pitcher . . . 86 to 88
tops.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who expressed earlier concern that Neagle wasn't cutting
loose and wasn't getting arm extension, watched from the stands
with a slight smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched better as he went on,'' Bowden said. ``He was a
little stiff at first, but got better as he loosened. He's made
great progress. He's not ready, but what I saw is encouraging, a
step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden re-iterated that Neagle most likely would begin the
season on the disabled list, backdated so that he would be eligible
Saturday April 10, if able. That would be the fifth game of the
season, putting him on the back end of the rotation for an
appearance in St. Louis against Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett, though, said Neagle isn't likely to pitch in an 'A'
game, probably a simulated game Sunday, and that will determine the
next step, perhaps a minor-league game on Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time (minor-league game) was mostly to get the kinks
out,'' Neagle said. ``But I'll never know where I am unless I let a
couple go. That's the only true test and I feel good about it
because I did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm was dragging behind on some of my fastballs, but I felt
no sliding or pinching in the shoulder and that was a concern,'' he
said. ``I need more strength in the shoulder, I'm not quite there,
just a hair short and that's why my control is off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I know I can cut it loose on every pitch, then my control
will be there,'' Neagle said. In nearly empty Hammond Stadium,
Neagle shouted expletives four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it is frustrating because I feel like I'm getting
there, but when I don't I know it and drop a cuss-bomb when the
ball is still on the way to the plate, especially on my fastballs

 &HT;    High-end or budget-savvy, Easter table settings are pretty in
pastels
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Martha Stewart wannabes, the table setting is almost as
important as the food.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers, china and stemware set the mood and style of the
occasion _ transforming even the most ordinary dinner into an
unforgettable experience for guests.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to create that party perfect table for Easter, which
is April 4, turn it into a pastel fantasy. Use the pretty shades of
traditionally dyed eggs _ lemon yellow, lavender, pale green and
apricot _ to create a fashionable, tasteful look.
</P>
<P>
   Easter has always been Atlanta interior designer Bill Cook's
favorite holiday. ``It celebrates spring,'' he says. ``And you have
all the wonderful shades of the new season with which to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see rabbits hopping around his table.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to get too thematic with the bunny thing,'' says
Cook. ``I prefer to decorate with the egg, the ancient symbol of
new life. Jelly beans or chocolate eggs are whimsical and witty and
can be used with traditional or contemporary china.''
</P>
<P>
   As a challenge, we asked Cook to set two contemporary Easter
tables _ an inexpensive look and a pricier version. Although we
used everything new for our settings, you might want to include
nostalgic family favorites on your table.
</P>
<P>
   TARGET: ELEGANTLY INEXPENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   For this setting, Cook found sleek plastic dinnerware at Target,
which included oval plates, square platters and oversize latte
cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid of mixing colors,'' he says, as he happily
combined shades of lemon, pale green, apricot and lavender in a
place setting. Clear tumblers, accented with stripes, flowers and
dots in the same colors, carried through the theme, as did the
place mats. Other touches: colorful cloth napkins, look-alike ivory
flatware, jelly beans and a wheat grass centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Cook also chose architect Michael Graves' stainless steel napkin
holder with egg-shaped salt and pepper shakers as well as his
streamlined ice bucket, with oval handles.
</P>
<P>
   COST BREAKDOWN
</P>
<P>
   From Target stores: Soup bowl, $2.69; small bowl, $1.99; oval
salad plate, $2.49; dinner plate, $2.69; large striped or polka-dot
tumbler, $2.69; small tumbler, $2.49; latte cup, $2.49; 12-piece
casual flatware, $9.99; cotton blend napkin, $1.99; plastic place
mat, 99 cents; ice bucket, $29.99; napkin holder with salt and
pepper shakers, $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   From your local florist: Wheat grass (half a flat).
</P>
<P>
   From A&AMP;P Food Market: Russell Stover jelly beans, $2.05 for a
12-ounce bag.
</P>
<P>
   NIEMAN MARCUS: UPSCALE ELEGANCE
</P>
<P>
   To create this sophisticated, contemporary table, Cook picked
earthenware dishes from Neiman Marcus in tones of green _ from mint
to chartreuse. For contrast, he placed the plates and bowls on
silver metallic chargers (oversize base plates). To carry out this
softly hued theme, he added cream-colored linen napkins, ivory
flatware and vases in tones of green and off-white. Other accents:
elegant crystal stemware rimmed in green, rose, blue and yellow;
bamboo orchid plants in earth-tone vases; and yellow beaded
``eggs'' filled with chocolates for each guest's plate.
</P>
<P>
   Cost breakdown
</P>
<P>
   From Neiman Marcus: Fluted bowl, $51; dinner plate, $24; silver
metallic charger, $56; linen napkin, $30; five-piece sterling
silver and ivory flatware, $198; beaded egg with chocolates, $20;
moss-green vase, $25; fluted striped vase, $165.
</P>
<P>
   From 20th Century Antiques, 1044 N. Highland Ave. N.E, Atlanta:
Murano's hand-blown glasses in various shapes, $190 each.
</P>
<P>
   From Forrester's Flowers, 2070 Cheshire Bridge Road N.E,
Atlanta: bamboo orchid plants, $39.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   EYE-CATCHING EASTER IDEAS
</P>
<P>
   Interior designer Bill Cook suggests the following tips for
setting that perfect table:
</P>
<P>
   -- Touch of whimsy: Have fun and do the unexpected. For example,
throw jelly beans on your table. Remember, this isn't a state
dinner!
</P>
<P>
   -- Eclectic elegance: Be diverse in your choice of tableware and
flatware. Combine the earthy with the elegant: metal with wood;
sterling silver with rock crystal; plastic with steel; ceramic with
fine crystal.
</P>
<P>
   -- Floral focus: Flowers are always an important focus, adding
color and texture. Instead of an overblown, contrived arrangement,
go for the sleek and pared-down look. Use one or two orchid plants.
Or put a single gerber daisy in a vase at each place setting.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uncovering all bases: Don't be afraid to not use a
tablecloth. Show off stone, wood and glass tables by using place
mats, or use nothing. Let your charger (an oversize plate) act as a
base.
</P>
<P>
   -- Collected memories: Use your collections as part of the table
decoration. Limoges boxes, papier-mache or decorated Faberge eggs
are beautiful and lend your individual style to the table.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hard-boiled beauties: A basket of dyed eggs makes an easy
centerpiece for an exquisite Easter dinner table.

 &HT;    For designer McFadden, all the world's an atelier
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some people you just can't see curling
up with a bowl of Froot Loops. Mary McFadden is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   McFadden is a debutante, a Sufi dervish, a former Palm Beacher,
a world traveler, a multiple divorcee, a collector of Buddhist art,
a size 2, a New York ``living landmark,'' a speaker of French and a
little Zulu, a two-hour-a-day tennis player and, incredibly, a
pitchman on the QVC shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   (She also designs clothes.)
</P>
<P>
   McFadden has visited nearly every country in the world except
Rwanda, Uganda, Senegal, Mauritania, Chile, Argentina and the
Guyanas. She took time to chat after a recent fashion show in Boca
Raton, but soon she'll be off to Russia, Venice and Yemen, which
will be the inspiration for her next collection of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   (Has she been to Yemen before? ``No,'' she says coolly, ``but I
know what I'm going to find there.'')
</P>
<P>
   McFadden travels with a bag of clothes, a bag of books, a clutch
of cameras and sometimes a male companion or two, and her recent
road trip through Mongolia for her current collection was tough
because, as anyone knows, once outside Ulan Bator the roads just
peter out.
</P>
<P>
   (Wherever she is, she can usually be reached by fax.)
</P>
<P>
   McFadden lived in Palm Beach for 13 years but left in 1983 when
her companion died, so she went back to New York and found other
companions, including a 23-year-old college student who she married
then dumped in a much-publicized divorce that included an
appearance on Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   (She is something like 60 years old but says simply, ``I've
forgotten,'' and walks off to examine wrinkles in a dress.)
</P>
<P>
   McFadden controls everything, from her plucked hairline to the
sets on her QVC show _ ``I had one that looked like a souk in
Morocco'' _ and says she spent four days just making the soundtrack
to the Boca fashion show because Mongolian music sounds ``too
Chinese,'' so she used Russian music instead.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes she's showing have been inspired by the 13th and
14th century Mongolian period in which Genghis Khan merged the
Byzantine, Iranian and Chinese cultures, and if you want to know
more just look at the two pages of notes from her recent New York
show, which read like a history lecture complete with dates.
</P>
<P>
   (She is wearing a tunic from her Central Java collection.)
</P>
<P>
   McFadden, says publicity director Laura Moffatt, is working on a
book about her travels.
</P>
<P>
   (Moffatt also says McFadden has one daughter, goes to at least
three parties a night and once, perhaps, was spotted wearing
jeans.)
</P>
<P>
   McFadden has been in business 26 years, and while her clients
sometimes beg her to design more cocktail-type styles she is quite
comfortable cooking up exotic looks from exotic lands, which is how
most of her dresses are created.
</P>
<P>
   (The rest, she says before disappearing again, ``are
fantasies.'')

<P>
   MANALAPAN, Fla. _ Frank McKinney insists he's not a gambler,
just a developer in tune with what the mega-wealthy want.
</P>
<P>
   The $12 million castle he built in Delray Beach, Fla. three
years ago was one of the country's most expensive houses built
without a buyer lined up. Now, McKinney is set to build his fourth
house so-called spec house: Priced at $39 million, it could be the
most expensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With a glass-domed rotunda big enough to seat 150 for dinner, a
game room as big as the average house and a 5,000-square-foot
master bedroom suite, McKinney says this is no wild dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business decision. I think God gave me a gift to
determine what these people want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A $12 million spec house is one thing _ but $39 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did the first $2 million spec house, people leaned
over and said, 'Are you crazy?' Then we did a $6 million spec, and
then a $12 million spec,'' said the 35-year-old developer, who paid
$9,000 for his first fixer-upper in 1986. But at $39 million, he
said, ``I admit I exercised my risk threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, McKinney and investor Thomas Melone paid $17
million for 8.66 acres along the ocean in Manalapan, about 20
minutes south of the heart of Palm Beach. It's the highest price
ever paid for a property in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The most ever paid for a house in Manalapan is $8 million. The
Palm Beach mark is $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The developers have advertised the entire parcel for sale, for
$28.7 million ($35,000 an oceanfront foot), as McKinney plodded
through a cumbersome permit process with plans for his
61,318-square-foot manse on the north 4.5 acres of the property.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a chance a buyer could snap up the entire parcel _
a perimeter wall has gone up and pilings are ready to go in. But
the foundation hasn't been poured. Or someone could buy during the
24 months McKinney estimates it will take to build the 11-bedroom,
21-bath house and make changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if we got all the way through
(construction) without a buyer,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because this house, he says, fills a void in that very
narrow upper end of the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventory is king,'' McKinney said. ``There is nothing
available right now that's new, that's nice, that's on the direct
oceanfront. Most every property that is respectable as far as curb
appeal and floor plan is under contract or sold.'' Besides the lack
of inventory, McKinney says he learned from his other spec houses,
each of which was bigger than the one before. The 1,000-square-foot
game room in the $12 million La Marceaux (''The Sea Towers''), for
example, just wasn't big enough. This time, the game room will be
2,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you there will be a guy who will say, 'This could
be a little bigger,' '' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned the mega-wealthy usually have auto collections
they like to show off, which is why plans call for a 10-car
``showcase'' garage with broken brick, groin vault ceiling, stone
floor and high-tech spotlights ``that will make the chrome pop
right off the cars' bumpers,'' he said. There's also a six-car
``utilitarian'' garage.
</P>
<P>
   Bedrooms are bigger, too, thanks to comments from real estate
brokers, including Clark French, who is marketing the house. In the
children's wing, bedrooms are 18 by 18 feet, and each has its own
bath. There also are two playrooms and a nanny's day room.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the house, in the 5,000-square-foot master
bedroom suite, ``her'' closet is a humongous 17 by 26 feet.
``Finally, we might get one big enough,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the plans _ a 30-by-24-foot movie theater with popcorn
stand and ticket booth, 1,440-square-foot gym, 8- to 12-foot-wide
hallways suitable for art collections, and a 24-by-37-foot family
room opening onto a grotto swimming pool with summer kitchen, and a
two-bedroom, two-bath guest house with its own kitchen and living
room.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney and his wife, Nilsa, plan to furnish four of the rooms:
the grand rotunda, game room, theater and master bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   About the only things the house doesn't have are a name and,
more important, a Palm Beach address.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in Palm Beach?'' asked luxury real estate broker
Arthur Zeckendorf, co-chairman of Brown Harris Stevens in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manalapan _ isn't that were the National Enquirerguy lives?''
asked Barbara Richey, a luxury broker at Allan M. Schneider in New
York's East Hampton. Yes, he did. And Gene Pope's widow, Lois Pope,
has her 30,000-square-foot Manalapan mansion on the market for $18
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $39 million, I would want to have the best address,'' said
Greenwich real estate broker David Ogilvy.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, ocean-to-lake estates in Palm Beach are rare _ even
rarer if you don't want a road between your house and the ocean. Of
the 30 or so direct oceanfront properties in Manalapan, three are
owned by multimillionaires or billionaires on the Forbes 400 list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Manalapan is the next 'best' address,'' Ogilvy said. But
for now, he said, the high price tag and out-of-Palm Beach address
is a double gamble for McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want it to be Gucci or Louis Vuitton _ not almost Gucci or
almost Louis Vuitton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by high-end brokers in luxury markets
throughout the country, all of whom said they couldn't think of a
spec house anywhere near $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's so far out of the norm that I can't give you any
logical thinking (on why he would build such an expensive spec)
unless he has somebody in mind for it,'' said Aspen real estate
broker Sandye Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $39 million spec caters to a very narrow market,'' said Palm
Beach County builder Skip Gozzo, who has a spec house in Aspen,
priced just shy of $11 million, furnished. In Telluride, a hot
Colorado ski area, an $11.995 million spec house attracted three
sales contracts at one time. ``It sold for asking price,'' Gozzo
said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a $15 million spec house in the foothills of Beverly
Hills, Calif., where a tear-down sold for $25 million last year,
said Beverly Hills real estate broker Jeff Hyland. But $39 million?
``It's mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney is prepared for such comments. After all, his property
is between the $350-and-up-a-night Ritz Carlton and shopping center
magnate Mel Simon's 40,000-square-foot estate that briefly was on
the market for $35 million. Down the road a bit farther,
billionaire William Ziff is replacing his old house with a
47,000-square-foot manse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet if you took a per capita net worth of Manalapan versus
Palm Beach, Manalapan would beat Palm Beach hands down,'' McKinney
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census doesn't track net worth. But according to the
1990 count, Manalapan was richer in annual income for each
resident: $115,874 for 320 people, compared to Palm Beach's $71,106
for 9,814 people.
</P>
<P>
   Manalapan is ripe for such a new house, McKinney said. Not only
is his large, ocean-to-Intracoastal property a prime spot, but the
town has a more tolerant attitude toward ''big'' than Delray Beach,
Ocean Ridge and Gulf Stream to the south. Palm Beach just doesn't
have available land, and the town doesn't take kindly to demolition
of old estates.
</P>
<P>
   So who can afford a $39 million house?
</P>
<P>
   Definitely those on the Forbes 400 list, and even the Forbes
800, if there were such a list, said Ogilvy of Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people spend $15 million on yachts, $30 million on a
Gulfstream V jet and have a net worth sufficient enough to spend
$35 million to $40 million on a house that has direct oceanfront
and (consider) the appreciation that oceanfront property has,''
it's really not much of a stretch, said French of J.C. DeNiro Real
Estate in Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, he said, is to search for land and, if it can
be found, spend three years to build. ``What's he going to say to
his wife, 'Let's save $5 million to $10 million and build it
ourselves?' It's so unique it can't be duplicated.''

 &HT;    Cruise the world for $100 a day
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A cruise to seven continents, 27
countries, 34 ports.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Duthie of Delray Beach, Fla. is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to do it!'' she exclaims. ``Just the idea of seeing how
large the world is!''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Tony, a retired engineer for Siemens, is going.
``When I was a schoolboy in England, I had a job at a shipping
company. The names of the boats _ oh, did they conjure up visions
in your imagination!''
</P>
<P>
   Hellen and Donald Nicol of North Palm Beach are going. Unlike
the Duthies, whose longest cruise has been one week, the Nicols
have been on six round-the-world cruises.
</P>
<P>
   And 60, and counting, other people from Palm Beach County are
going, too. They'll leave Athens, Greece, Nov. 20, 1999, on the
small Ocean Explorer I and return to Athens March 25, 2000. Along
the way, they will celebrate the millennium in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The things they want to see are as small as the penguins in the
South Shetland Islands near Antarctica (Sheila Duthie's dream) and
as big as the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm keen on astronomy and want to see the stars in the
Southern Hemisphere,'' says Tony Duthie, who will celebrate his
65th birthday on the cruise. ``It's so strange to look up and see
stars you don't recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the ship itself. The Duthies and Nicols chose
The World Cruise Company's Ocean Explorer I because of its size
(only 820 passengers) and its destinations (exotic ports too small
for the mega-cruise liners).
</P>
<P>
   And they liked the idea of the 35 faculty members who will stay
on the ship the entire journey. A West End theater director will
give acting lessons and produce a play on board with the
passengers. Other teachers include naturalists, historians and
ornithologists. Passengers can go to art and language classes.
</P>
<P>
   Guest lecturers will include author and actor George Plimpton,
who will give a course on creative writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a Victorian approach,'' says Sam Blyth, chairman
of The World Cruise Company. ``This cruise is more enriching. There
are no dancing girls, no bingo, no daiquiries with umbrellas.''
</P>
<P>
   And by traveling by ship, he adds, there's no jet lag. ``You
arrive ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Blyth flew to West Palm Beach recently from the company's
headquarters in Toronto because of the enormous interest here in
world cruises. The company offers three world cruises a year on two
ships and many of those passengers are from Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Several local passengers, he said, have booked for a year _
three world cruises back to back.
</P>
<P>
   The fares are rock-bottom by cruise standards, starting at about
$100 a day. It would be hard to duplicate that deal on land
considering that the price includes all meals and housekeeping. And
the two ships have single cabins so there are no single
supplements, a penalty for traveling by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the passengers have sold condominiums to take the
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement about the places they'll see is kindled by all sorts
of memories _ a picture seen in a book, a story heard long ago,
something that made a child daydream and an adult sitting behind a
desk fantasize.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Duthie, 62, wants to see Sri Lanka. ``I knew someone who
said it was absolutely beautiful. You remember these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is eager to see Ceylon _ the old name of Sri Lanka _
too. ``When I was a youngster in World War II, we would get
quarter-pound packages of tea from Ceylon. I remember a picture of
a female tea picker on the package.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope there will be female tea pickers in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Hellen and Donald Nicol are eager to add to their incredible
experiences on previous round-the world cruises. ``I never saw such
sunsets as those in Borneo _ flaming red,'' says Donald. ``And in
the Straits of Sumatra during a bad thunderstorm, we saw fantastic
lights, phosphorescence, on the crests of waves.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were first married, the Nicols lived in New York City
on 54th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues. At least once a
week, they walked to the docks and watched the ships come in and
dreamed about taking those ships some day.
</P>
<P>
   When Donald retired at age 49 after working as a financial
adviser and CPA _ a job that was ``boring as hell,'' he says _ they
traveled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, they took their first round-the-world ``cruise.'' A
freighter took a few passengers _ in addition to a lot of shrimp _
to Japan, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Hellen got seasick in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freighter was practically standing on end,'' says her
husband. ``There were 6 inches of water in our cabin.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellen vowed never to take a cruise again. And here she is ready
to go around the world once again.
</P>
<P>
   The average age on the ship is 61, says Blyth, which means most
passengers are retirees. But there are also families, who believe a
round-the world cruise is a good education.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila worked in a library in Chicago and is excited about the
computers on board, and the huge library, which has a librarian.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her husband is looking forward to dancing the nights
away.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila doesn't know how to dance. Now she'll have plenty of
time, and the opportunity, to learn.

   WALKER-COLUMN _ LONGVIEW, Tex. _ A seventh-grade homework
assignment has provided some surprising insight: For a glimpse of
your kid's future, look at his past. As I helped my son, Joaquin,
illustrate his family tree for a lesson, I enjoyed pointing to
different branches of that tree occupied by the ancestors for whom
he is named. The youngest of our children, he was blessed with
three given names, although he sometimes claims it is a burden.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ For some reason I have a hard
time keeping up with who is killing whom over what in the Balkans.
(Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald). MOVED TUESDAY.

<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ After nearly 17 years of
writing a column, the one thing I've learned is that you never know
what is going to set people off. I have written pieces that I was
sure would bring in loads of nasty mail and gotten nary a word. I
have written other columns that seemed utterly innocuous, only to
discover that I have somehow pushed someone's hot button. Still,
it's good to hear from the customers even if they're not exactly
calling to bestow laurels upon you. (Borders, Lufkin Daily News)

<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Now, here's a sour note regarding

Band Capital of the World? (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman)

<P>
   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Recently, we
celebrate the 40th anniversary of Las Novias Society in Palm Beach
County. Young and sassy, the 12 women who started the club in 1959,
thought ``The Sweethearts'' in Spanish translation an appropriate
self-description with sufficient panache to distinguish them from
the many other local women's groups in our community. (Jefferson,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Last Sunday's KKK rally at the
Kettering Civic Center resembled nothing so much as an open-air
Jerry Springer Show, with choreographed fistfights and dueling
profanities (none of them bleeped). The few residents who turned up
for peaceful protest were appalled, not only by the hateful
spewings of the Knights of the White Kamellia, but also by the
crude, combative behavior of the counter-demonstrators. (McCarty,
Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

<P>
   KATY, Texas _ Yee-haw.
</P>
<P>
   The harnessed animal crosses the parking lot at a furious clip,
but the woman holding the reins is having too much fun to be
scared. She's whooping and hollering and carrying on.
</P>
<P>
   This is horse country, and the action is taking place next to
the rodeo arena in Katy.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not horses.
</P>
<P>
   These are llamas.
</P>
<P>
   The folks gathered in this Houston-area city are learning to
drive carts, an increasingly popular way to use llamas. Carting, as
it's called, is also a major component of llama show competition.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to learn brought out about 30 llama owners
recently who paid $100 for every llama they brought to be trained.
</P>
<P>
   None of these people had ever carted. Neither had the llamas.
But that's no problem _ for the llama. This is one smart animal,
and it picks up its cues in a matter of minutes, not hours or days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't train a horse in an hour to pull a cart,'' says
Wade Thomas, a llama owner and trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their curiosity makes them very easy to train,'' says Lee
Lawrence, a trainer and cart builder.
</P>
<P>
   Native to the high-altitude reaches of Chile, Bolivia and Peru,
llamas have for centuries been used as pack animals. Weighing
between 225 and 350 pounds, they can carry a third of their body
weight.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the camel family, when domesticated they are
low-maintenance, requiring little water and only hay and grains for
food. Three or four can be raised on an acre.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States _ where Texas has the fourth-largest llama
population _ they are used as guard animals for livestock. Highly
sensitive to their surroundings and stressed by change, they have
been known to chase and kick to death coyotes. They also emit a
noise that acts as a bark from a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Their wool is used in sweaters. And they've even been employed
on the golf course as caddies.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say whether llamas know the difference between a
3-wood and a 5-iron.
</P>
<P>
   But they have a way of knowing things, says Lisa Rice of Rockin'
R Llamas in Katy, who sponsored the cart-driving sessions. She says
a llama at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo this year
instinctively put its head in the lap of a girl in a wheelchair so
she could pet it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are old souls that are here to teach you something.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now they are learning to pull carts, first in threes, then
in pairs and finally, solo.
</P>
<P>
   The carts can be adjusted for the number of llamas. The ones
here are built specifically for llamas and designed for off-road
use by Lee Lawrence of Montgomery, Ala., a financial planner who
runs about 80 head of llamas as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horse shaft (on the cart) is about 18 inches shorter,''
Lawrence points out. ``A horse runs under himself; a llama runs
with his legs out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Lawrence will backpack for several days in the
woods, using a llama-pulled cart. ``I put my tent and sleeping bag
under (the seat) and go just like I would on a trail ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use a lot of state parks; we use a lot of fire roads.''
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary conservationist, Lawrence is certified to use his
llamas and carts to ferry firefighting equipment into the
wilderness inaccessible by any other means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately we haven't had to do that, but we're prepared
to,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's carts, sold throughout the country, go for $1,100 and
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carting with the llamas is sort of a new enterprise,'' he
says. ``A lot of people started with the pony/cart relationship.
We're just now evolving to where we're making specific equipment
for llamas and conducting these kind of clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``tack'' _ a collar, back pad, ring guides, breeching _ is
also specifically designed, though it is similar to what you would
find on a horse, Lawrence says.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the arena, two llamas are harnessed into the cart, and
the beginning drivers get their instructions. ``See, the longest
one goes on the inside, the shortest (rein) goes on the outside,''
says one. ``Did you turn the hook part out?''
</P>
<P>
   But as Ruth Jordan awaits in the seat, one of the llamas rolls
on its back and appears trapped in the rigging.
</P>
<P>
   Several people rush over and help it up; crisis averted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When two of them start jumping, it's kind of scary,'' Rice
says. ``If that was a horse, we'd have some broken things. Heaven
only knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. Though llamas are quick learners and
respond to their owners, they are not used to having someone behind
them giving commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing here is totally different,'' says Rice.
``What we're saying is, `OK, llama I want you out in front of me,
going forward.' So they've got to figure out, where's my person?
And that it's OK out there going, responding to the commands you're
giving from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Those commands consist of ``walk on,'' ``walk right'' or ``walk
left.'' ``Gee'' and ``haw,'' traditional mule commands, can
substitute for the latter two.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the training method used this day is with a new, accelerated
technique, Rice explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``New things stress llamas. We're putting everything on it right
now, get it over with in 10 minutes; they will have worked through
the stress and come out the other side. It's working pretty well.
They're already so much more calmer than before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good, because a llama is capable of 40 mph over a short
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walk on,'' the driver implores. ``Walk left, walk on, Stormy,
good boys. Walk right, gee, walk on, trot, Stormy, trot.''
</P>

 &HT;    Mini CD reviews

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The balance achieved by this promising Atlanta combo on its
debut album is between icy-cool trip-hop rhythms and the warm,
seductive vocals of frontwoman Pam Howe. Like an old-school torch
singer on a tour of phat-ville, Howe, formerly with the jazz outfit
Cicada Sings, coos over a continuous slow-burn groove peppered with
samples and raps. Such lovely, languid tracks as ``C'est Noire''
and ``Soothing'' suggest Portishead on Prozac. Formed two years
ago, ph balance hasn't completely worked out the kinks. Howe's
relaxed delivery occasionally lapses into listlessness, and rapper
Captain Mudfish Starbolt lets a few rhymes get away from him. But
the band's inventive sound is refreshing. And it won't dry your
skin.

   Idahoan Doug Martsch and his bandmates take a concept as
moribund as the power trio, give it a swift kick and create
remarkably fresh-sounding music. Without resorting to
self-indulgent soloing and guitar-hero posturing, Martsch draws
striking melodic figures and wrings expressionistic riffs from his
six-string. The rhythm section of bassist Brett Nelson and drummer
Scott Plouf is capable of explosive power and delicate grace. The
songs on this major-label debut are generally shorter than on
previous independent-label releases, which only consolidates their
strength. ``Keep It Like a Secret'' is a tightly wound powerhouse
and the best chills-up-the-spine guitar record since Radiohead's
``O.K. Computer.''

   ``East Points Greatest Hit'' man is really the go-to guy for
hooks. That's Cool Breeze's specialty. He's the confident rapper
who came up with hip-hop's new name for this region, ``The Dirty
South.'' And though he follows guest vocal appearances by Outkast,
Goodie Mob and Witchdoctor on his recent No. 1 single, ``Watch for
the Hook,'' his chorus stands out: ``The C stands for Cool Breeze
who's known as the champ. Freddie Calhoun, the coolest cutter at
camp. My ones and my twos got your whole town shook. You better
listen to your corner and watch for the hook.'' On ``Good Good''
the hook's repeated, on ``We Get It Crunk'' it becomes a party
chant, and throughout this debut it's the hook_ and the nearly
sample-free production _ that strengthens the sometimes tiring
boasts that surround it.

 &HT;    Wilson-Davis a beautiful match
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not an easy concept to wrangle, even for an artist thoroughly
committed to revamping genre definitions to suit her own style,
Cassandra Wilson's latest project is at once seductive and a little
frustrating. The vocalist, who seamlessly traverses folk, pop and
jazz formats because she understands how fundamentally they can
interlock, finds a kindred soul in Miles Davis: the iconographic,
iconoclastic jazz trumpeter who was among American music's great
conceptualists, and a master of soulful cool who knew the gestural
power of a single, sustained note.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson enlists an all-star cast of musicians (including
guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist Dave Holland, cornetist Olu Dara and
members of her working band) for adaptations of seven pieces
composed or associated with Davis _ often her own lyrics _ plus
several originals. The music is always beautiful, especially when
it features an organic mesh of attentively arranged string
instruments _ acoustic bass, violin, mandocello, classical guitar
and so forth _ which offers a perfect balance to Wilson's
characteristically smoky voice. When the written material rises to
the challenge the singer has set for herself _ to claim the
feminine attributes of Davis' legacy _ it's quite exciting. The
opening (and closing) ``Run the Voodoo Down'' employs Wilson's
beloved blues lore in a canny manner, with an implicit nod toward
the Muddy Waters staple ``Mannish Boy.'' And on complete originals,
such as ``Right Here, Right Now,'' Wilson continues to combine
complex adult emotions with breezy, sophisticated folk-pop: her
great strength as a crossover artist.
</P>
<P>
   What's problematic is how much of ``Traveling Miles'' succumbs
to mood-making. It's exquisite mood-making, by the way, but falls
short of the major potential that makes the concept so appealing.

<P>
   &QR;  ``Mighty Joe Young'' (PG) _ Sure, the mix of
computer-generated effects and animatronic magic really can make
you believe in the mammoth gorilla of the title. But special FX
can't save this lame, noisy remake, which stars Bill Paxton as a
zoologist, Charlize Theron as big Joe's protector and a lot of cars
crashing as the big lug relocates from Africa to Los Angeles.
Priced to buy: VHS, $24.99; DVD, $29.99. Grade: C -

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Firelight'' (R) _ This Gothic romantic drama set in the
1830s could use a little more fire and a lot lighter touch. Still,
it burns with intelligence, craft and pyschological resonance. A
Swiss governess (Sophie Marceau) agrees to bear a child for an
aloof English aristocrat (Stephen Dillane), then disappear from his
life. But their ``business'' arrangement is complicated by feelings
both romantic and maternal. Grade: B

 &HT;    A look at some Oscar winners' earlier films
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 71st Academy Awards are history and it's all over, even the
shouting (though it's a good possibility Roberto Benigni is still
shouting somewhere).
</P>
<P>
   But maybe you'd like to know a little more about the winners and
their work. Here are a few rental suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Judi Dench (best supporting actress for ``Shakespeare in
Love'').
</P>
<P>
   You probably saw her as another legendary British monarch _
Queen Victoria _ in 1997's ``Mrs. Brown,'' for which she was also
Oscar-nominated. But you may not remember her in 1986's ``A Room
With a View'' in which she gave yet another canny cameo
performance. A sunny, impish adaptation of E.M. Forster's 1908
novel, the movie is a high comedy of manners from the James
Ivory/Ismail Merchant team.
</P>
<P>
   The cast _ many of them then fairly unknown _ is pure class.
Helen Bonham Carter plays our heroine who must choose between a
priggish Daniel Day-Lewis and a Byronesque Julian Sand. Maggie
Smith is a fluttery spinster, Denholm Elliott plays a guileless
good heart with a penchant for skinny-dipping and Dench steals
scenes as a pushy popular romance novelist.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  James Coburn (best supporting actor for ``Affliction'').
</P>
<P>
   The white-haired fat cat who accepted an Oscar on Sunday hardly
resembles the lean 'n' hungry kid who started his Hollywood career
four decades ago. But one thing remains unchanged: that
unmistakable Coburn Cheshire Cat grin.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn became wildly popular in the mid-'60s thanks to kicky
``mod''-ish spoofs like ``The President's Analyst'' and ``Our Man
Flint.'' But it's his early work with director John Sturges that
has always intrigued me.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Great Escape,'' Coburn is a lanky Australian POW (his
accent comes and goes) with a laid-back anti-authoritarian manner.
In ``The Magnificent Seven,'' he holds his own among such
up-and-comers as Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson, playing the
fastest knife in the West. That's right. Knife.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Roberto Benigni (best actor for ``Life Is Beautiful'').
</P>
<P>
   You've already seen some of his best work on the various awards
shows. He does pretty much the same thing in all his movies _
wide-eyed over-the-top exuberance that makes a Lab puppy look
restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son of the Pink Panther,'' an attempt to revive the old Peter
Sellers series, sank like a stone in 1993. However, the more
independent-minded American movie lover has known about Benigni
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Jim Jarmusch introduced him in ``Down by Law.'' A
kind of blackened ``Stranger in Paradise'' _ the setting is New
Orleans _ the film relies on the same three-character counterpoint
and East Village deadpan that made ``Paradise'' a hit. John Lurie
and Tom Waits are two deadbeats who end up sharing a cell with
Benigni (he's like a live-action Topo Gigio). He suggests they
escape, ``just like they do in American movies.'' The picture also
features the actor's wife, Nicoletta Braschi; she's still
co-starring with him a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gwyneth Paltrow (best actress for ``Shakespeare in Love'').
</P>
<P>
   She's usually associated with another period piece _ ``Emma.''
But if you'd like to see her in something completely different,
check out ``Flesh and Bone.''
</P>
<P>
   A thoughtful, sometimes slow-paced blood-will-tell parable, the
movie's ostensible stars are Dennis Quaid as a guy who repairs
vending machines in small Texas towns; Meg Ryan as a woman fleeing
a bad marriage; and James Caan as Quaid's dad, a grifter with a
vicious streak. But the performance that stays with you is Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   She plays Caan's girlfriend, a sloe-eyed con artist in cutoffs
whose favorite scam is to pose as a mourner and steal the rings off
corpses' fingers. Not exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from
the woman who would become Shakespeare's muse, but just what you'd
expect from a multifaceted actress.

 &HT;    `Pleasantville' a colorful twist on 1950s conformity
 &HT;    By Steve Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Two '90s kids (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are zapped
into a '50s sitcom and slowly bring sex, color and rock 'n' roll to
the black-and-white world. (The movie's lustrous mix of monochrome
and color is a marvel of digital wizardry.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie gets preachy in its second half, as writer-director
Gary Ross stretches out an obvious metaphor about the townfolks'
fear of the ``coloreds.'' But the performances are terrific,
especially by Joan Allen as the kids' new TV mom and William H.
Macy as the Ozzie-like dad who can't even comprehend the
possibility that dinner won't be waiting for him when he gets home
from work. Grade: B

TEN YEARS LATER: DEBATE ON DISABILITY CONTINUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Millions of Americans today can get their wheelchairs
into voting booths, take their guide dogs into restaurants or see a
play in sign language, all thanks to a Bush administration law that
protects the disabled against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But wheelchair users and the blind and deaf probably never
figured the government would lump them and their needs with the
problems of alcoholics, people who are obese and people infected
with HIV. In the past decade, however, that is what has happened as
the disabled and the courts have tried to interpret a sweeping
piece of civil rights legislation known as the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits have flourished as plaintiffs ranging from asthmatics
to victims of carpal tunnel syndrome have claimed relief under its
protections. In the process, the nation is undergoing a debate
about the very definition of disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always people who try to take advantage of the
law,'' said Jennifer Sheehy, a spokeswoman for the National
Organization on Disability. ``Any civil rights law is going to have
growing pains. I think that's where we're feeling some of the
growing pains, in defining disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the Americans With Disabilities Act, which extends
equal access to employment, government services and public
accommodations to the disabled _ will reach its 10-year
anniversary. Most say that the legislation has come a long way in
addressing discrimination against people with disabilities. At the
same time, it has sparked a debate over what the law means by a
physical or mental condition that ``substantially limits one or
more major life activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the battle lines are being drawn,'' according to
Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner Paul Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The government itself is assessing the law's effectiveness. The
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, in a report issued in October,
faulted the nation's courts for often applying the law too
narrowly. ``Many federal judges appear either to misunderstand the
ADA or be hostile to it,'' the report says. And the report said
that negative publicity about the American With Disabilities Act
has overblown the law's potential for frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negative publicity focused on a handful of cases _
including that of an alcoholic executive who sued his company for
disability-related discrimination when he was fired, and a
California woman who alleged she was wrongly fired for body odor.
But regulators say those are rare examples and that more typical
cases involve employers who fire people with HIV or hotels that
refuse to make their facilities wheelchair accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few cases that are frivolous,'' according to
Liz Savage, a lawyer in the civil rights division of the Justice
Department. ``The whole purpose of the ADA is to eliminate
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one of the framers of the law, former White House
counsel C. Boyden Gray, said the law has resulted in excessive
litigation. In retrospect, he believes the Bush administration
should have monitored the issue of coverage more closely from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's been one of the most serious failings of the
act,'' said Gray, also criticizing the Clinton administration for
not taking a more active role in the monitoring of frivolous cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the law itself has been a boom for trial
lawyers,'' said Pat Cleary, vice president for human resource
policy at the National Manufacturers Association. The EEOC cited a
38 percent increase in cases it received in the first year after
the law's passage. At the Justice Department, more than 10,000
complaints were filed between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that the definitions should be tighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we proposed the first draft, we wanted it to be broad,''
said Andrew J. Imparato, a lawyer with the National Council on
Disability.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups are fighting for more specific definitions to
protect themselves from employees who claim legal benefits due to a
wide range of health conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk of someone who is not legitimately disabled pulling a
fast one over the employees increases'' because of the American
With Disabilities Act, said Mary Leon, a spokeswoman for the
National Federation of Independent Businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eide, a lawyer with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said
that small businesses can be particularly hurt by lawsuits, with
the cost of dismissal some $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments cause advocates for the disabled to worry that
the business community is using the confusion over definitions of
disability to gut the legislation that has cost them millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they wouldn't hire us,'' said Freida Zames, president
of Disabled in Action. ``Now they don't want to hire us because
they say they can't get rid of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many point out that litigation could be avoided if
businesses would simply accommodate a person with a disability
instead of going to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single business has gone under because of the ADA,''
said EEOC Commissioner Miller, who was also recently appointed to
President Clinton's new National Task Force on Employment of People
With Disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for people with disabilities say the average cost of
accommodations are approximately $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately our hope is we get beyond the issue of whether or
not they have a disability,'' Imparato said. ``Any attempt to
narrow the definition will leave people out who are truly being
discriminated against.''

SOME CHURCHES HAVE COMPUTERS IN THE BELFRY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many church-goers at houses of worship in New York
and across the country think they are hearing the soft ringing of
old bells, when what they are really hearing is a computer. Yes,
even the church bell is going digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no moving parts but the exact same sound,'' said Paul
Kozlak, a contract salesman for Schulmerich, a bell manufacturing
company based in Sellersville, Pa., some 40 miles northwest of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The digital bells ``reproduce the sound of carillon bells
exactly,'' Kozlak said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the world's largest gothic
cathedral, has used the Schulmerich mechanical bells since the
1970s while its bell towers are under construction. But for many
small churches in New York, it comes down to money. If they did not
have the Schulmerich, they wouldn't have any bells at all.
</P>
<P>
   A full 20-bell set of carillon bells can cost as much as
$500,000, said Don Lundquist, an administrator at St. John the
Divine here. The digital Schulmerich carillon costs $8,000. And the
mechanical system sells for a mere $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most new churches can't afford real bells,'' said Trudy Faber,
professor and chairman of the music department at Wittenberg
University in Springfield, Ohio. ``We have a Schulmerich at my
church _ it rings three times a day and people can't tell the
difference from the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ancient times, bells have been a spiritually and
historically important part of religion and society the world over.
The first known bells date to the 11th century B.C., when the
Chinese designed large barrel brass bells with ornate designs. In
this digital age, you might think this old musical art form would
be fading like a lonely chime into the night. But Faber says the
1,000-year-old tradition is still meaningful to many.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new technology hasn't pushed out the old,'' Faber said.
``The use of electronic bells is not really expanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what the people at Schulmerich and their
competitors are banking on. After years of engineering, Schulmerich
developed True-Cast bells, a new digital system that delivers an
even more exact replication of real bells than its earlier
mechanical system. It can imitate the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia
or Big Ben in London. And there are more high-tech gizmos. With the
radio remote control, an operator can tinker with the sound from
hundreds of feet away. And its repertory is enormous: the largest
library of carillon music in the world with more than 2,000
selections.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanical Schulmerich resembles a giant standing xylophone.
Sound is produced when a hammer strikes 12 steel rods and then is
amplified throughout the cathedral by a speaker system.
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is: Are the parishioners fooled?
</P>
<P>
   ``For most services people are, even though ours aren't
state-of-the-art,'' Lundquist said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are still people who ring bells the
old-fashioned way, with ropes. The centuries-old method of ``change
ringing,'' is still widely used in England. Ringers are specially
trained to pull the ropes at a designated time. They have to be
strong enough to pull bells weighing thousands of pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The sound? Well, Faber says the old carillon bells like those at
Exeter Cathedral in England emit an incredibly full sound _ as if
coming from the heavens. As she recalls from one recent visit:
``Outside, you couldn't tell where they were coming from.''

MINORITIES FUME OVER NOXIOUS BUSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The warning signs are posted along Harlem's busy
streets: ``If you live Uptown, breathe at your own risk. Diesel bus
fumes can kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Often hidden by the same thick, dark clouds of bus exhaust they
warn against, the signs are paid for by West Harlem Environmental
Action (WEACT), a neighborhood organization that says the diesel
bus fumes pose severe health hazards to Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities in northern Manhattan are not just in danger of drugs
and the gun violence found too often on inner-city streets, said
Cleon Edwards, a WEACT spokesman. They also are subjected to unsafe
air, thanks to the Metropolitan Transit Authority, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The transit authority runs more than 3,500 buses daily from 19
depots in all five New York boroughs. Manhattan is home to eight
depots; seven of them are situated above 96th Street, where a
majority of residents are black and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these depots are across the street from schools and
large housing developments,'' Edwards said. ``The fumes are seeping
into the air, increasing our chances of being diagnosed with
asthma, lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis and heart attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   According to reports published by the New York City
Environmental Justice Department, the highest levels of air
pollution in the city are in areas near four transit authority bus
depots: the Manhattanville Depot, at 133rd Street; the Amsterdam
Avenue Depot, at 129th Street; the 126th Street Depot, at Second
Avenue; and the Mother Clara Hale Depot, at 147th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``These areas are where many of the city's minorities live,''
Edwards said from his office on 125th Street. ``There's only one
depot in lower Manhattan (the Hudson Depot at 12th Avenue and 15th
Street), but it can't compare to the air pollution that's present
up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Transit authority representatives admit that diesel fuel is
``environmentally unfriendly,'' as Edwards calls it, but say that
the authority is trying to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future is in alternative fuels,'' said Steven Nako, a
spokesman for the transit authority's Department of Buses.
</P>
<P>
   Nako said the transit authority had spent $11 million by last
December upgrading the Jackie Gleason Depot in the Sunset Park
section of Brooklyn. The upgrade is allowing the authority to
increase the number of buses running on compressed natural gas
(CNG) to approximately 200, from 33. Although this upgrade has no
immediate effect on the diesel-fueled buses in Manhattan, Nako
said, more buses could begin running on compressed natural gas in
other boroughs later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're expanding is our load of CNG buses,''
Nako said. ``However, I think they'll become obsolete soon. In the
future, you'll see more and more buses in terms of hybrid-electric,
not CNG.'' Nako added that the MTA has four hybrid-electric buses _
powered by both gas and electricity _ running throughout the five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of any future plans the MTA may have, Edwards said
the agency was not working hard enough to solve air pollution
problems in northern Manhattan. Health officials like Renelda
Walker of the Harlem Hospital Center agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's public knowledge that Harlem has a higher rate of
respiratory problems than in other areas,'' Walker said, adding
that 82 percent of patients admitted to the hospital in 1997 for
asthma-related problems were black or Latino. Asthma, Walker said,
affects about 5 percent of the U.S. population, but 20 percent of
Harlem's residents have the condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get more information on the cause for this,
but we believe the environment and the air pollution may have a
hand in it,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that's where WEACT had to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to educate people,'' Edwards said. ``We have to tell
this to the MTA, elected officials, and people in the community. I
feel like we've gotten some sense of progress, but there's still
more work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to let people know what the problem is and
what impact having thousands of diesel-fueled buses going through
the neighborhoods would have,'' Edwards continued. ``We're not
getting any benefits from having them here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers depend daily on
transit authority buses, Edwards said the MTA was the only sector
gaining from the diesel-operated buses. He said WEACT was pushing
the MTA to switch from diesel-fueled the buses that on compressed
natural gas or electric.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use diesel because it's a cheaper fuel,'' Edwards said.
``It burns easier. However, the transportation agency doesn't
necessarily think of public health issues. Their main objective is
to move people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are viable options,'' Edwards continued. ``There are a
number of cities across the country that are operating electric
buses or natural gas fuels. It's not like the technology is new.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 report by the American Public Transit
Association, only 4 percent of more than 50,000 transit buses in
the country ran on alternative fuel, like compressed natural gas,
ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas and methanol.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative fuel also costs more, the study says. ``We're moving
toward alternative fuel buses, but it's costly,'' Nako
acknowledged. ``I'd say an all-electric bus fleet is a possibility
as we enter the new millennium because, as technology improves,
that will be the cheapest way to run a transit operation.''
</P>
<P>
   For Edwards, the costs the transit authority may incur with
diesel fuel cannot be matched by the cost of human lives. Edwards
hopes to get other community activists involved in WEACT's campaign
against diesel-fueled buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is harmful for all people, whether you're black, white,
yellow or brown,'' Edwards said. ``We need the MTA to get by, or at
least most working people in New York do. However, when I see these
statistics, it really makes me wonder if a ride is worth it. I
mean, it's like people are dying to get around.''

   NEW YORK _ Shoulders sloped and feet shuffling, he pushed his
shopping cart slowly, deftly negotiating a sidewalk narrowed by
trash containers, wary pedestrians, and the bulging trove hanging
from the handle bar.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless and unemployed, this 47-year-old man, who identified
himself only as Gregory, spends most of each day sifting through
the discarded remains of other people's meals in order to buy his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Since the passage of the Recyclable Beverage Containers Act by
New York state in 1983, Gregory and hundreds like him have
discovered an alternative to a tradition of panhandling and
stealing as a means for subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be thankful that we are collecting cans, because
otherwise we would be robbing to survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But far from receiving praise for work that is consistent with
the law intended to reduce street litter, professional collectors
like Gregory often endure hostility, particularly from
inconvenienced shoppers and those required to redeem his cans and
bottles. Some retailers flatly refuse to comply at all with what is
referred to as the Bottle Bill.
</P>
<P>
   When Gregory finds a store willing to redeem his cans, he often
must wait for hours ``because the girls are lazy and the stores are
full of customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent weekday morning, five men and two women, all
professionals, waited outside an Upper West Side supermarket for
two hours to be paid for their cans and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   One of those men was Jack Cooper, 37, who waited his turn while
clutching a beer bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing shameful in collecting cans,'' Cooper said.
``I see people in suit jackets returning cans. Some people are
supporting their families with the can recycling _ one of the best
blessings they ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   While the merits of the Bottle Bill are manifest to those who
immediately benefit, others find it a tremendous burden.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Moore, the director of public affairs at the D'Agostino
supermarket chain , said that the company ``worries about customers
turning away because of the homeless people.'' The redemption
regulations, she continued, deplete the company of ``thousand of
dollars'' in labor costs from overseeing the time-consuming
container sorting and counting process. Furthermore, there is the
fee paid to the independent recycling company, Metromining, that
picks up the cans from the stores. Finally, there is the cost of
the bags and boxes that D'Agostino purchases to hold the recyclable
containers.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the company's stores in the East Village, Ms. Moore
said, she has seen men arriving in vans filled with hundreds of
cans. ``It is a little business at some stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stores in New York City alone _ 21 in all _
redeemed more than 2 million containers last year, Ms. Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lieblein, public affairs director for the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation, said that for the year
ending September 1997, the most recent data available, a total of
943,141,580 containers were redeemed in the city of New York for a
dollar value of $47,157,079.
</P>
<P>
   Because the law limits the number of cans retailers must redeem
for each customer each day to 240 units, Gregory visits a number of
stores daily. ``Twelve dollars for 240 cans,'' he said of the
familiar math.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not exactly lucrative, Gregory can collect this limit
perhaps four or five times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Standing outside an apartment building on the Upper West Side,
Gregory, dressed in his usual maroon sweatshirt, green jacket and
khaki pants, searched through the trash receptacles for cans and
bottles. ``Certain people have certain buildings that they do. I
have three buildings only because my godfather is the super of the
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this privilege, he has lost cans to early morning
opportunists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people out there collecting cans,'' he
said. ``We argue a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, however, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hardly fight over cans because there are too many of
them,'' Cooper said. ``There's always gonna be aluminum cans. It's
like a respect thing _ if someone knows it's your building, they
don't go there.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his experience, Gregory has found competition stiff. He
has often had to tell intruders in his designated area ``to move,''
he said. But he shuns physical violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a waste of time,'' he said.

HAVING YOUR CAKE, AND EXPERTS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
 CAKES   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Queen Victoria's weighed 300 pounds and was topped
with an ice sculpture of Britannia surrounded by cupids. Lady Diana
and the Prince of Wales had a five-tiered hexagon with flowers on
top. The Prince's mother, Queen Elizabeth, served one that was nine
feet tall and weighed 500 pounds. And the tallest on record was 100
tiers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the wedding cake. Few people realize that under the
beautiful frosted exterior are hidden columns, water pumps, dowels,
and even the great secret of stability, Styrofoam.
</P>
<P>
   Just as wedding rings are the key props for the ceremony, the
cake is the centerpiece of the reception. And as much science and
technology go into it as flour and sugar. Whether you choose a
theme of simple elegance or outrageous extravagance, having your
wedding cake (and eating it, too) requires expertise of all kinds:
In baking, obviously, to spin, mold and fashion sugar into an
edible wonder. In architecture, to make sure your Taj Mahal does
not become a Leaning Tower of Pisa. And maybe even in cryogenics,
to make sure that the top tier is frozen to perfection for serving
on the first anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cake symbolizes the celebration of unity; it symbolizes
the whole wedding,'' said bride-to-be Carmelia Colatorti, 36, who
was attending a recent bridal show in Stamford, Conn. She plans to
have a triple-tiered cake decorated with ornately patterned icing
and fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
   As home arts maven Martha Stewart wrote in her wedding guide:
``The bride gets to show off _ why shouldn't the cake get to do the
same?''
</P>
<P>
   Where to start? By finding the right baker, who, doubling as
psychologist, can help wedding-stressed couples figure out what
they want. ``I get to know what their fantasies and their visions
are,'' said Gail Watson of Gail Watson Custom Cakes in New York
City. She said that her clients call her a mind-reader, because she
can take their half-formed ideas and turn them into the perfect
cake.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no limit to the range of designs. New trends
include cakes in acid pop colors like chartreuse and fuchsia, or
the Alice in Wonderland cake, with layers jutting out at obtuse
angles, covered with harlequin oversized decorations in outrageous
colors. ``The more playful and dynamic, the bigger the reaction,''
said Donna Ferrari, an editor at Bride's Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a cake tells the story of the bride and groom, with a
forest or skyscraper, or depicts their hobbies _ like the one
topped with a figurine of a bride in cowboy boots. Watson has so
many ways of molding sugar that she has considered calling herself
a ``sugar manipulator'' on her tax return. She pulls, colors, blows
and spins it into just about any shape and texture imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The window of Angela Mia bakery in Norwalk, Conn., is filled
with dozens of wedding cakes, from a simple two-tiered white cake
with fresh flowers to a multipedestal, many-tiered affair with
fountains, silk flowers and plastic staircases, bearing figurines
of the wedding party.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Donna Marra has made everything from Halloween cake for
a late October wedding to a towered castle-shaped wedding cake,
complete with ivy and moat, for a Robin Hood-themed wedding. (Yes,
the bride was dressed as Guinevere.)
</P>
<P>
   And while rum cake was the only flavor available at Angela Mia
years ago, Marra said that the most popular these days is chocolate
mousse cheesecake _ with runners-up including devil's food, carrot,
spice and strawberry shortcake. Depending on the size, ingredients
and design, cakes can cost as little as $1.75 per guest, and as
much as $12.
</P>
<P>
   The most elaborate confection Marra has assembled was 14 feet
long and incorporated 20 separate cakes. It cost $7,000, and was
enough to feed 2,000 people _ even though there were only 650 at
the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   As Martha Stewart once wrote, ``anything can be built if you
have the right architect.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that any self-respecting architect would design many of the
currently popular cakes. ``It looks like a sleeping beauty castle
combined with a renaissance nightmare,'' said Phillip Zimmerman, an
architect who works in White Plains, N.Y., after seeing a photo of
a cake shaped like a Dr. Seuss fantasy castle. ``It is truly
outside the realm of architectural thinking.'' Its slender columns
could never stand up to architectural reality and the bridges
connecting the towers defy gravity, he said. ``The cake is in the
same world as honeymoon suites, heart-shaped tubs and ``Love Boat''
... an elegant statement of non-reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all brides concern themselves with architectural perfection.
At the height of wedding season (September, not June, as is
commonly assumed), Watson prepares 20 to 25 cakes for each weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A work of art could take two to three days of decorating
alone,'' said Ferrari, so baking the cakes on Tuesday is not
uncommon. Some cakes are covered with botanically correct sugar
flowers, which must be sculpted by hand, petal by petal, then set
aside to dry before being applied to the cake.
</P>
<P>
   For a cake that is two layers or more, a wooden dowel is
inserted down through the middle to keep the layers together.
Without it, said Watson, ``the layers would start to keel over in
transport.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Slinsky of Angela Mia transfers cakes from the bakery and
sets them up at the wedding site. She loads them into a van so that
she can remove the heaviest cakes (the ones that serve as bases for
the rest) first. Then she carries them, ever so carefully, one in
each hand, from the van to the reception hall.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, it takes an hour or two to assemble an ornate cake,
building up from the base layers with columns, fountains, mirrors
and figurines. To finish off the presentation, Slinsky squirts
piping around each bottom layer and spreads flowers on the table.
</P>
<P>
   In her four years on the job, she can remember only one mishap,
a fender-bender, which caused the single cake to slide and shmush.
Fortunately, there was enough time to call the bakery and get
another one baked and decorated in time for the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has seen a table holding a cake collapse; another time, a
dog attacked (and wolfed down) a cake at a reception. But perhaps
the most memorable disaster occurred when a chef dropped a
four-layer cake at the reception hall. It was too late to bake a
new one, so Watson reassembled the top three layers and replaced
the bottom with a quickly decorated Styrofoam substitute. Nobody
knew, but the bride was wisely instructed to slice into the second
tier during the cake-cutting ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the secrets of a cake's stability are the columns
imbedded in each layer, like pilings under a building. Despite
appearances, the layers do not rest on each other, but on these
columns
</P>
<P>
   At the appropriate moment during a traditional wedding, the cake
is presented, the bride and groom feed each other their pieces, and
then the wait staff whisks it away to be cut and served. But wait!
What's that in the kitchen? A substitute cake? To lower costs and
avoid overbearingly large wedding cakes, many brides and grooms
have an unadorned sheet cake made _ with the same ingredients as
the small showcase cake _ to serve the guests.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of more elaborate cakes, disassembling its parts is
akin to demolishing a historic building: save the valuable pieces
for recycling. Angela Mia gladly returns deposits when columns,
fountains and mirrors, are returned to the bakery after the
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Bride-to-be Jackie Jones, 34, interviewed at a Connecticut
wedding show, is very concerned that her cake send just the right
message to her guests. Looking over choices at the show, she
decided that her cake should be decorated to match the beads and
lace on her wedding dress. It will have five tiers, and the top
will be frozen so she and her husband can eat it on their first
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Jones may want to consult yet another expert about that. After
all, many first anniversary desserts resemble something between a
dry sponge and a brick, in both texture and taste.
</P>
<P>
   Reid Wurzburg, vice president of design at Macomber Cryogenics,
says he could do better. ``The key to viability is controlling the
rate of freezing to prevent the formation of ice crystals and
bursting cell walls,'' he said. To retain the look, feel and taste
of food, a home freezer will not do. ``It's okay for a cake that
you're freezing for Tuesday, but it's different when it's for next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the design of freezing processes for various
materials _ although he's never done a cake, he deals with
everything from sperm and eggs to loaves of bread _ is based on
research by Nobel Prize winners.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, he said, bread is frozen by running it through
a chilled tunnel, then spraying it with liquid nitrogen (at a
temperature of minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit) before packaging it. A
cake would have slightly different requirements, he said, because
it has more volume and is more fragile than bread.
</P>
<P>
   Failing access to a cryogenic facility, Ferrari recommends
freezing a butter cream cake as follows: insert toothpicks around
the cake to protect the decorations, wrap it with cheesecloth, then
plastic wrap, then aluminum foil, then refrigerate it then freeze
it. This way, she says, ``the icing will look nice and the cake
will taste great.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Princes William and Harry will use these technical
experts to make certain that their wedding cakes are not only
extraordinary, but stable, tasty and well-preserved.

DIVORCE STILL TABOO IN INDIAN CULTURE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Komal Shah turned 21, her parents decided to
find her a husband. She postponed graduate school for a year and
left New Orleans for Bombay, India, with her parents to search for
a groom. Three months later, she was married to a 22-year-old
physician.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after her wedding, she ran away from her
husband and in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   Shah phoned her parents from a friend's house and told them she
wanted to end her marriage. She was going back home to the United
States with or without them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound insane, but I got a lot of my courage back
after facing the reality,'' Shah said. ``I finally realized this
was all real and I couldn't live like this for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving a daughter away in marriage is one of the highest forms
of charity or good deed that Indian parents perform to enter
heaven. But Shah was born and raised in the United States. Like
many Indian-Americans, she grew up believing she was going to enter
into an arranged marriage but she did not realize the pressures
that such unions can bring to bear on both parties. She did not
think she would have to say yes to a man she did not like, simply
to satisfy her parents. Shah said she was not against the concept
of arranged marriages. But she feels compelled to speak out against
the stigma placed on young Indian-Americans when their marriages
fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if she is in an arranged marriage or love
marriage,'' said Prima Vora, director of Sakhi, a center assisting
South Asian battered women in New York. ``It is the value the
community places on marriage and the stigma of divorce that is one
of the factors in her feeling trapped,'' she said of her typical
client.
</P>
<P>
   But Shah, 25, said, ``This is the first generation of people
that realize we have options, we can make a choice and be
independent in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the option of divorce, only one percent of
Indian-American couples are divorced or separated according to the
1990 U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideology is that there is no divorce, but the reality is
there are many families who live outside of the traditional
household,'' said Professor Ann Waters, a historian and
anthropologist on South Asia at Barnard College. ``You have single
women and men living apart from their family, even if it is not
officially said.'' With increased economic independence, more Asian
women might consider divorce as an option in a failing marriage,
Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   The taboo remains. ``Whether in America or India, the stigma
stays even in the upper and lower caste,'' said Maya Sharma, a
visiting scholar at Columbia University's Center for Human Rights.
Sharma has conducted extensive research on single women in India
including those who are widowed, divorced, deserted or work as
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma said divorced women are treated differently than men in
similar situations within Indian society. ``An independent identity
of a woman strikes at the heart of the marriage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Single women are seen as loose in the sense of being
available, bad ones who will steal other people's husband,'' Sharma
said. ``And when you are single you don't have the same weight as
you are married. Somehow being single is a fault. It is seen as
something pitiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Shah recalls her parents' reaction to her decision to divorce
her husband. ``My parents approached me and said that no daughter
of theirs would be getting a divorce,'' she said. They did not want
her to speak of divorce, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in her view, her relationship with her husband and in-laws
had deteriorated to ``mental abuse'' that was ``enough to eat away
at the core of a person's soul and mental well being.'' She said,
``You will do anything to get away from the abuse, whatever form it
may be.''
</P>
<P>
   The social consequences of divorce affect men, too. Jay, who
declined to give his last name, is a 29-year-old Indian-American
who lives in Chicago. He got divorced after his wife left him and
moved back to India with their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is not getting a divorce or losing my wife,'' Jay
said. ``The biggest pressure is finding someone who likes you. You
are considered ineligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting other Indian women to remarry has not been easy for Jay.
Like many Indian-Americans, he uses matrimonial classifieds in
Indian newspapers and online sites for arranged marriages to meet
potential mates.
</P>
<P>
   But he feels that he is at a disadvantage. ``Since I am in
America and there is a lot of choice here, why choose a divorced
man?'' Jay said. ``There are a lot of Indian single men. Based on
that alone, why bother with me?'' If he were in India, he said, he
could easily find a woman to marry. But he admitted that his wife,
being a woman with a child, would find it more difficult to find a
new husband.
</P>
<P>
   Shah recently placed an advertisement online seeking a husband.
She said she had not been aggressive about finding someone before
her divorce papers were finalized last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on her marriage, Shah said, ``I was the one that
parents always wanted their kids to be like.'' But she said she had
to make a decision: ``Either I please myself or I live a fantasy
life to please my parents.'' She chose a tough reality.
</P>
<P>
   Shah said she wanted to share her experience with other
Indian-Americans so they know they are not alone when facing
societal pressures during marriage or divorce. This past fall, Shah
addressed a group of about 100 Indian-Americans organized by Young
Jain Professionals. ``There are so many more people that can't get
out of it.''

JAILHOUSE JOURNALISTS: RIKERS INMATES LEARN TO REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 DESIREE ADIB  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As their names were called out, the graduates proudly
strolled across the gummy green gymnasium floor to accept their
certificates. But this was not like any other graduation: the
students here were wearing regulation green fatigues, nine
correction officers paced along the gym's sidelines, and the poorly
ventilated air was thick, with an eerie sense of confinement. It
was commencement day at Rikers Island, the largest jail in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 12 weeks the inmates had spent hours in class
poring over back issues of the New Yorker magazine, struggled with
the rules of grammar, and learned interviewing techniques. On
graduation day they had two things to show for it: the Rikers
Review, a magazine they produced themselves and a diploma from the
Fresh Start Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first time ever being in prison and because of
Fresh Start I learned a lot,'' said Pablo Rodriquez, 19, who is
serving an eight-month sentence for selling heroin. ``Now I have
respect for myself and that helps me gain respect for others.''
</P>
<P>
   These 16 graduates are among the elite at Rikers Island. After a
grueling acceptance procedure of essay writing, background checks
and lengthy interviews, they were chosen out of 200 applicants for
the Fresh Start program. Organized by a criminal justice group
called the Osborne Association, Fresh Start offers 12-week cycles
of culinary arts or journalism training for men at Rikers Island.
The goal is to teach the inmates practical skills that will help
them successfully reintegrate back into society, according to
Jennifer Wynn, the journalism instructor and editor of the Rikers
Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rikers Review is there for the inmates as a vehicle for
self-expression, for self-esteem building, to learn how to
prioritize their work loads and to learn how to cooperate with
others,'' Wynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn stressed that the computer skills are especially critical
because inmates can use them to their vocational benefit when they
are released from jail. Lenny Hughes, a former drug addict who
graduated from the program nine months ago is an example of a
someone who did just that. During the graduation ceremony, Hughes
spoke to the inmates about his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program gave me options and hope that I can change my
lifestyle, and I am here today to show you that I did it and you
can do this also,'' said Hughes, who looked like a Wall Street
stock trader in a dark blue suit and black-rimmed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is out of jail and employed at a marketing firm making
$17 an hour. He is also a student at the Borough of Manhattan
Community College with a 3.0 grade point average.
</P>
<P>
   After the graduation ceremonies the inmates happily munched on a
hearty meal of fried chicken and cornbread prepared by their Fresh
Start counterparts in the culinary program. The journalism students
passed out the Winter 1999 edition of the Rikers Review.
</P>
<P>
   In the magazine there were articles describing everything from
the Department of Correction's pending ban on cigarettes to the
effect of the Y2K problem on prisons and courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine not being able to obtain water from the tap ...
imagine your commissary account dropped to zero ... imagine that
your good time was erased ... that the lights went out,'' writes
Abelardo Hernandez, discussing the Y2K problem in his article.
</P>
<P>
   There is a ``Dear Doc'' column where inmates can ask Dr. Esther
Schumann questions regarding various jailhouse ailments. ``What's
the deal with hepatitis?'' asks one reader.
</P>
<P>
   There are also reviews on books such as ``The Pros and Cons of
the NFL,'' a book discussing criminals who play in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authors do not just make allegations in their fascinating
and easy-to-read book _ they match crimes to players and include
mug shots, court records and police reports, as well as interviews
with victims and arresting officers,'' writes Jermaine Coit, in his
book review.
</P>
<P>
   Some inmates, like Rodriquez, contributed a personal essay that
revealed the hardship and challenges they faced in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I see this place as if it were a jungle full of
hunters stalking their prey,'' he wrote. ``Once you're here,
there's no hope of getting out without being hunted. On the Rock,
you are either the hunter or the hunted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rikers Review has been a product of the Fresh Start program for
20 years. The inmates are taught by instructors to write articles
that cater to the readership of the jail _ the inmates and the
correction officers. They are taught writing and computer skills on
Word Perfect and Windows 97 programs. The curriculum, which also
includes public speaking and self-evaluation classes, keeps the
inmates occupied and away from the trouble that tends to brew in
the overcrowded jail dorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In jail there are gangs, there are people with negative
attitudes and there are many intimidation and manipulation
factors,'' said inmate William McCray 39, who is serving eight
months for violating his parole on a prior drug conviction. ``The
program helps you get away from all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn explained that the intentions of the journalism program and
the magazine are not to cover controversial issues at Rikers, but
rather to be a ``positively oriented magazine for inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the magazine is to inform our readers, inspire
our readers or entertain our readers,'' she said. ``This is not a
muckraking tool and we can't be a vehicle through which we are
going to be exposing jailhouse scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Fresh Start organizers and the inmates
involved, the correction officers at Rikers are supportive and
helpful with the program. During the graduation ceremonies, the
correction officers were as seemingly happy and hopeful for the
inmates as friends and family in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope that I won't ever have to see any of these guys
in here anymore!'' said Capt. Susan Griffith, one correction
officer who spoke with much cheer during the ceremony. ``Instead, I
hope to one day run into them at a restaurant in Manhattan ... as
successful individuals in a free society.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all graduates are success stories. One student who was
accepted and actively involved in the journalism program was back
in Rikers on drug charges only one week after he was released.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn says that at one time, Fresh Start had psychologists on
staff who might have been able to help a student like that but
today the program is unable to meet the needs of ``troubled cases''
because of financial and administrative cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad really; programs like this should be staffed so that
we don't have to pick just the best,'' Wynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the inmates at Rikers Island are serving misdemeanor
sentences of one year or less. The average offender serves only 43
days, according to corrections officials. For the inmates at Rikers
there is no question that they will be back out on the streets; the
only question is whether they will be able to stay out. During the
ceremony, the poignant words of inmate Charlie Moore addressed this
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned one very valuable thing here at the Rock,'' Moore
said. ``It's a short bridge going there but it's a long bridge
coming back and hopefully we can rely on our hopes, dreams and the
skills we learned here to make that an easier ride back.''

</P>
<P>
   DISABILITIES LAW _ Next year, the Americans With Disabilities
Act, which extends equal access to employment, government services
and public accommodations to the disabled _ will reach its 10-year
anniversary. Most say that the legislation has come a long way in
addressing discrimination against people with disabilities. At the
same time, it has sparked a debate over what the law means by a
physical or mental condition that ``substantially limits one or
more major life activities.'' ``That's where the battle lines are
being drawn,'' according to Equal Employment Opportunity
Commissioner Paul Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ARRANGED MARRIAGES _ Giving a daughter away in marriage is one
of the highest forms of charity or good deed that Indian parents
perform to enter heaven. But when an arranged marriage does not
work out, ending it can be extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-TECH BELLS _ The digital age has come to churches in the
form of computerized bells.
</P>
<P>
   BUS FUMES _ Minorities in northern Manhattan are not just in
danger of drugs and the gun violence found too often on inner-city
streets. They are also subjected to unsafe air, thanks to the
Metropolitan Transit Authority, activists say. The transit
authority runs more than 3,500 buses daily from 19 depots in all
five New York boroughs. Manhattan is home to eight depots; seven of
them are situated above 96th Street, where a majority of residents
are black and Latino. ``Most of these depots are across the street
from schools and large housing developments,'' one activist said.
``The fumes are seeping into the air, increasing our chances of
being diagnosed with asthma, lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis and
heart attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE WEDDING CAKES _ Consider the wedding cake. Few people
realize that under the beautiful frosted exterior are hidden
columns, water pumps, dowels, and even the great secret of
stability, Styrofoam.
</P>
<P>
   CAN REDEMPTION _ Since the passage of the Recyclable Beverage
Containers Act by New York state in 1983, 47-year-old Gregory and
hundreds like him have discovered an alternative to a tradition of
panhandling and stealing as a means for subsistence. ``People
should be thankful that we are collecting cans, because otherwise
we would be robbing to survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LOST AND FOUND _ The objects in the Lost and Found at Grand
Central Terminal are bits and pieces of lives waiting to be
reclaimed. Paul Noguchi, an urban anthropologist at Bucknell
University, calls them ``testaments to forgetfulness'' and
``reflections of our culture.'' ``You are what you lose, to some
extent,'' Noguchi said. ``And we find some really strange things.''
</P>
<P>
   JAIL MAGAZINE _ As their names were called out, the graduates
proudly strolled across the gummy green gymnasium floor to accept
their certificates. But this was not like any other graduation: the
students here were wearing regulation green fatigues, nine
correction officers paced along the gym's sidelines, and the poorly
ventilated air was thick, with an eerie sense of confinement. It
was commencement day at Rikers Island, the largest jail in the
nation. For the past 12 weeks the inmates had spent hours in class
poring over back issues of the New Yorker magazine, struggled with
the rules of grammar, and learned interviewing techniques. On
graduation day they had two things to show for it: the Rikers
Review, a magazine they produced themselves and a diploma from the
Fresh Start Program.
</P>
<P>
   PIGEON RACING _ Pigeons don't get much respect in New York. But
a small circle of old-timers still compete in a sport that makes
champions of perhaps the world's most despised bird. They may look
slow, but pigeons can fly at speeds of up to 70 mph. It doesn't
matter where you drop them off, they come back like a boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   SAKE BARS _ The microbrew revolution has come and gone. Martini
madness is so two years ago. But there's a new drink in town. It's
clear. It's dry. It's cool. It's ... sake.

YOU ARE WHAT YOU LOSE: LOST &AMP; FOUNDS REFLECT CULTURES

   NEW YORK _ The man on the other side of the Plexiglas divider
stood in front of shelves of gray plastic bins filled with this
month's gloves, cell phones, beepers, Bibles, keys and umbrellas
and politely listened to one more tale of woe.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a drawer and gently plopped down a pile of
sandwich-sized plastic bags, each one containing a piece of jewelry
waiting for its owner to come looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   After a few seconds of rummaging, a smile came across John
Judd's face as he went from loser to finder, identifying one of the
more than 14,000 objects that made their way to the Metro North
Lost and Found Parcel Room at Grand Central Terminal last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the third wedding band I lost,'' said the 34-year-old
electrician who left his ring in the men's room at Grand Central.
``I should get a box of 50 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The objects in this room are bits and pieces of lives waiting to
be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Noguchi, an urban anthropologist at Bucknell University,
calls them ``testaments to forgetfulness'' and ``reflections of our
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are what you lose, to some extent,'' Noguchi said. ``And
we find some really strange things.''
</P>
<P>
   Noguchi has studied the lost and found at Tokyo Station for more
than 20 years. About two years ago, he said, one of his students
spurred his interest in Grand Central's.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Noguchi has visited this lost and found five times.
He has watched Fred Chidester, customer service manager and
self-described computer nerd, turn this home for lost artifacts
into an electronic wonder, reflecting the efficient and fast-paced
culture of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Chidester, 62, a former lieutenant commander with Metro North
police, studied the computerized systems of the FBI and New York
City Police Department, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We modeled our system after theirs,'' he said. ``But we came
up with a better mousetrap.''
</P>
<P>
   That modern mousetrap helped Metro North return more than 7,000
lost items last year, Chidester said.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of Chidester's labor can be seen first-hand on the
lower level near track 100 by anyone who misplaces just about
anything on a Metro North train, at any of the outlying stations or
in Grand Central.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that comes into the lost and found is tagged, entered
on the computer and stored in a designated bin or on a shelf or
rack, Chidester said. If it has been turned in it takes only
moments to determine its location.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lost artifacts are what hurried suburban commuters
would be expected to leave on their trains _ briefcases, gym bags,
jackets, glasses, hats and wallets, Chidester said.
</P>
<P>
   Glass eyeballs, artificial limbs, juicers, golf clubs and live
mice have also been found, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tokyo and New York are major urban centers and
globalization accounts for the similarities in some of the lost
objects, like laptop computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lost items unique to each culture, Noguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   A surgeon riding a Metro North train on his way to perform
reconstructive surgery left a box of human body parts _ eyebrows,
ear lobes and an upper lip packed on dry ice _ on one of the
trains, Chidester said. The surgeon realized his loss after he the
train left the station.
</P>
<P>
   Chidester tracked the train down and located the package. It was
returned it to the surgeon _ unopened.
</P>
<P>
   Americans might find that event odd or weird, but there would
probably be a different response at Tokyo Station, Noguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan if something like that showed up it's a source of
anxiety, because of the concern about lost and wandering spirits,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And as Japan has become a consumption society the number of lost
furoshiki _ silk scarves traditionally used to carry goods _ has
decreased, replaced by modern shopping bags, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noguchi has also looked at other factors _ like the differences
in demographics and time anxiety about the day's agenda _ that
influence what shows up at the different lost and founds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll get more lost artifacts in the morning than in the
evening rush,'' Noguchi said of Grand Central. ``That's true in
Japan, too. There's a rhythm to lost articles.''
</P>
<P>
   More old people ride the train in Tokyo so there are more sets
of false teeth lost, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lost Japanese wooden shoes have been replaced by forgotten
Reeboks and Nikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have compared lost objects to museum pieces,''
Noguchi said.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike museums, lost and founds are not the intention of
anybody, he said. ``They're a voice of the people for the things
they lost.''

HEY, BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE AN ATM? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here are the two big, completely nonfictional
issues in San Francisco right now:
</P>
<P>
   First, Mayor Willie Brown is considering the idea of giving
automated teller machines to the homeless, so people don't have to
lug around quarters, but can just run their cards through
panhandlers' money machines.
</P>
<P>
   Let that one sink in for a minute, while you're waiting for your
bank balance to show on the beggar's machine.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the San Francisco Catholic Archdiocese has unleashed its
power and influence against the city Board of Supervisors for
voting to close a street in the gay Castro District on Easter so a
bunch of gay guys who dress up as nuns can have a block party.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us can sympathize. But you have to admit, the church has
come a long way since those centuries when it crusaded against such
worthy opponents as the Saracens and Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, the line is moving closer to the homeless guy
with the ATM. It's a long wait, but it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to stand a few feet back, according to ATM etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   That way only the homeless guy will see the personal
identification numbers being punched in.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of giving the homeless ATMs comes from a local do-good
group that wants to assure that quarters dropped in cups don't go
to the fortified wine industry. Instead, donors will be assured
that 20 percent would go to the guy holding the machine, and 80
percent to groups helping the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   How the guy collects the money, I don't know. Bank of America
and Wells Fargo aren't exactly falling all over themselves for the
homeless business. They don't even seem to want ours, to judge by
the way they treat us.
</P>
<P>
   Why anyone would run an ATM card through a beggar's machine, I
don't know either.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, when you're at a regular ATM you're always looking over
your shoulders for scruffy guys. I guess the advantage is that here
you'd be looking right at them.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's homeless policy could fit on a cardboard sign: ``Will
take any cockamamie idea as food for thought.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Brown's point man on homeless issues,
Supervisor Amos Brown, proposed taking shopping carts away from the
homeless, replacing them with small two-wheeled carts and duffel
bags.
</P>
<P>
   How homeless people are supposed to carry ATMs on those rigs is
anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   We're looking for a little consistency here, people. The cops
are running homeless people off street corners and out of parks.
Now city officials want to turn them into monetary institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless people can be sources of revenue, just like illegally
parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   As the city's budget surplus slips away, perhaps the mayor will
consider extending ATM use to help solve other social problems.
</P>
<P>
   Give hookers ATMs, and use a portion of the proceeds to fund
shelters for battered women and Johns Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Give drug dealers ATMs, and some of the proceeds can go to rehab
centers. At the same time, street crime will be reduced because
there won't be cash on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Give muggers ATMs, and they won't have to drag you to one at
gunpoint to take your money. A portion of the proceeds can go to
fund the police.
</P>
<P>
   Give lobbyists ATMs, and developers won't have to create a paper
trail trying to get their highrises approved.
</P>
<P>
   Give every citizen and business an ATM, so city tax collectors
can withdraw as much money as they want and save money on stamps
and paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of running San Francisco keeps rising to support its
bright ideas. Satire doesn't come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city officials are scrambling to reach a compromise
between the Catholic Church and the guys who dress up as nuns.
</P>
<P>
   These guys, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, made fun of the
pope when he visited San Francisco a couple of years ago, so you
can see why the church hates the idea of them getting an indulgence
from city officials on Easter.
</P>
<P>
   A church spokesman made a big mistake by saying that closing the
street for a group that mocks the Catholic Church is like closing a
street for a group of neo-Nazis on Passover.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but I can't think of the last time the Sisters of
Perpetual Indulgence kicked and beat Catholics in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, under the First Amendment, San Francisco might have to
treat neo-Nazis as if they were just any other group wanting a
street fair in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco? Press ``cancel'' when finished or choose another
transaction.

CHURCH GROUPS FIGHT `SATANIC' MESSAGE IN ROCKER'S MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The word of God and the music of Marilyn Manson
shared twin billing at the Alamodome earlier this week as scores of
Christian activists proselytized to the shock rocker's faithful
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Manson fans weren't easily swayed by the churchgoers outside the
dome, but most accepted the ``God bless yous'' and religious
pamphlets in jack-boot stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't want to hear the word of God,'' said Cedric D.
Williams, 31, of the New Life Christian Center in San Antonio.
``They get caught up in the music. It's a satanic subliminal
message that's coming out, and they don't want to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Bird, decked out in black lipstick and red horns, was in
no mood to be converted on her big night out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pathetic. We're not going to lose our souls,''
said the 15-year-old resident of Buda, about 60 miles north of
here.
</P>
<P>
   The witnessing campaign was choreographed by a Christian radio
station, KSLR, which warned parents about the influence of Manson,
who has torn Bibles apart at his shows.
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders across the country have rallied against
Manson's music.
</P>
<P>
   His 1996 album, Antichrist Superstar, went platinum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good would Marilyn Manson be if no one hated Marilyn?''
the performer, whose real name is Brian Warner, said in a 1994
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, who resembles an androgynous, anorexic Alice Cooper,
without snakes, likened his concerts to a freak show _ and cast
himself as the carnival barker.
</P>
<P>
   During the San Antonio performance Monday, the police kept a
close watch on the black-garbed, white-faced legions of Manson
fans, many of whom sported tattoos, pierced appendages and dyed
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Halloween on Mars,'' Patrolman David Williams said.
``It's interesting, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson fan Ginger Oye, 19, was happily led about on a leash by
``master'' Terri Vasquez, 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has to tame me because I can't be controlled,'' Oye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the finest person that ever walked the Earth,''
she said of Manson.
</P>
<P>
   In her non-leash hand, Vasquez clutched religious pamphlets that
she said she would read later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a religious person,'' said Vasquez, who wasn't worried
about being influenced by the band. ``If you're a strong person,
you're not going to convert to Satanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the religious messages that Katie Dillon handed out
quickly became litter or were dumped in trash cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' said Dillon, 28. ``Garbage workers need God,
too.''

ICON ARTISTS FIND SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION IN THEIR WORK

   CAMBRIDGE, N.Y. _ When you enter the artist's studio, the air is
filled with the smell of paints and varnish, blending with aromas
of freshly baked biscotti and dog biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   The studio occupies the corner of a one-story dark-stained wood
house that could fit into any neighborhood, except this one is
nestled on a hillside near the Vermont border on the land of a
small religious community.
</P>
<P>
   Natural light floods the room streaming in from large windows
that open onto a scenic wooded area and beyond to the foothills of
the Green Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The artist's sanctuary is home to Sister Pat, who works five
hours a day, four days a week, as one of three monastic
inconographers at the New Skete Communities, in the upstate New
York community of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The painting of icons has been a part of this monastic community
also renowned for its dogs, dog biscuits, biscotti and cheesecakes
since its founding more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Pat works in her studio at Emmaus House, which is the
residence for the Companions of New Skete,
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to the parish with my husband in 1976 and began
the Companions community in this house in 1983, as one of three
couples and two widows,'' said Sister Pat, whose husband died in
1997. ``As companions, we follow a religious rule of life, as
professed monastics, like the nuns and many of the monks, which
includes daily worship and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sisters Cecelia and Rebecca work at the residence of the Nuns of
New Skete, about a mile and a half down the hill. The monastery for
the Monks of New Skete, the church and chapel are located near the
very top of the hill, a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women here are dedicated to monastic life in the
Orthodox Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Father Laurence, the abbot and founder of the community, and 11
monks (four of whom, including Father Laurence, are ordained) took
up farming in 1966 by one of the main roads in Cambridge, but the
traffic proved too busy for their monastic life and they moved to
their current location a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the hilly, rocky terrain of these 500 acres, farming
was out of the question. The community instead supports itself by
breeding German Shepherd dogs and boarding and training of all
breeds. In addition they write books, smoke meats, make dog beds,
T-shirts, gourmet cheesecakes, biscotti, dog biscuits and
liturgical works of art, from religious goods to music and painted
icons, which are found in the monks' gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   The icons are mostly commissions, from individuals and religious
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm backed up two years,'' said Sister Pat, as she
served her visitor freshly brewed coffee and homemade biscotti.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed casually in trousers and a plaid flannel shirt, instead
of her monastic habit, which is used for worship, Sister Pat sat
straight up on the edge of the seat of an armchair and told of her
career as a high school English teacher for 33 years, which is
where she met her husband, who was also a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I retired from teaching in 1987, to devote my time to painting
icons,'' she said. ``I wasn't trained as an artist. I only had 6
credit hours in college of drawing, lettering and design. But I
stopped because the work was cutting in on my other courses. But I
would draw anything. My sister, who also likes to draw, and I would
always get drawing materials from our parents at Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   When Father Laurence needed another iconographer to help meet
the demand of commissions, he asked if anyone liked to draw, and
Sister Pat showed him a large sketchbook she kept from over the
years, which happened to include a couple of pencil portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Pat studied with an iconographer in Clermont, N.H.,
learning to paint icons in the traditional way, using egg tempera
on gessoed wood, while Sisters Cecelia and Rebecca use acrylics on
the same surface. When painting with acrylics, the prepared wood
surface can be placed on an easel, as opposed to egg tempera, where
the icon has to remain flat. Egg tempera requires working with
puddles of color.
</P>
<P>
   Birch, plywood or a solid poplar, linden or any other
nonresinous (so it doesn't leech) softwood is used for an icon
painting. The wood is cut to the appropriate size, then painted
with 10 to 12 coats of gesso, with sanding between every third or
fourth coat.
</P>
<P>
   This process can take up to three days. The last is sanding with
a very fine grade of sandpaper till it becomes a smooth surface,
but still able to hold pigment. Any gold leaf work is applied last,
as it is very perishable.
</P>
<P>
   The painted surface of the icon must be sealed to protect the
pigments and gold leaf. It is customary to kiss an icon (but never
with lipstick or chapstick), showing respect of the figure
presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use a traditional olifa varnish, which is a refined linseed
oil with a bit of cobalt drier in it,'' Sister Pat said. ``It stays
tacky for a very long time, usually up to a year, and while it is
completely drying, it must be protected from dust by storing it in
an upright position in a very clean area away from traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the icons starts at $250 and goes up to $4,500 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The artists take great spiritual pride in their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The icon should be the opening through which we receive the
light of Christ,'' Sister Pat said. ``Painting icons is a service
to the church. We hope to kindle in the viewers a renewed faith in
God's incarnation in Christ.''

PLEADING THE CASE FOR NEGOTIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan Schlictmann doesn't look at all like John Travolta. He is
slender rather than filled out, Jewish rather than Italian, and has
gray hair rather than black. But he's the real thing, the crusading
attorney of ``A Civil Action,'' the movie in which Travolta tries
to nail Beatrice Foods and W.R. Grace for polluting the drinking
water in Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency eventually required the
companies to pledge $70 million, but the pledge was to Woburn, not
to Schlictmann and his clients. He won a moral victory, but at the
cost of his partnership, his house and even his car.
</P>
<P>
   Schlictmann recovered. He wrote a book, has a car again (a
Volvo) and another polluted-water case, in Toms River, N.J. And he
has a new attitude toward the law. Instead of seeking to nail his
targets to the wall, he talks about ``establishing a relationship
of trust.'' He speaks out against his profession's presumption of
conflict, which he says ``encourages in ourselves behavior which is
pathological.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlictmann spoke to a group in SeaTac, Wash., last week
organized by attorney Dave Larson, founder of Litigation
Alternatives Inc. Larson is a practitioner of mediation and
arbitration, and a critic of his profession's take-no-prisoners
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   And so is Schlictmann. The man portrayed by Travolta as the
fighter for truth now argues that truth ``is not something to be
taken. It is something to be shared.''
</P>
<P>
   He's trying that approach in Toms River. He describes his case
as much like that of Woburn as portrayed in the movie: a town with
polluted water and 60 cases of unexplained cancer. The difference
is, he made a deal with local industry to cooperate, and each
agreed that no lawsuits would be filed for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such a case would start with demands. But when you
start with negotiations, Schlictmann said, ``they become more
issues and concerns. You're letting go of control of that demand.''
</P>
<P>
   You're also letting go of your exclusive claim to the moral high
ground. Were you a victim? Maybe it's because you didn't stand up
for yourself. ``You disempowered yourself,'' Schlictmann said.
</P>
<P>
   To the lawyers present, he said: You're going to negotiate a
deal anyway. Why wait until you've conscripted your army and lined
up your cannons? Why not make peace now? ``Call up Jack the
insurance adjuster, whom you've known for 15 years,'' and work it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Several layers objected. You're a famous guy, they said. You
wrote the book. You were played by John Travolta. When you come
rolling into town, of course they're going to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Said Seattle personal injury attorney Scott Ericson: ``On a
single auto accident, how do we force an insurance company to the
table when they don't want to go? In essence, you are forcing them
to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right,'' Schlictmann said. Getting them to the table
``has elements of coercion. I just think what I'm talking about is
more civilized ... than piling more stones on somebody's chest
until he tells us the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   More civilized, certainly. But he never quite answered Ericson's
first question, which was, how do we do it?
</P>
<P>
   Larson, the sponsor, admits that a deal is not always possible
and the threat of court action may be required. But he says
arbitration, in which both sides agree to accept the decision of a
private judge, and mediation, in which they use a facilitator to
talk the matter out, are both better than going to court.
</P>
<P>
   One of Larson's other speakers, Justice Phil Talmadge of the
Washington Supreme Court, said it now takes three years for a
business dispute to be decided in King County court. Court
congestion is getting so bad, he said, that the high court could
order the state Legislature to hire more judges. He allowed that
this would be ``a very hard and blunt weapon, one that gets us into
a constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, Larson argues, is doing more things outside
court rather than engaging in long, expensive set-piece battles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he says, he had a client who killed a 12-year-old
in a car accident. In our culture, our lawyers advise us never to
say, ``I'm sorry,'' or to publicly be sorry. It might be used
against us. In this case, the dead child's mother, who is
Vietnamese, didn't feel Larson's client respected her son's death.
The client had planted a ceremonial tree in honor of the dead boy,
but no one had told the mother. When the two finally met, a flood
of tears and emotions were released, and the lawsuit was quickly
settled.
</P>
<P>
   Says Larson: ``A lot of these disputes could be settled by
letting people be people, letting people be human.''

 &HT;    GOP LAWMAKERS OFFER TAX REBATE
 &HT;    310&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping for a substantial budget surplus this year,
a group of Republican lawmakers Wednesday proposed a one-time 5
percent income tax rebate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When America takes in more than it needs, it ought to give it
back, pure and simple,'' said Rep. Mark Foley of Florida, the
bill's chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would offer all taxpayers a minimum rebate of $100 and
a maximum of $500 on taxes owed for this year. The filing deadline
for those taxes would be April 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers earning up to about $56,000 a year would qualify for
the full 5 percent rebate on the taxes they pay. Beyond that income
level, the $500 maximum would represent a smaller percentage of
their taxes. Persons who do not pay any taxes would not qualify for
money back.
</P>
<P>
   The rebate would be available only if there is a federal budget
surplus beyond the surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund. In
order to be fully implemented, Foley's bill would require a surplus
of $22.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting a
non-Social Security surplus of less than $1 billion, but the agency
will revise its estimates this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said he expects the surplus estimate to rise, based on the
strong economy. If the surplus is less than $22.7 billion, he said,
the percentage or maximum amount of the rebate might be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his approach as simple and direct without requiring a
long-term commitment to a tax reduction, Foley said he expected to
pick up wide bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Foley noted that many members of both parties are reluctant to
embrace a permanent tax cut based on projections of surpluses that
may not occur. He noted his bill would not be implemented unless
there was a surplus. Congress could decide to enact similar rebates
each year if the surplus continued.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The rebate would be different than the tax refunds may people
now receive from the government. A refund is made when someone pays
more tax than he owes, usually because too much is withheld from
his paycheck. The rebate would reduce the amount of tax owed.
</P>
<P>
   A similar rebate was given in 1975 when Democrats controlled
Congress and Gerald Ford was president. At that time the rebate was
10 percent with a $100 minimum and $200 maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., a senior member of the tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee and a cosponsor of the bill, said
that of all the tax cut proposals floating around Congress, ``this
is the best approach because it's the most direct approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley and Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo., another cosponsor of the
bill, are also members of the Ways and Means Committee.

   Stress hormones can help us escape a leopard. But in excess,
they may do a lot of damage to the brain. For example, take an
18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off to a war and
expose him to something horrific _ say, a battle in which he's the
only soldier in his unit to survive. Chances are that some day he
may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. By studying
magnetic resonance images of the hippocampus of patients with PTSD,
scientists are detecting new clues about the relationship between
stress and the brain. Robert Sapolsky is a professor of

18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off to a war and
expose him to something horrific _ say, a battle in which he's the
only soldier in his unit to survive. Chances are that some day he
may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. By studying
magnetic resonance images of the hippocampus of patients with PTSD,
scientists are detecting new clues about the relationship between
stress and the brain. Robert Sapolsky is a professor of

<P>
   Every now and then, someone with a medical problem needs a CT
scan or MRI of the brain. With luck, the test rules out a
threatening disease and in the resultant relief, the doctor shows
the patient the scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pictures of other organs, which inspire a bemused
response, brain scans provoke awe. Rookie med students feel the
same disquiet in anatomy class when they first hold a cadaver's
brain in their hands. The brain, after all, is the Seat of the
Soul. From this mass of tissue resembling marinated tofu emanates a
person.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a child's body stops growing, the brain has long
since settled into its adult size. Which is why it's mighty
interesting when the size of some part of the brain changes
dramatically in an adult. Lately, a certain brain region has
attracted a lot of attention because it may atrophy in response to
a certain type of serious stress.
</P>
<P>
   Take a green 18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off
to a war and expose him to something truly horrific _ say, a battle
in which he's the only soldier in his entire unit to survive. Some
rare, inexplicable supermen may come out of such an experience
unfazed or even strengthened. But the average guy may suffer from
nightmares and feel estranged from loved ones. Some survivors
remain damaged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was called shell shock during the First World
War, battle fatigue in World War II and in modern psychiatric
parlance, is called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just restricted to combat trauma, either. Gang rape,
childhood sexual abuse and imprisonment in Auschwitz are all
experiences that have produced the broken person labeled with the
acronym PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, patients with
PTSD suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness or
outbursts, loss of pleasure, an inappropriate startle reflex and
problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain
scans of PTSD victims from the Gulf War, Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable
practical lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how
the process works so we can learn how to prevent it.

   Most of us will be spared post-traumatic stress disorder.
Instead our memory troubles will fall under the influence of
everyday stressors.

   We can reconcile this contradiction by appreciating the
difference between getting stressed like a normal mammal and
getting stressed like a human (over the course of, say, a 30-year

adaptive, helping to save your life, while in the latter, the
unrelenting nature of the stress response sets you up for disease.
</P>
<P>
   That difference helps explain the data on stress and memory.
Stressors that last less than a few hours tend to sharpen memory,
mostly as a result of adrenaline. If the stressor persists, the
enhancement disappears, replaced by forgetfulness, mostly because
of glucocorticoids.

<P>
   Every now and then, someone with a medical problem needs a CT
scan or MRI of the brain. With luck, the test rules out a
threatening disease and in the resultant relief, the doctor shows
the patient the scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pictures of other organs, which inspire a bemused
response, brain scans provoke awe. Rookie med students feel the
same disquiet in anatomy class when they first hold a cadaver's
brain in their hands. The brain, after all, is the Seat of the
Soul. From this mass of tissue resembling marinated tofu emanates a
person.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a child's body stops growing, the brain has long
since settled into its adult size. Which is why it's mighty
interesting when the size of some part of the brain changes
dramatically in an adult. Lately, a certain brain region has
attracted a lot of attention because it may atrophy in response to
a certain type of serious stress.
</P>
<P>
   Take a green 18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off
to a war and expose him to something truly horrific _ say, a battle
in which he's the only soldier in his entire unit to survive. Some
rare, inexplicable supermen may come out of such an experience
unfazed or even strengthened. But the average guy may suffer from
nightmares and feel estranged from loved ones. Some survivors
remain damaged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was called shell shock during the First World
War, battle fatigue in World War II and in modern psychiatric
parlance, is called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just restricted to combat trauma, either. Gang rape,
childhood sexual abuse and imprisonment in Auschwitz are all
experiences that have produced the broken person labeled with the
acronym PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, patients with
PTSD suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness or
outbursts, loss of pleasure, an inappropriate startle reflex and
problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain
scans of PTSD victims from the Gulf War, Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable
practical lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how
the process works so we can learn how to prevent it.
</P>

<P>
   There is nothing quite like a congested highway to make your
fellow human beings seem dispensable. You don't even have to be
stopped dead _ it's enough just to drive into one accordion after
another, breathing exhaust, eyeing the other lanes to see if you
should dart into them because they're moving just a bit faster.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is passing an onramp, grinding your teeth as a fresh
stream of enemies flows onto your road. Perhaps you accelerate a
bit to avoid giving way.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo Huberman understands, but he might call you uninformed.
A little more traffic, he says, might be all it would take to
transform the whole mess into a state of crystalline harmony, one
that moves everyone to his destination reliably, steadily, and
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman is a theoretical physicist at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center who, until recently, spent most of his working
hours pondering congestion on the Internet. But one day he got a
visit from Dirk Helbing of the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Helbing is a theoretical physicist who spends all his working
hours pondering congestion on highways. Working together, Helbing
and Hubemman say they have found a way to unclog highways
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their discovery is based on computer models, which have gotten a
lot better at capturing the intricacies of traffic. The newer ideas
that Helbing and other physicists have developed simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   One method treats cars on a highway as molecules in a gas, but
molecules that want to move in one direction at a certain velocity.
The computer thus must solve fewer equations to describe the cars'
aggregate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another method considers the cars individually, but as
``cellular automatons'' that follow simple rules _ ``I am going too
slow; there is a vacant cell in the adjacent lane that would allow
me to pass therefore, I shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The data that anchor these models to real conditions come from
those electric highway cables that cars must sometimes thump over.
They're called induction-loop detectors, and they measure the
number, size and speed of passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, studying the data from a set of detectors
on a stretch of highway north of Frankfurt, another Stuttgart
physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the
freeway. It's an unintended, global cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana on the freeway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. For a little while.''

threatening disease and in the resultant relief, the doctor shows
the patient the scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pictures of other organs, which inspire a bemused
response, brain scans provoke awe. Rookie med students feel the
same disquiet in anatomy class when they first hold a cadaver's
brain in their hands. The brain, after all, is the Seat of the
Soul. From this mass of tissue resembling marinated tofu emanates a
person.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a child's body stops growing, the brain has long
since settled into its adult size. Which is why it's mighty
interesting when the size of some part of the brain changes
dramatically in an adult. Lately, a certain brain region has
attracted a lot of attention because it may atrophy in response to
a certain type of serious stress.
</P>
<P>
   Take a green 18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off
to a war and expose him to something truly horrific _ say, a battle
in which he's the only soldier in his entire unit to survive. Some
rare, inexplicable supermen may come out of such an experience
unfazed or even strengthened. But the average guy may suffer from
nightmares and feel estranged from loved ones. Some survivors
remain damaged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was called shell shock during the First World
War, battle fatigue in World War II and in modern psychiatric
parlance, is called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just restricted to combat trauma, either. Gang rape,
childhood sexual abuse and imprisonment in Auschwitz are all
experiences that have produced the broken person labeled with the
acronym PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, patients with
PTSD suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness or
outbursts, loss of pleasure, an inappropriate startle reflex and
problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain
scans of PTSD victims from the Gulf War, Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable
practical lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how
the process works so we can learn how to prevent it.
</P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: MEMORY, HORMONES AND EVERYDAY WORRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us will be spared post-traumatic stress disorder.
Instead our memory troubles will fall under the influence of
everyday stressors.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters confusing, stress also can help memory. We
remember where we were when the challenger exploded; we can recall
the details of an encounter with a mugger as if it were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we've also experienced ways in which stress can disrupt
memory _ such as discovering that the stress of an all-nighter does
some bad things to memory retrieval during a final exam the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   We can reconcile this contradiction by appreciating the
difference between getting stressed like a normal mammal and
getting stressed like a human (over the course of, say, a 30-year
mortgage). In the former situation, the stress response is highly
adaptive, helping to save your life, while in the latter, the
unrelenting nature of the stress response sets you up for disease.
</P>
<P>
   That difference helps explain the data on stress and memory.
Stressors that last less than a few hours tend to sharpen memory,
mostly as a result of adrenaline. If the stressor persists, the
enhancement disappears, replaced by forgetfulness, mostly because
of glucocorticoids.

   There is nothing quite like a congested highway to make your
fellow human beings seem dispensable. You don't even have to be
stopped dead _ it's enough just to drive into one accordion after
another, breathing exhaust, eyeing the other lanes to see if you
should dart into them because they're moving just a bit faster.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is passing an onramp, grinding your teeth as a fresh
stream of enemies flows onto your road. Perhaps you accelerate a
bit to avoid giving way.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo Huberman understands, but he might call you uninformed.
A little more traffic, he says, might be all it would take to
transform the whole mess into a state of crystalline harmony, one
that moves everyone to his destination reliably, steadily, and
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman is a theoretical physicist at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center who, until recently, spent most of his working
hours pondering congestion on the Internet. But one day he got a
visit from Dirk Helbing of the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Helbing is a theoretical physicist who spends all his working
hours pondering congestion on highways. Working together, Helbing
and Hubemman say they have found a way to unclog highways
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their discovery is based on computer models, which have gotten a
lot better at capturing the intricacies of traffic. The newer ideas
that Helbing and other physicists have developed simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   One method treats cars on a highway as molecules in a gas, but
molecules that want to move in one direction at a certain velocity.
The computer thus must solve fewer equations to describe the cars'
aggregate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another method considers the cars individually, but as
``cellular automatons'' that follow simple rules _ ``I am going too
slow; there is a vacant cell in the adjacent lane that would allow
me to pass therefore, I shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The data that anchor these models to real conditions come from
those electric highway cables that cars must sometimes thump over.
They're called induction-loop detectors, and they measure the
number, size and speed of passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, studying the data from a set of detectors
on a stretch of highway north of Frankfurt, another Stuttgart
physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the
freeway. It's an unintended, global cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana on the freeway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. For a little while.''

physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the
freeway. It's an unintended, global cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana on the freeway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. For a little while.''

<P>
   Every now and then, someone with a medical problem needs a CT
scan or MRI of the brain. With luck, the test rules out a
threatening disease and in the resultant relief, the doctor shows
the patient the scan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pictures of other organs, which inspire a bemused
response, brain scans provoke awe. Rookie med students feel the
same disquiet in anatomy class when they first hold a cadaver's
brain in their hands. The brain, after all, is the Seat of the
Soul. From this mass of tissue resembling marinated tofu emanates a
person.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a child's body stops growing, the brain has long
since settled into its adult size. Which is why it's mighty
interesting when the size of some part of the brain changes
dramatically in an adult. Lately, a certain brain region has
attracted a lot of attention because it may atrophy in response to
a certain type of serious stress.
</P>
<P>
   Take a green 18-year-old, stick him in a uniform, ship him off
to a war and expose him to something truly horrific _ say, a battle
in which he's the only soldier in his entire unit to survive. Some
rare, inexplicable supermen may come out of such an experience
unfazed or even strengthened. But the average guy may suffer from
nightmares and feel estranged from loved ones. Some survivors
remain damaged for decades.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was called shell shock during the First World
War, battle fatigue in World War II and in modern psychiatric
parlance, is called post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just restricted to combat trauma, either. Gang rape,
childhood sexual abuse and imprisonment in Auschwitz are all
experiences that have produced the broken person labeled with the
acronym PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, patients with
PTSD suffer from flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness or
outbursts, loss of pleasure, an inappropriate startle reflex and
problems with memory and concentration. Those last two symptoms
have prompted recent brain-imaging studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, some neuroscientists have begun
generating magnetic resonance images of PTSD patients' brains and
carefully measuring the volumes of the organs' many bewildering
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, groups working independently reported that in
afflicted individuals an important region of the brain called the
hippocampus is smaller than average.
</P>
<P>
   The hippocampus is used to form long-term memories, retrieve old
ones and manage explicit, conscious memory. Surgically destroy the
hippocampus, as has been done in a zillion lab rats and some major
types of memory will be gone for good. Similar problems result when
Alzheimer's disease ravages the hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recent PTSD imaging studies have found atrophy only
in the hippocampus; the rest of the brain is fine. The damage,
however, is not trivial. Researchers at the Manchester VA Medical
Center and Harvard Medical School who have studied combat PTSD
patients reported that one side of the hippocampus was about 25
percent smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   While neuroscientists agree that an atrophied hippocampus and
PTSD go together, there is a lot of debate over why. One possible
explanation involves a class of steroid hormones called
glucocorticoids.
</P>
<P>
   During stress, whether of a physical or a psychological nature,
a person's adrenal glands secrete loads of these chemicals. But too
much of the hormones _ during chronic psychological stress, for
example _ can be a trigger for all sorts of stress-related
conditions, including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Because the hippocampus has lots of receptors for
glucocorticoids, it's the part of the brain most sensitive to the
hormones. Glucocorticoids can damage neurons in the hippocampi of
rodents and primates. Can excessive glucocorticoids damage the
human hippocampus? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cushing's disease, in which tumors produce
astronomically high glucocorticoid levels. Researchers have found
atrophied hippocampi on MRI scans of people with this disease. The
rest of the brain is fine, but the higher the levels of
glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, the smaller the hippocampus and
the more memory problems the patient experiences.
</P>
<P>
   When the tumor is corrected and glucocorticoid levels go back to
normal, the hippocampus slowly returns to normal size, suggesting
that the shriveling was reversible and the branches grew back.
</P>
<P>
   Is this what happens in PTSD? No one really has a clue;
researchers need to study actual brain tissue to determine whether
PTSD patients really have fewer neurons in their hippocampi than
healthy individuals. Moreover, no one knows how high glucocorticoid
levels get during a rape or a bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the Bronx
Veteran Affairs Medical Center in N.Y. have examined PTSD patients'
glucocorticoid levels and have observed that levels are not higher
than normal, but lower. They explain the syndrome not by excessive
stress hormones during trauma but by excessive sensitivity to these
hormones after the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the idea that trauma could cause a brain to shrink
could be completely wrong. Maybe we have the story backward. Maybe
the person with a small hippocampus who goes into a trauma is the
one vulnerable to PTSD. Some researchers are trying to figure out
whether a small hippocampus predisposes someone to PTSD.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Freeman, a psychiatrist at the North Little
Rock Veterans Administration Medical Center, is taking another
approach. If the hippocampus shrinks after the trauma, the extent
of atrophy should be more dramatic in survivors of older disasters
than of recent ones. Freeman and his colleagues are comparing brain
scans of PTSD victims from the Gulf War, Vietnam and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recent hippocampal research has little to say about
everyday stress and recovered memory, it does have some valuable
practical lessons for us.
</P>
<P>
   If a small hippocampus is indeed a risk factor for PTSD,
neuroanatomy should be taken into account when we decide whom to
ship off to battle. And if the atrophy is a consequence of the
trauma or the post-trauma period, scientists need to figure out how
the process works so we can learn how to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: MEMORY, HORMONES AND EVERYDAY WORRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us will be spared post-traumatic stress disorder.
Instead our memory troubles will fall under the influence of
everyday stressors.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters confusing, stress also can help memory. We
remember where we were when the challenger exploded; we can recall
the details of an encounter with a mugger as if it were yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we've also experienced ways in which stress can disrupt
memory _ such as discovering that the stress of an all-nighter does
some bad things to memory retrieval during a final exam the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   We can reconcile this contradiction by appreciating the
difference between getting stressed like a normal mammal and
getting stressed like a human (over the course of, say, a 30-year
mortgage). In the former situation, the stress response is highly
adaptive, helping to save your life, while in the latter, the
unrelenting nature of the stress response sets you up for disease.
</P>
<P>
   That difference helps explain the data on stress and memory.
Stressors that last less than a few hours tend to sharpen memory,
mostly as a result of adrenaline. If the stressor persists, the
enhancement disappears, replaced by forgetfulness, mostly because
of glucocorticoids.

<P>
   There is nothing quite like a congested highway to make your
fellow human beings seem dispensable. You don't even have to be
stopped dead _ it's enough just to drive into one accordion after
another, breathing exhaust, eyeing the other lanes to see if you
should dart into them because they're moving just a bit faster.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is passing an onramp, grinding your teeth as a fresh
stream of enemies flows onto your road. Perhaps you accelerate a
bit to avoid giving way.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo Huberman understands, but he might call you uninformed.
A little more traffic, he says, might be all it would take to
transform the whole mess into a state of crystalline harmony, one
that moves everyone to his destination reliably, steadily, and
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman is a theoretical physicist at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center who, until recently, spent most of his working
hours pondering congestion on the Internet. But one day he got a
visit from Dirk Helbing of the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Helbing is a theoretical physicist who spends all his working
hours pondering congestion on highways. Working together, Helbing
and Hubemman say they have found a way to unclog highways
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their discovery is based on computer models, which have gotten a
lot better at capturing the intricacies of traffic. The newer ideas
that Helbing and other physicists have developed simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   One method treats cars on a highway as molecules in a gas, but
molecules that want to move in one direction at a certain velocity.
The computer thus must solve fewer equations to describe the cars'
aggregate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another method considers the cars individually, but as
``cellular automatons'' that follow simple rules _ ``I am going too
slow; there is a vacant cell in the adjacent lane that would allow
me to pass therefore, I shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The data that anchor these models to real conditions come from
those electric highway cables that cars must sometimes thump over.
They're called induction-loop detectors, and they measure the
number, size and speed of passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, studying the data from a set of detectors
on a stretch of highway north of Frankfurt, another Stuttgart
physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the
freeway. It's an unintended, global cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana on the freeway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. For a little while.''

   There is nothing quite like a congested highway to make your
fellow human beings seem dispensable. You don't even have to be
stopped dead _ it's enough just to drive into one accordion after
another, breathing exhaust, eyeing the other lanes to see if you
should dart into them because they're moving just a bit faster.
</P>
<P>
   Worse is passing an onramp, grinding your teeth as a fresh
stream of enemies flows onto your road. Perhaps you accelerate a
bit to avoid giving way.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo Huberman understands, but he might call you uninformed.
A little more traffic, he says, might be all it would take to
transform the whole mess into a state of crystalline harmony, one
that moves everyone to his destination reliably, steadily, and
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman is a theoretical physicist at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center who, until recently, spent most of his working
hours pondering congestion on the Internet. But one day he got a
visit from Dirk Helbing of the University of Stuttgart in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Helbing is a theoretical physicist who spends all his working
hours pondering congestion on highways. Working together, Helbing
and Hubemman say they have found a way to unclog highways
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their discovery is based on computer models, which have gotten a
lot better at capturing the intricacies of traffic. The newer ideas
that Helbing and other physicists have developed simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   One method treats cars on a highway as molecules in a gas, but
molecules that want to move in one direction at a certain velocity.
The computer thus must solve fewer equations to describe the cars'
aggregate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another method considers the cars individually, but as
``cellular automatons'' that follow simple rules _ ``I am going too
slow; there is a vacant cell in the adjacent lane that would allow
me to pass therefore, I shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The data that anchor these models to real conditions come from
those electric highway cables that cars must sometimes thump over.
They're called induction-loop detectors, and they measure the
number, size and speed of passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, studying the data from a set of detectors
on a stretch of highway north of Frankfurt, another Stuttgart
physicist, Boris Kerner of the DaimlerBenz Research Institute, made
a surprising discovery. Between free-flowing traffic and traffic
jams, he identified another pattern, slower than free-flowing but
still steady, in which cars in all three lanes moved at the same
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerner observed that this ``synchronized traffic'' occurred most
often near on-ramps. A peak in the number of cars coming off the
ramp could cause the traffic on the highway to synchronize
suddenly, like water vapor condensing to a droplet around a
particle of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The effect often spread up and down the highway from the ramp
and could persist for hours after the burst on the ramp had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   By modeling traffic as a gas, Helbing has been able to reproduce
Kemer's synchronized traffic pattern _ and to show that it can be
caused by other disturbances, like one truck creeping past another,
slowing the flow behind. The synchronizing can even be caused by a
small trough in the number of cars merging onto a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has shown that there are many distinct phases of
congested traffic _ at least five _ between free-flowing and a jam.
Helbing has constructed a phase diagram for highway traffic which
suggests how different combinations of flow on the highway and flow
on a ramp can produce different types of congestion _ and how
easily one phase can flip into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain traffic densities, small causes have large
effects,'' Helbing says. ``In particular, most types of congestion
are avoidable _ they ... are caused by small disturbances that grow
and at some point cause the traffic to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Helbing's cellular automaton model, they simulated a
realistic mix of cars and trucks on a highway, moving at different
speeds and passing one another at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They computed the times it took the vehicles to cover six miles
of road under a wide range of traffic conditions. At one critical
traffic density_ about 35 vehicles per mile of highway _ they
observed something _ ``All of them start becoming one,'' says
Huberman. ``Suddenly the traffic is basically moving like a solid
block.''
</P>
<P>
   At the critical density, the cars and trucks adopt the same
speed, and both types of vehicle seem to maintain that speed for a
long stretch of road. That is a desirable situation, say Helbing
and Huberman: A steady speed makes for reliable travel times and
less passing, which can cause accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The solidblock state is fragile, however; increase the vehicle
density a bit and the fast-moving block dissolves into sluggish and
aggravating stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways of keeping the block intact. All you
have to do, say Helbing and Huberman, is put computer-controlled
stoplights at each on-ramp. The lights would respond to real-time
data on traffic conditions collected by wires the cars pass over.
</P>
<P>
   When the data indicate gaps in a block of traffic passing an
on-ramp, the light there turns green. When the density threatens to
shift the traffic into stop-and-go, the light turns red again.
</P>
<P>
   At rush-hour peaks, traffic would still slow to a crawl. But at
intermediate densities, Huberman says, commuters would move
smoothly and contentedly as a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people act in selfish ways, it's very hard to achieve a
common goal,'' he says. ``But here the interesting thing is you
have a rather large group of people, they're all being selfish, and
yet they all achieve a very smooth state of running through the

OPENING THE CLOSET DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At the start of his career, engineer Jason Stone worked for a
large chemical company in Alabama, where any hint of homosexuality
could have sabotaged his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not come out to people other than my parents, and I was
using the job, I guess, to get my confidence and gain some
financial independence before I made any other decisions,'' recalls
Stone, 28. ``It took about two years, but I began to come out to
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, deciding how much of his private life to reveal to his
employer was especially difficult in a corporate atmosphere in
which simply being single was perceived as detrimental to career
advancement. The average age of the firm's mostly male executive
and engineering staff was 52. Most were married, settled, and set,
says Stone, and ``their beliefs were pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone eventually left the company and earned an MBA from Harvard
Business School, but he never forgot those years or how much he
might have benefited from a network of gay and lesbian
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Stone and James Robertson, an MBA candidate at the
Yale School of Management, will see the fulfillment of a long-term
goal when a two-day national professional and networking conference
in Boston, specifically geared to the needs and goals of gay and
lesbian MBA students, opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the top 20 business schools and count the number
of gay and lesbian business students, the numbers are quite
small,'' says Robertson, 33, a native of Newcastle, England. ``We
decided to bring all these small pockets of people from top
business schools together to make a strong, professional network
for them as they enter the working world.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, titled ``From the Closet to the Boardroom,'' is
expected to attract about 150 gay and lesbian business students
from around the country. Workshops will focus on such topics as how
gays and lesbians can influence workplace policy, and keynote
speakers include Julie Palen, founder of InterNoded Inc., one of
OUT magazine's top 100 firms in 1998, and Walter Schubert, founder
of the Gay Financial Network and the first openly gay member of the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Its goal? To encourage participants to share business ideas,
make new friends, and form networks with executives from US
corporations with an interest in promoting workplace diversity. ``A
lot of good companies lose excellent employees because of issues
they don't understand or even know about it,'' notes Stone. ``And
one of those issues has to do with attitudes in the workplace
toward people who are different. I call it a war on talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in the workplace since Robertson graduated from
Dartmouth College in 1987 with a degree in painting and Stone
landed his first professional job in the mid-90s. Back then, few
companies offered domestic partner benefits or were even remotely
interested in recruiting lesbians and gays.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many large employers are promoting themselves as being
diverse, and some actually boast of a congenial workplace
atmosphere where differences are accepted. ``There is no question
that the world has changed,'' says Kim Mills, education director of
The Human Rights Campaign in Washington, D.C., a national gay and
lesbian political organization with more than 300,000 members.
``The job market is very tight now, and companies are competing
brutally for the best and brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   One example: McKinsey &AMP; Co., an international consultancy, and
the lead sponsor of the upcoming conference at Harvard Business
School.
</P>
<P>
   While Mills points to the current labor shortage as a reason for
the demand, Jack Stephenson, a partner in McKinsey's New York
office, says diversity is important ``to the meritocracy we have at
McKinsey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very interested in getting high-quality talent, and we
are actively looking at every source of talent we can get,'' says
Stephenson. ``We have, for a number of years, sponsored gay and
lesbian recruiting dinners at the top business schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also trying to build an open, supporting environment.
Places like McKinsey often have the perception of being stuffy. We
want to make sure that that perception does not continue, and one
way to do that is to eliminate artificial roadblocks to finding and
keeping talented people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills believes the current recruiting wave has prompted more
employers to develop nondiscriminatory policies and offer domestic
partner benefits to workers. These benefits, she says, ``have
become a low-cost means of keeping and attracting top employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, 85 employers instituted domestic partner
benefits, up from 51 in 1997, reports the Human Rights Campaign. In
all, 625 companies now offer the benefits to employees in
nontraditional relationships, including Avon Products, Aetna, Shell
Oil, Turner Broadcasting, and Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM has a strong anti-discriminatory policy and so does
BankBoston,'' says Mills. ``At both companies, there is ongoing
training so that people will be treated with respect and dignity,
whoever they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, there are still messages in the wider
community that say that gay people are mentally ill and need to be
reformed. So we know that gays and lesbians are not safe in every
community. They still represent the third-highest percentage of all
hate crimes recorded by the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a perfect world, say specialists. Yet national polls
have consistently shown that when Americans are asked whether they
believe people should be discriminated against in the workplace
because of sexual orientation, 80 to 85 percent consistently say
no.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that many more students, including those with
MBAs, are coming out on their resumes these days. By listing the
names of the gay and lesbian organizations they belong to, they are
saying, ``We want the employer to know,'' notes Mills. ``By being
open, the candidate gives the employer the option of either hiring
or not. It also opens the door so that the gay or lesbian applicant
will know exactly where he or she stands.''

DIRECTOR DISCUSSES PLANS TO EXPAND MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The branch that the Boston Museum of Fine Arts opens in Nagoya,
Japan, next month isn't its only expansion in the works. Back home,
MFA director Malcolm Rogers is talking with architects about a plan
for a museum that is bursting at the seams, with both art and
people. Might that parking lot go underground, and a new wing on
top? Might a bridge be built over the street that separates the
museum from its affiliate school?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's possible,'' Rogers said the other day, sitting in
his antiques-filled office, at a table covered in green baize. ``As
far as the building goes, we need a master plan. We're looking at
architects to do one, and looking at what we can do within the
existing shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Having survived a year when the museum has been the subject of
controversy and criticism over owning and exhibiting art of
less-than-perfect provenance, Rogers is looking forward. Now that
the MFA has completed a $137 million capital campaign _ money that
tidied up the museum's affairs and will not be available for the
expansion _ he's focusing on a strategic plan he says the museum
will be ready to announce ``in a few months' time.'' The plan
addresses every aspect of the museum, from the urgent need for
climate control _ which more than a quarter of the museum's spaces
still lack _ to the inefficiency of having several separate
conservation departments scattered around the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the new museum,'' which is what he's calling it, ``research
and conservation will be in one place,'' Rogers says, ``whether
that's an existing or new one. We already have a major grant in
hand for that, although it's still unannounced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One'' is a word Rogers speaks often. The museum's curatorial
departments have, until now, operated as separate fiefdoms with
dramatically unequal power, money, and space. He envisions them
becoming ``a community,'' he says. ``I have no favorites in this
museum. I want every department to shine.'' Curators at the MFA _
and in other American museums _ are losing their autonomy, and many
resent having exhibition ideas foisted on them by marketing and
education departments, or by directors. How the balance of power
between the MFA's king and barons evolves will be interesting to
see. Already, though, Rogers has reined in the wild child across
the street _ the School of the Museum of Fine Arts _ by deciding
that having one of the country's top art academies on the premises
is a plus. Nowadays, if a work hanging in the MFA galleries is by
an alumnus or teacher at the school, the label says so.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is thinking globally, too. ``Having a foothold in Asia
will be a great opportunity,'' he notes. Nagoya, which will house
loan shows of both five-year and six-month durations, will bring
$50 million to the museum over the 20 years of the contract, and
will also pay for some curatorial and conservation expenses, Rogers
says, ``so it will help turn over sleeping collections.'' Nagoya
shows will be drawn from the MFA's extensive stores, ``easing the
pressure on this site,'' he adds. ``Is that a formula we can extend
to other cities? It could be part of the internationalization of
the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Global reach is a current museum trend: New York's Guggenheim
Museum, with outposts in Venice and Bilbao, Spain, is the model.
Rogers hopes that a worldwide presence could bring more money and
collections to Boston, more than Bostonians themselves could or
would provide. ``We're looking at an international council to
support the museum,'' he says. Currently, 12 percent of MFA
visitors are foreign, a number he hopes to increase: He's already
held a press event in London that has resulted in several stories
on the museum, and on Boston as a destination. And while he's at
it, he notes that visitorship in general is way up _ 1.5 million
last year _ partly due to the more than 565,000 people who saw
``Monet in the 20th Century,'' the world's most visited art
exhibition in 1998. Again thanks to ``Monet,'' museum membership
jumped from 67,000 in January 1998 to 96,000 a year later.
</P>
<P>
   MFA Enterprises _ the umbrella for the museum's retail,
restaurant, and parking empire _ has also taken quantum leaps. The
main restaurant has shed its little-old-lady air. And there's a new
restaurant for lunch, a glass-walled structure built within the
Fraser Garden Court, where you can eat under a Calder mobile.
</P>
<P>
   The store's selection of dreary reproductions has been upgraded,
and you can now find everything from Zulu baskets to one-of-a-kind,
high-end jewelry to a Dale Chihuly bowl. Rogers is particularly
proud of a new partnership with Ars Libri Ltd., the antiquarian
booksellers, which has its own section in the MFA store, sometimes
featuring books and materials related to current shows. Among other
treasures on offer here at the moment is a fragment of the
manuscript of the first edition of ``Lives of the Artists,'' by the
16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari, and a receipt for a
painting by David.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says the shop has also begun selling work by living
artists, both local and national. He cites this as a way to give
more presence to contemporary art, which the museum has
historically neglected. While there's precedent for this _ the
British Crafts Council has long had a sales branch in London's
Victoria &AMP; Albert Museum _ Rogers says, ``There's been a prejudice
in museums against selling real art, because you're endorsing
certain artists. But I see no problem in that.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep visitors looking longer and spending more, he also
envisions lounges within the museum where they can sit, browse
through books or interact with computers, refreshing themselves for
the next round in the galleries _ or shops.
</P>
<P>
   Is the malling of the museum healthy or hazardous? Rogers
insists the beefed-up retail is good, and in good taste, and that
commercial operations ``must reflect the excellence of the
collections.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the actual shows in the museum _ which are, after all, the
point _ the past few years have seen an emphasis on blockbusters or
slick commercial displays with little or no scholarly value. But,
after a couple of contemporary photography exhibitions that were
downright embarrassments, the MFA has come up with a winning one,
the current ``Abelardo Morell and the Camera Eye.'' And the show
schedule through the millennium looks both varied and promising. In
addition to name brands _ Sargent, van Gogh _ there are major
exhibitions on subjects including ancient Egypt, Edward Weston
photographs, the history of guitar design, and the paintings of May
Stevens, the Quincy-born artist who views life through the lens of
two other women: her mother, Alice Stevens, and the firebrand
socialist Rosa Luxemburg.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also plans to beef up collections that are already
world-class in several areas. The goal of his Millennium Project is
acquiring 100 masterworks of modern and contemporary art, ``to
address a hereditary weakness that people complain about,'' he
says. His pitch to prospective donors of these works that the
museum can't afford to buy, especially to donors from out of town,
is that gifts that would mean little to a powerhouse like the
Museum of Modern Art ``would make a real difference at the MFA.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday at lunchtime, when I met with Rogers, there were
long lines to get into the parking lot and to use the ladies' loos.
The joint was jammed. It's clear the museum needs more facilities,
but unclear where it's going to put them. The artworks need even
more breathing room than the visitors. ``European decorative arts
are not well displayed,'' Rogers acknowledges. ``Nor are American
decorative arts. And there is woefully insignificant space for
20th-century art, and for art of the ancient world.'' (What does
have an adequate piece, at least of the current pie, is Asiatic
art, with 27 galleries.)
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't yet know where the increased space will be, he
does say, ``I find it unattractive to enter the museum through the
parking lot,'' which is the only aboveground space that's a logical
candidate for a new wing. Rogers, who reopened the old Huntington
Avenue entrance in 1995, also yearns to reopen the long-closed
Fenway entrance, to reconnect with the section of the Emerald
Necklace beyond, ``which could be one of the most beautiful urban
recreation spaces in America,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautions that ``we do not know if there's money in this
community'' to pay to implement a strategic plan he calls
``transformational.'' He notes that the MFA's expansion plan
``isn't nearly as far along as Harvard's.'' Harvard University Art
Museums director James Cuno has already enlisted the aid of
internationally celebrated architect Renzo Piano for his proposed
new riverside museum; the MFA, Rogers says, is still looking around
for an architect. ``But if we can make a new museum here,'' he
says, ``we can contribute to the revitalization of Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only just begun,'' says Rogers, who can look like a
jolly round-faced imp at times, but goes suddenly solemn as he
pronounces these words. ``I really mean that.''

ROLLING STONE HONORS THE GUITAR GODS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of throwing the usual muss-haired rock star or carefully
muss-haired actor onto its cover, Rolling Stone for April 1
features a curious drawing of Jimi Hendrix rising like Venus on the
Half Shell atop a pork chop, a third eye staring from his chest and
a third hand reaching from his sleeve. The occasion for the
enigmatic vision is a ``special issue'' celebrating Guitar Gods,
those all-time classic pickers like Hendrix, Keith Richards, Carlos
Santana, Albert Collins, and B. B. King, who have channeled their
hearts through their fingers, cut through our numbness and pain,
and scared us half to death with their brighter-than-lightning
licks. The feature is a tribute to the electric instrument that has
stimulated enough mind-altering music, sex appeal, political
friction, and drug drama to make its chronicler, Rolling Stone,
into one of the most successful publications in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good moment to reestablish devotion to ``youth culture's
weapon of choice during the last fifty years,'' as managing editor
Robert Love puts it. As pop music continues to become submerged in
the studio-ized magnificence of electronica and the cleverness and
scrappiness of sampling, the Guitar Gods feature brings it all back
home. Basically, the magazine asked a few dozen players to talk
about their own guitar heroes and recall their ``Great Guitar
Moments,'' the first riffs that moved them to pick up their own
guitars. Richards says Chuck Berry's 1950s records are ``rock 'n'
roll guitar playing to the max,'' and he describes his own passion:
``Everybody else is asleep, or gone, or your old lady's left you.
Well, you've always got her. I mean, the shape alone. . . . I sleep
with the thing sometimes.'' Jeff Beck praises Django Reinhardt,
Vernon Reid praises Santana, and Santana praises John Lee Hooker:
``It's like the devil and God playing together.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimonials are perked up by the sort of creative
phraseology that shows how challenging it can be to write and talk
about the fleeting power of music. Nancy Wilson says Jimmy Page's
chords were ``very left of center,'' Trey Anastasio from Phish
refers to the ``logical form'' of Jerry Garcia's playing, Reid
calls Santana's sound ``incredibly vocal,'' and Beck says that
Mance Lipscomb's blues ``sounds like a horse and carriage. It has
that atmosphere and that ricketiness. It's pre-jalopy.'' Nobody,
however, makes a comparison between Jimi Hendrix's electric guitar
magic and a piece of meat.

   The April Vanity Fair is the annual Hollywood issue, with a
triptych cover of acting's new kids. It's also, according to the
magazine, the ``biggest issue ever,'' with 414 pages of ads,
photos, ads, stories, and ads. The centerpiece is a lush portfolio
of Hollywood people, all stunning work by the usual classy snappers
_ Herb Ritts, Annie Leibovitz, Bruce Weber, David LaChapelle,
Firooz Zahedi, Helmut Newton, and Michael O'Neill. Leibovitz gives
Drew Barrymore and Gwyneth Paltrow a corpselike stillness, Ritts
turns Meryl Streep into her own best fan, and Zahedi brings us
close up to Loretta Young.

   There's a long piece by Sam Staggs in anticipation of next
year's 50th anniversary of ``All About Eve,'' the classic with
plenty of camp cachet. Staggs goes behind the scenes of the movie,
focusing on the star wars, Bette Davis's star trips, and the ``real
Eve,'' a woman called Miss X who pulled a fast one on an Austrian
star named Elisabeth Bergner.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe director Joseph L. Mankiewicz and producer
Darryl F. Zanuck first wanted Claudette Colbert or Gertrude
Lawrence to play Margo Channing. Davis, with the help of her Edith
Head outfits, left an indelible mark on the role. She also left an
indelible mark on her costars, including Gary Merrill, with whom
she fell in love on the set and married, and Celeste Holm, who
called Davis ``constantly rude.'' Apparently, Holm said, ``Good
morning'' to Davis early in the shoot, and Davis replied, ``Oh
(expletive), good manners.'' Supporting actress Marilyn Monroe also
had issues with Davis, saying, ``She didn't talk to me at all, just
sort of swept around the set, nose and cigarette in the air. She's
a mean old broad.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories _ and there are others, including George Sanders's
accusation that Davis lacked ``fundamental graciousness toward her
coplayers'' _ are juicy, recalling a time when actors could
misbehave in peace, without today's round-the-clock scrutiny by the
media.

WHEN SAILORS ARE IN PORT, SEAFARER'S FRIEND LIVES UP TO ITS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the early 1800s, Boston was a teeming port with merchant
sailing ships lining dock after dock. Many of the surrounding
streets were filled with seedy rooming houses, noisy bars and busy
brothels.
</P>
<P>
   Into this sometimes rough and tumble world some local ministers
thought there was a need to inject the word of God.
</P>
<P>
   So the Boston Seaman's Friend Society was born in 1827 with a
mission to provide for the spiritual and temporal needs of
seafarers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the society is now known as Seafarer's Friend and its
geographical reach extends to ships arriving in Portland, Maine,
and Portsmouth, N.H., as well as Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A ministry of the United Church of Christ, the work of
Seafarer's Friend has evolved as the needs of seafarers have
changed. Working on ships can be lonely, dangerous and backbreaking
work, said the Rev. Robert F.R. Peters, president of Searfarer's
Friend.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond tending to seafarers' souls, the organization, in visits
to more than 500 ships across New England each year, provides more
tangible aid _ warm winter clothes, phone cards so ship workers can
call home and tours of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The seafarers spend weeks confined to a ship and when they do
pull into port many times it's only for a day or even a few hours
because high-tech heavy machinery makes loading and unloading
vessels easier and quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many seafarers call their ships `a floating prison,' '' said
the Rev. Jan Willem Van der Werff, who spends four days a week
visiting the container ships, the oil tankers and automobile
carriers that arrive in Boston. ``You can go crazy. You live where
you work. The only people you have to talk to are your colleagues.
When you're in port you might be lucky to make one phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Van der Werff, 31, who studied theology in his native Holland,
is perfectly suited to work among seafarers. His father was a
seafarer. So was his grandfather. Van der Werff himself
contemplated following the family tradition. But his father talked
him out of it, telling his son that seafaring is not as glamorous
as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when my older sister was born, my father did not
see her until she was 1 1/2,'' he says, taking a break from
visiting crew members aboard a liquid natural gas tanker docked in
Boston. ``I thought when I started this job that things would have
changed. But it's still the same. Seafarers go out on 12-month
contracts and sometimes longer, never seeing their families. That
creates a lot of stress. And that's we have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, most seafarers Van der Werff works with come from Asia,
particularly the Philippines and India. Starting wages can be as
low as $200 a month _ seemingly poverty wages, but much better than
what seafarers can earn back home, Van der Werff noted. ``That is
if they even find a job,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Seafarer's Friend also must play an advocacy role because
many seafarers are treated unfairly by their employers _ being made
to work longer than their contract states or having their wages
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly concerned with issues of equity for
seafarers,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Seafarer's Friend has been meeting with New England
Seafarer's Mission, which ministers to cruise ships, Mariner's
House, which provides rooms for seafarers in the North End and Our
Lady of Good Voyage, a Catholic church on the waterfront, to better
coordinate services to the shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world there are about 800 maritime ministries
operating in different ports, including 200 in the United States
and Canada. In many cases a minister is usually the first friendly
face a seafarer sees after being out to sea for long stretches of
time.

FBI SEEKS SUSPECTS IN CASE OF MISSING WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 and JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONORA, Calif. _ FBI agents are questioning men with histories
of criminal violence in their quest for suspects in the
disappearance of a mother and two teen-age girls and the killings
of at least two of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reviewing leads and information on possible suspects,''
said FBI Special Agent Nick Rossi, who provided little other
information on the case.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and other investigators are believed to be looking for at
three men as possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The intense search for the missing woman and two teen-agers
ended with discovery on March 18 of the missing trio's burned car
hidden in a ponderosa pine forest some three hours north of the
Cedar Lodge in El Portal, the town near the Yosemite National Park
where the women had been staying before they disappeared in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investigators found the charred bodies of Carole
Sund, 42, of Eureka and a second person, believed to be that of one
of the girls _ either Sund's daughter Julie, 15, or their friend
Silvina Pelosso, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said they are seeking leads on the other
missing girl.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents and detectives from Tuolumne and Stanislaus counties
and Modesto have pored over dozens of arrest warrants of men
convicted of violent crimes to determine possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi said the FBI has accumulated a large volume of forensic
evidence, and much of it is being analyzed by the FBI crime lab in
Quantico, Va., but he declined to discuss the information.
</P>
<P>
   People who knew Carole Sund described her as a resourceful,
take-charge woman who would not have gone willingly with an
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that one of the bodies in that car would be Carole's,
because she would fight for those girls,'' her father, Eureka
businessman Francis Carrington, said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington, who has praised the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies, said that even so, it's hard to sit and wait for the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody knows the whole story, and we want it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of three men the FBI is looking at as possible suspects, one is
a 42-year-old ex-convict who lives in Modesto. His criminal record
stretches back to 1975 and includes convictions for a particularly
brutal rape of a relative while her children cowered nearby in a
car, as well as manslaughter, assault, drug possession and
attempted escape.

IS CORRUPTION MORE WIDESPREAD OR IS IT JUST BETTER REPORTED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's hear it for the only force greater than gravity:
temptation.
</P>
<P>
   The scent of corruption overwhelms our olfactometer at a pace
unparalleled. But is humanity getting weaker? Or are there just
more of us to tumble into the pit? So sated is the news with moral
perfidy that it's hard to find a section of the paper that doesn't
reek of human failing. Is there more corruption around? Or just
more publicity about it?
</P>
<P>
   More congressional and prosecutorial lung power was spent on the
ultimately impotent impeachment business than anyone dreamed
possible. Enough said about Bill No. 1, the heartily hammered most
powerful gent in the world. Bill No. 2 (Gates), merely the richest
soul on earth, has his legal Rotweilers on the case, trying to
stave off a probe almost as long as Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot turn to the sunny playing fields of sport for relief.
The Lords of the Rings, that secretive, self-perpetuating body that
hijacked legal ownership and commercial profiteering of the
worldwide Olympic movement, are laid bare as bribe-taking
double-dealers who resist any but the most cosmetic attempts to
shovel out the dung-encrusted stable and start afresh.
</P>
<P>
   The manly art of self-defense made a cynical lunge for the
womanly share of the pay-per-view audience. Boxing's corrupt bosses
hired as title fight judge an accountant six weeks off her
bankruptcy declaration to officiate at the Holyfield-Lewis debacle.
Her judging was as bankrupt as her accountancy practice. The
ex-champ, Mike Tyson, is locked up. As boxing should be.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you looked last week, the mighty were getting humbled.
The European Commission resigned en masse; there were apparently
more rotten apples than good ones in that barrel. Russia's top
prosecutor, the unhappy star of a raunchy sex video, had to quit,
prompting Boris Yeltsin's former press secretary to say in Moscow,
``Everyone has compromising material on everyone else, and usually
it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of Israel's third-largest political party, Aryeh Deri,
was convicted on corruption charges. The Rev. Allen Boesak, the
heroic black minister who stood strong against apartheid in South
Africa, fessed up to scamming on the side. Religion proved no
cleaner than the heavyweight title racket. The Rev. Henry Lyons,
head of this country's National Baptist Convention, quit after
conviction on racketeering and theft charges, nailed for handling
money and women, two temptations about which the Bible is
persistent and eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's defense minister? A drug dealer on a vast scale, some
disgruntled US investigators claimed to The New York Times after
they were ordered off the case. The Chinese government? Why, they
were spying on us! Who do they think they are? The Israelis? The
nerve of these Chinese!
</P>
<P>
   The US Congress, of course, is a great trumpeter of moral values
and proclaimer of personal political virtue. It spent most of last
year enmeshed in intimate ladies' apparel and only belatedly
realized its mistake.
</P>
<P>
   So our resensitized solons packed off last weekend to ``civility
camp'' in Pennsylvania for lectures and supervised recreation, not
unlike play group at the day-care center, with snacks, nappy time,
and constant encouragement to be nicer, kinder, gentler, and
remember to count to 10 before calling the other guy a scumbag, Mr.
Chairman. No word yet on whether the corrupt campaign finance
system will be changed. Maybe thay could hire the goofy lady boxing
judge to referee that debate. Or just-retired Major General David
Hale, fined and reprimanded for coercing sex from the wives of four
subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   A yearlong probe into presidential priapism wound down after a
half-dozen of his most rabid GOP foes found check marks on their
sexual morality rap sheets. To follow the papers, the moral outrage
meter is in danger of redlining. But, as Click and Clack, the
Tappet Brothers, would put it, maybe the trouble is in your gauge,
and not necessarily in your radiator core. Perhaps the media
machine is just more efficient at sniffing out scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The single most important task we have is bringing you ``the
news'' that has a bearing on how you and yours live day to day. But
our No. 2 chore is to ferret out corruption, look under rocks,
shine light in dark corners.
</P>
<P>
   Abuse of trust and double-dealing are all-too-human traits.
Nothing eradicates such sins like full, prompt and public
disclosure. Bad ink is like bleach; it kills germs. Making things
public has a remarkable and purgative impact on human affairs.
Things go better not with Coke but with disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The money people call it ``transparency.'' If the IOC made its
financial dealings public, as it should, it would be impossible to
manipulate site awards. If the Russian government had more
transparency and Russia's media were up to the job, then billions
of dollars in foreign aid that have disappeared into offshore Mafia
back accounts would have gone to the peasants who need it still.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy breeds coverup, period. Human nature doesn't change.
Temptation is the occasion for sin. The threat of disclosure is the
single greatest safeguard against succumbing to temptation. For a
lot of us sinners, fear of getting caught is the greatest deterrent
of them all. There's a lot to be said for shame. It's the cement
that holds the moral bricks together.

HOMOSEXUAL SUES BOY SCOUTS OVER FIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A gay man fired from the Boy Scouts is suing the
organization, saying his boss hired private investigators to grill
his co-workers and friends and then fired him because of his sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Keener, 46, of Sacramento, filed the lawsuit Tuesday in
Sacramento Superior Court against the Golden Empire Council,
covering 16 counties in northeastern and central California.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit opens a new strategic front, employment, in the
struggle by the advocates of gay rights to push the Boy Scouts of
America to drop its adamant anti-gay stance. Efforts so far have
focused on the exclusion of Scout members and leaders who are
homosexual or who advocate gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Kors, a lawyer representing Keener, called the
investigation into Keener's private life an illegal and
unconstitutional witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit dismisses as a pretext the Boy Scouts' stated reason
for firing Keener in September _ his acceptance of a personal
discount from a company that was a major contributor, Kors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Keener was fired for being a gay man,'' Kors said. The
lawsuit contends that his dismissal violates the California Labor
Code, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation by all public and private employers except religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Johnson, the council executive for the Boy Scouts in
Sacramento, defended the dismissal of Keener as an assistant
council executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Keener's discharge is based on his failure to properly
account for and resolve a situation involving personal use of some
contributed resources,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says Keener earned his Eagle Scout rank and in 1976
went to work for the Boy Scouts, first in San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   Over 22 years he was promoted through various other posts until
reaching assistant executive in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Keener said Tuesday he always kept his personal life separate
from his professional life. The lawsuit says he was told many times
by his bosses that any employee who was known to be gay would be
fired.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, a co-worker was called in by Johnson
and told that investigators had been hired to determine if Keener
was homosexual. The lawsuit says the co-worker was subjected to
three hours of questioning, asked about her private conversations
with Keener, if she knew if he was gay and who his friends were.
</P>
<P>
   Keener's lawyer said investigators also questioned his friends.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL IS ONE OF THE LAW'S MESSIEST CORNERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In one of the many beguiling moments in Charles
Kenney's novel ``The Son of John Devlin,'' the title character
ruminates about the law, or at least the jurisprudence he inhaled
in academe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only person I know who actually enjoyed law school,''
Devlin says. ``It was so well-ordered, and what was required was so
plain and direct. It wasn't as though you had to be some sort of
analytical genius. It's not like math or the sciences, where
breakthroughs are what matter. There really isn't anything new to
learn. It's all there, collected in one place. All the rules are
there. I like the tidiness of it. The clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Tidiness and clarity do not describe the legal grotesquerie
known as the Independent Counsel Act of 1994, based on the 1970s
hubris favoring nonpolitical solutions to politics and extralegal
approaches to the law. All three branches of government and the
public that hires them now recognize the folly of thinking, There
really isn't anything new to learn. The law that pandered to an
American appetite for antiseptic tidiness is now alarmingly messy.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Founding Fathers expect law to be used to pursue people
instead of crimes? In 1780, John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts
Constitution the aim of American democracy: ``A government of laws
and not of men.'' Adams risked his life to oppose King George III.
Would he readily surrender absolute power to a special prosecutor?
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee has held hearings on
the possible renewal of the law, which expires June 30. Senators
Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, and Joseph I. Lieberman,
Democrat of Connecticut, have engaged in thoughtful exchanges with
witnesses, but some colleagues have been as glib as Gilda Radner on
``Saturday Night Live.'' Caught in a gross error, her character
said, ``Never mind!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of
Illinois, said. ``Four years ago I voted to reauthorize this law.''
If he was mistaken, how about President Clinton? On June 30, 1994,
he called the law ``a foundation stone for the trust between the
government and our citizens'' and signed its reauthorization while
boasting that ``the independent counsel statute has been in the
past and is  &UR; today &LR;  a force for government integrity and public
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president digests his own words, he avoids direct comment
on the law. In his press conference last week, he cited his status
as the statute's most notorious victim and most famous defendant.
Clinton, who seldom heeds Harry Truman's motto, ``The buck stops
here,'' passed this buck Friday to the American Bar Association,
which now opposes renewing the law.
</P>
<P>
   Shunning partisanship by invoking a supposedly neutral authority
is part of the Watergate hangover that created this whole
nightmare. More precisely, the special prosecutor law of 1978
ignited 20 nightmares: 20 prosecutors pursuing chosen victims,
their aggregate prosecutorial record a shallow dish of thin gruel
at a total cost of $148 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Kenneth W. Starr is the answer, what is the question? That
dilemma may trouble Congress as much as its morbid fear of being
called partisan. Even Common Cause, the Marley's ghost of the
Watergate nightmare, is having second thoughts. But instead of
letting the law die, the citizen's lobby is peddling more
nonpolitical, extralegal gizmos and gadgets, anything to prevent
elected public officials from taking responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Son of John Devlin'' deals with betrayal, corruption, sin,
and the limits of law. Congress should heed its lesson, based on
that evoked by John Milton in ``Paradise Lost,'' that ``law can
discover sin but not remove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Were Congress to resume its oversight powers, it could shame the
president and errant Cabinet members into doing their duty. A tribe
of righteous congressional investigators facing reelection is
better than an insidious, nonaccountable pack of special
prosecutors.

METHODISTS SEEK TO DISCIPLINE PASTORS OVER GAY BLESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The United Methodist Church has filed charges
against 69 of its pastors in Northern California and Nevada for
going against church law and blessing a lesbian couple.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Melvin Talbert announced the charges in Sacramento on
Tuesday, along with a plea for the church to change its stance and
fully accept gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very painful day for me,'' the bishop wrote. ``I
will uphold the law, but I will not be silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on Methodists on both sides of the issue to agree to
disagree and keep working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue ... working to change the position of our
church,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The charges had been expected since the Rev. Don Fado of St.
Mark's United Methodist Church in Sacramento led 94 of his fellow
clergy members in blessing the union of two members of his
congregation in a highly publicized ceremony Jan. 16. The charges
were filed against Fado and the other 68 participants from the
bishop's district.
</P>
<P>
   Fado said Tuesday, ``I think this is an opportunity for us to
show the country how we can find unity in the midst of our
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Filing of charges triggers a investigation that could lead to a
church trial of the 69, or the charges could be dropped. At worst,
the 69 could lose their ordinations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue threatens to split the United Methodist Church and is
causing debate in every other major Christian denomination in the
United States.

THE NORTH KOREAN THREAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY DEATH STAR REDUX
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I cannot believe that there are more than 10 people between
Portland, Maine, and Portland, Ore., who lie awake at night in
feverish sweats worrying about being vaporized by North Korea. Yet
in Washington, it is as if Ronald Reagan is still in charge,
pointing at futuristic drawings for those George Lucas photo ops of
the 1980s, urging us to ring the planet with death stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly two decades since Reagan came to power, the United
States has spent $55 billion (almost half of what it would cost to
fix the schools) trying to build a missile defense system Darth
Vader would not laugh at. Darth is on the floor rolling. We have
not hit a missile in several practice attempts.
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped a Washington that refuses to give the peace
dividend a chance. Though even President Bush thought a space-based
missile system was impossible and ridiculous, defense hawks in
Congress and the weapons contractors who bankroll them kept
paranoia alive on a Capitol Hill too petrified to question
thousand-dollar military toilets for fear of looking weak on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House, in a 317-105 vote, and the Senate, in a
97-3 vote, resurrected Reagan's failed dreams. They approved
legislation to again develop missile defense. President Clinton,
ever the Republicrat chameleon, has pledged $10.5 billion over the
next six years to resume research.
</P>
<P>
   The votes came with a swiftness and lack of debate that was
incredible, given how we dissected every aspect of Monicagate. It
was abominable, given how much we have spent on nuclear weapons
programs with no oversight. It was insane, given that we already
have the power to char everyone on earth, which means that any
enemy pushing his red button has just committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   People complain about the $50 million Kenneth Starr spent over a
White House affair. The United States has spent $5.8 trillion for
nuclear weapons since 1940, a figure that is more than the combined
federal spending in the last half-century for education, job
training, agriculture, environment, social services, general
science, and space research, community development, disaster aid,
police, and energy production.
</P>
<P>
   In a groundbreaking report published last year by the Brookings
Institution, America's nuclear weapons programs have come at a cost
that, if we were talking welfare for poor folks, would make even
welfare advocates scream for cuts. We have up to 130,000
Hiroshima-sized bombs. Given that our World War II blast of that
Japanese city resulted in 200,000 deaths, we have the capacity to
kill earth's population 4 1/2 times.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``Atomic Audit: The Costs and
Consequences of US Nuclear Weapons since 1940,'' the evidence is
abundant of knuckleheaded nuclear ideas by paranoid politicians.
Author Stephen Schwartz said, ``When Admiral Arleigh Burke, chief
of naval operations, stated in 1957 his belief that the equivalent
of 720 warheads on invulnerable Polaris submarines would be enough
to deter the Soviet Union, the United States already had six times
as many deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When retired Army Chief of Staff General Maxwell Taylor wrote
in 1960 that `a few hundred missiles' (presumably armed with a `few
hundred' warheads) would satisfy deterrence, the United States
already had some 7,000 strategic nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara argued in 1964
that within a few years the equivalent of 400 megatons would be
enough to achieve mutual assured destruction and hence deterrence,
the US stockpile had almost 17,000 megatons, 17 billion tons of TNT
equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, there has always been a tremendous gap between what
informed military and civilian leaders thought necessary for
deterrence and what was actually deployed, a state of affairs that
has not changed with the end of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a tremendous gap in accountability because
Congress, according to Schwartz, ``has never held a hearing,
debate, or vote on the cost, scale, pace, or implications of the
overall program, even though the potential for waste, fraud, and
abuse is at least equal to that for entitlement programs.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the resurrection of Reagan's Death Star to
assure us of accountability, let alone sanity. Since 1957, when
Sputnik freaked out America, we have spent a total of $100 billion
on missile defense systems. Yet, as Schwartz says, ``we are not
much closer to creating a viable missile shield.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy stopped a foolish,
anti-Russian missile defense project for its cost and
ineffectiveness. He said, ``We should not spend hundreds of
millions on production of this weapon pending general confirmatory
indications that we know what we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one years later, Congress and Clinton, spooked over
countries we could scorch in seconds, rush to spend billions on
weapons. They do it with no confirmatory indication they know what
they are doing. Darth Vader is on the floor in stitches.

THERE'S GOOD REASON PRESSURE COOKERS ARE MAKING A COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the first word associated with a piece of cooking equipment
is fear, you would think the machine didn't stand a chance.
Emotions run deep, especially in the kitchen. But the pressure
cooker has defied logic.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a generation, no one has used pressure cookers except
for women who were housewives in the 1950s, who tended to cook food
to death (their children claim). Now the cookers are taking off
again, rescued by very modern cooks from a variety of backgrounds,
who all share one thing in common: too little time. People will do
anything to save time _ even overcome fear. In fact, they'll
replace fear with fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Fervor for a pot? Here's what one reader wrote to Lorna Sass,
author of ``The Pressured Cook'' (Morrow, 1999): ``You have changed
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Others must agree. The US distributors for Magefesa, a sleek
spring-valve pot made in Spain, report ``huge sales.'' Amy Aldape
of North American Promotions in Palatine, Ill., which sells the
cookers by mail order (see accompanying story), says the company
has grown 1,000 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sass waited years to hear things like this. She thinks there's
more behind the pot's popularity than the need for speed. One
factor is the redesigned, streamlined pressure cookers from Europe,
which are essentially foolproof: The lid locks into place by
sliding together with the saucepan. Another is a longing for
old-fashioned food, the kind Sass describes as having ``a
soul-satisfying aspect,'' which is where the pressure cooker
excels. Then there's the growing population of vegetarians, who are
using pressure cookers for dried peas and beans; restaurateurs, who
are also buying them for legumes; and cooks on boats and in RVs,
who are short on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, pressure cookers are going to ordinary families who
don't want the nightly meal to consist entirely of pizza and
carry-out food. ``For a family on the run,'' says Stephen Black of
the Back Bay cookware shop KitchenArts, ``there's no better thing
to have around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the pressure that builds up inside the sealed cooker,
food bubbles away at a higher temperature (250 degrees) than it
would in a regular pot (212 degrees). ``At this higher-than-normal
boiling point,'' writes Sass in her book, ``the fiber in food
breaks down and the flavors mingle in one-third or less the
standard cooking time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, you get a great flavor along with a satisfying texture.
The goal isn't to replicate your mother's overcooked pot roast but
to cook the meat quickly, just until it is very tender, and add
sophisticated garnishes _ like ginger and curry spices or roasted
peppers and fresh herbs.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround for the pot began slowly. For many years, the
only young cooks with pressure cookers were those who grew up with
them. ``I learned to use one when I was 19,'' says Judith Barrett,
author of ``Saved by Soup'' (Morrow, 1999). ``My mother always used
one, my brother and his wife cooked their brown rice and beans in
the pressure cooker, and I wanted to make chicken soup taste like
my mother's.'' She began with a jiggle-top pot, eventually
inherited her mother's cooker, then decided to move to the new
generation of spring-valve pots. ``I had eight. I gave some away.
Now I have five.''
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, pressure cookers were associated with terror,
because of someone's mother's split peas hitting the ceiling.
Everyone seems to have one of these family legends, revolving
around too much pressure that built up in a pot and sent food
flying out the top. ``I've heard so many versions of Aunt Tillie's
soup on the ceiling, I can't tell you,'' says Sass.
</P>
<P>
   But that can't happen with the new spring-valve pressure
cookers. Heavy, sturdily built, with a well-constructed bottom, the
``second-generation'' cookers, as Sass calls them, have built-in
safety mechanisms so the contents can't fly out. Even untrained,
tied-in-knots, technophobic cooks can operate the new pressure
cookers without worry.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently they do. Cheryl Trecoske of the television
shopping channel QVC says, ``They've been very successful over the
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``successful,'' Trecoske means about 24,000 cookers selling
in a 24-hour period, as they did last month. The same week last
year, 16,000 pots sold in a special offer. QVC airs segments for
pressure cookers about three times a month, says Trecoske.

ITALIAN WEDDING SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Pressured Cook,'' by Lorna Sass (Morrow,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   For the meatballs:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound ground beef
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon granulated or powdered garlic, or 1 1/2 teaspoons
minced fresh garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the soup:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups thinly sliced leeks or coarsely chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   8 cups chicken or beef broth, or combine them
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Italian herb blend
</P>
<P>
   3 large carrots, peeled, halved lengthwise, and cut into
1/2-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup pastini or other small pasta, such as tubetti or
ditalini
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds escarole, trimmed and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   For the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients
by blending them with your hands. Shape the mixture into bite-size
balls. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For the soup: Heat the oil in the cooker over medium-high heat.
Cook the leeks, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Blend in the
tomato paste and cook for an additional minute, stirring
constantly. Add the broth and herbs, taking care to scrape up any
browned bits. Add the carrots. Bring to a boil over high heat, then
add the pastini. Lower the heat to medium. Gently drop the
meatballs into the broth a few at a time. Set the escarole on top.
(Don't be concerned that the cooker will be filled almost to the
brim; the escarole will shrink dramatically.)
</P>
<P>
   Lock the lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure.
(This may take 5 minutes since the cooker is so full.) Reduce the
heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 1 minute.
Quick-release the pressure by setting the cooker under cold running
water.
</P>
<P>
   Stir gently. With a slotted spoon, remove 1 meatball. Slice it
in half and check that it is cooked through. If not, simmer the
broth, uncovered, over medium heat until the meatballs are done, 1
to 2 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Adjust the seasonings and serve in large bowls. Top each portion
with a generous sprinkling of grated cheese. Pass the remaining
cheese in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most practical size of pressure cooker is the 6-quart model
(marked 5 liters on European pots). This may seem large, but the
cooker can't be filled all the way to the top or it won't come up
to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the European spring-valve pots cost between $100 and
$170 because of the complicated pressure mechanism in the lid.
According to a rating in Cook's Illustrated magazine a few years
ago, the Magefesa and Kuhn Rikon are the two superior cookers, with
Fagor and Monix next.
</P>
<P>
   Magefesa is not available in retail stores. You can order it by
mail (888-787-9991) or over the Internet (magefesausa.com). Kuhn
Rikon is available at KitchenArts in Back Bay (617-266-8701) and
through the Williams-Sonoma catalog (800-541-2233). Williams-Sonoma
stores sell the Fagor brand.
</P>
<P>
   For all the cookers, follow the manufacturer's instructions
carefully. Kuhn Rikon's instructions, says Stephen Black of
KitchenArts, are ``clear, succinct, confidence building, and easy
to understand,'' which is what you need the first time out.
</P>
<P>
   Once the food is cooked, you can let the pressure come down
naturally without help, or use Sass's quick-release method. To
quick-release, set the hot pan in the sink and run cold water over
the top. Tip the pan slightly so no water seeps into the vent near
the handle (if there is one) or onto the pressure rod. The pressure
will drop in minutes and you can open the cooker easily. This
system prevents food from becoming overcooked.

 By MARK GREEN WITH NANCY YOUMAN  
 From ``The Consumer Bible,'' published by Workman Publishing 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Chief Justice Marshall declared in 1819 that ``the
power to tax is the power to destroy,'' taxes had been this
country's great obsession. Political careers are lost for
supporting them; millionaires go to prison for evading them. And
the rest of us _ the ``little people,'' in Leona Helmsley's
immortal words _ are left to sweat and fret as April 15 looms near.
 &HT;    Some 115 million Americans dutifully file their income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service each year. Slightly over
half of taxpayers choose to go through this painful ritual alone,
sitting at the kitchen table with paper, pencil and eraser or at
the computer answering questions from a tax preparation software
program, and measuring the extent of the damage. The rest, due to
fear or financial complexity, seek solace or savings by hiring a
tax preparer.
 &HT;    Finding the right professional can truly be a taxing task. There
is no national standard or educational requirement for tax
preparers: All you need to do is click your ruby shoes together
three times and murmur, ``I am a tax preparer'' et voila, you can
hang out a shingle and get down to business. Only California and
Oregon have qualifying guidelines.
 &HT;    And while fiscal laws are in a constant flux, one in seven
preparers has in recent years canceled subscriptions to tax
information services that help keep accountants up-to-date. The
result: U.S. taxpayers demanded $100 million in damages from
certified public accountants in 1992, according to the chief
insurance liability underwriter for the accounting industry.
 &HT;    Therefore you need to take some time to find the right person to
take care of your financial health, if you choose not to do it
yourself. Step one is to decide if you'll prepare your tax return
yourself or go for professional help.
 &HT;    If your tax situation changed little since last year, or if you
have only a few pieces of information _ one or two W-2s, some
interest and investment income, and a mortgage deduction _ consider
sitting down at home one weekend with pen, pencil, coffee and
calculator and slogging through until it's done.
 &HT;    As one business journalist who has done his own taxes for 20
years explains, ``I go it alone because of an absolute conviction
that no outsider will take as much care with my return as I will,
no matter how big the fee.''
 &HT;    You should be able to knock off your return in an afternoon.
According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 3 hours and 27
minutes to prepare a 1040 Form, plus two more hours for forms
listing itemized deductions and capital gains and losses.
 &HT;    If you decide to go it alone, the IRS offers free help with
publications, phone hotlines and walk-in centers. While telephone
assistance has been notoriously unreliable, the rate of technical
accuracy had reached 89 percent by 1993, up from 78 percent in
1991.
 &HT;    In addition, call your local IRS office to find out about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, a program that offers free
assistance to low-income taxpayers, the disabled, non-English
speakers and, in conjunction with the American Association of
Retired Persons, low- and moderate-income citizens 60 years and up.
 &HT;    Consider also investing in a tax guidebook or, if you have a
computer, a software program.
 TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE  
 &HT;    It may not be the most fun you'll have on your computer, but
various companies now offer tax preparation software, both in
stores and on the Internet, to replace the pencil and eraser of
old.
 &HT;    Three programs dominate the market. Turbo Tax (and its Macintosh
counterpart, Macintax) and Personal Tax Edge, both by Intuit, Inc.,
which controls 80 percent of the market, and Kiplinger Tax Cut, by
the folks responsible for your neighborhood H&AMP;R Block storefront.
 &HT;    All three follow a question-and-answer interview format similar
to how a flesh-and-blood preparer operates; all three are
reasonably user friendly; all three enable you to test different
scenarios to maximize your savings; and all three have become quite
affordable.
 &HT;    The downsides: The existing programs can be less than accurate
for complicated returns (with Turbo Tax getting the best results in
a Consumer Reports survey). They take a generally conservative
approach to the tax code, which may not suit more aggressive
taxpayers.
 &HT;    And, as one skeptic points out, ``impressive as some software
is, it can't put on a suit and wave your receipts in front of an
IRS auditor.''
 &HT;    Finally, it is worth noting that in a Consumer Reports survey of
26,000 readers, it took software users an average of nine hours to
prepare their taxes, as opposed to five hours for pencil-and-paper
proponents. However, to be fair, the former often faced more
complicated returns.
 A GOOD TAX PREPARER IS HARD TO FIND  
 &HT;    If your tax return is reasonably complex or if you need
professional backup, help is available. But not all tax preparers
are equally qualified.
 &HT;    Each year, Money magazine asks 50 tax preparers to calculate
taxes owed by a hypothetical household. In 1997, none of the 45
respondents came up with the same figure _ and none came up with
the magic number of $42,336, the figure calculated by the expert
who prepared the test.
 &HT;    Answers ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. Less than one in four
respondents came within $1,000 of the correct answer. In addition,
there was no correlation between the fees charged and the accuracy
of the returns.
 &HT;    A few pointed queries should help you come up with the right
person for the job. First, find out about prospects' professional
background. Ask how preparers stay current on tax developments _ do
they read specialized journals or attend seminars? As always,
recommendations from family, friends or colleagues are a good place
to start.
 &HT;    Find out if your preparer shares your financial philosophy _
whether he or she will aggressively push the legal envelope or act
in a conservative fashion.
 &HT;    Finally, ask how the fee is computed. Storefront preparers
generally charge based on the number of forms; enrolled agents and
CPAs, on an hourly basis. Steer clear if the fee is calculated
based on the size of your income rather than the complexity of your
return. Don't forget to ask if your preparer will reimburse you for
errors that result in interest or penalties.
 &HT;    Most important, look for someone whose skills march the
complexity of your return. Just as you wouldn't hire Albert
Einstein to tutor your child in fourth-grade math, you don't need a
CPA from one of the Big Six accounting firms to file a 1040EZ (for
``easy'') form. At the same time, you don't want to hire a rookie
if you're playing in the big leagues.
 &HT;    Tax professionals break down into four categories:
 &HT;    + Storefront preparers provide the best bang for the buck if
your filing is fairly straightforward (only a few documents).
Because anyone can claim to be a tax preparer, make sure to check a
prospective preparer's qualifications. You're probably in good
hands if you go to one of the large national chains.
 &HT;    H&AMP;R Block, which files one in seven U.S. tax returns, requires
all its employees to complete annual 11-week courses. For an
average of $50, you can expect a solid, straightforward job _ but
no fancy accounting to jazz up your refunds.
 &HT;    Unlike enrolled agents, CPAs and tax attorneys, storefront
operators cannot represent you at an IRS audit. Large chains,
however, will generally send a preparer to accompany you to the IRS
if your return is audited.
 &HT;    For business returns or complicated personal returns _ if you
sold a house, got married or divorced, want to claim depreciation
of assets or had partnership income last year _ consider going to a
more thoroughly trained professional. There are three kinds:
 &HT;    + Enrolled agents are certified to practice before the IRS after
having either worked at the IRS for a minimum of five years or
passed a rigorous two-day exam (only 30 percent pass). They are
skilled at navigating the system and can handle most functions a
CPA would serve, including complex tax returns, financial planning
and representing you at an audit, often for up to one-half to
one-third less than a CPA would charge.
 &HT;    + Certified public accountants, like enrolled agents, should be
considered for complex filings _ especially if your situation
involves large investment portfolios, business interests, trusts or
self-employment plans. CPAs may be especially valuable for
financial and tax planning.
 &HT;    But while all CPAs have some tax training, not all are experts
on individual returns. And while they are required to take 80 hours
of continuing education courses every two years to maintain their
CPA designation, they may do so in a field unrelated to your needs.
 &HT;    + Tax lawyers are the industry's 800-pound gorillas. They
generally do not assist in the preparation of individual returns
but rather intervene in complex issues like divorce settlements or
more adversarial IRS audits.
 &HT;    
 SIDEBAR: HOW TO GET HELP  
 &HT;    + To get free assistance from the IRA, call (800) 829-1040 or
your local IRS office. The hearing-impaired with TDD equipment
should call (800) 829-4059.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants in your area, call (800) 862-4272.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the National Association of Enrolled
Agents in your area, call (800) 424-4339.
 &HT;    + The IRS puts out more than a hundred useful booklets,
including Publication 1, ``Your Rights as a Taxpayer,'' Publication
17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' and Publication 910, ``Guide to
Free Tax Services.''
 &HT;    + Several organizations _ such as Consumer Reports, H&AMP;R Block,
Ernst &AMP; Young, etc. _ put out annual tax preparation guides. For
$15 or $20, these guides can help you prepare even moderately
complex returns.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Spring in America is a pretty mixed bag. On the one hand,
springtime means gardens and baseball and hours of extra daylight.
On the other hand, just as the weather turns fair and we yearn to
get out of the house, it's time for the annual downer: filing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Few things in history are as hated as taxes. Across cultures and
classes and entire millennia, people have feared them, resented
them and hunted for ways not to pay them. But no matter how
fiercely resented, they don't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ben Franklin's dictum _ ``in this world, nothing is
certain but death and taxes'' _ has been true since the earliest
dawn of recorded time.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are at least 5,000 years old. In fact, one of the major
reasons that the Sumerians _ the world's first great civilization,
and the inventors of writing _ developed writing at all was because
priests and kings wished to keep better track of mandatory tax
payments to temple and throne. (It was also the Sumerians who
invented history's first tax receipt _ a clay tablet, carefully
scratched _ in anticipation, perhaps, of history's first tax
audit.)
</P>
<P>
   As civilization spread through the ancient world, so too did
taxes, sometimes by tithing (voluntary and not), sometimes by
excise duties, and sometimes _ the grimmest times _ by imposing
slave labor. Direct taxes also were often invoked, although with
caveats: While directly taxing a Roman citizen was considered
insulting, it was all right to tax the province (which is why, in
Luke 2:1, a pre-tax census is taking place).
</P>
<P>
   Taxation in medieval Europe was fairly hit-and-miss, with formal
taxes tending to be imposed only during crises. An example was the
so-called ``Saladin tithe,'' imposed to raise money for France and
England to overthrow the sultan Saladin during the Third Crusade;
once the crusade petered out, so did the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval Europe marks the very last time taxes were not too
terribly taxing. From the 15th century on, as governments grew
larger and more expensive, taxes became ongoing, and the need for
collection more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the attempt to expand collections in the colonies
sparked resentment, then revolution. While taxes alone did not
cause the American Revolution, they certainly kickstarted the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The colonists despised England's power to tax them, less because
of the revenue loss (actually fairly light) than because the Sugar
Act and the Stamp Act reminded the colonists, each time they paid,
how unfree they were.
</P>
<P>
   With taxation so touchy a topic, the Founders were, not
surprisingly, rather vague on the subject when framing the
Constitution, content to allow this hot potato to cool off in the
hands of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The first federal income tax appeared in America during the
Civil War. The North imposed a 3 percent tax on incomes above $600,
reaching 5 percent for incomes above $10,000 (predictably, these
rates later rose). One interesting provision of Civil War taxes was
that taxpayers' names were routinely published in the local paper,
along with amount paid. This created an excruciating dilemma:
Obviously, the less tax you paid, the less money out of your pocket
_ but then, the less good your finances looked in the eyes of your
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the war was in progress, there was little griping about
the income tax; there was plenty afterwards, though, especially in
the Northeast, where most of the nation's power and wealth resided.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, East Coast congressmen tossed it out and replaced it
with tariffs on products which just happened to be manufactured in
their states. These tariffs was bitterly resented in the west _
``the west'' being anywhere west of the Alleghenies _ where
manufacturing was minimal and incomes in general far too low to
have to pay much income tax anyway. Soon the stage was set was an
east-west battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, a second income tax became law; two years later, the
Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. This ruling galvanized
sectional feeling, the pro-tariff east howling that the west's
continued enthusiasm for an income tax betrayed ``communistic
leanings,'' and the pro-income tax west howling back how the
country was being taken over by its 4,000 known millionaires and
their ``whorish lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A move arose, supported by Democrats, Populists and progressive
Republicans, for a third income tax _ this one's constitutional
legality to be guaranteed by means of an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over an income tax amendment became, very swiftly,
a hot political issue. Those opposed to the tax (Teddy Roosevelt's
``malefactors of great wealth'') took the position _ sound
familiar? _ that taxes were unfair because they punished success
and rewarded failure.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of income tax (``the idle, the lazy, the
shiftless,'' according to their opponents) argued _ also familiarly
_ that wealth in America was becoming too concentrated, and taxes
would help to level the moneybags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, an amendment _ No. 16 _ was ratified by the necessary
36 states. Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with a $3,000
($4,000 for married couples) exemption. With personal income in
1913 averaging $621, the 16th Amendment clearly was something not
meant to apply to most people _ only the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   This situation didn't last. In 1913, less than 5 percent of the
population filed tax returns; by 1919, this number had nearly
doubled; by the end of World War II, close to half the American
public was filing. And it's never been that low since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 160 million tax returns will be filed.
What's more, the whole rigmarole of taxation _ 1040s, W-2s, lO99s _
has become so common and shared an experience that complaining
about it, once thought highly uncouth, is now a conversational
icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes, like springtime, have become accepted as part of the
natural order _ even if, at best, it's the most grudging acceptance
humanly possible.

 By MARK ALBRECHT AND THOMAS RAY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We remember receiving a panicked call on a Friday afternoon from
a self-employed marketing consultant. Without warning, the IRS had
put a levy on his checking account, causing his rent check and
other payments to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided doing his tax return one year while working on a
major project and missed the tax deadline. Even with the best
intentions of filing the return, something had always gotten in his
way. Although this happened very innocently, he was frightened and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   During our first meeting, he confided that the tax problem had
actually started earlier. He had not filed his tax returns for the
previous seven years and the IRS presented him with a bill for
$12,000. Because he was living from month to month, there was
little hope that he could ever pay off the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   After further research, we found that the IRS had computed his
tax bill for him, without including any deductions. Using legal
deductions, we prepared the returns and most of them resulted in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Our client was ecstatic when we informed him that he actually
owed just $1,000 and would soon be free to get on with his life.
Although the bill could not be paid in full, we still negotiated an
affordable $25 monthly payment plan and the IRS finally agreed to
release the levy on his checking account, allowing his rent and
other bills to be paid in time. Thankfully, this story had a happy
ending, but it also teaches us to care for our tax matters before
they become serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   When April 15th rolls around, nearly 20 percent of the taxpaying
population will owe Uncle Sam for current and back taxes with
little or no ability to pay their bill. These are not bad or
dishonest people. Tax troubles are often triggered by poor cash
flow stemming from unintentional circumstances such as a business
failure, job layoff, divorce or health problems. Chances are you or
someone you know will face a sizable tax bill, property lien, wage
or bank garnishment or even a seizure of valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is desperate to settle over $200 billion in back taxes
and utilizes aggressive collection techniques to reduce its
receivables. In some businesses, IRS wage garnishments on an
employee will result in termination. Countless loyal Americans feel
forced to hide in the underground cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been avoiding a tax problem, there is only one
effective alternative. Simply stop worrying and negotiate. You will
not go to jail or lose your house unless you have been convicted of
tax fraud. So don't worry!
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate options by which you can reach a settlement
without causing unreasonable hardship. You may even be able to
eliminate the tax bill or at least have it greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option in handling an IRS tax problem is a monthly
payment plan called an Installment Agreement, where the balance is
paid off over three to five years. The payment amount is based on
strict IRS formulas calculating your ability to pay. At best, an
Installment Agreement puts you into a safe harbor by stopping the
collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As part of your agreement, you will make your monthly payment
plus file and pay your taxes on time. If you fail to comply, the
collection pressure returns and you are back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that it is an expensive loan with a current
effective rate of over 17 percent in interest and penalties. Plus,
if the tax bill is large enough and requires three or more years to
pay off, the IRS may attach a lien to your assets as protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next option, called Offer in Compromise, entails a dollar
settlement with the IRS. Sometimes you can pay less than 10 cents
on the dollar for your settlement without undue harm to your credit
report. The amount of your offer is based on your net worth plus a
factor of your monthly disposable income. It is always wise to
offer payment in one lump sum. The IRS also weighs factors such as
your age, health, education and future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the complex OIC process takes six to nine months if
handled by a competent tax professional. Thorough analysis and
proper planning of your financial and tax situation should be done
before contacting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Upon acceptance of the OIC, you must also file returns and pay
any owed taxes on time for a period of five years. Failure to do so
will nullify the settlement, and the old tax problem will come back
in full with accrued interest and penalties. Annual tax planning is
especially important during this probationary period to ensure full
compliance and freedom from collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your final option is the dismissal of taxes in Chapter 7
bankruptcy. The IRS is given three years to collect the tax before
you can file Chapter 7. However, if your financial profile is too
strong and tax liens are attached to your assets, then the taxes
may not be dismissible.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative route is Chapter 13, which enables you to pay
back the IRS and creditors, usually over three years, while keeping
assets and income protected.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for a period of
seven to 10 years. Yet with steady income and no new credit
problems, it is now possible to be worthy of new credit and
financing after just six months. However, proposed changes in
bankruptcy laws will make it very difficult to discharge taxes.
Should you decide to take this route, you would be wise to move
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do first? Get advice from an experienced tax
professional. After all, we are talking about the IRS. You are
extremely vulnerable in competing against a seasoned collection
officer and there is no time to master an understanding of the
numerous technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save money, many people undertake this process
alone and find themselves in more costly situations. This is
clearly a time when you want representation to protect your best
interests. A licensed CPA or enrolled agent can save you
considerable amounts of money, time and hassles without costing a
small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiating process, you can now make an
honest evaluation of your finances and prepare a realistic monthly
budget. Regardless of your situation, it is also important to
budget your projected tax liability correctly.

   Self-employed taxpayers have the additional burden of staying
current with their quarterly estimated tax payments. Have your tax
consultant prepare a quarterly tax projection to ensure that there
are no surprises at the end of the year.

   Try to think of your estimated tax payment as an additional
monthly overhead cost such as rent or phone. To help you to stay in
compliance with the IRS, the monthly budgeting process is a simple
yet highly effective tool which can also generate savings for a
more prosperous future.

   Stash away your turtlenecks. Dryclean your coats. It's time to
rotate that wardrobe. Here's a style guide to the fashion
industry's definition of up-to-the-moment cool.
</P>
<P>
   UTILITARIAN CHIC: First there were cargo pants. Then messenger
bags. Designers clearly want fashion to be useful. This season is
no exception.

June.
</P>
<P>
   5. Leather A-line skirt by designer Ann Demeulemeester, courtesy

   6. Wool sheath with cashmere cardigan by Ralph Lauren. Handbag
by Kate Spade. Courtesy of Saks Fifth Avenue. Model: Sonia Garufi.

NEW SITCOM OWES HEAVY DEBT TO SEINFELD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's like, you know, ``Seinfeld.'' And it's like, you know,
about nothing, except that it's set in Los Angeles, the capital
city of nothing, which presides over the state of vapidity, air
kissing, and locutions like ``It's like, you know.'' And it's like,
you know, much better than it has any right to be, especially
considering A) there are already too many sitcoms with 20-something
singles bantering about breasts, and B) its cutesy-colloquial
title, ``It's like, you know,'' makes you want to take refuge in a
dusty old grammar book.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, I was inclined to dislike this new ABC series, and
not just because of the title. Of the many ``Seinfeld''-influenced
sitcoms, including the successful ``Friends,'' ``It's like, you
know'' has the distinction of being the most brazen imitator.
Created by ``Seinfeld'' producer Peter Mehlman, it makes no bones
about wanting to inherit the crown, directly lifting the
Seinfeldian micro-view of life by turning the tiniest quirks into a
full-fledged comedy of manners. Nose jobs and uneven breasts all
become extended ``bits,'' with characters who are as shameless
about their shallowness as Jerry, Elaine, &AMP; Co. Two of the show's
five gabbers, Robbie and Shrug, even have inane George-and-Jerry
conversations, to the tune of: ``Don't you think the letter Q
should come a lot farther down in the alphabet?''
</P>
<P>
   Also predisposing me against ``It's like, you know'' is its
sheer soullessness. The show represents Hollywood celebrating its
own emptiness and materialism, in order to create the sort of
entertainment success that makes Hollywood such an empty and
materialistic place. The Tinseltown self-debasement is at its peak
with the casting of Jennifer Grey, who plays herself (unlike the
four other leading actors). In Wednesday's premiere, Grey, who has
undergone enough serious cosmetic surgery since ``Dirty Dancing''
to make her unrecognizable, submits to ongoing jokes about her new
face. When one character doesn't believe she's actually Jennifer
Grey, she brightly exclaims, ``Nose job!,'' and he responds, ``Just
one?'' While the quips are funny, it's a little sad to think of
Grey using her surgical mistakes as a way to re-ignite her career.
</P>
<P>
   But: the confident and ironic tone of ``It's like, you know'' is
infectious, and you may find yourself catching the buzz after an
episode or two. Against all odds, the series manages to caricature
a city that is already a living caricature of itself. The writing
is sharp, and the episode concepts are clever, including an entire
half-hour built around the observation that LA grinds to a halt
during a high-speed highway chase, to watch it on live TV. ``It's
our version of a snow day,'' one character notes. There are small
anthropological details everywhere, including an ongoing visual
joke that has the natives constantly toting bottles of water and a
forthcoming episode that finds the gang visiting an
``amnesiologist'' who can erase troublesome memories. Also, in the
manner of ``The Larry Sanders Show'' and Robert Altman's ``The
Player,'' the series features cameos by LA types like Elliott Gould
and Kato Kaelin, who show up as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As on ``Friends,'' each of the ``It's like, you know''
characters is distinct _ a real plus in the ensemble sitcom genre.
The setup has cynical New Yorker Arthur (Chris Eigeman) coming to
LA for two months to write about the city of fallen angels. He's
staying with his old friend Robbie (Steven Eckholdt), who converted
to Left Coastism after making his fortune bringing the High
Holidays home to Jews via ``Pay Per Jew,'' and a quirky fellow
named Shrug (Evan Handler). The eggheaded Shrug is a wonderful
creation, a ``trustafarian'' who suffers debilitating guilt from
his independent wealth, and who believes, rightly, that black
people don't like him. Also hanging out at Robbie's house are Grey
and a flighty masseuse named Lauren (A. J. Langer), who sometimes
serves subpoenas to criminals once she's got them on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Eigeman, best known from his work in Whit Stillman movies
``Metropolitan'' and ``The Last Days of Disco,'' is perfect as the
grumpy New Yorker with a weakness for models. Eckholdt, who
resembles a young Colin Firth, plays the transplanted Manhattanite
to a T, marveling at the mellow freedoms of the West Coast: ``You
don't even have to be interesting in LA!'' And Handler, with his
broad frown, and the bubbly Langer _ best known from ``My So-Called
Life'' _ take the show's sensibility a giddy step further into
absurdity. Only Grey, who works well as the object of humor, is out
of place, not entirely in synch with sitcom-styled delivery and
timing. She's, like, you know, a little too real.

SUPER SALESMAN DAVIS TAKES HIS LUMPS AS LYCOS DEAL IS CHALLENGED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ By early February, Lycos Inc. chief executive
Bob Davis had narrowed the search for a partner for his Internet
company to a few candidates, including General Electric Co.'s NBC
television network.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had a reputation as a super salesman, dating back to the
11 years he had spent hawking minicomputers for Wang Laboratories
Inc. But as the 42-year-old Dorchester native chatted with General
Electric chief Jack Welch, it became clear that this was one sale
he wasn't going to make. People familiar with the conversation say
Welch refused to trade GE's shares for Lycos stock, which he
dismissed as overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffed, Davis instead announced a merger on Feb. 9 with major
units of USA Networks Inc., the New York media company controlled
by Barry Diller.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Davis must close the toughest sale of his career. His deal
has been thrown into jeopardy. Investors who had hoped for a merger
that included a high premium for Lycos stock drove down its share
price by a third after the announcement. To complete the merger,
Davis needs approvals from disappointed shareholders who still hope
a higher bid might emerge for Lycos, the fourth-most popular portal
site on the World Wide Web behind America Online, Microsoft, and
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the stock's decline, David Wetherell, the Internet
investor who helped found Lycos and recruited Davis to the company,
abandoned his initial support for the deal, quit the Lycos board of
directors, and vowed to use his 18.5 percent stake in Lycos to
arrange a competing bid for the company.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other institutional investor also says he would
vote against the agreement. ``They haven't made a compelling
presentation,'' said the investor of Davis and his would-be USA
Networks allies.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of smaller investors suggest Davis does not appreciate
the potential of the new medium. To some of these critics, the
stratospheric values of Internet stocks are justified. They had
expected Davis to strike a deal with terms as generous as those
received by rival Internet portals like Excite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis is one dumb donkey!'' read one recent message on an
Internet message board devoted to investing.
</P>
<P>
   Another writer commented: ``How stupid is Davis _ I can't wait
to see him watch his career go down the toilet along with the deal
that he was so proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis has a track record of striking controversial deals
that in hindsight look like winners. Shares of Lycos dropped
significantly twice last year, after it invested in two smaller
Internet companies, Tripod Inc. of Williamstown and
California-based WhoWhere Inc. But neither drop prevented Lycos
shares from closing as high as 137 in the days leading up to the
USA agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davis says he's not put off by the criticism. ``This isn't a
business that I run by consensus,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is busy lobbying stock analysts and fund managers to
support the deal, which he says will give Lycos the chance to boost
revenue and profits immediately through partnerships with USA
Networks units like the Home Shopping Network and the Ticketmaster
event seating service.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting to put the matter to a shareholder vote isn't likely
for several months, but Davis has won over at least one major fund
manager so far. ``Davis knows what he's talking about,'' this
person said. .
</P>
<P>
   The Lycos chief seems an unlikely Internet seer, considering
that he hadn't even used e-mail before he became the company's
first employee in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was raised in Dorchester, the son of an attorney and a
homemaker. He attended Boston College High School and Northeastern
University, where he competed on the swimming team. Both his
parents had passed away by 1979, when Davis graduated with a degree
in business administration. Later, he earned an MBA from Babson.
</P>
<P>
   While attending Northeastern, Davis also spent three months as
an intern in an IBM sales office in Waltham. He applied to become
an IBM salesman after graduation, but the company wanted to make
him a systems engineer. ``The logic behind that was I had too much
of a baby face,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he took a sales job at General Electric, then joined
Wang in 1982. In his 20s at the time, Davis was part of a group of
practical jokers who secretly moved one another's cars around the
parking lot and cleaned out desks while coworkers were away,
recalls Tom Murphy, a former supervisor who is now a sales director
at Roll Systems Inc. in Burlington. ``They'd do terrible things to
each other,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, in 1984, Davis outmaneuvered IBM to gain
Wang's first pact to sell minicomputers to the Stop &AMP; Shop
supermarket chain. Then, when skeptical Wang executives balked at
the terms, Davis went back and ``talked them into it all over
again,'' Murphy recalled. Davis ``thought he had lost, and he came
back twice as hard,'' his former boss said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, Davis had become Wang's head of US commercial sales and
marketing, but left as the company's fortunes sank. He joined
Cambex Corp., a Waltham data-storage hardware company, where he was
working in 1995 when he got a call from Dan Nova, a former Wang
salesman who had gone to work for CMGI, Wetherell's Andover-based
venture capital firm that invests in Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis recalls it, Nova asked: `` `What do you know about the
Internet?' I said, `Nothing.' He said: `You're the perfect guy for
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nova needed an executive with a fresh perspective to oversee
CMGI's $2 million investment in a new Internet company called
Lycos. The firm, named after a web-spinning spider, used a
technology licensed from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh
to create an index of World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR; , Lycos has about 750 employees and reported revenue of
$55.3 million for the six months ended January.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, Davis was Lycos's sole employee, camped
in a cubicle at CMGI's offices recruiting talent and capital. The
Web was just starting to become popular, but friends wondered why
Davis had left a secure sales career for the untested medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see the vision behind this thing, but Bob knew it
was going to be big,'' said Rich Davis, a friend who's not related,
who says he passed up an offer to join the fledgling company.
</P>
<P>
   That's now cause for teasing, Rich Davis says. For example, Bob
Davis will ``point things out in magazines and ask my wife if she
likes them. If she says yes, he'll say, `That's too bad. Rich could
have bought that for you,' '' Rich Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great at taunting. But if you go up against him, you're
going to lose,'' said John Troy, a neighbor of Bob Davis in
Southborough, where the Lycos chief lives with his wife and their
three children.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lycos's most recent proxy statement, filed in
November, Davis earned $250,000 last year in salary and bonus. In
addition, he was listed as the beneficial owner of 349,475 Lycos
shares, worth $31.9 million at  &UR; yesterday &LR; 's closing price of 91
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Davis say he is annoyed by the criticism of the
USA Networks deal by his own shareholders, particularly Wetherell,
who initially voted for the agreement. (Wetherell, on vacation,
declined to be interviewed for this article.)
</P>
<P>
   Davis declines to discuss the naysayers but insists that he put
together the best deal possible, after discussions with other
potential merger partners. Other people say those companies
included Time-Warner, Bertelsmann, and CBS Corp.
</P>
<P>
   No other companies were willing to offer billions in cash or
stock, Davis says. ``Many were willing to trade on-air promotion
and their Internet sites,'' Davis said. ``But in terms of putting
in real assets, none of them were willing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The USA-Lycos deal, he insists, remains the best one for
shareholders in the long run. If only he can make the sale.

THE SHOW WENT ON _ AND ON AND ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the 1999 Oscarcast has finally concluded _ how long did
the show run this year, three days? _ I can offer my assessment of
the festivities: ``Zzzzzzzzzzzz...''
</P>
<P>
   Being a chronic insomniac, I am highly qualified to offer
irrefutable testimony that the decision of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences to move its awards show from Monday to
Sunday was a stroke of genius. Sunday night is usually the worst
night of the week for me, sleepwise, but that
four-hour-and-then-some Oscar show was a miracle cure. I was
sleeping like a baby by the time Whoopi Goldberg made her third
costume change.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm kidding. I watched the whole thing, including the
excruciating pre-show shows on and around the celebrity-trampled
red carpet and all the post-show shows, from the party-hopping
inanity on ``E!'' to the special edition of ABC's ``Politically
Incorrect'' that wandered onto the airwaves at 3 a.m. or so.
</P>
<P>
   I saw more Oscar coverage than the law allows, as David
Letterman might say.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, David Letterman. The critics trashed his performance as
Oscar host a few years back, but I would have happily traded
Whoopi's repertoire of one-note political jokes and tasteless
sexual innuendoes for a few minutes of a smirking Dave saying:
``Oprah _ Uma. Uma _ Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a shame that the longest awards show in the history of
the universe couldn't at least have given us the irrepressible
Billy Crystal, whose handling of the emcee duties in recent years
has occasionally approached the sky-high standards set so long ago
by best-ever Oscar host Bob Hope and his worthy successor, Johnny
Carson.
</P>
<P>
   When Crystal hosts the Oscars, he clearly understands that the
show is not about him _ it's about the movies and the movie people
who are being honored. He also understands that political humor
must cross ideological and partisan boundaries to be funny. If it
doesn't cross those boundaries, it isn't humor _ it's propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi Goldberg's anti-Republican shtick was tedious, but it
would have been a lot easier to stomach if she could have somehow
racked her brain and conjured up a punch line or two that ridiculed
a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi wasn't trying to amuse the millions of movie fans who may
not be Democrats, of course. She was working a room that was
overpopulated not just by Democrats but by left-wing-nitwit
Democrats. We saw the leftwits in action _ or nonaction, as it were
_ when they sat on their hands during the presentation of a
lifetime achievement award to Elia Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan happens to be one of the greatest moviemakers of all time.
He also happens to be a man who committed the politically
unforgivable sin _ for the left _ of blowing the whistle on
Stalinists in the early 1950s, when Hollywood was blacklisting
known and suspected members of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic that Kazan's enemies were describing him in recent
days as a ``Benedict Arnold'' when in fact most red-blooded
Americans in the '50s would have considered communists to be
traitors and the people who exposed them to be patriots.
</P>
<P>
   And how ironic that actor Rod Steiger, who turned up on the
post-Oscar edition of ``Politically Incorrect,'' has been so
harshly critical of Kazan in recent interviews but apparently had
no qualms about appearing in Kazan's ``On the Waterfront'' _ a Best
Picture winner that launched Steiger's career two years after Kazan
supposedly betrayed all of moviedom.
</P>
<P>
   What's that, Rod? No instruction on the meaning of hypocrisy at
the Actors Studio?
</P>
<P>
   OK. I've stalled long as long as I can. Time to face the music:
I missed five out of seven on my Oscar predictions. I can't
remember a year when I was so far off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to me and other failed amateurs, however, I feel
obligated to point out that most of the expert prognosticators were
just as awful.
</P>
<P>
   About the only pre-Oscar prediction that was absolutely
accurate, in fact, was the prediction that this year's Oscars were
impossible to predict.

   BOSTON _ Atyia Allen and Amanda Boege are friendly, but not best
friends. They say ``hey'' in the hallways of Lincoln-Sudbury High
School, where both are seniors. But neither would normally invite
the other home for a sleepover, for example, or find enough in
common to even talk on the phone.

   Yet there they were three nights ago in the Allen family's
apartment in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, lying side by side
under a pink and blue quilt, blond Amanda in her suburban farmer's
market T-shirt and black Atyia in her Jamaican floral headwrap,
looking every bit the cultural contrasts they are.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to an invitation by seven Metco students at
Lincoln-Sudbury to six classmates and five teachers to spend five
days and four nights in their Boston homes, the girls found that,
pajamas being a great equalizer, they share at least a little
common ground:
</P>
<P>
   Both have considered being doctors; both got early acceptance to
college; both are still trying to figure out who their prom dates
will be.
</P>
<P>
   And they both think that for Metco to really succeed in its
integration mission, kids need to spend the night at each other's
homes, tour each other's neighborhoods, eat dinner at each other's
tables, and worship at each other's churches, as they have done
over the past four days.
</P>
<P>
   The city/suburban slumber party was Metco student Monique
Worrell's idea in January, and Superintendent John Ritchie, who
joined in by spending three nights at Monique's house, was
immediately enthusiastic. Metco is a Boston-area program that
enables children from the city to attend suburban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Says Amanda, ``I signed up for this program because I felt it
would give me a better idea of what it would be like to be a Metco
student _ to be in the minority, to have to work so hard to get to
school every day, to go to a school in a place so different than
where you live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't change the color of my skin, so I'm still missing half
of it, but I'm getting a pretty good idea of how they might feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda was one of eight local students eager to take the Metco
kids up on their offer. Most of her classmates, she says, have only
seen the Boston tourists see: Copley Place, Faneuil Hall, and
Newbury Street. She considers herself more worldly: Her father
lives in Brighton and she attended Boston public schools until
third grade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Thursday's bus ride home with Atyia to Dorchester _ a
60-minute odyssey that begins at a Sudbury wildlife refuge and ends
at the Ruggles MBTA station _ Amanda, the only white person on
board, feels awkward. Hands jammed in her pockets on the way home
from a pizza parlor, she lets Atyia do most of the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to put yourself in the position of being the
minority,'' Amanda says later. ``I was the only white person
walking down the street, or on this bus. This is how they feel
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Atyia, an outgoing, talkative, self-confident 17-year-old,
suprises Amanda by telling her that she was so intimidated as an
elementary school Metco student in Lincoln that she didn't speak in
class for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today she says she would never return to public school in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I wanted to go to college, I'd better come out here
than go to a Boston school. It's all in the name,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Their clothing personifies the girls' completely different
personalities: Atyia favors gold chains, short skirts, clunky high
heels, and easy laughter. Amanda wears tiny silver earrings,
corduroys, sneakers, hooded sweater, and shy smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is connection.
</P>
<P>
   Still far from turning the corner from classmates to
``girlfriends,'' Atyia says that at least now when they pass in the
hallways, ``We'll talk, we'll have something to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next time, I can sleep at her house.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicken curry is simmering, rice is boiling, and stomachs are
growling at Monique Worrell's house on Hewins Street in Dorchester.
Monique is hosting dinner for her Lincoln-Sudbury guests: school
newspaper editor Jonathan Sclarsic, 17; Ritchie, who is both
superintendent and school principal; and teachers Caroline Han
(history) and Tom Hooper (English.)
</P>
<P>
   While her mother cooks, Monique, 17, tries to do homework on the
kitchen island. Her younger brothers start teasing that she should
go to the prom with Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   Monique laughs gamely, but glares at her brothers when Jonathan
isn't looking.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan, an intensely earnest young man who has worked as a
page in Washington for US Representative J. Joseph Moakley
(``fighting poverty and homelessness''), says he wants to
experience what city life was really like (is there really steady
violence?), where Metco kids really live (do most live in the
projects?) and how long the bus ride really takes (do they really
have to get up at 5 a.m.?).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see another culture and what urban living is like;
something we don't get much of in Sudbury,'' he said. ``It's much
nicer than I thought it would be. Much nicer. And it's quiet and
safe. I think it's going to be an interesting experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Monique, a born politician, (her mantra: ``Where is the
justice?'') says she considers school leaders like Jonathan a key
to her cause:
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get one kid to go back to the school and say, `You
should see how nice Monique's house is,' or `Their neighborhood is
really safe,' then we'll be happy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan and the superintendent have their own rooms in
Monique's elegant, Victorian home, which was renovated by her
father, Cecil, a school bus monitor by day and carpenter by night.
The family is proud to show off his handiwork: the gourmet kitchen,
formal dining room with crystal chandelier.
</P>
<P>
   Those details are not missed by Jonathan, whose architect father
built his family's contemporary home, which sits on 11 acres in
Sudbury and is shaped like a wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house is nice, even by Sudbury standards,'' Jonathan
observes.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is ready. Sharon Worrell, Monique's mother, changes from
her blue hospital uniform (she is a mental health worker) to a
floral dress to serve her daughter's guests. She and her husband
and sons then eat in the kitchen, insisting that Monique's friends
take the table set with white linen and fine china.
</P>
<P>
   Monique says grace, as everyone stands behind their chairs,
heads bowed, while gospel music trickles in from the den.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation is polite, if somewhat reserved, but the group
is eager enough to continue that they all end up in Monique's
bedroom to hang out and gossip _ including Ritchie, who has been
criticized by some Metco students recently for imposing a mandatory
after-school tutoring program for any Metco student with a C
average, a rule not imposed on the other students.
</P>
<P>
   On this night however, Ritchie scores points just for being
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe the superintendent is hanging out on my
bed,'' said Monique, laughing. ``What have I done?''
</P>
<P>
   It's 6:30 a.m. Friday, but it might as well be the middle of the
night as far as Howie Fugate is concerned. Like most
Lincoln-Sudbury students, he drives his own car to school _ three
minutes away _ and can sleep until 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, after spending the night in Dorchester with his
friend and football teammate Daryl Short, Howie is barely awake as
the Metco bus makes its way from Codman Square to the Mass Pike.
</P>
<P>
   Although Howie and Daryl have been friends since 9th grade,
Howie had never been to Daryl's house. So the two bonded the
previous night in a male way: They watched basketball and talked
sports.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Howie is horrified at how early (5:15) Daryl has
to wake up to get to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see now how hard it is for him to get to school, do his work
and then play football,'' said Howie. ``This whole experience has
just given me a greater appreciation for everything the Metco kids
go through to be at my school. I mean, I take the place for
granted, but they really have to work to be there. Sympathy, that's
what I feel. Sympathy and admiration.''
</P>
<P>
   At the back of the bus, Emma Miniscalco, 18, of Sudbury, is
talking about her experience with Natalie Brown, 17, of Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so isolated in my town. They were saying to me,
`Don't get shot','' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie was appalled. ``Who said that? WHO SAID THAT? I want
names!'' Emma demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why we did this program,'' Natalie told her. ``You
have to go back and tell them that is just not true. The city is a
safe place; my family is like your family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell them it's pretty courageous to be a Metco
student,'' Emma said.

<HEADLINE>
BIAS AGAINST WOMEN FACULTY MEMBERS MEASURED AT MIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE _ The women professors at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology presumed that their numbers were low for the reason
everyone had accepted as fact: Girls just don't like science.
</P>
<P>
   Then they took out their tape measures.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaking around the nation's most prestigious institute of
science in 1994, 15 women went office to office comparing how much
space MIT awarded women with what men of equal status got. It was
less by about half.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries were less, too. As was the research money given to
women. And the numbers of women on committees that made decisions
about hiring and funding.
</P>
<P>
   There were no women department heads and never had been. And
while MIT lavished raises on men who got job offers elsewhere, it
simply let the women leave. They might have been expected to leave,
anyway, since MIT had made most of them so miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Like most universities facing complaints of bias, MIT at first
resisted the women's charges of inequity, resisted even giving them
data they asked for.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike schools that have waited for lawsuits to act, MIT did
something rare in academia: The institute looked at the numbers and
admitted it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   And in a report that will be presented to the faculty later this
month, MIT's top administrators, all white men, will admit they
have discriminated against women for years, in ways that are subtle
and unintentional but very real.
</P>
<P>
   MIT has done more. In the four years since the women faculty
first suggested there was bias, the institute has raised women's
salaries an average of 20 percent, to equal men's; increased
research money and space for women; awarded them key committee
seats; and increased the pensions of a handful of retired women to
what they would have been paid if the salary inequities had not
existed.
</P>
<P>
   It's all because three unhappy women professors happened to
compare notes one day.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how these women got MIT to recognize and
acknowledge bias offers a portrait of how discrimination works,
often so subtly that many women themselves don't believe it exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that contemporary gender discrimination
within universities is part reality and part perception,'' MIT
president Charles M. Vest wrote in a letter prefacing the report.
``True, but I now understand that reality is by far the greater
part of the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   National numbers were bad, too
</P>
<P>
   It might have been easy in 1995 to dismiss the numbers as a
reflection of the national picture. A full academic generation into
the women's movement, only 26 percent of tenured faculty nationwide
were women, compared with 18 percent in 1975. It's not that women
aren't entering academia; in 1995, 43 percent of faculty in
tenure-track positions nationwide were women, according to the
American Association of University Professors. The problem has been
especially pronounced at elite universities.
</P>
<P>
   Because the numbers were so small, a woman who suspected
discrimination might as easily conclude that she was the victim of
circumstances particular to her case.
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1994, when MIT told Nancy Hopkins, a
prominent DNA researcher, that it would discontinue a course she
had designed that was now required for 1,000 students a year.
</P>
<P>
   She had worked for five years to develop the course; in the
previous two years, a male professor had joined her in teaching it.
The man, MIT informed her, was going to turn the course into a book
and a CD-ROM _ without her.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins drafted a letter to Vest about how she felt women
researchers were treated, which she described as her ``enough is
enough'' letter. When Hopkins discussed it with a woman colleague,
she asked to sign it, too. They got to talking about their
situations, and eventually the discussion expanded to a third
tenured woman on the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to poll every tenured woman in the School of
Science _ one of five at MIT _ to see whether what they had
experienced were individual problems or part of a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   They were surprised to find out how fast they got their answers.
Within a day, they had talked to all 15 tenured women (there were
197 tenured men) and agreed that there was a problem and that
something had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   True to their fields, they looked first at the data.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of tenured women on the faculty had not moved
beyond 8 percent for two decades. There was little hope for change:
Only 7 women were on the tenure track, compared to 55 men.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of women were entering science in the first place. In
half the six departments in the school of science, there were more
women undergraduates than men.
</P>
<P>
   Was child rearing part of the problem? Certainly, childbearing
years coincide with the years when most women get tenure. And,
true, of the women with tenure, half had children, which is
statistically low.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a minor part of the story. The main part was
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem had to do with the way MIT paid salaries,
requiring professors to raise a portion of their salaries from
outside grants. And women were required to raise twice as much in
grants as men.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the information the women needed was not without
struggle. When they asked for information on space awarded to
women, MIT insisted they got the same space as men. But when the
group checked the numbers, the women realized that was only because
the institute had counted office and lab space for women, but only
office space for men.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, some women said they had sensed discrimination but
feared that they would be dismissed as troublemakers or that their
work would suffer from the distraction of trying to prove their
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women had devoted their lives to science,'' Hopkins
said. ``There was a feeling that if you got into it, you weren't
going to last; you'd get too angry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hurdles in getting research money, space, or support
were already costing them time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes 50 percent of your time and 90 percent of your
psychic energy,'' Hopkins said. ``Time is everything in science.
Six months can cost you the Nobel Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints won a `total convert'
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, the women presented a report to Robert
Birgineau, dean of the School of Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unequal treatment of women who come to MIT makes it more
difficult for them to succeed, causes them to be accorded less
recognition when they do, and contributes so substantially to a
poor quality of life that these women can actualy become negative
role models for younger women,'' the women wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they said, they were so miserable that any young woman
looking up at them would think, ``Why would I want that?''
</P>
<P>
   All 15 women crowded into his office to present the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many unhappy faculty at a university, so for each
one, you might be able to rationalize why that person might be
unhappy,'' Birgineau said last week. ``But meeting this whole group
of women together, it was very much the whole was more than the sum
of the parts. You could not rationalize their situations as based
on the idiosyncrasies of individuals. It took this set of women
coming together and speaking in one voice to see what the issues
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Birgineau, Hopkins said, ``became a total convert.''
</P>
<P>
   He did his own quick investigation to see if the numbers were
correct. (They were.) And he made quick remediation. Immediately,
he boosted women's salaries an average of 20 percent and eliminated
the requirement that women raise part of their salaries from
grants; MIT is moving to eliminate the system for men, as well. He
began aggressively recruiting more women faculty.
</P>
<P>
   He also moved to set up a committee that would investigate
gender inequities further, as the women faculty had requested.
While the women had anecdotal evidence of similar bias in the four
other schools at MIT, they and the dean decided, to save time, to
limit the investigation to the School of Science.
</P>
<P>
   But merely setting up the committee took six months, as
Birgineau struggled to convince department heads that a problem
existed. The department heads suggested that the women simply
didn't do as well in the masculine, competitive culture of MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with a push from Vest, the department heads agreed to
participate. The committee consisted of a woman from each of the
six departments in science _ except for math, because there were no
women math professors _ and three department heads.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told the committee how her department head had
withheld the fact that she had children when her name came up for
tenure; it would be a strike against her, he told the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Another told how she told her male supervisor she wanted to run
a larger lab. ``Do you think you can?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The report, stripped of the most damning stories about
individuals, was released to faculty members on the institute's Web
page this week and will soon be released in a faculty newsletter.
It acknowledges that there is evidence of ``subtle differences in
the treatment of men and women,'' ``exclusion,'' and, in some
cases, ``discrimination against women faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   The inequities, the report said, extended to salaries, space,
research, and inclusion of women in positions of power. An
underrepresentation of women making key decisions had bred male
``cronyism'' that for women meant ``unequal access to the
substantial resources of MIT.'' While junior women faculty were
generally supported, their supervisors began to marginalize them as
they advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if this was an institution that didn't want
women,'' said Molly Potter, a cognitive scientist. ``There's
acceptance of them in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it came to decisions about who gets what, who
succeeds, who gets the creamy appointments, who gets the awards
that can be distributed by recommendation or the will of the
department head, it's the buddy system,'' Potter said. ``The men
were the buddies of the men.''
</P>
<P>
   The report dismisses the argument that women didn't succeed
because they weren't good enough. ``The opposite was undeniably
true,'' it says, noting that 40 percent of the 15 women have been
named members of the National Academy of Sciences or the Academy of
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just men who raised talent as an explanation for
women's failure to thrive; some women had secretly worried it might
be true about themselves. And that was precisely what made it so
hard for them to speak up for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough, because the whole debate about affirmative
action we're having in this country is based on the fact that along
with affirmative action comes the feeling on the part of the
recipient that `maybe I only got here because I am a woman or a
black or something,' '' said Lotte Bailyn, the dean of the MIT
faculty and a professor at the Sloan School of Management who
studies barriers to women and minorities in the workplace. ``It's
clearly not true here, as I think in most places, but many women
don't want to get caught in the possibility that they or other
people might think so.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade's progress in one year
</P>
<P>
   MIT has responded, as one woman said, with ``more progress in
one year than was accomplished in the previous decade.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to salary, space, and resource increases, Birgineau
said he expects to have a 40 percent increase in the number of
women with tenure next year, bringing the percentage to above 10
for the first time. The institute corrected some pensions, one by
$130,000, the other by $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   MIT is also looking at ways to allow women to incorporate child
raising into scientific careers, with, for instance, a provision
allowing them to stop teaching and then get back on the tenure
track without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Birgineau said, five of the six women expected to
get tenure this year have children.
</P>
<P>
   The report urges the establishment of committees in the four
other schools at MIT and a similar effort to consider why
minorities have not made progress in science.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic could argue that the institute addressed the problems
only because it realized it might soon be looking at a lawsuit. The
federal government last month filed suit against Stanford, for
instance, for not doing enough to aid the progress of women.
</P>
<P>
   But among the women, any cynicism yields to gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unhappy at MIT for more than a decade,'' one woman told
the committee. ``I thought it was the price you paid if you wanted
to be a scientist at an elite academic institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``After . . . the dean responded, my life began to change,'' she
said. ``My research blossomed; my funding tripled. Now I love every
aspect of my job. It is hard to understand how I survived _ or
why.''

MUSIC CELEBRATING MARY VISION HITS BILLBOARD CHARTS _ 400 YEARS
LATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Unless you were living in Central America
400 years ago, you've never heard anything quite like ``Guadalupe:
Virgen De Los Indios.'' Slow, soothing, gorgeous in its hymnal
softness and punctuated by percussion and wind instruments such as
rocks, log drums and clay flutes, ``Guadalupe'' is a true hybrid:
part classical, part world beat.
</P>
<P>
   This second effort by the San Antonio Vocal Arts Ensemble is
reminiscent of Gregorian chants, and for good reason: The music was
influenced by European vocals of the 1400s and 1500s. But its
percussion is as much a part of Native American traditions. And its
subject matter is older than the Pilgrims. These 18 brief songs,
dating from 1585 to 1600 and hidden away in a church attic for more
than 350 years, celebrate one of the most famous events in Mexico:
the appearance of the Virgin Mary to Juan Diego on Dec. 12, 1531.
</P>
<P>
   This merging of vocals, percussion and sacred subject matter has
made ``Guadalupe,'' on the tiny Talking Taco label, a hit with
devout Catholics and lovers of ethnic music. The CD recently landed
in the Top 15 of the Billboard Top World Music Albums chart,
alongside artists such as the Gipsy Kings and Ry Cooder's Buena
Vista Social Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it stirs a chord with people,'' says Christopher
Moroney, a graphic artist who, with his wife, Covita, marketing
director of the San Antonio Symphony, formed SAVAE in 1989. They,
along with members Lee P'Pool, Kathy Mayer, Jody Noblett, Paula
Olsen and Tanya Moczygemba, saw it as a way to celebrate early
music, especially that of colonial Latin America. ``People are
looking for a spiritual experience through music, and the story has
a mystical quality to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But that story might well have begun and ended back in the 1500s
_ if not for a chance discovery in a small Guatemalan village in
1963.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the Virgin to Diego, a Nahua Indian, was the
catalyst for the conversion to Catholicism of millions of people in
Latin America. Symbolizing the merging of the Native American and
European cultures, the event was celebrated endlessly in song and
story.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan Tomas Pascual was a devotee of the Virgin. He wrote
songs with titles such as ``De la Sagrada Maria'' (''From the
Sacred Mary)'' and ``Virgen Madre de Dios'' (''Virgin Mother of
God).'' These popular songs were sung in churches and small
villages.
</P>
<P>
   And then, sometime after 1600, the manuscripts of these and
other songs were put in a small wooden box. Some were in Nahuatl,
the language of the Aztecs; others were in Guatemalan dialects,
archaic Spanish or Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Centuries passed. At some point, the box was put in the attic of
a small church in the village of Santa Eulalia. And there it might
have stayed, forgotten, if not for Father Daniel P. Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the church's roof was being repaired. Jensen, recently
assigned to the area, scrambled up to the dusty attic and
discovered the box. Curious, he opened it.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen looked through the music, much of it in what appeared to
be its original deerskin bindings, and knew he had _ well, he
didn't know what he had. He mailed a page to Robert Stevenson, a
friend and music professor in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson got on a plane the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a musicologist, he recognized this as an original
document from the 16th century, music from the century of the
Spanish conquest,'' Moroney said. ``This obviously was an exciting
historical find.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, the songs went on a long trip.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson became a professor at the University of California at
Los Angeles and published some of the music in his ``Inter-American
Music Review.'' In 1981, it was transcribed by musicologist Sheila
Raney Baird for her master's thesis at what was then North Texas
State University in Denton. From there, it went into two archives:
those of the University of Texas and the Lilly Library in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroneys had seen Stevenson's UCLA journal years before and
had used a couple of Pascual pieces on their first CD, 1997's
``Native Angels.'' The CD included music from colonial Latin
America from Peru, Cuba and Mexico. Then, after a concert in 1996,
Moroney was approached by a Mexican musicologist, Dr. Oscar
Garcia-Landois.
</P>
<P>
   Did they know, he asked, that there were far more Pascual pieces
available?
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Landois mailed transcriptions from the attic box to the
Moroneys, who were interested but unsure that the music would work
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already knew our second CD would be about the Virgin; you
can't overlook her importance and the event in the development of
Mexican civilization,'' he said. ``But initially I didn't think we
could use them. They were almost too simple.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Moroney had discovered ``Cantares Mexicanos,''
by drummer Don Francisco Placido. ``Cantares,'' which included drum
patterns in syllable form, had been compiled in the mid-1500s at
the behest of Aztec nobles to document their culture. The marriage
of Pascual's lyrics and Placido's percussion patterns clicked.
</P>
<P>
   Released in fall 1998, ``Guadalupe'' was immediately embraced by
the large Catholic population of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This CD is a major contribution to the whole field of
Guadalupe studies,'' said Father Virgil Elizondo, a San Antonio
resident and author of several books on the Virgin. ``It brings the
story out in music and represents the power of the event and its
consequences. It allows people to experience musically what
happened. People can remember it in a poetic way.''
</P>
<P>
   The night they heard ``Guadalupe'' had made the ``Billboard''
chart, SAVAE members were rehearsing; they celebrated with
champagne and then got on with business. They're preparing for
upcoming shows and arranging material for their next CD, expected
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to explore `Cantares'' deeper,'' Moroney said.
``The idea is to show what the Aztec civilization was and what the
Spanish civilization was through music and they fused what that
music became.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of interest, and it's great, but I don't
think we'll be giving up our day jobs anytime soon.''

   MAMMOTH-MANSIONS (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ As the Florida sun beats
relentlessly on the perfect palms and spotless thoroughfares, the

SXSW HIT HIGH NOTES _ AND SOME LOW ONES, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
and MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Austin's South by Southwest music festival, which concluded
Sunday, is an enormous undertaking. That's why people go: to be
immersed in music, swept along by the momentum of having so many
choices in what to see and where to go.
</P>
<P>
   There's more than any one person can catch, no matter how hard
you try. Here, two music writers pick the fest's highlights _ and
its lowlights:
</P>
<P>
   DAVE FERMAN'S GOOD STUFF:
</P>
<P>
   _ Many performers coming to Austin with a lot of buzz delivered
the goods. Among them were Mercury Rev, Beth Orton and Chuck E.
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   _ New-to-me acts, including California band Grandaddy, North
Carolina power/roots-pop quintet The Pinetops and Chicago
singer/songwriter Chris Mills.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the Stars, a new venue behind the Under the Stars
vintage clothing store. Bands (such as Wayne ``The Train'' Hancock
and Teddy Morgan) play under the trees, illuminated only by tiki
torches, a street lamp and candles.
</P>
<P>
   _ More international and label-showcase nights than ever. It's
nice to have a number of bands from a given country (Japan, Finland
and Ireland were three this year) or on a given label, such as V2
or Jacknife, all on the same bill.
</P>
<P>
   MALCOLM MAYHEW'S GOOD STUFF:
</P>
<P>
   _ Like finding a great CD in a cut-out bin, you can stumble on
some wonderful music during SXSW simply by taking a chance on a
band you've never heard of. My great discovery was Pop Unknown, an
Austin quartet that played simple, loud, guitar-fueled pop songs.
No DJ turntables. No elements of country. No maracas. Just
straightforward rock, a real rarity these days.
</P>
<P>
   _ South by Southwest always offers free outdoor music, and this
year's bills were some of the strongest yet: On Friday, Austin
pop-rock trio Fastball performed, followed by eclectic tunesmith
Joe Ely. Saturday was equally strong, with Austin alt-country
rebels the Gourds and indie-rockers Spoon and headliners Guided by
Voices. The crowds were laid-back, the weather was nice and the
bands smoked.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free beer. They were even giving it away at a record store.
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm dangerously obsessed with the latest disc by Idaho
indie-rock group Built to Spill, ``Keep It Like a Secret,'' and I'm
relieved to say they were terrific live. The music is carved out of
sweet melodies interjected with jagged, off-kilter time changes,
but they added another layer via a lot of mesmerizing improv. The
hourlong wait outside was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sets by locals Go Metric USA, Slobberbone and the Old 97's
were wonderful in their unique ways. Sometimes I say there's
nothing going on around here, but these three bands made me happy
that, no matter how hard I've tried, I haven't left North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   DAVE FERMAN'S BAD STUFF:
</P>
<P>
   _ Not enough urban music. At all. SXSW is based around white
rock 'n' roll bands, but there has to be a way to work more hip-hop
into the mix, given the genre's huge influence on pop music in
general. And there's hardly any gospel.
</P>
<P>
   _ I heard Houndog (the new spinoff group led by Los Lobos' David
Hidalgo) and realized that neither Hidalgo nor Cesar Rosas alone is
as good as they are together.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Austin Music Awards need to be streamlined. There was far
too much dead time as bands set up. And the sound was both muddy
and too soft.
</P>
<P>
   MALCOLM MAYHEW'S BAD STUFF:
</P>
<P>
   _ For some reason, a lot of the South by Southwest clubs make
you stand outside for A VERY LONG TIME. And usually, for no good
reason. Example: We waited an hour to get in to see Lo Fidelity All
Stars Thursday at La Zona Rosa, and once we finally did get in, the
place was half-full. Think they do that stuff to paint the illusion
that you are at the hip show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bands that are hyped the most tend to disappoint the most.
Last year, the big deal was A3. Anything happen with them? Nope.
This year, the aforementioned Lo Fidelity All Stars were the big
about-to-burn-bright stars. Next year, they, too, will just be a
faded, circled name in '99's SXSW guide.
</P>
<P>
   _ Something I don't understand: Why, year after year, people
without badges throw fits when they can't get into SXSW shows. When
he couldn't get into Built to Spill's show at Babe's, some
badgeless hothead had to be chased off by the cops. SXSW is NOT for
the casual music fan; it's for the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ever heard the name Robbie Williams? If not, you probably
will, whether you like it or not. Williams is the latest heartthrob
import from the United Kingdom. In his homeland, the onetime member
of teeny-bop pop act Take That is about as popular as the Spice
Girls. He made his U.S. debut (well, as far as we know, it was his
U.S. debut) Friday at an invite-only show at Club DeVille. After
the show, this was overheard: ``Reminded me of the guy from Right
Said Fred.'' Consider yourself warned.

 &HT;    Stock your pantry with a little help from the Web
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What with Y2K hysteria and a bit of millennium madness
now seeping into the collective consciousness, even the most
level-headed folks may be getting a touch of the Chicken Little
syndrome and beginning to think about stocking up on food . . .
just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Companies dealing in survival food are reporting that business
is booming. Many people are apparently buying up huge quantities of
all sorts of Space Age and dehydrated foods to have on hand for
who-knows-what.
</P>
<P>
   However, good cooks from every millennium have always known that
a well-stocked pantry provides the security of knowing you will be
prepared for anything _ well, maybe not runaway comets heading
straight for the Earth, but unexpected guests, bad weather, a flat
tire, anything that could keep you from getting to the store.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few decades ago, a well-stocked pantry meant having a
good supply of flour, sugar, lard, some rice, beans and maybe some
canned tomatoes and other canned goods.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is an unprecedented variety of foods _ from meat,
fish and vegetable entrees to desserts and condiments _ that have a
long shelf life. There is nothing necessarily second rate about a
meal put together primarily from the pantry shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing just what you have on your pantry shelves can also take
a lot of the confusion and stress out of daily meal planning as it
eliminates ``the full refrigerator but nothing to eat syndrome.''
It also cuts down on walking down supermarket aisles in a daze
wondering what to buy. Keeping up with the basics tends to let
everything else fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   The effort needed to learn just what a well-stocked pantry
entails and keeping one inventoried is well worth the time. For
this the Internet is a gold mine of information. As with every
organizational effort, the first thing to do is make a list. On
this page are a few very good sites that list certain foods you
should consider for permanent status on your pantry shelves.
</P>
<P>
   By checking out these sites and others, you will find that
cooking from your pantry does not limit you to beef jerky and Tang;
rather, with the variety of nonperishable foods available today,
the sky is the limit.
</P>

staples from almond extract to pudding mixes to Worcestershire
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/pantry.htm goes well beyond
basics with items like anchovies, artichokes, bread crumbs,
mushrooms and clam juice. And there's a suggestion that if the
world ends, Marsala, Madeira and sherry are vital to life.

 &HT;    Pastry holds delectable ways to welcome warm weather
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine a lush banquet table set for a 10-course
Renaissance feast in the cavernous hall of a turreted Italian
castle. The centerpieces are tall-sided pies with fancy crusts
gilded with egg yolk and cradling elaborate and savory ingredients,
like pork and pigeon, cinnamon and saffron.
</P>
<P>
   Travel ahead a few centuries to the Italian countryside, where a
peasant carefully rolls out two thin crusts to encase the first
green leaves of spring, just as she will do with the last greens
before winter.
</P>
<P>
   And there, on the streets of Reggio today, are shoppers eating a
favorite street food, erbazzone, which is pastry wrapped around
spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture yourself savoring a simple mushroom pie for your
first meal on the screened porch this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Or imagine the surprising spectacle of a torta rustica _ a tall
dome of pastry with colorful layers of spinach, ham, red peppers
and cheese _ at the center of the Easter brunch table.
</P>
<P>
   Savory tarts are a supreme way to celebrate spring. And tarts _
or tortas _ are so versatile, you can tinker with most recipes to
include your favorite vegetables, cheeses and meats. Sliced thin
and small, they work well as appetizers or side dishes. Make
heartier cuts and pair with a salad for a main meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tortas began on the tables of the affluent back in the
Renaissance. Then, only the rich could afford white flour, and it
was the rich who were interested in the appearance of things,''
says Lynn Rossetto Kasper, author of an award-winning Italian
cookbook, ``The Splendid Table'' (Morrow, $35), and host of a radio
show of the same name. ``They loved to enclose all kinds of
ingredients in these fancy crusts and line their banquet tables
with these tall pies.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Kasper writes that many of the tortas were
``designed to be show-stoppers: When their lids were lifted, flocks
of live birds flew out. ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the peasants who often farmed the ingredients for the
landowners could keep only meager amounts of eggs and flour. So
they would use a dab of lard and roll out thin crusts to use a
minimum of flour. But they could wrap the pastry around a bounty of
greens and vegetables from their own gardens, Kasper's research
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The technique developed across the country and through the ages.
Those in the north would use more cheese, fine hams and pastas;
those in the south relied more on greens and other vegetables.
Special ingredients might be used at holidays. A torta pasqualina,
popular in Liguria, was often served at Easter. It was made with 33
sheets of paper-thin pastry _ representing the 33 years of Christ's
life _ and filled with chard, artichokes, ricotta and hard-boiled
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Inside we offer directions for building a simpler but colorful
torta rustica, a project that takes a couple of hours but will be
sure to make an impression. We also offer a simple cheese torta
using puff pastry and gorgonzola cheese that takes only a few
minutes. And there's a mushroom tart that's reminiscent of a hearty
quiche and tortas that use potatoes and polenta as a foundation,
rather than a flour crust.
</P>
<P>
   Try one for a simple family meal or as a noble addition to a
feast. Or, like the folks in Puglia, try them all and serve them in
small bites _ sort of as torta tapas. No matter how or why you
serve a torta, you're sure to find they are a lovely way to say
goodbye to the casseroles and carryout of winter and say hello to
spring.

 &HT;    Seasonal ingredients fare beautifully in make-ahead pies
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I first set out to make a torta rustica, I couldn't even
envision it. It just sounded like it would taste good. But I
followed the steps in the recipe below, and wow! That's what I
heard time and time again the first time I served it up to friends.
Since then, I've made it numerous times for special occasions _
it's a favorite at bridal shower buffets.
</P>
<P>
   So I set out to try other tortas, many from a lovely little
cookbook called ``Cucina Fresca,'' written by Italian food
aficionados Viana La Place and Evan Kleiman (HarperCollins, 1987).
The whole premise of the book is food that can be served at room
temperature. That's what makes tortas so ideal for spring and
summer. You can bake many of them early in the morning and then
never have to turn the oven on again the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   From the elaborate torta rustica to simpler fare, we offer a
number of savory tarts for spring below. Pastry crusts, mashed
potatoes and polenta serve as the foundation for such ingredients
as spinach, leeks, salami and mushrooms. Once you've tried a few,
feel free to substitute your favorite seasonal ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Torta Di Polenta
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Chilling time: 45 minutes or longer Cooking time: 30-35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Polenta is so wonderful because you can dress it up or dress it
down. Here it's combined with savory ingredients like leeks, red
onions and smoky cheese and molded in a round shape. This is ideal
for entertaining because it can be prepared hours ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup leeks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup red onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 quart vegetable broth
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup yellow cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 ounces fresh goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce smoked Gouda cheese, in 1/4 inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Salt, if needed
</P>
<P>
   Tomato sauce (optional)
</P>
<P>
   In a medium skillet, heat olive oil and add garlic, leeks and
red onion, cooking until they are golden, about 7 minutes. In a
large saucepan, heat the broth with the butter. Slowly whisk in the
cornmeal and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a
wooden spoon, for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until it is very
thick.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the polenta from the heat and stir in the cooked onions
and the goat cheese, then the diced Gouda and grated Parmesan.
Taste and add salt only if needed. Pour the hot polenta into a
buttered deep-dish pie pan or round casserole and smooth the top.
Cover and chill for 45 minutes or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Slide a knife around the edges of
the polenta to loosen it, then invert it onto a buttered baking
sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. It should be hot through and just
barely crisping on the outside. Cut the torta into wedges and serve
with your favorite tomato sauce, if desired. _ From: ``The New
Vegetarian Epicure'' by Anna Thomas (Knopf, 1996)

<P>
   There are any number of elaborate torta rustica recipes to
choose from, but I've always found this one to be a winner. Even
folks with dough phobia will find this easy. Because of the eggs,
it's more like working with a soft cookie dough. And it's fun to
layer the ingredients. You can use your imagination. If you like
the idea of adding some whole boiled eggs for Easter, simply do so.
Whatever you choose, this dome pastry will surely impress.
</P>
<P>
   6 packages (10 ounces each) frozen chopped spinach
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   5 eggs, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 large red bell peppers or a 1-pound can good-quality peeled
red peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 recipe Soft Tart Dough
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Italian fontina, rind removed, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Black Forest ham, sliced 1/8 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   Cook spinach according to package directions. Drain in a
colander and rinse under cold water to cool. Drain the spinach and,
with your hands, squeeze out excess moisture so that it is almost
dry. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the butter and oil in a small skillet. Add onion and cook
until it becomes translucent and begins to color. In a large bowl,
mix spinach, sauteed onion, 4 eggs, Parmesan, bread crumbs, salt
and pepper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   To roast and peel the peppers, place them over a gas burner or
under a broiler and turn with tongs until they are blackened all
over. Place in plastic bag, close the top and let them sweat 10
minutes. Remove from the bag and rinse the skins off under cold
running water. Dry on paper towels. Carefully remove the stems,
open the pepper, and discard the seeds and white ribs. Cut the
peppers to lie flat in one piece. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. To assemble the tart, roll out
two-thirds of the Soft Tart Dough on parchment, wax paper, foil or
plastic wrap into a 14-inch circle. Line a medium mixing bowl with
plastic wrap. Invert the 14-inch circle of dough into the bowl.
Peel off the paper or plastic wrap that was on the dough and pat
the dough against the sides of the bowl. Now begin to layer the
ingredients. First, place a thin layer of spinach mixture, then a
layer of red pepper, fontina and ham. Continue layering in a
pattern you like, but finish with a layer of spinach at least 1/2
inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the remaining dough into a circle large enough to cover
the filling. Invert the dough onto the tart filling and peel off
the paper or plastic wrap. Trim the edges of the circle (which will
become the bottom crust). In a small bowl, whisk remaining egg with
milk. Brush the edge of the circle with the egg wash and fold over
the extra dough from the larger circle (which will be the top of
the tart). Make sure the edges are well-sealed. Carefully invert
the tart onto a baking sheet and remove the bowl. Peel off the
plastic wrap that lined the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If you desire a sheen on the crust, brush it with egg wash
before placing it in the oven and once or twice during baking. Bake
about 40 minutes or until the crust is a deep golden brown. Serve
at room temperature, cut into pie-shaped wedges. _ From ``Cucina

   This is so incredibly easy and delicious, it will fast become a

   1 ounce dried porcini or shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>

<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds fresh white or brown mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves,
crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound dandelion greens or arugula, washed, dried and
coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Madeira or port
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces prosciutto, julienned

   1 ounce Gruyere cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   Place the dried mushrooms in a bowl and cover with very warm
water. Set aside for at least 30 minutes or until the mushrooms
soften. Line a 10-by-2-inch removable-bottom round tart pan with
the pastry and chill for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter
and 2 tablespoons of the oil together in a medium skillet. Add the
sliced fresh mushrooms, salt and pepper. Saute over moderate heat
just until the mushrooms begin to wilt; do not overcook. Remove
from the heat and turn into a strainer to drain and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 tablespoon each of the butter and olive oil in a small
skillet. Add the minced garlic and thyme. Stir over low heat until
you smell the herb. Add the dandelion greens or arugula. Saute over
moderate heat just until the greens wilt. Turn into a clean
strainer to drain and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the dried mushrooms. Check the mushrooms to be sure they
are free of sand. Dry them. Heat 1 tablespoon each of the butter
and oil in a small skillet. Add the dried mushrooms and saute
gently. Add the Madeira or port and cook until the wine evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the tart, scatter the bread crumbs over the bottom
of the pastry shell. Add the greens, both types of mushrooms, the
prosciutto and the Gruyere. Lightly beat together the eggs with
half-and-half in a bowl. Pour over the other ingredients in the
shell. Bake the tart in the middle of the oven for about 45
minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
The tart will puff slightly. Cool at least 10 minutes before
removing from tart pan. Serve at room temperature, cut into
pie-shaped wedges. _ From ``Cucina Fresca''

STUDENTS CONVICTED OF DRUG CRIMES CAN LOSE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL LEWIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opposition is growing on college campuses to a provision of the
Higher Education Act that withholds federal financial aid from
students convicted of selling or possessing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the provision in the fall to send a message to
young drug users, but opponents say that it denies money to
troubled students when they need it most to turn their lives
around, that it fails to address drug intervention and education,
and that it ignores other types of criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Many college students are becoming aware of the provision but
worry about its ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little scared myself. I know how people's names get
dropped, and they can get arrested,'' said Hunter Russell, a junior
at the University of Texas at Dallas. ``My main fear is being in
the wrong place at the wrong time. I could lose my financial aid.
I'm pretty dependent on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision, part of the Higher Education Act Amendments of
1998, goes into effect in fall 2000 and denies grants, loans and
work assistance to students convicted under federal or state law.
</P>
<P>
   Students can lose at least one year of financial aid for a drug
possession conviction and at least two years for a conviction of
selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility can be reinstated during the suspension if students
complete rehabilitation and pass two random drug tests, but the law
does not define rehabilitation, said Judy Schneider, assistant vice
president and director of Student Financial Aid at the University
of Texas at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are somewhat hopeful that Congress will address some of the
questions and actually reverse its position and not tie financial
aid to the issue,'' said Schneider, president of the National
Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. ``We do not
feel like it's an issue that should be tied to receiving financial
aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion is shared by Drug Reform Coordination Network
officials in Washington, D.C., who are trying to spread awareness
of the provision through an online newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Student leaders at UT-Dallas and 130 other campuses are
reviewing the provision to determine whether they will support a
resolution to ask Congress to overturn it, said Adam Smith, the
network's associate director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The provision is a misguided way to fight the war on drugs,''
said Smith, who is helping students to coordinate the campaign.
``Given the racial disparity in drug law enforcement, this will
inevitably have a discriminatory impact. It will deny education to
those for whom it is most vital: the poor, the nonwhite and
nonviolent young people who have had previous contact with the
criminal justice system and who are trying to turn their lives
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of increasing drug arrests among college students have
contributed to lawmakers' frustration, but their approach should
have focused on intervention and treatment, said Irma P. Jones,
coordinator of substance abuse prevention and vice president for
student affairs at University of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the `let's get tough on drugs' attitude,'' she
said. ``I hope this is not a political ploy on the part of someone
who wants to come up with a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Department of Education officials in Washington are
fielding calls about the provision but say they cannot help.
Representatives from the Department of Education, financial aid
administrators and members of President Clinton's staff are trying
to clarify enforcement procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty general,'' said Jane Glickman, spokeswoman for the
Education Department. ``The FBI has one, but only law enforcement
has access to it. They are really trying to figure out how to
enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. gave the students' campaign a
boost last week by introducing a bill to repeal the provision. But
it most likely will be opposed by lawmakers such as House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who strongly supported the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every criminal who gets funding takes away from other students
who need it,'' said Jim Wilkinson, Armey's press secretary. ``There
are so many kids in the inner city that do not have access to money
for education who want to get out of their situations and to make
something out of their lives. To think that some students get
turned down because a drug dealer gets it, is a big concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all students consider the provision a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Martin, a junior political science major at UNT, said he
has grieved for friends killed or injured in drug- or
alcohol-related accidents and believes that the provision will
force students re-evaluate substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a harsh punishment at all. It's not denying them
financial aid forever,'' Martin said. ``They have the option of
rehabilitation. It gives them reason for rehabilitation to help put
their lives together. Their education will mean more to them.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Higher Education Act drug provision
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in fall 2000, college students convicted of selling or
possessing a controlled substance can have their federal financial
aid suspended. Students become ineligible for financial aid for one
year for a first offense for possession, two years for a second
offense and indefinitely for a third offense. Students lose
eligibility for two years for a first offense for selling drugs and
lose it indefinitely for a second offense.
</P>
<P>

COMMENTARY: PROTECTING THE SPIRITUAL _ WHEREVER IT IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a court of law, nesting falcons have far greater legal
leverage than the spiritual needs of the Northern Plains Indian
tribes. That sad fact tells us something about skewed priorities in
our nation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service can stop recreational climbing at a
monument or a park in order to protect nesting falcons, but it
cannot do so to accommodate religious ceremonies of American
Indians. At least, that is what some climbers argue.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver
heard oral arguments concerning climbing on Devils Tower National
Monument in northeast Wyoming. The monument has a reputation as one
of the best crack climbing sites in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Tower is considered a sacred site by Northern Plains
Indian tribes. The National Park Service, which manages the
monument, had put a voluntary climbing ban in place for the month
of June to accommodate the spiritual ceremonies of the Lakota,
Crow, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Shoshone and other Indian tribes.
June and the summer solstice have a special significance to the
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, U.S. District Judge William Downes of the federal
district of Wyoming had ruled that the ban on climbing during the
month of June was constitutional, as long as the ban remained
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial climbing guide Andy Petefish and the Bear Lodge
Multiple Use Association appealed, claiming that the voluntary ban
wasn't really voluntary because the government could use its
enormous influence to coerce climbers into accepting the ban
whether they wanted to or not.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in the appeal, however, is whether the
National Park Service can constitutionally accommodate the
religious beliefs of American Indians in managing the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based Mountain States Legal Foundation, which
represents Petefish and the association, argues that such an
accommodation violates the First Amendment's establishment clause,
that the federal government is showing a preference to a religious
belief and thereby violating the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal overlooks the fact that the NPS accommodates
Christian religious ceremonies at numerous other national parks.
The Park Service asks visitors not to disrupt Catholic services in
the San Antonio Missions in Texas. The NPS closes the Ebenezer
Baptist Church, a National Historic Site in Georgia, to visitors
during special services.
</P>
<P>
   When high Mass is held at the Franciscan church in the
Tumacacori National Historic Park in Arizona, the NPS asks visitors
to remain quiet and respect the ceremony. Do these accommodations
violate the establishment clause? They have not been challenged in
court.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonable person must insist that if it is constitutional to
accommodate Christian religious ceremonies on federal lands, then
it is constitutional to accommodate American Indian spiritual
ceremonies on these same lands. No one is forced to participate in
another's religion.
</P>
<P>
   No one is even asked to participate _ only to respect another's
religion. The land is spacious enough to accommodate all religions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the 10th Circuit Court heard the appeal,
the National Park Service closed 20 climbing routes on Devils Tower
to protect nesting prairie falcons. The ban on those routes is
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of climbers nearby could cause the falcons to
abandon their eggs or their chicks. No one has challenged the right
of the NPS to protect falcons. Nor should anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual needs the same protection.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have lived in the West, on the high plains, understand
the spiritual nature of the land and its wildlife. One has a sense
of awe when watching hawks and eagles in their high gyrations, when
seeing a red fox across a river, when witnessing a flight of white
pelicans circle in an upward spiral until they disappear into the
sky, or a great blue heron lift off a dead branch. One learns a
sense of place within nature, within the landscape. The landscape
feeds the deepest part of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   And there are places on the land that call to each of us, that
in some way announce their sacredness to us.
</P>
<P>
   With the same reverence that we protect our wildlife, we must
protect the spiritual wherever it is found. If we can ban climbing
to ensure the nesting of falcons, we should be able to ban climbing
to ensure that religious beliefs and ceremonies have a rightful
place in the world.

CAN DEMOCRATS PRODUCE A SECOND JFK AT THEIR L.A. CONVENTION? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 28) , (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ Now that the Democrats have
decided to hold their presidential nominating convention in Los
Angeles for the first time since 1960, it is inevitable that
comparisons will be drawn between the nominee of that year, John F.
Kennedy, and the party's prospective nominee of 2000, Al Gore.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the presidential search-and-dissect season takes off, the
question is whether Gore can rekindle the fire that burned so
brightly so long ago when the Cold War was the great threat to
America and the civil rights movement was just gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the fact that both men can be categorized as
Democrats wanting to be president, there are few similarities
between Kennedy and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The issues and atmosphere in America have changed greatly in the
four decades since Kennedy officially launched the ``New Frontier''
from the City of the Angels. But in that time, the assassinated
president has achieved a special place in the hearts of Americans
and a special meaning in terms of electoral politics.
</P>
<P>
   A recent public opinion poll listed Kennedy along with
Washington, Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt as one of the
republic's greatest presidents. So much for the public's historical
perspicacity.
</P>
<P>
   In his short time in the White House, Kennedy did not score many
memorable achievements, although he did launch the successful
effort to place a man on the moon and he did stand up to the Soviet
Union in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's most memorable achievement may have been that he, the
first American president born in the 20th century, inspired a
generation of young Americans, including Bill Clinton, to seek to
careers in public service. He and his wife, Jacqueline, also made
the White House a showcase for elegance and appreciation of the
arts, letters and the contributions of America's Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   What often matters in politics is the aura achieved by a public
figure, and Kennedy's aura continues to glisten despite the recent
revelations about his promiscuous private life.
</P>
<P>
   It should not be surprising, therefore, that when Democrats go
back to Los Angeles, many will be hoping to anoint a nominee who
can emulate Kennedy's victory at the polls and create enthusiasm
for public service among young people. As things now stand, that
nominee probably will be Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was but 15 when Kennedy was assassinated, there are
some small links between the two men. Kennedy and Gore's father,
Albert Gore Sr., served together in the House in the 1940s and
early 1950s and were elected to the Senate on the same November day
in 1952 that Dwight Eisenhower won the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kennedy and the senior Gore, Al Gore also served in House
and Senate before being tapped by Clinton in 1992 for the vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's 1960 campaign centered around what he called the need
to ``get America moving again'' after eight years of the Eisenhower
administration, a slowdown in the national economy and his claim,
which later proved false, that America had fallen behind the Soviet
Union in missile development.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy, whose Catholicism was both a political asset and
liability, was no shoo-in. He won the Democratic nomination only by
defeating all prospective opponents in the primaries. Then he beat
Richard Nixon in the closest presidential election in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is nominated, instead of promising to get America moving
again, he will be forced to defend, rather than criticize, the
administration because he has been an integral part of it. No
previous vice president has enjoyed as close a relationship with
his president.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy continues to flourish and if criticism of
Clinton's policies in Kosovo, China and other foreign lands does
not become an explosive political issue, Gore may fare well. But if
the economy winds down and if Republicans can make voters believe
that Clinton has been the architect of a weak and misguided foreign
policy, he will have a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were able to capitalize on allegations that the
Democrats had mishandled overseas matters at the end of the Harry
Truman administration in the early 1950s and again in 1968 and 1972
during the tragedy of Vietnam. A further problem for Gore will be
his closeness to a president whose moral and ethical standards are
in disrepute.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the Republican nominee, Gore may
focus on the economic doldrums that persisted during his father's
presidency, while Bush may hit hard at the moral turpitude of the
Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who lacks Kennedy's charisma, has said some foolish things
of late, including his claim to have helped create the Internet.
But his basic intelligence, his grasp of modern technology, his
protection of the environment, his understanding of economic
matters and his experience in the highest reaches of government
should serve him well.

YOU JUST THINK YOU KNOW BEANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All cooks think they can make a pot of beans. Like Poggie Ames
of Granbury, Texas, says, ``You just dump them in a pot and boil
them until they don't rattle anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy enough for Ames to say; he has three first-place awards and
two seconds to his name at the annual General Granbury's Birthday
Celebration and Bean, Rib and Chili Cook-Off.
</P>
<P>
   The event is this weekend on the town square from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of cooks will fire up their stoves for ribs and beans
Saturday. Sunday is for the chili cook-off, a new event this year.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of judges will choose the official winners, but this
festival also allows the public to judge. Visitors pay a dollar for
a small cup, a spoon and a ballot. They get to pick their favorites
for the ``people's choice awards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one we go for,'' Ames said. ``We want our beans
cooked for the people; we really don't care much about the other
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes a difference, because the judges are looking for the
best beans only. They don't want to see any meat in the beans; they
just want beans and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   But Ames said that's not the way he was taught to cook beans.
That's not the way his mother fixed them, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was the only woman I ever knew who could cook just
enough for the five of us, have 10 others show up, and there ended
up being plenty for everyone with a little left over,'' he said.
``I've never been able to figure out how she did that. I sure
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen Ames would always watch her boys _ Poggie, Dan and Fred _
when they cooked at the bean cook-off. She made sure they didn't
overseason the beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put too much in,'' Ames said of the seasonings. ``And
you can't take it back. Once you season them, that's the way it's
going to be. Once you get 40 pounds of beans boiling, you can't
just call it off.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the seasoning that determines how good the beans are.
There is no other really deep, dark secret, Ames said. You just add
seasoning at different times. He said he uses crushed tomatoes,
cilantro, sauteed onions, salt and a little bit of brisket. The
salt goes in last, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also has soaked the beans overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of meat you use depends on what you're serving with
the beans,'' Ames said. ``If you are going to serve them with
chicken, then you put chicken in the beans. I always serve mine
with brisket, so I put brisket in the beans.''
</P>
<P>
   When cooking 40 pounds of beans, he added, he'll toss in about a
dozen jalapenos.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people will turn up the fire and boil their beans
until they're done,'' Ames said. ``I really don't do that. I'll
bring them up to a good rolling boil and then I'll turn the fire
off. I'll let them sit there until I can put my hand on the side of
the pot without burning it. The pot will still be hot, maybe 120 or
130 degrees, but the beans won't be boiling. Then, I'll add the
sauteed onions and diced tomatoes and bring the beans back to a
boil for about 10 or 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ames said he cooks the onions ahead of time in ``just enough
grease to make them slide around.'' He cooks them until they are
translucent.
</P>
<P>
   After the beans have returned to a boil, he again turns off the
fire and begins to stir in the diced brisket. It's back to a boil
again, then off again.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he adds the chopped cilantro. ``I kind of let it set
there on top,'' Ames said. ``The oil comes out of the cilantro and
gives it a flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds salt, stirs the pot, and pronounces them ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cook the beans like I like them,'' he said. ``We go for the
people's choice awards and showmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames and his two brothers will join Hood County Sheriff Allen
Harden this year in fixing what they call ``Chain Gang Beans.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff and his chief deputy, and an investigator, will be
dressed in their western lawmen outfits, with the Ameses dressed in
prison uniforms and shackled to a ball and chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a good time,'' Ames said. ``We've lived in Granbury
all our lives, and we wouldn't miss this event. That little square
will be jam-packed.''
</P>

   SOPRANOS-TV-IMITATORS (Undated) _ ``The Sopranos'' is such a
white-hot favorite in the television industry that network
executives are trying to figure out how they can copy the
breakthrough style of the HBO miniseries and perhaps make up for
the mistake several of them made in passing up the show in the
first place. By Bill Carter.
</P>
<P>
   SOPRANOS-MINISERIES-CLASSIC (Undated) _ The Sopranos series has
pulled off an almost impossible feat: it is an ambitious artistic
success, the best show of this year and many others; it has also

actually talk and get excited about. A reporter's notebook by Caryn

   OPRAH-BOOK (Undated) _ ``The Reader'' is a small, quiet,
intellectual book that asks big moral questions. It has a
distinctly Mitteleuropean feel, of Kafka or Von Kleist, an air of
allegory and moral meditation. Hardly a prescription for a best
seller. Yet it has been translated from the original German into 23
languages and sold to Mirimax for a film. To top it all, ``The

Dinitia Smith.

EXHIBIT SKETCHES LENNON'S ARTISTIC SELF-PORTRAIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEN HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Soon it will be 20 years since John Lennon was
murdered outside his home in New York City. Yoko Ono, who was with
him the night five shots rang out, says, ``I don't often cry about
it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ono, 66, is a wealthy businesswoman. She still records and
performs occasionally. She is an artist. Her son, Sean, is putting
out his own records now. Ono has moved on.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often, something casts her back to life with
Lennon. Such as one little drawing he did in 1969, just a scribble
that took only a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of those days _ it's kind of a bittersweet
feeling,'' Ono says in a telephone interview. ``It's John and I
holding each other, almost like a yin-and-yang drawing. It's a
beautiful thing that he did. This was in England, and we were so
much in love. It just chokes me up in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Beatles and ``She Loves You,'' long hair, peace and
love and worldwide fame as a rock 'n' roller, John Lennon was a
young man with a sketch pad. He drew just as fast and furiously as
he played his guitar, with the same passion and humor, and often
with the same raunchiness.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, he was talented enough to win admission to the
Liverpool College of Art. Success with the Beatles ended his school
days, but he never stopped drawing. Even after the birth of his son
Sean, when he put down his guitar for five years of stay-at-home
fatherhood, he continued doodling his life on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The largest collection of Lennon's artwork ever exhibited will
be on display this weekend at the Renaissance Houston Hotel. ``In
My Life: The Artwork of John Lennon'' will feature more than 100
drawings, including the never-before-shown pieces used as cover art
on the ``John Lennon Anthology''recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings are a self-portrait, 1969-1980. He depicts the
major events in his life, from his courtship of Ono and their
wedding through his immigration battle to live in the United States
to domestic bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Limited-edition reprints of the drawings, signed by Ono, will be
for sale during the exhibit. While most will sell for about $1,000,
they'll range in price from $140 to $24,000 (for an original
lithograph).
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, reprints of handwritten lyrics will be for
sale; prices will range from $125 to $1,000. The songs include
Beatles classics such as ``Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,''
``Revolution,'' ``Nowhere Man and Day Tripper,'' plus solo hits
such as ``Woman,'' ``Beautiful Boy'' and ``Watching the Wheels Go
Round.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was cranking them out all the time,'' Ono says. ``He would
send postcards or letters, and there'd be a little drawing on them.
He'd finish a drawing and just say to people, `You want this?' He
was very generous. He could be generous because he was so talented.
He was just a talented guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of Lennon's life after the Beatles, there were two
constants at his side: Ono and a sketch pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at these drawings, and I remember when he did them. I
was usually around when he was drawing. Usually I was around all
the time. We were together a lot. It reminds me of those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd draw wherever we were. Sadly, he'd just throw a lot of it
away. The drawing of John and I holding each other, he initially
thought, `Oh, it's not good enough.' He was going to throw it away,
but I saved it. A couple of days later he said, `It's not bad.' Now
we use that drawing for our logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art was not a formal thing with John. He wasn't that kind of
artist. He was an inspired artist. He'd draw anywhere _ on a plane,
in a conference with lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ono remembers one emotionally agonizing encounter with lawyers
that she and Lennon endured in 1971 at the Family Law Center in
Houston. They were trying to gain custody of Kyoko, Ono's daughter
from a previous marriage. They had heard that Kyoko was living in
Houston with Ono's ex-husband, filmmaker Anthony Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for Kyoko. We knew she was in Houston. But
when we got there, they just left town,'' Ono says. Mother and
daughter weren't reunited until 1997, when Kyoko called Ono.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very nice feeling about Houston except that it wasn't
a very nice occasion,'' Ono says. ``Despite that, I thought, `Hmm,
hip town.'''
</P>
<P>
   To announce the arrival of the Lennon art exhibit, two
tractor-trailers will pull up at the Houston Food Bank and unload
60,000 pounds of food, a gift from Ono.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that whenever we do a show of John's work, we
make sure to do something for a local charity . That's what it's
about,'' she says.

LAWYER DRAFTS DIVORCE BOOK FOR TEXANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   If Texas native Jerry Hall were able to divorce Mick Jagger in
her home state instead of Great Britain, her claim for $50 million
might not seem that exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, any divorce settlement would be dictated by
what the couple accumulated during their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   So if the famous couple amassed $100 million during their
relationship, her request would be a ``little low'' under Texas
standards, Dallas divorce attorney Ike Vanden Eykel says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down here, if we're representing a wife and all we get is 50
percent, we consider that a loss,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: A high-profile divorce in the Lone Star
State is likely to have a ``Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' quality
to it, says Vanden Eykel, author of the new ``Successful Lone Star
Divorce: How to Cope With a Family Breakup in Texas'' (PSG Books,
$16.95).
</P>
<P>
   Divorce is different in Texas than it would be almost anywhere
else on Earth, for a number of reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas is one of only nine states that recognize community
property. Under state law, a non-wage-earning spouse has just as
much right as a wage-earning spouse to property accumulated during
the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   _ For all practical purposes, alimony is nonexistent, Vanden
Eykel says. The Texas Legislature passed a limited law in 1995 that
allows maximum payments of $2,500 a month for three years to an
ex-spouse who was married at least 10 years and has no means of
support.
</P>
<P>
   _ Either party can ask for a jury trial. In a divorce case, a
jury can determine community property and custody issues and even
decide the value of a disputed business. Texas is the only state
where a jury can determine custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 12 people (deciding important divorce issues), and
that makes it somewhat of a gunfighter's type of justice still in
this state,'' says Vanden Eykel, whose clients have included Texas
Rangers baseball player Juan Gonzalez and the ex-wives of
evangelist Robert Tilton and millionaire Rex Cauble.
</P>
<P>
   Things often get nasty if there's a fight over custody or if one
party feels harmed by a spouse's extramarital affair and embarks on
a personal vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things so easily get out of hand. You have to realize
the system rewards `nuclear war.' It's like going into an oil
refinery with a blowtorch. If you set it off, there is going to be
a fire,'' Vanden Eykel says.
</P>
<P>
   He offers these suggestions for helping to maintain civility
during a divorce case:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider your options.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously ask yourself: Is the marriage salvageable? If there's
a chance, try counseling, therapy or a trial separation to work out
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have ended it, there's nothing left to save. If you
try to save it, you might just succeed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do your homework.
</P>
<P>
   Educate yourself on the legal system and what a divorce will
cost you emotionally and financially. Know both your financial
situation and your spouse's, including the value of retirement
funds and the amount of outstanding or potential debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in without knowing that, and they end up learning
about the system halfway into it, and by then they can't get out of
it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Interview several lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ask friends who have been in similar situations for referrals.
Interview at least two lawyers before deciding to hire someone.
Compare what each says, and gauge how comfortable you feel that
your interests will be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the same questions of each lawyer, and don't tell one what
the other said. Ask about the types of cases they have handled,
their thoughts about mediation, which mediators they use (if they
can't name one, they probably don't use mediation often), and
specific questions on how they would handle your situation.
</P>
<P>
   Vanden Eykel, who charges $450 an hour, agrees that not everyone
needs a high-priced divorce attorney. He recommends hiring ``the
most lawyer you can afford'' for your situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can destroy an anthill with a missile, but a shovel will
do just fine,'' he says. ``Not every case needs to be attached to a
team. You may not require someone at the top of the fee range.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay involved.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've hired a lawyer, be a part of the process. Don't
abdicate the case to your attorney. Let him or her know what you
are thinking; otherwise, you may be left with unanswered questions
after the divorce is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shut up.
</P>
<P>
   People going through a divorce often feel a need to tell
everyone how lousy the ex-spouse is and other details of the
breakup. Such negative talk can come back to haunt you,
particularly during delicate negotiations. You may also
inadvertently give away your strategy with such loose talk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay focused on your objective.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let thoughts of vengeance or vendettas blur your focus.
Try to fashion a resolution that gets you all or much of what you
need without putting your spouse through a ``human meat grinder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep the emotions out, because it is an emotional
situation, but you can try to keep them under control and not let
them be damaging to you,'' Vanden Eykel says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite news accounts that often highlight the most acrimonious
divorces, more than 85 percent of divorce cases in the state are
resolved in mediation without going to trial, Vanden Eykel says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magic of mediation is, quite frankly, amazing,'' says the
attorney, who calls mediation the most significant development in
his 25 years of practice (followed by the invention of the
photocopier and the fax machine).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediation has allowed for an avenue to resolve differences
without this `nuclear war.' It forces (couples) to sit down with a
trained mediator and try and settle the case.''

DO CHEERLEADING OUTFITS FORCE GIRLS TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THEIR
BODIES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Marcia Ritter informed cheerleading
hopefuls and their parents that tryouts would be done in a set of
double sports bras last month instead of the traditional white
T-shirt, they didn't even blink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of questions about other things, but not one
comment about the sports bras,'' Ritter said. ``Nobody raised their
hands about it. There was not a word.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Colleyville Heritage High School varsity cheerleading
coach would learn later, there was plenty of concern among parents
that the policy would put an unhealthy emphasis on body weight, and
perhaps on girls' bustlines.
</P>
<P>
   When Ritter got wind of parents' concerns, she immediately
abandoned the idea. But the controversy is an example of what
experts see as continuing societal pressure on young women _
cheerleaders or not _ to look and act a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   This perception was further confirmed in a recent study, which
found that despite all of the publicity about eating disorders,
teens are still struggling with self-esteem and body image. A major
culprit: photos and articles in magazines such as ``Seventeen'' and
``Glamour,'' which help convince many teen girls that they are fat
and should diet.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released this month by Alison Field of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, interviewed 548 girls in grades five
through 10 and reported that seven in 10 girls said magazine
pictures influence their ideas of the perfect body shape. Nearly
half said they want to lose weight because of those pictures,
although only 29 percent were overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do a very good job of raising boys to be or do
whatever they want,'' said James T. McElroy, author of ``We've Got
Spirit: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Cheerleading
Team.'' ``But we seem to impose on girls a lot of `shoulds' ... as
opposed to allowing them to do what they feel happy and comfortable
doing.'' For instance, he said, if a girl feels comfortable wearing
a sports bra, then let her. If she doesn't, then she shouldn't be
forced to.
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Sharon O'Dell, said she doesn't have a problem with
girls wearing the sports bras, because the girls often wear more
than one. ``These are like 6 inches in diameter,'' said O'Dell,
whose 16-year-old daughter is a cheerleader at Heritage High.
``They look like halter tops. They're just form-fitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Routen, varsity cheerleading sponsor at Arlington Heights
High School in Fort Worth, has tried to steer girls away from tight
and revealing clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took over the cheerleading, I took out the category in
tryouts for appearance,'' said Routen, who requires her squad to
try out in T-shirts and walking shorts. ``I tell them it is not
their place to look sexy at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this 11 years, and I don't think there has
ever been a year when I didn't have at least one and sometimes as
many as three (cheerleaders) who were anorexic. I've seen cases so
severe, they had to do treatment or leave school.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her efforts to de-emphasize looks, Routen said that
girls still want to wear tight and revealing clothing and often
ignore her suggestions, such as lengthening their cheerleading
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   But Ritter said the switch from T-shirts to a sports bra was
simply a practical one, to avoid T-shirts flopping in the girls'
faces. She said T-shirts become untucked and can wind up leaving
the girls' bras exposed anyway. It was never her intention to make
anyone feel pressured about the switch, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tryouts are scary enough for these young girls,'' said Ritter,
who was following the sports-bra trend at the college level. ``It
was not my goal to make it any more uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Graham of Champion Cheer in Colleyville, Texas, agrees
that sports bras have their pragmatic points. She said that even at
the middle and high school levels, most girls wear them under
T-shirts, whether they are required to or not. Graham owns one of a
growing number of businesses that train girls on school
cheerleading teams and private teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are being used to determine a girl's size and
prettiness, I have a problem with that,'' said Graham, a former
Martin High School cheerleader from Arlington. ``If they're being
used for practical reasons such as preventing the T-shirt from
flying up into their faces while tumbling, that's a different
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham also said she feels that the pressure on girls to look a
certain way is usually self-imposed. Many cheerleaders strive to be
``a flyer or top person'' in stunts. Those girls are generally more
petite than those on the bottom, who must lift the smaller girls
over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smaller you are, the easier it is, so there's definitely
pressure to stay fit,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheerleaders at Arlington Heights High School agree, saying that
even though Routen always emphasizes a clean, wholesome look, some
girls concentrate on keeping their weight down.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth James, who has been a cheerleader for 11 years, most
recently at Arlington Heights, said that she has never experienced
pressure to be thin, but ``can still see it happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``We've Got Spirit,'' McElroy, an award-winning journalist
and husband of a cheerleading coach, follows a Kentucky high school
team's quest for its ninth national cheering title. Like the recent
study, he blames the body-image problem squarely on advertisements,
TV shows, clothing stores and models: ``Cheerleading is \Rmore\S
concerned with issues of grace, athleticism, and
self-esteem-building confidence in girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said that if coaches are telling girls to make judges
like them, the question of how becomes paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come across as perky, smiley and attractive,'' McElroy
said. ``And depending on how you interpret that, it may involve
supertight tops or short skirts. The sexuality issue is a tough
one, because on the one hand you don't want to make girls feel
pressured to look or act a certain way, but on the other hand you
run the risk of making girls feel bad about their sexuality, and I
think that would be too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   McElroy sees the trend for more-revealing uniforms filtering
down from the professional cheerleaders, who tend to wear nothing
but Lycra body-hugging outfits. For instance, instead of the short
pleated skirts, more teams are wearing skirts that look like strips
of fabric over a pair of shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they move, the strips open and are more revealing,'' said
McElroy. ``They might as well just be wearing underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   This trend seems to be limited, at least locally, to All-Star
teams, privately-owned teams formed strictly for competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of teams who wear the crop-top uniforms and the
fly-away skirts with the slits,'' said James, also on an All-Star
team. ``It's crazy. Most All-Star teams have those because they
look good when you twist.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is concern that sexier outfits are making their way
to the high-school level.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Claire Bloxom, another cheerleader at Arlington
Heights, said uniforms are becoming ``more and more risque'' every
year, pointing to one local cheerleading group that wears tops with
spaghetti straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're trying to put out a sex magazine,'' she said,
``instead of lead cheers.''

<P>
   Since the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in the Qumran area of
Israel, the question of who wrote these biblical and secular texts
has puzzled scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as the archeological find of the century, the scrolls
supposedly are the oldest copies of most of the Old Testament and
sectarian writings. Scholars have theorized that they were written
by the ``Essenes,'' an ascetic brotherhood of bishops and laymen
with strict rules of behavior that existed long before the birth of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is evidence that the Essene sect was not established
until after the time of Christ. If the Dead Sea Scrolls are indeed
pre-Christian documents, the Essenes could not have written them.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, scholars who
questioned the truth of the Bible developed the Essene theory to
account for the origins of Christianity. They speculated that it
sprang from a sect of pre-Christian Jews. These scholars also
suggested that John the Baptist and Jesus himself were Essenes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nowhere in the New Testament are the Essenes mentioned,
though other sects are, including the Zealots, Herodians, Sadducees
and Pharisees.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the writers of the Scrolls never called themselves
``Essenes,'' but referred to themselves as ``the poor'' or ``poor
in spirit,'' which also happen to be terms applied to the early
followers of Jesus. Even Lawrence Schiffman, a noted Dead Sea
Scroll scholar, has gone so far as to say that the writers of the
scrolls should not be referred to as ``Essenes'' but as the
``Qumran sect.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, scholars who believe in the antiquity of the
Scrolls claim they were written by the Essenes in a writing house
-- a scriptorium -- in Qumran near the caves where the first
scrolls were found. World renowned Hebrew paleographer M. Bezalel
Narkis, however, notes in La Paleographie Hebraique Medievale that,
``One should take into consideration the fact that Jews never had
monastic scriptoria ... . Only since the 13th century is there some
evidence of larger workshops headed by scribes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The records of historians Pliny and Philo, who were writing in
the decades after Jesus' death, include sketchy details about
sects.
</P>
<P>
   Dead Sea Scroll scholars combined several sects into one that
they inferred to be the Essenes in order to account for the
authorship of the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Josephus, a prominent Jewish historian of the same period, also
wrote about such a sect, calling its members city dwellers who
lived in ``every town in Israel.'' They didn't live in the desert
or wilderness, like the Dead Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, respected Israeli archaeologist Yizhar Hirschfeld
created a stir by asserting that Essenes lived not at Qumran, but
at Ein Gedi, a Dead Sea community 20 miles south of Qumran. But
Hirschfeld said he found a striking similarity between that
community and the monasteries built centuries later by Byzantine
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Pick, also an archaeologist and the dean of arts and
sciences at Columbia Pacific University in California, added a nail
to the coffin of the Essene theory when he told Newsday in 1997,
``The most telling thing was there was no synagogue at the Qumran
site.''
</P>
<P>
   First-century Jews, he said, built synagogues at sites where
they lived for only a few years, such as the fortress at Masada.
Why, Pick asks, wouldn't the Essenes have built a synagogue at
Qumran where they supposedly lived for more than 100 years?
</P>
<P>
   OSSAEANS, NOT ESSENES
</P>
<P>
   But people called ``Ossaeans'' did live along the northern
shores of the Dead Sea after AD 68. Some scrolls scholars believe
they were the Essenes.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius, a church father of the third and fourth centuries
AD, wrote that the ``so-called heresy of the Ossaeans ...
originated from the regions of Nabataea and Ituraea, Moabitis and
Arielitis, from the regions that are situated at the other side of
the lake that in the Holy Scripture is called Dead Sea.'' The fact
that Epiphanius calls them a ``heresy'' suggests that they had a
Christian background.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups lived not far away in the Golan Heights region.
Claudine Dauphin, a French archeologist, found that Judeo-Christian
sects emerged after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 and continued
into the medieval period.
</P>
<P>
   ``At two of the sites,'' she wrote, ``we started finding bizarre
stuff -- Christian symbols intertwined with Jewish symbols ... like
a menorah covered by a ship, representing the church, whose mast
was a cross, or a lulav (palm branch) whose top branches formed a
cross.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why I found lameds (the Hebrew ``L'') with the
top part turned into a cross in the Copper Scroll (one of the Dead
Sea Scrolls). Or why there are X's in the margins of messianic
passages that speak of the Messiah on the Isaiah Scroll.
</P>
<P>
   Another important clue in the search for the Essenes is offered
by Athanase Negoitsa in Revue de Qumran. He writes of a document by
Nilus the Ascetic of the fourth century AD that indicates the
Essenes lived then. Nilus praises their ``meditative and lofty
moral life.'' But he regrets that the Essenes do not follow in the
true philosophy of the gospel of Christ, implying that they were a
heretical Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a source that clearly states the Essenes originated in
the Christian period and not before?
</P>
<P>
   CALLED ``NAZARENES''
</P>
<P>
   We know from the writings of the Church Fathers that the Jews
who believed in Jesus were called ``Nazarenes'' and that they kept
the laws of Moses and the customs of the Jewish people. That
dispels the gentile myth that the Jewish people rejected Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, Honorius Augustodunensis stated, ``The Nazoraeans
are so called after the village Nazareth. These confess that Christ
is the Son of God but they observe everything in the old Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the New Testament book of Acts clearly
brings out that not only did large numbers of Pharisees, but also
``a great company of priests [Sadducees] had turned to the Lord.''
We also find in the book of Acts that entire Jewish cities, such as
Lydda and Sharon, accepted Jesus the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the Church Fathers that even in the later
centuries -- like the fourth and fifth centuries AD -- Jewish
followers of Messiah still existed and did not deny their heritage.
If the name for Jewish believers was ``Nazarenes,'' what then were
the gentiles called who received Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   We read in Acts of the Apostles (11:26) that the gentiles who
believed in Jesus were called ``Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   But between the time of the first gentile believer (Cornelius)
and the time that large numbers of gentiles in Antioch were
converted, what name differentiated gentiles?
</P>
<P>
   I found the following statement in Epiphanius: ``All Christians
were called Nazoraeans [Nazarenes] once. For a short time they were
given also the name Iessaeans, before the disciples in Antioch
began to be called Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius thus contradicts the theory that the Essenes were a
pre-Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But is he a reliable source? If he is, why have his words on the
subject been ignored? Why, as Negoitsa brings out, do ``...many
Qumranologists (Dead Sea Scroll scholars) take no account of
Epiphanius...?''
</P>
<P>
   They surely must have found, as I did, the references in
Epiphanius that show the Essene sect did not come into existence
until after the death of Jesus. A noted Qumranologist has revealed
that ``older scholars will prefer to ignore the new materials: the
ferment they produce is too strong for their stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just ``new material'' but anything that goes against
the ``accepted theory.'' Four decades ago, Jewish writer and
scholar Solomon Zeitlin said anyone who challenged accepted Dead
Sea Scroll theories was regarded as a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars regard Epiphanius as an extremely important
source. In ``Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' German scholar
Rainer Riesner states, ``According to reliable tradition in
Epiphanius, the Jewish Christian community left the Holy City at
the outbreak of the Jewish War (AD 66-70) to settle at Pella in the
Decapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Negoitsa writes: ``Epiphanius was born in Palestine ... spoke
five languages, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Coptic, and Aramaic. Thus he
was able to read all the documents and writings ... (had) precise
information regarding the sects of Palestine and especially those
in the region harboring the Dead Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Negoitsa doesn't mention Epiphanius' statements about
``Iessaeans.'' What is the derivation of this Greek word, and does
this have any bearing on Christianity?
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Comfort, professor of Greek and New Testament at Wheaton
College and Senior Bible editor at Tyndale Publishing House, states
that the word ``Iessaeans'' or ``Essenes'' comes from the Greek
word ``Iessaios,'' which means Jesse, the father of David.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Christians may have called themselves this because
the Messiah was called the Son of Jesse (Isaiah 11:10, Romans
15:12),'' wrote Comfort, whose analysis offers further insight into
Epiphanius' statements that the Essenes were a Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   How then could the Essenes be the writers of the Dead Sea
Scrolls, which supposedly date as far back as 300 BC?
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the scrolls ``merely revived [this] old, long
discarded theory,'' claims Millar Burrows in More Light on the Dead
Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK ON JESUS
</P>
<P>
   Scroll scholar A. Dupont-Sommer explains that the Essene theory
was a product of 18th-century biblical criticism. It speculated
that Jesus ``was imbued with Essene ethics, which in their turn,
owe much to Zeno,'' a Greek philosopher of the fifth century BC.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Essene Writings from Qumran,'' Dupont-Sommer says the
Christian apologists saw this philosophy as ``a weapon, a devilish
theory designed to sap the originality and transcendence of
Christian revelation. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand
the very lively opposition of a number of Christian historians,
Catholic and Protestant alike, in the 19th century and during the
first half of the 20th.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Essene theory had become a scholarly attack upon
Jesus -- the uniqueness of his teaching, his Jewishness, his early
years and his divinity.
</P>
<P>
   Though soundly refuted in the last century, the Essene theory
began gaining acceptance again in the 1950s. Jewish scholars, such
as Zeitlin and P. R. Weiss, were among a growing number who
challenged the early dating of the scrolls as well as the theory
that the Essenes wrote them. They believed the scrolls dated from
the medieval period, rather than 300 BC to AD 50.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitlin wrote that ``ascribing ... the scrolls to the
pre-Christian period (was) theologically motivated.'' The scrolls
were being used as propaganda against Christianity, he said, by
back-dating them to the pre-Christian era. Many scholars who no
longer held to historic Christian doctrinal beliefs revived the
Essene theory to attack the Judeo-Christian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the Jewish scholars who defended
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity about the Dead Sea Scrolls continues as new pieces to
the puzzle of their origin are put into place and access to the
Dead Sea Scrolls becomes less restricted. We now know who the
Essenes were and that they couldn't have written the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars now must search for the historicity and identity of
those who did and who carefully stored them in the caves at Qumran.

</P>
<P>
   Dead Sea Scroll scholars combined several sects into one that
they inferred to be the Essenes in order to account for the
authorship of the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Josephus, a prominent Jewish historian of the same period, also
wrote about such a sect, calling its members city dwellers who
lived in ``every town in Israel.'' They didn't live in the desert
or wilderness, like the Dead Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, respected Israeli archaeologist Yizhar Hirschfeld
created a stir by asserting that Essenes lived not at Qumran, but
at Ein Gedi, a Dead Sea community 20 miles south of Qumran. But
Hirschfeld said he found a striking similarity between that
community and the monasteries built centuries later by Byzantine
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Pick, also an archaeologist and the dean of arts and
sciences at Columbia Pacific University in California, added a nail
to the coffin of the Essene theory when he told Newsday in 1997,
``The most telling thing was there was no synagogue at the Qumran
site.''
</P>
<P>
   First-century Jews, he said, built synagogues at sites where
they lived for only a few years, such as the fortress at Masada.
Why, Pick asks, wouldn't the Essenes have built a synagogue at
Qumran where they supposedly lived for more than 100 years?
</P>
<P>
   OSSAEANS, NOT ESSENES
</P>
<P>
   But people called ``Ossaeans'' did live along the northern
shores of the Dead Sea after AD 68. Some scrolls scholars believe
they were the Essenes.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius, a church father of the third and fourth centuries
AD, wrote that the ``so-called heresy of the Ossaeans ...
originated from the regions of Nabataea and Ituraea, Moabitis and
Arielitis, from the regions that are situated at the other side of
the lake that in the Holy Scripture is called Dead Sea.'' The fact
that Epiphanius calls them a ``heresy'' suggests that they had a
Christian background.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups lived not far away in the Golan Heights region.
Claudine Dauphin, a French archeologist, found that Judeo-Christian
sects emerged after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 and continued
into the medieval period.
</P>
<P>
   ``At two of the sites,'' she wrote, ``we started finding bizarre
stuff -- Christian symbols intertwined with Jewish symbols ... like
a menorah covered by a ship, representing the church, whose mast
was a cross, or a lulav (palm branch) whose top branches formed a
cross.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why I found lameds (the Hebrew ``L'') with the
top part turned into a cross in the Copper Scroll (one of the Dead
Sea Scrolls). Or why there are X's in the margins of messianic
passages that speak of the Messiah on the Isaiah Scroll.
</P>
<P>
   Another important clue in the search for the Essenes is offered
by Athanase Negoitsa in Revue de Qumran. He writes of a document by
Nilus the Ascetic of the fourth century AD that indicates the
Essenes lived then. Nilus praises their ``meditative and lofty
moral life.'' But he regrets that the Essenes do not follow in the
true philosophy of the gospel of Christ, implying that they were a
heretical Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a source that clearly states the Essenes originated in
the Christian period and not before?
</P>
<P>
   CALLED ``NAZARENES''
</P>
<P>
   We know from the writings of the Church Fathers that the Jews
who believed in Jesus were called ``Nazarenes'' and that they kept
the laws of Moses and the customs of the Jewish people. That
dispels the gentile myth that the Jewish people rejected Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, Honorius Augustodunensis stated, ``The Nazoraeans
are so called after the village Nazareth. These confess that Christ
is the Son of God but they observe everything in the old Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the New Testament book of Acts clearly
brings out that not only did large numbers of Pharisees, but also
``a great company of priests [Sadducees] had turned to the Lord.''
We also find in the book of Acts that entire Jewish cities, such as
Lydda and Sharon, accepted Jesus the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the Church Fathers that even in the later
centuries -- like the fourth and fifth centuries AD -- Jewish
followers of Messiah still existed and did not deny their heritage.
If the name for Jewish believers was ``Nazarenes,'' what then were
the gentiles called who received Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   We read in Acts of the Apostles (11:26) that the gentiles who
believed in Jesus were called ``Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   But between the time of the first gentile believer (Cornelius)
and the time that large numbers of gentiles in Antioch were
converted, what name differentiated gentiles?
</P>
<P>
   I found the following statement in Epiphanius: ``All Christians
were called Nazoraeans [Nazarenes] once. For a short time they were
given also the name Iessaeans, before the disciples in Antioch
began to be called Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius thus contradicts the theory that the Essenes were a
pre-Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But is he a reliable source? If he is, why have his words on the
subject been ignored? Why, as Negoitsa brings out, do ``...many
Qumranologists (Dead Sea Scroll scholars) take no account of
Epiphanius...?''
</P>
<P>
   They surely must have found, as I did, the references in
Epiphanius that show the Essene sect did not come into existence
until after the death of Jesus. A noted Qumranologist has revealed
that ``older scholars will prefer to ignore the new materials: the
ferment they produce is too strong for their stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just ``new material'' but anything that goes against
the ``accepted theory.'' Four decades ago, Jewish writer and
scholar Solomon Zeitlin said anyone who challenged accepted Dead
Sea Scroll theories was regarded as a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars regard Epiphanius as an extremely important
source. In ``Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' German scholar
Rainer Riesner states, ``According to reliable tradition in
Epiphanius, the Jewish Christian community left the Holy City at
the outbreak of the Jewish War (AD 66-70) to settle at Pella in the
Decapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Negoitsa writes: ``Epiphanius was born in Palestine ... spoke
five languages, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Coptic, and Aramaic. Thus he
was able to read all the documents and writings ... (had) precise
information regarding the sects of Palestine and especially those
in the region harboring the Dead Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Negoitsa doesn't mention Epiphanius' statements about
``Iessaeans.'' What is the derivation of this Greek word, and does
this have any bearing on Christianity?
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Comfort, professor of Greek and New Testament at Wheaton
College and Senior Bible editor at Tyndale Publishing House, states
that the word ``Iessaeans'' or ``Essenes'' comes from the Greek
word ``Iessaios,'' which means Jesse, the father of David.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Christians may have called themselves this because
the Messiah was called the Son of Jesse (Isaiah 11:10, Romans
15:12),'' wrote Comfort, whose analysis offers further insight into
Epiphanius' statements that the Essenes were a Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   How then could the Essenes be the writers of the Dead Sea
Scrolls, which supposedly date as far back as 300 BC?
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the scrolls ``merely revived [this] old, long
discarded theory,'' claims Millar Burrows in More Light on the Dead
Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK ON JESUS
</P>
<P>
   Scroll scholar A. Dupont-Sommer explains that the Essene theory
was a product of 18th-century biblical criticism. It speculated
that Jesus ``was imbued with Essene ethics, which in their turn,
owe much to Zeno,'' a Greek philosopher of the fifth century BC.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Essene Writings from Qumran,'' Dupont-Sommer says the
Christian apologists saw this philosophy as ``a weapon, a devilish
theory designed to sap the originality and transcendence of
Christian revelation. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand
the very lively opposition of a number of Christian historians,
Catholic and Protestant alike, in the 19th century and during the
first half of the 20th.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Essene theory had become a scholarly attack upon
Jesus -- the uniqueness of his teaching, his Jewishness, his early
years and his divinity.
</P>
<P>
   Though soundly refuted in the last century, the Essene theory
began gaining acceptance again in the 1950s. Jewish scholars, such
as Zeitlin and P. R. Weiss, were among a growing number who
challenged the early dating of the scrolls as well as the theory
that the Essenes wrote them. They believed the scrolls dated from
the medieval period, rather than 300 BC to AD 50.
</P>
<P>
   Zeitlin wrote that ``ascribing ... the scrolls to the
pre-Christian period (was) theologically motivated.'' The scrolls
were being used as propaganda against Christianity, he said, by
back-dating them to the pre-Christian era. Many scholars who no
longer held to historic Christian doctrinal beliefs revived the
Essene theory to attack the Judeo-Christian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the Jewish scholars who defended
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity about the Dead Sea Scrolls continues as new pieces to
the puzzle of their origin are put into place and access to the
Dead Sea Scrolls becomes less restricted. We now know who the
Essenes were and that they couldn't have written the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars now must search for the historicity and identity of
those who did and who carefully stored them in the caves at Qumran.

<P>
   Since the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in the Qumran area of
Israel, the question of who wrote these biblical and secular texts
has puzzled scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed as the archeological find of the century, the scrolls
supposedly are the oldest copies of most of the Old Testament and
sectarian writings. Scholars have theorized that they were written
by the ``Essenes,'' an ascetic brotherhood of bishops and laymen
with strict rules of behavior that existed long before the birth of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is evidence that the Essene sect was not established
until after the time of Christ. If the Dead Sea Scrolls are indeed
pre-Christian documents, the Essenes could not have written them.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, scholars who
questioned the truth of the Bible developed the Essene theory to
account for the origins of Christianity. They speculated that it
sprang from a sect of pre-Christian Jews. These scholars also
suggested that John the Baptist and Jesus himself were Essenes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nowhere in the New Testament are the Essenes mentioned,
though other sects are, including the Zealots, Herodians, Sadducees
and Pharisees.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the writers of the Scrolls never called themselves
``Essenes,'' but referred to themselves as ``the poor'' or ``poor
in spirit,'' which also happen to be terms applied to the early
followers of Jesus. Even Lawrence Schiffman, a noted Dead Sea
Scroll scholar, has gone so far as to say that the writers of the
scrolls should not be referred to as ``Essenes'' but as the
``Qumran sect.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, scholars who believe in the antiquity of the
Scrolls claim they were written by the Essenes in a writing house
-- a scriptorium -- in Qumran near the caves where the first
scrolls were found. World renowned Hebrew paleographer M. Bezalel
Narkis, however, notes in La Paleographie Hebraique Medievale that,
``One should take into consideration the fact that Jews never had
monastic scriptoria ... . Only since the 13th century is there some
evidence of larger workshops headed by scribes.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The records of historians Pliny and Philo, who were writing in
the decades after Jesus' death, include sketchy details about
sects.
</P>
<P>
   Dead Sea Scroll scholars combined several sects into one that
they inferred to be the Essenes in order to account for the
authorship of the scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Josephus, a prominent Jewish historian of the same period, also
wrote about such a sect, calling its members city dwellers who
lived in ``every town in Israel.'' They didn't live in the desert
or wilderness, like the Dead Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, respected Israeli archaeologist Yizhar Hirschfeld
created a stir by asserting that Essenes lived not at Qumran, but
at Ein Gedi, a Dead Sea community 20 miles south of Qumran. But
Hirschfeld said he found a striking similarity between that
community and the monasteries built centuries later by Byzantine
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Pick, also an archaeologist and the dean of arts and
sciences at Columbia Pacific University in California, added a nail
to the coffin of the Essene theory when he told Newsday in 1997,
``The most telling thing was there was no synagogue at the Qumran
site.''
</P>
<P>
   First-century Jews, he said, built synagogues at sites where
they lived for only a few years, such as the fortress at Masada.
Why, Pick asks, wouldn't the Essenes have built a synagogue at
Qumran where they supposedly lived for more than 100 years?
</P>
<P>
   OSSAEANS, NOT ESSENES
</P>
<P>
   But people called ``Ossaeans'' did live along the northern
shores of the Dead Sea after AD 68. Some scrolls scholars believe
they were the Essenes.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius, a church father of the third and fourth centuries
AD, wrote that the ``so-called heresy of the Ossaeans ...
originated from the regions of Nabataea and Ituraea, Moabitis and
Arielitis, from the regions that are situated at the other side of
the lake that in the Holy Scripture is called Dead Sea.'' The fact
that Epiphanius calls them a ``heresy'' suggests that they had a
Christian background.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups lived not far away in the Golan Heights region.
Claudine Dauphin, a French archeologist, found that Judeo-Christian
sects emerged after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 and continued
into the medieval period.
</P>
<P>
   ``At two of the sites,'' she wrote, ``we started finding bizarre
stuff -- Christian symbols intertwined with Jewish symbols ... like
a menorah covered by a ship, representing the church, whose mast
was a cross, or a lulav (palm branch) whose top branches formed a
cross.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why I found lameds (the Hebrew ``L'') with the
top part turned into a cross in the Copper Scroll (one of the Dead
Sea Scrolls). Or why there are X's in the margins of messianic
passages that speak of the Messiah on the Isaiah Scroll.
</P>
<P>
   Another important clue in the search for the Essenes is offered
by Athanase Negoitsa in Revue de Qumran. He writes of a document by
Nilus the Ascetic of the fourth century AD that indicates the
Essenes lived then. Nilus praises their ``meditative and lofty
moral life.'' But he regrets that the Essenes do not follow in the
true philosophy of the gospel of Christ, implying that they were a
heretical Christian group.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a source that clearly states the Essenes originated in
the Christian period and not before?
</P>
<P>
   CALLED ``NAZARENES''
</P>
<P>
   We know from the writings of the Church Fathers that the Jews
who believed in Jesus were called ``Nazarenes'' and that they kept
the laws of Moses and the customs of the Jewish people. That
dispels the gentile myth that the Jewish people rejected Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, Honorius Augustodunensis stated, ``The Nazoraeans
are so called after the village Nazareth. These confess that Christ
is the Son of God but they observe everything in the old Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the New Testament book of Acts clearly
brings out that not only did large numbers of Pharisees, but also
``a great company of priests [Sadducees] had turned to the Lord.''
We also find in the book of Acts that entire Jewish cities, such as
Lydda and Sharon, accepted Jesus the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from the Church Fathers that even in the later
centuries -- like the fourth and fifth centuries AD -- Jewish
followers of Messiah still existed and did not deny their heritage.
If the name for Jewish believers was ``Nazarenes,'' what then were
the gentiles called who received Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   We read in Acts of the Apostles (11:26) that the gentiles who
believed in Jesus were called ``Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   But between the time of the first gentile believer (Cornelius)
and the time that large numbers of gentiles in Antioch were
converted, what name differentiated gentiles?
</P>
<P>
   I found the following statement in Epiphanius: ``All Christians
were called Nazoraeans [Nazarenes] once. For a short time they were
given also the name Iessaeans, before the disciples in Antioch
began to be called Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanius thus contradicts the theory that the Essenes were a
pre-Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But is he a reliable source? If he is, why have his words on the
subject been ignored? Why, as Negoitsa brings out, do ``...many
Qumranologists (Dead Sea Scroll scholars) take no account of
Epiphanius...?''
</P>
<P>
   They surely must have found, as I did, the references in
Epiphanius that show the Essene sect did not come into existence
until after the death of Jesus. A noted Qumranologist has revealed
that ``older scholars will prefer to ignore the new materials: the
ferment they produce is too strong for their stomachs.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just ``new material'' but anything that goes against
the ``accepted theory.'' Four decades ago, Jewish writer and
scholar Solomon Zeitlin said anyone who challenged accepted Dead
Sea Scroll theories was regarded as a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars regard Epiphanius as an extremely important
source. In ``Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' German scholar
Rainer Riesner states, ``According to reliable tradition in
Epiphanius, the Jewish Christian community left the Holy City at
the outbreak of the Jewish War (AD 66-70) to settle at Pella in the
Decapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Negoitsa writes: ``Epiphanius was born in Palestine ... spoke
five languages, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Coptic, and Aramaic. Thus he
was able to read all the documents and writings ... (had) precise
information regarding the sects of Palestine and especially those
in the region harboring the Dead Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Negoitsa doesn't mention Epiphanius' statements about
``Iessaeans.'' What is the derivation of this Greek word, and does
this have any bearing on Christianity?
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Comfort, professor of Greek and New Testament at Wheaton
College and Senior Bible editor at Tyndale Publishing House, states
that the word ``Iessaeans'' or ``Essenes'' comes from the Greek
word ``Iessaios,'' which means Jesse, the father of David.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Christians may have called themselves this because
the Messiah was called the Son of Jesse (Isaiah 11:10, Romans
15:12),'' wrote Comfort, whose analysis offers further insight into
Epiphanius' statements that the Essenes were a Christian sect.
</P>
<P>
   How then could the Essenes be the writers of the Dead Sea
Scrolls, which supposedly date as far back as 300 BC?
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the scrolls ``merely revived [this] old, long
discarded theory,'' claims Millar Burrows in More Light on the Dead
Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>

   Scroll scholar A. Dupont-Sommer explains that the Essene theory
was a product of 18th-century biblical criticism. It speculated
that Jesus ``was imbued with Essene ethics, which in their turn,
owe much to Zeno,'' a Greek philosopher of the fifth century BC.

Christian apologists saw this philosophy as ``a weapon, a devilish

Christian revelation. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand
the very lively opposition of a number of Christian historians,

</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Essene theory had become a scholarly attack upon
Jesus -- the uniqueness of his teaching, his Jewishness, his early

</P>
<P>
   Though soundly refuted in the last century, the Essene theory

as Zeitlin and P. R. Weiss, were among a growing number who
challenged the early dating of the scrolls as well as the theory
that the Essenes wrote them. They believed the scrolls dated from
the medieval period, rather than 300 BC to AD 50.

   Curiosity about the Dead Sea Scrolls continues as new pieces to
the puzzle of their origin are put into place and access to the
Dead Sea Scrolls becomes less restricted. We now know who the
Essenes were and that they couldn't have written the scrolls.

   Scholars now must search for the historicity and identity of
those who did and who carefully stored them in the caves at Qumran.

<P>
   The ambiance might charitably be described as early 20th-century
American dungeon: The cobwebbed walls are made of thick slabs of
Manhattan schist set in brown mortar, which over the last century
has shed enough sand and lime to form an inch-high berm at their
base. A network of rusty pipes _ steam, gas, drain, sprinkler and
water _ crisscrosses the floor and ceiling. The air is moist and
pungent, redolent of No. 2 heating oil and steam-boiler exhaust and
shimmers in rude blue fluorescent light. This is a basement, my
basement, and I love it.
</P>
<P>
   In our five-story, five-bedroom house, this is the one place I
can truly call my own. Each of my children has his or her own
bedroom. My wife, who works at home, has her own study. Even the
washer and dryer get their own four walls with a door that closes.
By default, I get everything beneath the house's habitable spaces.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about a louche rec room with a wet bar and a
60-inch television. I'm not even talking about the kind of slightly
mildewed chamber that is hospitable enough to house a laundry or a
sewing nook. I'm referring to a nether world of sewer drains, leaky
pipes, tool-strewn work benches and smoky power plant that only a
man could covet. I'm talking about the kind of creepy, irredeemable
vault that, much as I may wish for it, could not even be converted
into a teen-ager's bedroom. Banished to this subterranean briar
patch by the local matriarchy, I secretly howl with joy.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture that has been working overtime to break down gender
barriers and eliminate old-boy clubs, the basement continues to
resist integration. And that's not likely to change anytime soon,
says Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the author of ``Finding Flow: The
Psychology of Engagement With Everyday Life'' (Basic Books, 1998),
the best-selling analysis of peak experience.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his research into flow, that absorbing psychological
state that athletes, musicians and surgeons refer to as ``the
zone,'' the University of Chicago psychologist outfitted 200
working men and women with electronic pagers, beeped them randomly
during the day and asked them to write down where they were and how
happy and creative they felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the basement is the part of the home in which
men have the greatest number of positive moods, and the environment
in which women have the fewest,'' Csikszentmihalyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Where are women happiest? ``In the bathroom,'' he said. ``It's
one of the few places they don't feel hassled by children or
husbands _ a place where they don't feel obligated to do anything
but focus on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be impolitic to say it, but the affinity for what
Csikszentmihalyi calls the micro-ecology of the basement almost
certainly originates in the Y chromosome. My 16-year-old daughter
was surprised recently to learn we had one. Her younger sister has
explored the region a couple of times with her twin brother but now
refuses to venture beyond the top of the stairs, from which outpost
she often rouses me from a board-drilling fugue to request dinner
or announce a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Social constructionists would undoubtedly argue that my girls
are simply taking their cues from their mom, who refuses to honor
this sanctuary, the very foundation of our cozy Upper West Side
Manhattan familial corporation, with even an occasional visit. They
would also have a generous explanation for her apparent snub: she's
cutting me some slack,  &UR; honoring my space &LR; . Perhaps. But she also
shudders just thinking about the moist ecology of our basement and
shakes her head, mystified, when I eagerly head off down below. I
don't expect her to understand my urge to drain the boiler, arrange
my drill bits, practice my slap shot and disassemble things that
work just fine any more than I can figure out why, when the world
is too much with her, she finds peace in an hour or so of furtive
folding and sorting.
</P>
<P>
   My 9-year-old son, by contrast, follows me into the sanctum
sanctorum every chance he can get, to learn, among other things,
the fabulously destructive potential of the Sawzall. He and his
pals can often be found there after school, furiously flailing away
with hammers and saws, industriously building nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Are we just an old-fashioned family, immune to the new gender
politics that has done away with His and Hers? I don't think so.
For one thing, our corporation requires two very modern paychecks
to stay afloat. I submit, however, that my basement puttering
satisfies a vital, even if seemingly outdated and redundant,
psychological need, long important to the male ego. With my
protective hands on the pulse of the domestic compound, I can
literally take and adjust its temperature, insure its proper
hydration and hygiene and feel as if I have guaranteed the good
health of the family gene pool for another day.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not so benighted as to expect credit for my efforts, though.
In the ongoing national and local debate on who does more domestic
scut work, basement chores rarely figure into the tally. For years,
researchers have churned out studies showing that, while working
dads are performing more household chores than their fathers did,
women still do the maid's share of them _ and often after racing
home from the office themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures from the Families and Work Institute, a
Manhattan research group, show that men now put in 75 percent as
much time as women taking care of grunt work in the parlor, kitchen
and nursery _ up from 30 percent in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   But what would happen to that ratio if the obligations of the
basement were added to the usual cleaning, shopping and diapering?
I would trade having to plunge my arm shoulder-deep into a
backed-up sewer drain in search of a Furby someone has flushed down
a toilet for a hundred diaper changes any day.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe I would not. The basement is my world, and I'm
not ready to give it up.

A WEB SURFER'S GUIDE TO ANCIENT BRITISH PAST

<P>
   In the beginning, when the glaciers had retreated and the land
was young, when warrior kings and their priests had learned how to
use awe and fear, and even before they had learned to use an
alphabet, there was Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, before Stonehenge, there was Avebury, 20 miles
to the north. Bigger and more elaborate than Stonehenge, Avebury,
near Silbury Hill, is the largest prehistoric mound in Europe. In
fact, Southwest England is studded with giant stone monuments,
circular ditch-and-wall henges, burial mounds and lines of ancient
avenues, built by thousands of prehistoric men and women over
thousands of years in the late Neolithic and early Bronze Ages.
</P>
<P>
   A village later grew up within Avebury's circle, and between
anti-pagan moralists and building-supply scavengers, Avebury's
stones have been ravaged. It is Stonehenge, standing on the
Salisbury Plain of Wiltshire, safer from builders and destroyers,
that has caught the world's historical and mystical fancy.
</P>
<P>
   On a Web site named ``The Complete Stonehenge''
(http://www.amherst.edu/ermace/sth/sth.html) on a page titled ``Why
I'm Obsessed,'' the site's creator, Emily Mace, wrote, ``Something
profound, something wonderful, something magnificent must have
happened when I saw that monument.''
</P>
<P>
   Her site is part of the Stone Circle Web Ring
(easyweb.easynet.co.uk/aburnham/ring), a group of more than 100
sites dealing with dolmens, menhirs, sarsen stones, barrows, burial
mounds and theories varying from the informed to the fanciful to
the seriously extraterrestrial: ``Dark Isle,''
``Archaeoastronomy,'' ``Crystalinks,'' ``Megalithica,'' ``The Ley
Hunter Journal,'' ``Stones of Wonder,'' ``How the Shaman Stole the
Moon'' and straight on till morning.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to start a tour, a wonderful guide is The
Megalith Map (members.tripod.com/megalithic), an index with the
location of any known stone circle or row in the British Isles. All
of Britain and Ireland are gridded: Click on a map grid and you get
little symbols for each site. Try Stonehenge, and you get not only
the visual and textual geography, but also a list of 16 other Web
sites with more information.
</P>
<P>
   The Megalith Map is produced with the help of Aubrey Burl, the
author of many books on prehistoric Britain, including ``A Guide to
the Stone Circles of Britain and Ireland'' (Yale University Press,
1995).
</P>
<P>
   A less comprehensive but highly readable map guide, Ancient
Britain (www.weldwood.demon.co.uk/ancient.htm), provides more
information about fewer megalithic sites, along with many pictures.
The writer calls Avebury a far more rewarding place to visit than
Stonehenge. ``The atmosphere of the stones,'' the writer says of
Stonehenge, ``is long gone and with each visit I find it a little
more depressing than the last.'' (English Heritage, the
government-sponsored preservation group, is planning a major
relocation of the roads and tourist buildings to help improve the
scenic beauty.)
</P>
<P>
   There are few signs of long-term settlement contemporaneous with
Stonehenge and Avebury, and this absence has given rise to the
notion that the builders were nomadic tribes. But the notion that
nomads planned and executed a virtual city of religious and
astronomical significance seems even more far-fetched: Some of the
monument's bluestones are believed to have been transported more
than 100 miles, from hills in Wales, and required hundreds of
laborers, who had to be housed and fed.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the gold ornaments and bronze daggers buried
in many of the graves, implying the existence of a nobility and an
artisan class.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the historians are sure of is that the builders were
not Druids; those animist forest-dwellers arrived long after
Stonehenge was built. The Brittannia Web site's Earth Mysteries
pages by Chris Witcombe has a section on Druids:
britannia.com/wonder/earth/druids.html.
</P>
<P>
   The builders of Stonehenge left no alphabet but knew astronomy:
The lintel stones and the ``heel stone'' to the east of the circles
form a giant sundial in line with the summer solstice. English
Heritage has done extensive radiocarbon dating of the site, dating
antlers in the surrounding ditch to 3000 B.C., many of the main
stones to between 2800 and 2200 B.C., and other parts to 1400 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   To some archeologists, the most amazing thing about Stonehenge
is not the construction itself but the huge span of time, more than
1,500 years, in which it held an active place in prehistoric
society.

   Remember Silly Putty? An amorphous blob of industrial goo
marketed to children, its chief virtue was flexibility, and its
many uses were encyclopedically demonstrated in Saturday morning
television commercials: You can stretch Silly Putty into any shape!
It can be rolled into a ball and bounced!
</P>
<P>
   And if you flatten it over a comic book, the image transfers,
turning the featureless, gray-beige lump into a temporary storage
medium for colorful drawings. Would wonders never cease?
</P>
<P>
   So you bought the Silly Putty and did all the things you saw in
the commercial, then promptly lost interest because at the end of
the day, Silly Putty doesn't have much to say for itself. It's all
style and no substance.
</P>
<P>
   Audiorom's Shift Control does for sound what Silly Putty did for
industrial goo. The product of a London-based design collective,
Shift Control showcases a dozen ways to stretch, bounce and
manipulate sound in an environment studded with references to
computer games, techno music and club culture.
</P>
<P>
   It's insanely stylish. The program begins with an explosion of
circular schematic diagrams _ perhaps cross sections of a
cylindrical skyscraper, or tiny gears or cells _ drifting across
the screen like boulders in a classic game of Asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   Each contains a sound sample, triggered when the cells
intersect. Nudge the cursor inside one of these membranes and it
will float along inside a bubble of sound as the audio snippet
loops indefinitely. Click twice, and each diagram opens a cleverly
crafted audio interface.
</P>
<P>
   There's a mixing board where you can stretch audio samples like
melted mozzarella and stack them in layers. A paint program assigns
each color a different sound effect, so you can sweep the cursor
across the screen to ``play'' the image as a soundscape.
</P>
<P>
   Another interface positions sounds in space: dragging an icon up
or down changes the volume; dragging it left or right pans between
speakers. Like Silly Putty, these features allow you to stretch
stuff and make it stick to walls.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the rolling-into-a-ball-and-bouncing category,
there is another group of Shift Control interfaces that makes
sounds into virtual objects subject to virtual physics. If you
throw miniature schematic diagrams around, they'll trigger sound
samples whenever they bounce off the walls (a sly, winking
reference to Atari Breakout, a console game old enough to buy
alcohol).
</P>
<P>
   Another interface, shamelessly derived from the work of Toshio
Iwai, a Japanese sound artist, uses movable barriers to trigger and
redirect audio samples. Place two barriers across from each other,
set the ball bouncing between them, and voila, a simple sound loop.
</P>
<P>
   With more objects in motion and more barriers in place, the
sound scheme becomes denser and more complex. But it's still, at
heart, a game of follow the bouncing ball.
</P>
<P>
   A third cluster of sound toys bridges the gap between music and
text, converting the text keyboard into a sound keyboard, with each
row of keys corresponding to a bass line, melodic groove or ambient
wobble. It seems arbitrary at first, but most translations of music
into text are arbitrary _ the lines and dots we use to represent
music on a page, or the fact that 440 vibrations per second
translates into the letter A.
</P>
<P>
   Before typewriters, musical keyboards were the only kind. Shift
Control restores the keyboard interface to its source, with a
twist.
</P>
<P>
   Riffing on the translation of text into sound, another sound
tool spins alphabet letters into saxophone phrases that flow
smoothly into one another. Frequent letter combinations like ``re''
or ``ion'' become leitmotifs. Business memos and Read Me files
metamorphose into reasonably interesting music. Snippy e-mail from
erstwhile sweethearts also sounds snazzy (must be all the
exclamation marks).
</P>
<P>
   This is the only feature of Shift Control that stands up to
continuous play. The rest, like Silly Putty, loses its appeal when
the novelty wears off. It's visually beautiful, but an extremely
superficial experience. It's great the way a movie trailer or a
book jacket or album liner notes can be great. You're impressed,
but only once or twice, and then you want to know what's
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't anything beneath the surface here because Shift
Control isn't about content. It's about different ways to package
content. As a packaging showcase, Shift Control is a spectacular
success.
</P>
<P>
   It does everything great packaging is supposed to do: It makes
whatever is wrapped inside (in this case, unremarkable techno
music) seem hipper and more exciting that it actually is. And it
garners kudos in the design community, which awarded Shift Control
a handsome plaque at the Milia 99 Festival in Cannes. So this disk
is circulating in art departments up and down Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In six months, these packaging ideas will be used to sell blue
jeans, soft drinks and prepaid long-distance calling cards. It's a
short hop from the London Institute of Contemporary Art to the
advertising world. Follow the bouncing ball.
</P>
<P>
   (Shift Control, by Audiorom, sells for 16.99 pounds _ about $28.
It can be ordered online at www.audiorom.com.)

COMPUTERS DISSECT THE INSTANT WHEN CLUB MEETS BALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (af)  
 By BRIGID BUCKMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer-aided design software, a tool usually thought of in
connection with architecture and interior design, has played a
significant role in the evolution of golf equipment in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Rugge, the director of research and development for the
Taylor Made Golf Co &UR; . &LR; , based in Carlsbad, Calif., said computer
capabilities had altered the development process by allowing the
company's engineers to assess club designs through animated motion
and readouts that the computer programs provide.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Joe Hoffman, a design engineer at Taylor Made, can
fine-tune an animated club head that appears on his computer screen
by experimenting with properties the software makes visible, such
as the center of gravity, a pivotal element to a strong club
design.
 &UR;  &LR; The center of gravity is designated on screen with a small X on
the club that can be moved according to design needs. Thus,
engineers can redesign the club with different materials or in a
different shape in order to shift the center of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-aided design tool also makes it easier to
experiment with some materials, like titanium, by allowing the
engineers to see how specific metals will react to collisions.
 &UR;  &LR; Designers can then determine what alterations are necessary to
maximize performance on the computer screen before the club is
physically brought to life in the modeling room through a data
transfer process that is similar to sending a word processing
document to a printer.
</P>
<P>
   In Taylor Made's modeling shop, prototypes in both wax and
machine resin are developed from the computer data. The clay-like
machine resin prototype is painted according to the graphic design
sketches and evaluated aesthetically. If the resin prototype is
given the go-ahead, it is then cast in the appropriate metals.
 &UR;  &LR;  This completed prototype is then brought to Taylor Made's swing
dynamics lab, a mid-sized room brimming over with computers and
electronic gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   David Anderson, a Taylor Made mechanical engineer with an
impressive handicap of 7, strategically places light meters on the
club and his own body, then stands in front of five light sensor
cameras and swings the prototype club at a ball, launching it into
the wall in front of him with a sharp bang.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras record the movement of the club and Anderson's
swing, feeding the motion and velocity data into customized
analytical software. This software analyzes how the ball and club
react upon collision, and how the club interacts with the golfer's
body. It also allows the engineers to watch the swing and collision
in a stick-figure representation complete with a complex data
readout.
</P>
<P>
   It is this process that helps the design team assess whether or
not the club is performing as predicted. If not, they can analyze
the problems. If the club performs to the satisfaction of the
development team, it then moves on to a test of player reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that can take the place of testing them by
putting them in the hands of golfers and letting them hit balls,''
said Rugge.
</P>
<P>
   If the club fails to win the support of the players in the test
group, as well as Taylor Made's tour staff, an assortment of pro
golfers including Mark O'Meara, it goes back to the computer
screen.

   Here is a sampling of golf balls and drivers made possible by
new technology, with the manufacturers' recommended retail prices:
</P>
<P>
   ORLIMAR TRIMETAL DRIVER ($400): A driver with a stainless steel
shell, a face that blends a variety of metals and copper-tungsten
weighting.
</P>
<P>
   TAYLOR MADE FIRESOLE DRIVER ($399): This oversized titanium club
head is 12 percent smaller than Taylor Made's last driver, the
Tibubble2. Tungsten is added to the bottom of the club to weight
it, which the company says will give more power to a ball struck on
the sweet spot.
</P>
<P>
   CALLAWAY'S GREAT BIG BERTHA HAWK EYE TITANIUM DRIVER ($500): The
latest in the Big Bertha line has a tungsten screw in the sole of
the oversized titanium clubhead. The company says the lower center
of gravity results in a more powerful drive.
</P>
<P>
   WILSON'S STAFF TITANIUM STRAIGHT DISTANCE BALLS ($35 per dozen):
This ball has a dimple pattern that the company says is designed
for extra distance. Wilson call this its longest-flying ball to
date.
</P>
<P>
   TOP-FLITE'S BI-METAL BALLS ($37 per dozen): This ball uses
titanium in the cover and tungsten in the core.
</P>
<P>
   TITLEIST PROFESSIONAL BALLS ($54 per dozen): A cover made from a
rubbery plastic creates a softer feel for this ball, which is meant
for better players who can get better control over a soft-cover
ball.

<P>
   EL ROSARIO, Mexico _ In a scene out of science fiction, millions
of monarch butterflies cling to the branches of fir trees in
shivering clumps, swaying gently like giant prehistoric flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the sun bursts through the forest and the monarchs
explode into flight, creating a blizzard of orange and black wings
as translucent as stained glass, as delicate as the strains of a
harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please watch your step!'' urges guide Sergio Antonio Moreno,
as tennis shoes kick up dust and narrowly miss butterflies in their
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, ma'am,'' Moreno answers a woman carrying a plastic bag,
``you can't take the butterflies with you, not even the dead
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in this remote forest 120 miles west of Mexico City, a
country is struggling to balance one of the world's most
extraordinary natural wonders against the needs of very poor
farmers and the demands of well-meaning tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is the 2,000-mile monarch butterfly migration,
from summer breeding grounds on the U.S.-Canadian border down
through the Gulf states and into winter enclaves in Mexico's Sierra
Madre mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Flying about 100 miles a day, the butterflies' trek is as old as
modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   But the migration is so endangered by logging, land erosion and
poorly managed tourism that it could be wiped out within our
lifetime, according to some experts. That danger exists despite a
decade of attempts to protect the monarchs' habitat in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is now the Achilles' heel of the monarch migration,''
said biologist Lincoln Brower of Sweet Briar College in Virginia.
``Losing it would be like losing Yellowstone National Park.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the number of butterflies that have
gathered in Mexico have declined 70 to 80 percent (CQ), according
to Brower. The reasons remain a mystery, but Brower is convinced
that El Nino's drought conditions, logging and the draining of
water from streams for cottage industries are the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, a Mexican writer and environmentalist who grew
up among the butterflies, said logging -- clandestine and legal --
continues to destroy the fir trees known as ``oyamel'' that are the
butterflies' protective blanket while they winter in Michoacan and
Mexico states between November and late March. Most of the monarchs
that migrate from east of the Rocky Mountains winter in this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the scandal if you were to destroy the Sistine
Chapel,'' said Aridjis, calling the butterflies' gathering in
Mexico ``a masterpiece of nature'' comparable to ``listening to
Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to protect the butterflies' habitat, Brower, the
World Wildlife Foundation and others are working with the Mexican
government on a scientific review of monarch sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, researchers confirmed that monarchs resting in
Mexico during the winter came from the Great Lakes region and the
American Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, five out of a dozen mountain ranges in the Sierra Madre
identified as monarch habitat were declared sanctuaries, areas
where logging would be either prohibited or strictly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say it is urgent that areas not yet protected
be declared sanctuaries also, or those forests will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do it drive through that area and see all the
logging trucks, most illegal,'' said Chip Taylor, a University of
Kansas entomologist and director of Monarch Watch, a group that
monitors the migration.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty has led to a plundering of the forest as farmers raze
trees to make way for crops or cut down trees to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're just as poor as they were before,'' Aridjis said.
</P>
<P>
   If it is going to declare more land as sanctuaries, Mexico also
needs a long-term plan for showing people who own that land now
that they can earn money from a ``living forest'' through managed
tourism and other activities, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctuaries like El Rosario -- where farmers now serve as guides
-- are a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Each family that owns a piece of the land here must send a
member to work at the sanctuary, either as a guide or maintenance
worker. In exchange, they receive a cut of the proceeds from
tickets, which are about $1.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all poor here, but most of us are in agreement with
this now,'' said guide Antonio Moreno, 20.
</P>
<P>
   But Moreno and other guides now well versed in the monarchs'
needs said even tourism is taking a toll on the sanctuary. On
weekends, as many as 8,000 people pour through the reserve, raising
thick clouds of dust and making so much noise that the butterflies
flee higher into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Outside El Rosario, shacks selling souvenirs stand on bare land
where groves of trees hosted monarchs a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really very worried,'' said Javier de la Maza, director
of Mexico's protected areas. ``I'm the first one to say that things
have gotten out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Mexico may consider proposals to allow environmental
groups to work with farmers to manage the tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchs' breeding ground in Canada and the United States is
vast, encompassing about 1.3 million square miles and stretching
from the Great Lakes down into Texas and other Gulf Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   But in Mexico the insects funnel into an area that measures only
about 30 by 60 miles. And only a fraction of that -- 60 square
miles -- is currently protected.
</P>
<P>
   Within those 60 square miles, logging is prohibited in less than
18 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific review of the monarchs' habitat could increase
the number of sanctuaries, said de la Maza. But nothing is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico also has launched reforestation projects it hopes will
restore some of the forest that's been lost inside sanctuaries, de
la Maza added.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm clock that starts the monarchs on their journey to
Mexico is the autumnal equinox in late September. That when they
return to the winter grounds from where their great-grandparents
flew the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Like a orange snowstorm, they flutter into the Sierra Madre in
late October, just in time for Mexico's Day of the Dead celebration
on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say they return to pay their respects to their
ancestors,'' said Moreno. He said he and his neighbors used to call
the butterflies ``doves'' and had no idea where they came from each
year.
</P>
<P>
   On a quiet weekday, the sanctuary's trees are covered with
butterflies. By mid-morning, they drop from the trees and fill the
air, lighting in meadows to drink from dew and streams and to feed
on wildflowers. Sometimes hundreds tumble from branches in one fell
swoop, like a waterfall or carpet unfurling. Their wings beat a
soft hum that competes with the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchs mate, some die and around the vernal equinox in
late March they leave in droves, flying north again where three
more generations are born before the cycle is repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a unique world phenomenon,'' Brower said.
``There are certain areas in world that transcend nationalism. The
monarch reserves are one of them.''

<P>
   EL ROSARIO, Mexico _ In a scene out of science fiction, millions
of monarch butterflies cling to the branches of fir trees in
shivering clumps, swaying gently like giant prehistoric flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the sun bursts through the forest and the monarchs
explode into flight, creating a blizzard of orange and black wings
as translucent as stained glass, as delicate as the strains of a
harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please watch your step!'' urges guide Sergio Antonio Moreno,
as tennis shoes kick up dust and narrowly miss butterflies in their
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, ma'am,'' Moreno answers a woman carrying a plastic bag,
``you can't take the butterflies with you, not even the dead
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in this remote forest 120 miles west of Mexico City, a
country is struggling to balance one of the world's most
extraordinary natural wonders against the needs of very poor
farmers and the demands of well-meaning tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is the 2,000-mile monarch butterfly migration,
from summer breeding grounds on the U.S.-Canadian border down
through the Gulf states and into winter enclaves in Mexico's Sierra
Madre mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Flying about 100 miles a day, the butterflies' trek is as old as
modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   But the migration is so endangered by logging, land erosion and
poorly managed tourism that it could be wiped out within our
lifetime, according to some experts. That danger exists despite a
decade of attempts to protect the monarchs' habitat in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is now the Achilles' heel of the monarch migration,''
said biologist Lincoln Brower of Sweet Briar College in Virginia.
``Losing it would be like losing Yellowstone National Park.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the number of butterflies that have
gathered in Mexico have declined 70 to 80 percent (CQ), according
to Brower. The reasons remain a mystery, but Brower is convinced
that El Nino's drought conditions, logging and the draining of
water from streams for cottage industries are the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, a Mexican writer and environmentalist who grew
up among the butterflies, said logging -- clandestine and legal --
continues to destroy the fir trees known as ``oyamel'' that are the
butterflies' protective blanket while they winter in Michoacan and
Mexico states between November and late March. Most of the monarchs
that migrate from east of the Rocky Mountains winter in this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the scandal if you were to destroy the Sistine
Chapel,'' said Aridjis, calling the butterflies' gathering in
Mexico ``a masterpiece of nature'' comparable to ``listening to
Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to protect the butterflies' habitat, Brower, the
World Wildlife Foundation and others are working with the Mexican
government on a scientific review of monarch sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, researchers confirmed that monarchs resting in
Mexico during the winter came from the Great Lakes region and the
American Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, five out of a dozen mountain ranges in the Sierra Madre
identified as monarch habitat were declared sanctuaries, areas
where logging would be either prohibited or strictly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say it is urgent that areas not yet protected
be declared sanctuaries also, or those forests will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do it drive through that area and see all the
logging trucks, most illegal,'' said Chip Taylor, a University of
Kansas entomologist and director of Monarch Watch, a group that
monitors the migration.

trees to make way for crops or cut down trees to sell.

<P>
   As golfers count the days until they can launch balls down lush
green fairways, they start to look doubtfully at their equipment:
Will that dinged-up putter really do this year? Has some new club
come along to prompt the golfer to put last year's flashy titanium
driver out to pasture? Is the next guy's ball giving him a huge
advantage over everybody else?
</P>
<P>
   But those questions are entwined with some troubling issues for
the sport. Golf, seemingly one of the lowest-tech pastimes, is
trembling from traditionalists' charges that technological advances
have sullied the game.
</P>
<P>
   The digital revolution has helped bring equipment design to the
point where oversized, even cartoon-like, drivers are now the norm,
and golf balls composed of seemingly sci-fi materials are common.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the governor of the sport in this country, the
U.S. Golf Association, strives to keep talent, not technology, the
deciding factor in matches _ and to keep the world's hallowed golf
courses from becoming obsolete beneath the boom of high-tech clubs
and balls.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA tests each innovation carefully. ``We are using
technology to fight technology,'' said Frank Thomas, the
association's technical director.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, equipment manufacturers support the changes in
clubs and balls. ``The average player is getting a big benefit from
technology,'' said Frank Garrett, director of golf research and
development at the Wilson Sporting Goods Co., based in Chicago.
Wilson was the nation's top seller of golf club sets in 1997,
according to the National Sporting Goods Association.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, golf is a game in which club hits ball for all of
450 millionths of a second. The variables at play in those instants
are the skills of the 26.4 million golfers who play nationwide and
the capabilities of their balls and clubs. About $3.4 billion was
spent on such equipment in 1997, the sporting goods association
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said golf clubs had become more forgiving, giving even a
poorly hit ball a better chance of being a decent shot. He also
pointed to improvements in balls. ``Golf balls are much more
consistent than they were 25 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gutta-percha, a tough rubbery gum used by modern dentists as a
filling substance, was the primary or sole ingredient in golf balls
until around the turn of the century, when a ball with a solid core
covered in tightly wound rubber with a gutta-percha cover took
over. By 1907, these balls were prompting calls from some members
of the USGA for standards to keep such improvements from ruining
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Today's players choose between two basic types of balls: low
spin and high spin. Low-spin balls, with a harder cover, are
designed to help the amateur. They offer added distance and
straighter shots.
</P>
<P>
   Carol King, a secretary from Canoga Park, Calif., who has been a
golfer for 40 years, said the low-spin balls gave her longer,
straighter shots. She sticks with her favorite low-spin brand
because, she said, the difference from ball to ball can be
pronounced. ``There are some balls that feel like rocks, and some
that jump right off of the club,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   High-spin balls are designed for the skilled player who already
has distance and accuracy under control and needs a ball with a
softer cover to get finer control. Such balls can be expensive,
however, with some listing for more than $50 per dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The Titleist Professional balls (manufacturer's suggested retail
price $54 a dozen) use new rubbery plastic materials to enhance
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Balls that costly, however, are enough to steer away golfers
like Darren Pavesi of Woodcliff Lake, N.J. ``Personally, I wouldn't
even look at them,'' he said. ``What is that _ gold in there?''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, the golf association tested all balls at
the hands of Iron Byron, a robot golfer that looks somewhat like a
metal oval mounted onto a miniature Eiffel Tower at the test range
at the group's headquarters, in Far Hills, N.J. Until last
November, Iron Byron was relied upon for tests enforcing the USGA's
overall distance standard, which allows a ball to travel a maximum
of approximately 280 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Iron Byron was replaced by an indoor test range;
the range's launcher shoots golf balls through a tunnel lined with
light meters, which send data to customized analytical software.
The system tests the ball's characteristics in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The software can take into account the launching angle, spinning
rate and velocity of the ball as well as the temperature, relative
humidity, barometric pressure and wind speed of the
microchip-created fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Also tested for each ball model are spherical symmetry, maximum
weight, minimum size and initial velocity, which cannot exceed 250
feet per second with a 2 percent tolerance. The USGA tested 642
models of balls, submitted by more than 40 manufacturers from 14
countries, to find out if they should be included on this spring's
list of approved balls. Only eight types failed; they were either
overweight, undersized or did not pass the initial velocity test.
</P>
<P>
   The golf association also has a biomechanics laboratory to
assess things like the interaction between a club and a golfer's
swing. In the laboratory, reflective markers are attached to the
golfer's clothing as well as to the club being assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Five video cameras record the movement of the golfer's swing by
reading the reflective markers and send these data to a computer
program that can generate a software model of a golfer; such models
make it easier to analyze things like the effect of a particular
club on a golfer's joints.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs are also tested to see if they conform to association
standards. The most technologically advanced clubs are the
long-hitting drivers; putters and irons are peripheral to the
technology debate. Since 1979, drivers that are hollow and made
primarily of metal (now called metal woods) have pushed classic
wood woods out of most golfers' bags.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until 1995 that titanium, a silvery white,
lightweight metal known for its tensile strength, became a
golf-club star with the introduction of the Great Big Bertha
Titanium Driver, made by the Callaway Golf Co., based in Carlsbad,
Calif. A relative of Callaway's 1991 sensation, the Big Bertha, the
Great Big Bertha used titanium to make a lighter club with a bigger
head.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most metal wood manufacturers quickly followed suit, with
similar lightweight club designs with big heads. Some designs now
involve other metals beyond titanium.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the popularity of oversized heads, Dick Rugge, the
director of research and development for the Taylor Made Golf Co.,
based in Carlsbad, Calif., said, ``You get better results with a
bad swing, and that's where most golfers live.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the USGA began testing certain types of
metal-wood drivers, especially the titaniums, for an undue
springlike or trampoline effect on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the test, an air cannon shoots a golf ball at the club face.
The ball is monitored by ballistic light meters that feed data into
a computer. The computer calculates the initial velocity of the
rebounding ball and any trampoline-like behavior by the club.
</P>
<P>
   Ely Callaway, the founder and chairman of the Callaway Golf Co.,
opposes efforts to restrict technological improvements in
equipment. The added distance from improved drivers ``is good for
the game and good for the 40 million golfers around the world,'' he
said, adding, ``We're not saying there should be some artificial
power allowed, like gunpowder.''
</P>
<P>
   The USGA's main concern with metal-wood drivers is that they may
make cherished older golf courses obsolete by adding distance to
drives. The association wants to avoid a repeat of the assault on
the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Ga., during the 1997
Masters tournament, when Tiger Woods won with a record-breaking
270, 18 under par.
</P>
<P>
   The technologically advanced equipment used by Woods and other
competitors helped them make such inroads that after the
competition, the club had to upgrade four holes to make them
harder.
</P>
<P>
   Many metal wood manufacturers see the USGA's standard as a block
to club development. Callaway has threatened to sue the USGA if any
of its drivers are rejected. As of the first round of testing,
which ended in January, no American-made clubs had failed the
``springlike'' test.
</P>
<P>
   The new clubs have been popular among golfers. Clocking ball
after ball onto the driving range at the Griffith Park Harding and
Wilson Golf Course in Los Angeles, Robert Heinz of Malibu, Calif.,
was using a new oversized titanium driving club with tungsten
plugged into the bottom of the club for extra weight. ``It just
hits a lot straighter,'' he said. His drives aren't longer, he
said, but are more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary Kahn, 27, a production assistant living in Los Angeles
who started playing golf when he was 11, said that he and his
fellow golfers were susceptible to marketing hype. ``The mentality
is, If it's new, it's better and I'd better buy that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn uses an oversized driver, but he said he would rather use a
driver made of persimmon wood, the kind used by greats like Sam
Snead and Babe Didrikson Zaharias, if he could find one. ``I like
the way a persimmon looks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is not clear that the equipment makes the golfer.
Byron Nelson, for whom Iron Byron was named, had what many consider
the single best year for any golfer when he shot an average of
68.33 strokes per round. The year was 1945.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morgan Brown, 28, a golfer from Dana Point, Calif., who competed
professionally for four years, recently switched to an oversized
titanium driving club, which has yet to win him over. ``I'm not
sold on the whole bigger-is-better deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Barber, a golf professional at the Griffith Park Harding
and Wilson Golf Club who has been playing for 35 years, said he did
not know what options the manufacturers had left for new drivers.
``They've basically exhausted all of the metals,'' he said. ``It'll
go back to smaller. You can see the pendulum swing back and
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King, too, has doubts about the technology. She recently
tried a couple of oversized titaniums but has settled for a smaller
graphite metal wood that she said gave her distance and consistent
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think we should have any more technology _
we're already outdoing the golf courses,'' she said. ``Well, I'm
not, but other people are.''

<P>
   While we were waiting for a man to land on the moon in the
1960s, the U.S. space program rewarded us with useful byproducts
like Teflon and Tang. Today, while many Americans wait for the
price of high-definition televisions to drop from the completely
absurd to the merely ridiculous, they have already reaped largely
unseen benefits from this new broadcast standard. Thanks to the
technology involved in HDTV, many classic motion pictures that have
been damaged over time may soon be restored to a nearly pristine
state.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to do this kind of restoration has long been sought
by filmmakers and film preservationists. Many films have simply
been lost, while the surviving copies of others have become deeply
damaged through repeated screenings and improper storage. Prints
for more than 50 percent of all movies no longer exist, said John
Galt, vice president for high-definition technology development at
Sony Pictures Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike visual arts of the past, such as prehistoric cave
drawings, motion pictures simply won't last for even 500 years,''
Galt said in an interview. The company's High Definition Center,
based in Los Angeles, has become a nexus for the development of new
techniques in film restoration. The methods all focus on
transforming a film into digital images, then using computers to
manipulate those images.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, it was nearly impossible to fix motion
picture film that had been scratched or stepped on or chewed up by
machinery. Fixing a sequence required physically touching up tens
of thousands of individual frames, a virtually impossible task. At
best, some scratches could be removed through the wetgate process,
in which a damaged film is immersed in fluid before light is passed
through it. The fluid helps fill in the gashes, which then do not
print through to the new copy.
</P>
<P>
   The development of high-definition videotape, which can
reproduce an image that is virtually as sharp as that possible with
motion picture film, gave film archivists the tools they needed to
do more than just get rid of scratches.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology allows them to virtually recreate missing
frames. Because high-definition videotape is digital, a motion
picture can be transferred onto it, and then those digital images
can be manipulated in the same way that home computer users can
alter their scanned photographs by placing a dog's head on a
brother-in-law's body. It just takes a lot longer when you are
trying to work on a 20-minute reel of a movie instead of one single
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures first tried this technique on Frank Capra's silent
classic ``The Matinee Idol.'' All copies of this 1928 Columbia
release were presumed lost, but in 1992, a film historian found a
copy in a canister in France, complete with French title cards and
missing and rearranged scenes. Grover Crisp, the vice president for
asset management and film restoration at Sony Pictures, heard about
the find and, thanks to a joint effort between Sony and the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, was able to get a copy sent to
Los Angeles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After the picture was transferred to high-definition video,
restoration artists eliminated scratches by ``painting'' damaged
areas with computer styluses. Crisp had new English-language title
cards created on high-definition videotape, and damaged frames were
restored by copying similar elements in surrounding frames on the
computer and pasting them into the areas that needed repair. The
process is similar to the way photomanipulation software like Adobe
Photoshop adds and subtracts picture elements by ``borrowing''
colors and textures from surrounding parts of an image.
</P>
<P>
   Using similar techniques, Crisp has just completed restoring
85,000 frames of a 1960s classic, ``Easy Rider,'' removing vertical
scratches that appeared throughout the entire 19{-minute running
time of two of the film's 10 reels. The reels were transferred to
high-definition videotape, and the vertical scratches were filled
in one at a time by a computer. A computer program analyzed each
frame for dirt marks; when the computer sensed that an area was
considerably darker or lighter than its surroundings, it assumed
that dirt was the reason and modified the density of the area so it
matched.
</P>
<P>
   But this automated process of dirt removal has some significant
flaws. For example, if the computer sees rain, it thinks ``dirt''
and removes it. So images that contain intentional light or dark
areas still need to be cleaned up by a person checking each frame
on the computer. And since color dyes fade at differing rates, it
is up to the individual restorer to bring tones back into balance.
</P>
<P>
   The goal in film restoration is not to create a new copy that
looks as if it had been shot last week, but to restore a print so
it looks as it did when it was first screened, complete with all
the washed-out or overly saturated colors that we might find
unusual today. It is like restoring an old painting; the esthetic
of the time when the work was created reigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be very careful,'' said Galt, of Sony Pictures.
``Restoring films is like peeling an onion _ you correct one gross
problem and you then find smaller ones. But the restorer's goal is
`to do no harm.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1863, nearly 15 years before Thomas Alva Edison
created the first phonograph, an inventor named Leon Scott is said
to have visited the White House. If historical anecdotes are
accurate, he made a tracing of President Lincoln's voice with his
newly invented ``phonautograph,'' a machine that scratched sound
patterns onto a soot-blackened sheet of paper wrapped around a
drum.
</P>
<P>
   The cylinder on which a paper record of Lincoln's voice was
apparently made has never been found. But there are two
phonautographs known to exist in the United States. One is at the
Smithsonian Institution. The other is in Brooklyn, at the home of
Allen Koenigsberg, an impassioned collector of antique phonographs,
sound recordings and other technological and cultural artifacts
from the last century.
</P>
<P>
   The lost tracing of Lincoln's voice is one of dozens of mild yet
nagging preoccupations for Koenigsberg, whose day job is teaching
classics at Brooklyn College.
</P>
<P>
   He has little interest in collecting more recent inventions,
although he is happy enough to use a computer and, of course, has a
Web site (members.aol.com/allenamet/PhonoBooks.html). It's not that
he has any objection to modern technology; it just does not capture
his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that I enjoy collecting old technology is
that it is so tactile,'' he said. ``I can see how it works. I can
repair an old phonograph from 1900, but if my CD-ROM goes down, I
haven't a clue how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does see a connection between the things he collects and
today's technomania. There is, he said, a close parallel between
the optimism surrounding technology that reigned at the close of
the 19th century and the celebration of computers, the Internet and
technology in general that is occurring at the end of this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development of the movies, sound recordings, the spread of
the telephone and electric lighting, the convenience of the
mimeograph, the improved typewriters, seemed to herald a century
without precedent,'' Koenigsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is some of the faded optimism that clings to old
objects that attracts him. He is looking for a lost recording by
Mark Twain, who dictated his 1892 novel ``The American Claimant''
onto Edison's early records, hollow cylinders of wax _ roughly the
size of a soup can _ that were used for both recording and playing.
</P>
<P>
   And he has searched for years for a water-powered phonograph,
manufactured briefly in 1890 by Edison, which played records by
circulating water through a turbine.
</P>
<P>
   Not that his collection is anything but enviable. In addition to
Scott's phonautograph, Koenigsberg, 56, owns one of Edison's first
phonographs, which recorded on tinfoil (he also has a piece of the
original foil from that machine); one of the first Edison talking
dolls; one of the first jukeboxes; an 1898 talking alarm clock (it
speaks in French); daguerreotypes of Lincoln, John Quincy Adams and
Dolly Madison; a lithograph of a woman listening to a stereo
telephone broadcasting service, a 19th-century variant of cable
television called the Theatrophone, as well as a recording of
Edison receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigsberg, who keeps his collection in what he admits is a
rather helter-skelter fashion in his house, said he had some 5,000
cylinder records, some of them extremely rare, including a Sarah
Bernhardt recitation; a presidential campaign debate from 1908; a
1912 Theodore Roosevelt stump speech to the Manhattan Boys
Progressive Club, and a speech by Edison himself, delivered at the
end of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``He normally didn't like to speak in public as his deafness
prevented him from hearing his own voice properly, and he knew that
he was not the polished speaker that people expected,'' Koenigsberg
said. ``But he made an exception for the end of that war.''
</P>
<P>
   What inspires awe from others both in and outside the collecting
world is Koenigsberg's scholarly approach to his hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the two or three most reliable people specializing
in the beginnings of the phonograph,'' said Samuel Brylawski, head
of the recorded sound section at the Library of Congress, to whom
Koenigsberg often turns during his sleuthing missions. ``He's
absolutely dogged in the pursuit of a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Koenigsberg an expert on Edison and his inventions
(he has published at his own expense a complete history of
phonograph patents) and a font of historical and cultural trivia,
but he also looks for the story behind every technical artifact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people with bigger, more important collections,''
said David Giovannoni, a fellow collector and an audience research
analyst in Derwood, Md. ``Allen is also an information collector,
which is where he absolutely shines.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the serial murderer. A few years ago, in a suitcase
containing 36 otherwise unremarkable, unlabeled cylinder records,
Koenigsberg found one with the unidentified voice of someone
admitting multiple murders.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigsberg heard this: ``I cannot help the fact that I was a
murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to a song.
I was born with the evil one standing beside the bed when I was
ushered into the world, and he has been with me ever since.'' The
killer voiced regret about only one of the 27 victims: his lover,
Minnie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Using that name as a clue, Koenigsberg dug through newspaper
archives and concluded that he was in possession of a recording
made of the most famous serial killer of the late 19th century _
H.H. Holmes, a doctor whose real name was Herman Webster Mudgett.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lincoln phonautograph session actually took place, and
the cylinder wasn't inadvertently tossed in the trash by a janitor,
Koenigsberg said, one of the most likely places for it to be would
be in the White House archives. ``The kind of paper that was used
on the drum goes under the name of kymograph,'' he said. ``So if
these tracings still existed in Washington, they might be filed
under such a word.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Koenigsberg wrote to the White House many years ago, he
said, ``I did not detect much interest in such a search.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, at the time Leon Scott invented his phonautograph, he
had devised a way only to make a visual record of a voice, but not
to reproduce the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's recording bristle _ from a pig or a bird _ scratched the
surface of the blackened paper to make a visual tracing of the
voice. ``He never anticipated that these tracings could be used to
reproduce the voice,'' Koenigsberg said. ``They were only used for
visual study.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Edison invented the phonograph in 1877 that
sounds could be played back. ``Until then, nobody had the insight
that if the stylus could cut a groove in wax or plaster or
gutta-percha, the needle would make sound,'' Koenigsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Davia Nelson, executive producer of ``Lost and Found Sound,'' a
current National Public Radio series, said she and her fellow
producer, Nikki Silva, had relied heavily on Koenigsberg's store of
knowledge about old and lost recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``On almost any question we have, he's the expert,'' Ms. Nelson
said. ``He's finding everything else, but he's the find.''
</P>
<P>
   Koenigsberg, whose somewhat rumpled appearance belies the
fastidiousness with which he pursues his hobby, first became
interested in collecting old technologies in the 1960s, while he
was a graduate student at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He decided against collecting maps, his first interest, because
the field was too crowded. So he began to look for a field that had
attracted less interest. He hit upon old phonographs and
recordings, which few people were collecting at the time. Since
then, he has collected some 80 antique phonographs.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigsberg is a regular speaker at a senior citizens' center in
Brooklyn, and he frequently takes in a few of the items he has
found. ``There is always a chorus of `I threw that out!''' he said.
``I tease them, saying that if they didn't throw these things out,
I wouldn't have found them.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing of an old phonograph for sale in a far-flung part
of the world, Koenigsberg will drop everything to go there and
check it out. Fortunately, he said, his wife, Judy, enjoys
traveling. They have driven to Toronto on a tip and to the Rainbow
Bridge on the Canadian border to buy a treadle phonograph from
someone who did not want to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   It was a blitz of a trip to Florida that brought Koenigsberg his
prized tinfoil phonograph, one of the first made. As soon as he
heard of the phonograph's existence, Koenigsberg rented a car and
drove straight to Clearwater to pick up the rare machine, along
with more than a dozen more commonplace antique phonographs from
the same collector. Then he drove straight home. Total travel time:
48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   No travel was required for the phonautograph, which had been in
a science museum warehouse in Mexico City, where it had been stored
for 50 years. It arrived in Brooklyn via United Parcel Service. He
painstakingly restored it, and when he was finished, his was more
complete than the Smithsonian's, which had a piece missing.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigsberg seldom sells pieces from his collection. When
museums ask for donations, he says no. ``I'm not ready for that
yet,'' he said. ``Eventually, sure, but I have a resonance with
them that I would miss. And they are part of my research
archives.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the technological optimism that ruled at the end of the
last century and now rules again, Koenigsberg's attention to the
past makes him a bit wary.
</P>
<P>
   After the discovery of the X-ray in 1895, Koenigsberg pointed
out, the new technology was heralded as a panacea for all ailments.
It was not until people became ill from overexposure that the
dangerous effects became clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the middle of it, it's very hard to tell where
the technology is really taking you,'' Koenigsberg said. ``We're
prisoners in our own time.''

   and many of its officials were sharply divided over entering the
conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Even as congressional leaders
dropped efforts to halt the airstrikes, many lawmakers were

bombing will succeed, lack of clear objectives, and uncertainty
about an exit strategy. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   JASPER-PORTRAIT _ About seven months after its unveiling at
Lamar University, a portrait commemorating Jasper dragging death
victim James Byrd Jr. will go on the auction block. ``We've got one
bid from an L.A. real estate man,'' said Ricky Jason, CEO of
Houston-based Colorblind Entertainment and co-owner of the

Galveston, who ordered a case filed by the Bolivian government
against U.S. tobacco companies sent to Washington, D.C. The suit
had been filed in a Brazoria County state court before it was

   LABOR _ Ohio Gov. Taft becomes the first Republican gov to
address the legislative conference of the AFL-CIO and uses the
opportunity to say he will not support proposed right to work
legislation, again distancing himself from conservative members of
his own party. Plus, Jo Ann Davidson said moves to dismantle
prevailing wage provisions on public projects likely won't go

   GAS-DEREG _ Competition for residential customers has gotten
most of the attention so far in Georgia's newly deregulated natural
gas market. But competiton forthe state's 100,000 business
customeers probably been the fiercest because they offer the most
profit potential.Most sought are dry cleaners and restaurants. One
marketer has hired a Korean -American dry cleaner to sell to the
300 cleaners operated by Korean-Americans in the metro area, a
highly sought group. Marketers also seek out businesses with
multiple locations, the larger the better like Home Depot.
According to a consultant who represents such businesses, savings
are running as high as 30 percent. (Quinn, Atlanta

   INTERNET-VIDEOPHONE _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The future of the Internet
is probably not in traditional computers; it will be in other

the market this summer, will allow one-button access to the
Internet from any desktop in your home or office. (Cummings, Dayton

E-MAIL PEN PAL SITES GIVE PRISONERS A LINK TO THE WORLD OUTSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Ohio, Ark., Mo., Calif., N.Y., Wash.)   (af)  
 By GEORGE ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using e-mail is not the easiest way to start a relationship.
Just ask Diane A., a psychotherapist from Colorado. In 1995, she
began exchanging letters with a man whom she met through a notice
posted on a Web site. Through their correspondence, the pair fell
in love and plan to marry next year. That is the earliest her
fiance is expected to be released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine meeting someone new and the first thing they want to
know about you is the worst thing you've ever done in your life,''
Diane said, recalling their first exchange of letters. Her fiance,
now in his late 30s, robbed a convenience store when he was 19 and
received a sentence of 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, he was involved in a knife fight that resulted in the
death of another prisoner. He spent six years on death row before
the Supreme Court overturned his conviction on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Diane, who asked that her last name not be used (``My parents
don't know that I've fallen in love with someone in prison,'' she
said), met her fiance through Penn-Pals (pennpals.org), one of a
half-dozen Web sites that connect inmates of state and federal
prisons with pen pals outside the gates.
</P>
<P>
   Because no prison system in the United States _ federal, state
or municipal _ allows inmates to receive e-mail directly, these Web
sites typically collect e-mail messages for prisoners, print them
out and mail them to the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   For the creators of prison pen-pal sites and their advocates,
the sites are a tool for breaking down the invisible walls of
loneliness that inevitably accompany incarceration. But critics
contend that these sites represent all the common fears of the
Internet writ large: that predatory criminals use these sites to
establish relationships and win the confidence of naive _ and some
not-so-naive _ online correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Penn-Pals, the site where Diane A. met her fiance, was started
in 1995 by Charles Sparks, at the time a manager at a Cleveland
robotics firm. A friend of Sparks who was in prison was looking for
a traditional pen pal. ``He requested I assist him in placing an ad
in a local supermarket tabloid,'' Sparks said. ``I realized the Net
would be far superior for his purpose in affording access to people
from around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   What began as a simple favor became a Web site in March 1996.
Sparks creates a personalized Web page for each inmate, using
information they provide by filling out a questionnaire, and a
photo where possible. Each prisoner is then given an e-mail address
for receiving messages, which Sparks collects and distributes.
</P>
<P>
   Most prisoners become aware of his service by word-of-mouth.
Sparks estimates that since he began the site, he has helped 1,350
inmates find pen pals.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said that he had never been in prison himself but that
while he was growing up, his father was imprisoned for six years.
``That left an impression on me,'' Sparks said. ``I try not to make
a big connection between that and the Web site, but it's something
that has never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks now works on Penn-Pals full time. ``I tried to price it
so that inmates could afford it, with a little sacrifice,'' he
said. ``It's $20 for the setup, the Web page and everything you get
with it, $5 more for a photo, for scanning it in. That's for the
first 30 days, then it's $5 a month thereafter. So $35 for 90 days
with a photograph.'' He fulfills about a quarter of the requests at
no charge. ``If you're in solitary, you're not working, you have no
income,'' Sparks said. ``Of course they're the ones who need human
contact the most.''
</P>
<P>
   The site provides a richly layered venue for prisoners and their
families to express their hopes, fears, anguish and regrets. Art
created by prisoners, much of it striking and passionate, adorns
the Web pages, and there are special areas for prisoners on death
row, parents of prisoners and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the inmates are looking for more than a
letter. ``Someone told me we ought to start a chapel here,'' Sparks
said with a laugh. ``We've been responsible for quite a few
marriages. Most recently, I got a letter from Steve Risinger _ he's
in prison in Arkansas, met a nice lady and they just got married.
He sent me a wedding picture.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace-Inmates, which is run out of rural Missouri, averages
more than 2,000 hits a week. Another site, Prison Pen Pals, logs
between 3,000 and 5,000 hits a week. Sparks' site registers 820
user sessions per day, with 3,550 total pages being viewed each
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most remarkable thing I've ever done in my life or
ever will,'' Sparks said. ``I can't imagine going back to a regular
job. I worked in robotics for seven years and didn't add anything
to society at large. This makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares his enthusiasm. The sites' creators receive
some criticism directly. ``I have had death threats via e-mail,
been told that I should be raped or have a child murdered,'' said
Priscilla Pletcher, who runs the Prison Pen Pals site. ``Sometimes
you wonder if the right people are in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Ida Ballasiotes, a Republican member of the Washington State
House of Representatives and co-chairwoman of its Criminal Justice
and Corrections Committee, recently called a committee hearing to
discuss the Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I don't want to see going on,'' Ballasiotes
said in an interview. ``I know some of the individuals who are on
these sites. I saw a guy who murdered his fourth wife and is being
investigated in the death of his second wife, and talks about
taking long walks in the moonlight. These are really manipulative
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cardoza, a Democratic state assemblyman from California,
has been also pushing for a review of the sites. ``A constituent of
mine was on the Net and he came across his daughter's killer on one
of these Web sites,'' Cardoza said. ``You can imagine the trauma
that caused him.''
</P>
<P>
   The only state that does not allow inmates to receive mail
generated through Sparks' site or any other third-party service is
New York. James B. Flateau, spokesman for the New York State
Department of Correctional Services, said that the state's right
has been upheld in numerous court cases. ``We do not allow mail
kiting, the sending of mail through third parties,'' he said. ``For
security reasons, we want to know who inmates are writing to and
getting mail from.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said that taking precautions at the start of the pen pal
process is the way to make these sites safe. He warns inmates not
to look for anything more than a pen pal through the site and he
screens the questionnaires the inmates fill out. ``And there have
been some I have refused. One guy was a pimp. Some people just have
their priorities screwed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Corcoran, vice president of the California Correction
Peace Officers Association, said that the sites should not be
regulated but that users should exercise caution. ``Pen pals can be
a valuable support for a prisoner,'' Corcoran said. ``I have found
that what works the best are religious outreach programs for
inmates. With an Internet site you have no idea what you're signing
up for. You have no knowledge of the individual, and you're
divulging personal information to them about yourself and your
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Diane, who writes to three other pen pals besides her
fiance, said that she was ambivalent about some of the inmates who
use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I write to tell me that 40 to 50 percent of the
people in prison, I should be glad they won't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own fiance, whom she met face to face for the first time
last summer, is scheduled to walk out of prison within the next 24
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was released from death row 14 months ago,'' Diane said.
``The most intense period in my entire life was the two months in
which we waited to see what the Supreme Court would say. After he
was released from death row, he said to me, `I'm really struggling
to cope with the idea that I have a life again. What am I going to
do with it?' ''

   LABOR _ Ohio Gov. Taft becomes the first Republican gov to
address the legislative conference of the AFL-CIO and uses the
opportunity to say he will not support proposed right to work
legislation, again distancing himself from conservative members of
his own party. Plus, Jo Ann Davidson said moves to dismantle
prevailing wage provisions on public projects likely won't go
anywhere, which could mean two of three GOP anti-labor proposals
could be in trouble despite labor's weakened position. Jeff
Jacobson is among those pushing to curb labor. (Hershey/Hills,

   GAS-DEREG _ Competition for residential customers has gotten
most of the attention so far in Georgia's newly deregulated natural
gas market. But competiton forthe state's 100,000 business
customeers probably been the fiercest because they offer the most
profit potential.Most sought are dry cleaners and restaurants. One
marketer has hired a Korean -American dry cleaner to sell to the
300 cleaners operated by Korean-Americans in the metro area, a
highly sought group. Marketers also seek out businesses with
multiple locations, the larger the better like Home Depot.
According to a consultant who represents such businesses, savings
are running as high as 30 percent. (Quinn, Atlanta

   INTERNET-VIDEOPHONE _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The future of the Internet

the market this summer, will allow one-button access to the
Internet from any desktop in your home or office. (Cummings, Dayton

year or two. That's where guys like Charlie Leibrandt, Pete Smith,
Kent Mercker, Steve Avery, Terrell Wade and Denny Neagle fit in.
Neagle is the latest to do his thing in Atlanta and move on . . .
to the Cincinnati Reds, who are patiently waiting to see him pitch
at full-bore against a full complement of major-league hitters as
he slowly builds arm strength from a weak shoulder. The question
that concerns the Reds should be: Is Neagle another Leibrandt,
Smith, Mercker, Avery or Wade? (McCoy, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

their rotation remains Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and
some strong-armed guys to fill out the back of the rotation for a
year or two. That's where guys like Charlie Leibrandt, Pete Smith,
Kent Mercker, Steve Avery, Terrell Wade and Denny Neagle fit in.
Neagle is the latest to do his thing in Atlanta and move on . . .
to the Cincinnati Reds, who are patiently waiting to see him pitch
at full-bore against a full complement of major-league hitters as
he slowly builds arm strength from a weak shoulder. The question
that concerns the Reds should be: Is Neagle another Leibrandt,
Smith, Mercker, Avery or Wade? (McCoy, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 (Attn: Mass., N.Y., N.J.)   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like everyone else these days, computers are getting in touch
with their feelings. Or at least learning to fake it.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated voices are starting to sound a bit more
human. Soon the classic robotic monotones of synthetic speech will
have tinges of the sad, the happy, the polite, the warm and even
the frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, of course, are eager for the era of the
empathetic computer voice. They need speech synthesizers that
sound, if not natural, at least personable enough to attract
customers to a range of new devices that talk, like systems that
can read e-mail to drivers as they barrel down the highway or can
read to the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that warmer voices will soon be available to
deliver, for instance, a solicitous ``Would you like me to read you
your messages?'' and even a sharp ``Wake up!'' if detectors find
that a driver is dozing off at the wheel. They will even be able to
read a poem by Robert Frost from a CD-ROM encyclopedia with a touch
of poignancy as well as clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not there yet, but we are getting closer,'' said Andre
Schenk, director of linguistic technology development at Lernout &AMP;
Hauspie in Ieper, Belgium. ``Computers themselves cannot understand
the text, of course, they cannot comprehend what they are saying,
but we can improve the quality of the voice. And we can mark the
text for them, saying this part should be spoken happily, this part
sadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lernout &AMP; Hauspie makes text-to-speech programs, systems that
take typed text and convert it into speech.
</P>
<P>
   The text-to-speech products with improved, more touchy-feely
voices, expected in about a year, are a result of decades of
research. To create such voices, companies had to identify the
subtleties in vocal stress that people associate with emotions like
anger, fear, joy and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in how emotion altered speech, and in writing
instructions for a voice synthesizer that included some of those
changes,'' said Dr. Janet Cahn, a researcher in the field of
emotion and computer-generated language who last month completed
her doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cahn has been experimenting with enlivening
computer-generated voices since the late 80s, when she did her
master's thesis on what she called ``expressive synthesized
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cahn wrote instructions for a voice synthesizer to read
sample sentences like ``I told you not to call me at the office,''
accounting first for the effect that stressing certain words has on
the meaning: ``I told you not to (italics)call(end italics) me at
the office,'' for example, and ``I told you not to call me at the
(italics)office.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Then she wrote program code that allows the voice synthesizer to
express emotion. ``When people are sad, research suggests they talk
more slowly, so to convey the emotion `sad,' I tried for a more
relaxed, almost slack voice,'' Dr. Cahn explained. She also
adjusted the articulation. ``Angry speakers tend to articulate very
precisely, but sad speakers have very imprecise, almost slurred,
articulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cahn varied the settings on the speech synthesizer,
adjusting the pitch range, putting in pauses and varying the speech
rate and voice quality for her sample sentences. Then she tried the
sentences out on MIT students and asked them to identify the
emotions portrayed. ``They got the emotions right about half the
time _ that's roughly what people can do with human speech in
tests,'' she said. Some of the sample sentences can be heard on her
Web page (Cahn.www.media.mit.edu/people/cahn/emot-speech.html).
</P>
<P>
   A later project, in which lines from an Abbott and Costello
routine or from ``Waiting for Godot'' are rendered with one of six
flavors of emotions _ impatient, plaintive, disdainful, distraught,
annoyed or cordial _ can be heard at the Computer Museum in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are seeking ways to expand the range of
computer-generated speech. ``Normal, sitting-at-the-desk speech is
not applicable to many practical purposes,'' said Professor Iain R.
Murray, a lecturer in applied computing at the University of Dundee
in Scotland. ``For instance, you might need a very spirited warning
if a missile is coming right toward you.'' Murray is playing with
the way voices sound when people are in what he called ``excited
states _ terrified, for instance, or drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even something in the future of speech generation for
fast-talking New Yorkers. At International Business Machines, Dr.
Salim Roukos, manager of conversational systems at the company's
Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., is
working with machines that carry on conversations with people who
want to do a specific task, like trading stock. One project will
take into account how fast people talk to the speech synthesizer
and respond accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people interact with computers mainly by pushing
buttons,'' Roukos said. ``We want them to just talk to the machine
as to a human, so we need a machine that will adapt to what's going
on in the conversation.'' He added: ``People who speak fast prefer
a machine that speaks fast. That's one of the reasons I'm designing
this stuff. I like faster machines, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how realistic are these computer voices going to become?
Dr. Joseph Olive, who has worked on text-to-speech conversion since
1970 at Bell Laboratories, now Lucent Technologies, in Murray Hill,
N.J., said the problems were difficult ones that would require much
more research. But the desire to solve them runs deep, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Olive wrote an opera scored for soprano and computer.
``I was working on speech synthesis and transformed some of the
work into singing,'' he explained. In his opera, a scientist
teaches a computer how to speak with feeling. The computer falls in
love with her, so the scientist, who cannot cope with that,
disassembles the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The main theme of the opera, Olive said, is the desire to have
computers not just speak but speak with feeling. ``But for right
now, though,'' he said, ``I have my hands full transmitting the
accurate meaning behind the message.''

ANNETTE BENING PLAYS HEDDA GABLER _ HAIR-TRIGGER HEROINE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She was the original angry chick with a gun.
Before Jackie Brown, before La Femme Nikita, even before Bonnie
Parker, there was Hedda Gabler.
</P>
<P>
   Whip-smart, self-destructive, trapped in a b-o-r-i-n-g marriage
and most probably pregnant, Hedda likes to keep her father's old
pistols close by. She's a walking powder keg, a proud, headstrong
woman threatening to blow the bourgeois propriety off a provincial
Norwegian town.
</P>
<P>
   A Victorian femme fatale? Or simply a 19th-century version of
the kind of middle-class mom you might find schlepping the kids to
soccer practice in Sherman Oaks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women, I think, have a bit of Hedda Gabler in them,''
says Annette Bening, who's playing the formidable title role in a
new production of Henrik Ibsen's 109-year-old classic opening
tonight at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us, in a way, can relate to her predicament, whether or
not you're happily married or happily have children _ which I am,''
Bening says. ``I can still understand the problems and the inherent
contradictions in the effort to take care of yourself as a human
being and also be this nurturing figure.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why the Geffen is letting Bening fulfill a
20-year ambition in playing Ibsen's disturbing, complicated
heroine. In a town where impeccable technique usually counts less
than flawless features, Bening, 40, is one of the few Hollywood
actresses with both a certified celebrity aura and a proven stage
record.
</P>
<P>
   She began her acting career with the prestigious American
Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and has played Shaw, Chekhov
and Shakespeare. Before Hollywood came knocking in the late 1980s,
she earned a Tony Award nomination and a Clarence Derwent Award for
Outstanding Debut Performance for her turn in Tina Howe's comedy of
love and longing, ``Coastal Disturbances''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, the Topeka, Kan., native was cast as the scheming
seductress the Marquise de Merteuil in Milos Forman's ``Valmont.''
It was the first of several roles, including her dark-hearted con
artist in ``The Grifters'' (1990), that stamped Bening with an
inevitable '90s epithet: She was the thinking person's vixen.
</P>
<P>
   With her subsequent marriage to Warren Beatty and entry into
motherhood (the couple have three young children), the mass media
instantly recast Bening as a ``post-feminist'' paragon,
successfully juggling home, hubby and career.
</P>
<P>
   But, speaking by cell phone as she chauffeurs her two eldest
children to school, Bening sounds pretty much like any pleasantly
harried working parent.
</P>
<P>
   Why does she think others feel the need to idealize her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do that to famous people,'' she replies. ``We all
do it _ I mean, I do the same thing _ to people who are well known:
We look to them as some sort of a guideline. And it's something
that, if you're in that position, you have to kind of be careful,
because we're all just struggling as much as everybody else, and
trying to get our lives to be satisfying to us, and to be
meaningful, and to balance all the different demands.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a genuineness in Bening's voice, a quality both empathic
and sharply focused. When te phone line twice goes dead during the
conversation, she calls back immediately. When it happens a third
time, near the end, she calls back once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I don't like not being able to say goodbye,'' she
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bening sits on the board of the Actors' Gang theater in
Hollywood, this will be her first major L.A. stage appearance. Its
genesis goes back several years, when Bening met Geffen producing
director Gil Cates at the Academy Awards and began discussing the
idea of doing a play, possibly Noel Coward's ``Fallen Angels.''
When that didn't work out, she proposed ``Hedda Gabler,'' and Cates
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get back on my feet,'' Bening says. ``I
wanted the machines to be out of the room, I didn't want any
cameras or microphones or semi-trucks. I just wanted to be able to
dive into a great piece of literature. That's the thing I'm so
excited about _ the day-to-day process of trying to understand the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Dan Sullivan, former head of the Seattle Repertory
Theatre, the Geffen production has been newly adapted by L.A.-born
playwright Jon Robin Baitz (``The Substance of Fire''), with Bening
specifically in mind. Baitz and Sullivan have worked together since
1989, smoothing the way for this collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make it (the translation) fresh and alive and
something that lands on our ears appropriately,'' Bening says. ``We
didn't want it to sound stilted or phony or arched or in any way
removed from hot-blooded talk. Actually, there are some good
translations, but they're either British, and they have a sort of
British vernacular to them, or they just sound kind of hokey. And
so it is so great, and I'm very impressed with (Baitz's) work on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hedda is clearly its catalyst, Ibsen's play is really
an ensemble piece in which the various characters' conflicting
agendas are observed with a cool, scientific eye. The Geffen cast
includes Byron Jennings as George Tesman, Rosemary Murphy as Aunt
Julie, Paul Guilfoyle as the scheming Judge Brack and Patrick
O'Connell as Eilert Lovberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great women's roles, and she (Hedda) is never
off the stage,'' says director Sullivan, ``but it is such a layered
subtext for everyone in the play that everyone's wants and desires
collide in the course of the evening. It's just not that one
person, even though it's that one person making it all happen. You
have to be as invested in everyone else's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan describes Bening as ``a creature of the theater,
extremely disciplined and hard working.''
</P>
<P>
   A prescient, socially conscious artist, Ibsen sometimes is held
up as a literary champion of progressive causes, including
feminism. The playwright himself, however, made no such claims,
preferring to identify women's rights with human rights in general.
</P>
<P>
   Bening agrees that it would be far too reductive to label
``Hedda'' a feminist tract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ibsen was, of course, this incredible, really, revolutionary
to explore a dilemma of a woman who didn't have all of the
qualities women really had to have in order to get along in society
then,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the idea of a woman who was not maternally oriented
is still, I think, an extremely hard thing for people _ for any of
us _ to witness, a woman who cannot relate or hasn't any instincts
about children. It's a very upsetting kind of an idea, because I
think we all need our mothers so desperately, so we idealize
motherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Hollywood, Bening has walked an intriguing
line between nurturing matriarchs (``In Dreams''), hard-bitten
molls (``Bugsy,'' ``The Grifters'') and many other types of women
in between.
</P>
<P>
   Although she never has seen a production of ``Hedda Gabler,''
she was greatly moved by Janet McTeer's fierce, eroticized
performance as Nora in the imported British version of Ibsen's ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's faced with making dramatic sense of a character one
critic described as ``the most hateful woman in dramatic
literature.'' It's a role sometimes called the female Hamlet, a
theatrical Anapurna that perhaps only Eva Le Gallienne, Maggie
Smith and a few others have successfully scaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I think all great characters have many, many
layers,'' Bening says, easing Hedda onto the analyst's couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is their own conscious layer of behavior, then there's
their subconscious layer, then there's their unconscious layer,
which is very important in this play because I think so much of
what is happening is coming out of that unconscious; it's coming
out spontaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Bening's voice races up a gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so terrified talking about it this way because I don't
know that I'm going to get all this!'' she says. ``So, this is all
just kind of intellectual talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But a moment later, a more assured Bening describes the task as
something ``one has to cope with as a creative person, if you want
to challenge yourself.'' It helps that her Hollywood friends have
been supportive, at a time when record numbers of movie and TV
stars (Kelsey Grammer, Danny Glover, Jenna Elfman) have been
appearing on L.A. stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very gratified by it,'' Bening says, ``just because I hope
that it kind of maybe will get other people to get involved in this
way as well, to take time to do this kind of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, part of the reason I haven't done plays is because of
my kids. I've got three little kids, and I just haven't been ready
to do a play. And now that I'm doing it, I understand why.''

 (ATTN: Alaska, N.Y., Pa. ,  Mass.)  (rk) 
 By   IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last July when a vicious storm descended on the unnamed mountain
peak that Michael Coyne was climbing in Alaska, he pulled out a
palm-size gadget with a tiny fan protruding from the top.
</P>
<P>
   As the air currents starting spinning the fan, a liquid crystal
display told him that the winds were gusting up to 72 mph. The
device then calculated that the wind chill was a numbing minus 21.1
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely helped me make some decisions,'' said Coyne, a
mountain climber and adventurer from Boston who decided that day to
fasten down his tents and wait out the storm. ``Sometimes the wind
is misleading. Without measurements, you don't realize that the
gusts of wind are as high as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The device Coyne carried, a Kestrel 2000, which sells for $119,
is one of a series of small, relatively inexpensive electronic
devices that are rapidly evolving into handheld personal weather
stations.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Kestrel's manufacturer, Nielsen-Kellerman of
Chester, Pa., will introduce a $159 model that, in addition to
measuring temperature and winds, as the current model does, will
also be able to measure relative humidity. That will enable it to
calculate the dew point as well as the heat index, warm weather's
version of the wind chill factor.
</P>
<P>
   And a competitor _ the Brunton Co., distributor of the Wind
Watch, made by its parent company, Silva _ is expanding its
electronic handheld wind measurer and thermometer to include a
barometer and an altimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Naughton, the Kestrel product manager at
Nielsen-Kellerman, said his company hoped the expanded features
would make the tiny weather stations attractive to the general
public. ``They are becoming a general consumer product for anybody
who's going to spend anytime outdoors,'' Naughton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kestrel wind meter technology developed, somewhat
improbably, from Nielsen-Kellerman's main line of business:
producing electronic devices for rowers. Among its offerings for
that market is a highly sensitive speedometer.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid forcing users to drill holes through their racing
shells to install the speedometer, the device uses a tiny fan with
a magnet at its center that spins on jeweled bearings like a
mechanical watch movement. That unit is fixed onto the outside of
the boat under the water line. On the inside, a separate sensor
detects the magnet's revolutions to calculate speed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of Kestrel's customers have been sailors and
``anybody connected to anything that involves flying or falling
through the sky,'' Naughton said. The company is trying to sell
parents on the idea that they need to check the wind chill or heat
index levels before sending their children outside.
</P>
<P>
   That information, of course, can already be obtained by flicking
on the Weather Channel. But Naughton argued that you would not get
accurate information there or on the Web unless you lived very
close to an airport, the usual place for monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least one group of concerned urbanites has turned to
the weather device. Last year, the organizers of the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day parade used it to track wind speed ahead of the
inflatable floats. ll

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ The 800 people who are attending the PC
Forum 99 conference here, an annual gathering of some of the
world's technological elite, are the people who envision, finance
and make the products and services used by the ``early adopters,''
people who buy new technologies for technology's sake.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these executives, time is as precious as water is to
the creatures in the vast desert that surrounds this resort area,
so they have no patience for technologies that do not work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, are their favorite gizmos and gadgets?
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are ubiquitous. During conference breaks, dozens of
people dash to the courtyards and stand in the sun, like so many
cacti in designer sunglasses, with upraised arms holding tiny
wireless phones to their ears.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Pilot screens glint in the light, and inside, clusters of
people huddle around laptop computers that are connected to the
Internet over wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Quinlan, vice chairman of the MacManus Group, the New
York advertising concern, said she carries two cell phones ``in
case one goes down.'' Mitchell Kertzman, president of Network
Computer of Redwood Shores, Calif., carries a pager, a Palm Pilot
personal digital assistant, and a miniature Motorola digital phone,
all of which he stuffs into his pockets and hopes are
inconspicuous. He adds that he expects to go catatonic if ever they
all start vibrating and buzzing simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   David Nagle, chief technology officer for AT&AMP;T and a former
Apple Computer executive, also has a cell phone (AT&AMP;T, of course)
in his pocket. ``I just bought a Palm V,'' he said, referring to a
slim, shirt-pocket computer made by the 3Com Corp.'s Palm Computing
division.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle said he is annoyed that he has to regularly synchronize
the information in his Palm V with the information in his desktop
computer, over a direct connection, instead of simply synchronizing
all his information with all of his devices over a network.
</P>
<P>
   Will we ever see a pocket-size, network-centric, wireless,
AT&AMP;T-branded gizmo like that? ``Well, no announcements, but I think
it's a good idea,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Lonier, chairman of Working Solo, a consulting company for
free-lancers and other self-employed people in New Paltz, N.Y.,
lovingly displayed her sea-foam green Nokia 6160 cell phone, a
nearly constant companion. ``To me, one of the interesting things
about this conference is that a year ago everyone was on Motorola
Star-tacs, and this year almost everybody is on Nokias,'' she said.
``It's the shift from analogue to digital, and the introduction of
AT&AMP;T's One Rate plan.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sculley, former chief executive of Apple Computer and now a
private investor in New York City, corroborated Ms. Lonier's phone
observation by whipping out his Nokia 6120. ``I notice everyone has
switched over to this model,'' said Sculley, who recently became
chairman of a start-up company called Zapa Digital Arts. He
explained that the multi-modal Nokia can move seamlessly from
analogue to digital and from the United States to Europe, something
most cell phones cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley, the father of the Apple Newton, conceded that he now
carries a Palm Pilot. ``And then I carry a notebook computer. I
have several of them, but the one I usually carry around is a Sharp
Actius, because it's only 2.8 pounds. It's got almost a full
keyboard, high-resolution display, and its got everything I need
for e-mail and web access built in.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Griffiths is president of the software developer
Perspectives Unlimited, a virtual corporation with offices in
Delaware, California, Virginia and New York. ``One thing that I
definitely can't give up is my videocam,'' she said, referring to a
videoconferencing system her company assembled using Dell and IBM
computers, Intel digital cameras and Microsoft's Netmeeting
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me to be able to take an idea and run with
it independent of geography or time zones or boundaries created by
walls. I can basically plug into any telephone line so that we have
real-time video conferencing, even if I'm sitting in an airport or
a hotel room.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com in Seattle, reached
for a wallet-sized device on his belt. ``My newest gadget is the
Motorola Pagewriter 2000,'' he said, referring to a wireless device
known as a smart pager. ``It's nicely designed so that you can flip
it open and read your e-mail messages without taking it off your
belt. They've really thought it through well. You can send e-mail
and receive e-mail, and it is not as interruptive as a cell
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, some technology executives are most
enamored with devices that are still on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, chairman and president of Broadcast.com of Dallas,
and some friends rigged his home PC to receive HDTV broadcasts. It
is his favorite technical toy right now. ``But what I want,'' he
said, ``is mobile wireless access to my PC in my car. That's like
my nirvana right now. You always become untethered somewhere along
the line and I hate that, hate it, hate it, hate it. To be able to
sit by the pool, or jump in my car and stay tethered, that's the
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   How long does he think it will be before he reaches nirvana?
``Two years, three years max,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How about stuff available right now? ``My Sony Vaio 505,'; Cuban
said, referring to his thin, light laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Raymond, president of Open Source Initiative of Malvern,
Pa., does not carry any devices. ``I am certainly not resistant to
technology,'' he said. ``I've been a happy Internet user since the
1970s. But at the moment I find that I don't have a Palm Pilot, I
don't have a cell phone. Each of these devices has a little too
much cost and complexity associated with it, relative to its
function for me. I don't want to carry 20 different devices that
each do one thing; I want to carry one device that does it all, and
we're not there yet. Maybe it's my unwillingness to look like a
character from a William Gibson novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Has that been a hindrance in the high-tech circles in which he
travels? ``No, but then, I have a good memory,'' he said, tapping
his head. ``I have the equivalent of a Palm Pilot installed
neurally.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, whose company Edventure Holdings is host for the
annual technology conference here, does not have a telephone in her
New York apartment. ``Look,'' she said, patting her pockets. ``I've
got nothing on me, no buzzer, no cell phone, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   People who spend all their time thinking about technology have
the power to choose whether or not to use it, she noted. To Ms.
Dyson, the ideas that flow to her via the technology, whether they
come as electronic mail or an exciting new software application,
are far more interesting than the hardware.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``I carry my Sony Vaio with me wherever I go,
pretty much,'' Ms. Dyson said. ``I don't like the gizmos, but I
love my PC.''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO gave unusual written assurances on
Wednesday to five countries neighboring Serbia that the alliance
would consider any military strikes against them by Belgrade
``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said they had given the assurances after
Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Slovenia and Romania expressed
concern about threats to their safety once NATO warplanes began
bombing Yugoslavia for its refusal to accept a peace settlement in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hungary, which also borders Yugoslavia, had continued to
raise concerns although it formally became a member of the alliance
last week, one diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The membership of Hungary means that the allies are bound by
treaty to consider an armed Serbian attack against it as an attack
against them all, and react accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official said Secretary-General Javier Solana wrote to
the other five countries on Wednesday that the allies would also
view any Serbian attack against them ``with the utmost
seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Solana wrote to the leader of Macedonia, where
10,000 allied soldiers are gathered as the advance guard of a
possible international peacekeeping force for Kosovo, that the
alliance would meet any Serbian attack on those forces with ``an
appropriate response.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Solana's letters had gone out before Yugoslavia
warned Romania, Albania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Macedonia on Tuesday
night not to support NATO bombing raids or the ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Romania's foreign ministry said Romanian and
other diplomats from countries neighboring Yugoslavia were summoned
into the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry in Belgrade on Tuesday night.
Belgrade told the diplomats that it ``expected neighbors to refrain
from taking any direct or indirect part in any action against
Yugoslavia,'' according to Simona Miculescu, the Romanian
spokeswoman, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Belgrade have previously warned both Albania
and Macedonia not to support hostile operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country won't allow its territory to be used in an attack
on any neighboring country, including Yugoslavia, and I think NATO
will accept this,'' Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have given formal assurances that peacekeepers would
go into Kosovo only if the Serbian authorities under Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agree to accept them. Negotiators for
the rebels signed an accord in Paris last week providing for
political autonomy for the province and 28,000 peacekeepers to
enforce it, but Milosevic refused, telling the U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke in Belgrade Tuesday that the peacekeepers would
be one-sided and anti-Serb.
</P>
<P>
   The two million people of Kosovo, which the accord would leave
under Serbian sovereignty for a three-year transition period, are
90 percent of ethnic Albanian origin. Serbia and Montenegro are the
constituent parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia headed by
Milosevic, who abolished political autonomy for Kosovo when he was
president of Serbia 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The five countries Solana wrote to on Wednesday are among the 24
members of the alliance's Partnership for Peace program,
established after the end of the Cold War to promote stability in
relations between Western nations and formerly Communist nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance has repeatedly made clear that the security of
all NATO member states is inseparably linked to that of the partner
countries,'' Solana wrote. ``Your security is of a direct and
material concern to the alliance.''

ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENSES TOP NATO'S TARGET LIST IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The likely targets of NATO war planes and missiles
attacking Yugoslavia include naval docks and ships along the
Adriatic coast as well as military bases, ammunition dumps and
supply centers across the country, military experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO forces first must destroy Yugoslavia's air defense
network, a protective shield of surface-to-air missiles, early
warning radars and electronics that pose a danger to allied pilots.
The first phase of the military operation that began Wednesday was
focused mainly on this task.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon, the Yugoslavs operate some 100
surface to-air-missile batteries, including mobile SA-6 missiles,
and less mobile SA-3s; about 2,000 mobile air defense guns along
with shoulder-fired missiles similar to the Stinger missiles in the
U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy Adm. Leighton Smith, who directed NATO attacks
against Bosnian Serb forces in 1995, said that once the air
defenses are eliminated, all Yugoslavian military facilities would
be fair game, not just those in the embattled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were calling the shots, I'd go after military
capabilities in Serbia (the dominant Yugoslavian province) and I'd
take out the biggest targets and then work down from there,'' said
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He indicated that high on his target list would be airport
runways and command and communications centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect NATO to go after military facilities, motor
pools, and supply bases,'' Smith said, adding, ``I would take out
all of their ammunition and transportation capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, declining to discuss specific
targets, said Wednesday that the target list is ``extensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO attacks began after Yugoslav military forces failed to
call off their crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, where Yugoslavian forces are battling the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA), there are about 40,000 Yugoslavian troops
operating 400 tanks, several hundred armored personnel carriers and
several hundred artillery pieces, said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   While these are also likely targets, Smith said that attacking
them would pose a challenge to NATO pilots because of the
difficulty of distinguishing between troop concentrations and
facilities under control of the Yugoslav government and those
controlled by the KLA forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant problem,'' Smith said. ``If you go after
forces in Kosovo, you have some difficulty in identifying what is
the right thing to hit because there is nobody on the ground to
identify who is friend and who is foe.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he encountered a similar predicament in 1995 when
NATO attacked Bosnian Serb targets in order to pressure the warring
parties to sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Naval Institute, much of Yugoslavia's
military capability is spread across some 15 major military bases,
most of which are not in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Janes Information Group, a leading British publisher on foreign
militaries, said that among the top targets of NATO pilots are
Yugoslavia's main early warning and coastal missile defense center
at Mount Rumija in the province of Montenegro on the Adriatic
coast; the main air surveillance site at Kopanik in southwestern
Serbia, and the Podgorica airbase near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's also identifies as likely targets the naval base at Tivet
on the Adriatic, a tank base at Krusevac in central Serbia, and air
bases at Ladjevci in central Serbia, Ponikve in western Serbia, and
Slatina near the Kosovan capital of Pristina.

FOR SERIOUS LINCOLN SCHOLARS, CHANCES FOR NEW DISCOVERIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill. , Utah, Neb., Conn.)  (Eds: Herbert Mitgang is the author of ``Abraham Lincoln: A Press
Portrait'' and the play ``Mister Lincoln.'') 
 (nk) 
 By HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is reassuring to know, 190 years after Lincoln's birth in
1809, that in 2000 and beyond, new studies will continue to seek
clues to the 16th president's life and language _ electronically.
Even though the shelves hold more books about Lincoln than about
any other president, modern technology will soon enable historians
to scour his ideas and actions even more closely than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University Press brought out the Abraham Lincoln
Association's eight volumes of ``The Collected Works of Abraham
Lincoln'' nearly a half-century ago. Though somewhat outdated, they
have been the standard reference tool in the nonstop field of
Lincolniana.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Web site is being developed that will offer the complete
multivolume ``Works'' _ all 2,048,683 printed words. Lincoln
scholars hope to unearth nuggets that will help to interpret his
rise from near obscurity to the White House, his brilliance as a
wordsmith and his momentous decisions during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site will be a building block to create an electronic
archive, said Thomas F. Schwartz, Illinois' state historian. ``It's
the beginning of what will become a virtual Lincoln library _ the
first of its kind for any American president.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Schwartz's editorial guidance, the searchable database for
Works was produced by a search-engine company called Word Cruncher
Internet Technologies, in Alpine, Utah. The database, which is near
completion, will be available at the association's Web site
(www.alincolnassoc.com).
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Schwartz forwarded a test copy of the Lincoln
database on a disk and suggested that I give it a try. (Just in
case of a nervous breakdown _ the computer's or mine _ I kept a
well-worn printed edition of the eight volumes close at hand.)
After installing the program, just for fun, I called up two words
that have been big in the contemporary vocabulary _ impeachment and
censure _ to see if Lincoln ever used them.
</P>
<P>
   In a wink, the answer appeared on the screen. The word
``impeach'' came up only twice, while the word ``censure'' was
found 14 times. Was there a subliminal message here? It was amusing
to think so, but of course, the Lincoln database referred neither
to a presidential impeachment nor to a censure, in the recent
senses of the words.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on July 14, 1863, 10 days after Gen. Robert E.
Lee's defeated army at Gettysburg turned tail and escaped
southward, an unhappy Lincoln had to calm down Gen. George Meade,
who failed to pursue the Confederate Army, by damning him with
faint praise in a letter that began: ``I have just seen your
despatch to Gen. Henry Halleck, asking to be relieved of your
command, because of a supposed censure of mine. I am sorry now to
be the author of the slightest pain to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Lincoln scholars have already found the database to be
useful.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to cross-reference words and phrases more handily
without having to depend on the incomplete index to the printed
volumes. Take the words ``union'' and ``nation.'' Professor James
Rawley of the University of Nebraska found that Lincoln tended to
drop the word union during his presidency and increasingly began to
call the United States a nation.
</P>
<P>
   There are already a few surprises that will demand fresh
interpretation by scholars. In 1858, the year he debated Stephen A.
Douglas, Lincoln frequently referred to the Declaration of
Independence, but in the final years of his life in the White
House, he avoided mentioning the document, which declared that
``all men are created equal.''
</P>
<P>
   An effort is also being made to trace Lincoln's stylistic
fingerprints. Which words did he write himself and which were first
drafted by one of his secretaries? In the famous letter of sympathy
to Mrs. Bixby on the death of her sons in battle (quoted in the
film ``Saving Private Ryan''), the word ``beguile'' appears.
Professor Michael Burlingame of Connecticut College said that
beguile had not been part of Lincoln's vocabulary and attributed it
to John Hay, a Lincoln secretary who often used the word in his own
writing. In the same letter the words ``our heavenly father'' turn
up _ again, not a phrase in the Lincoln lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   Will the new electronic research really change our knowledge
about the character and achievements of Lincoln or any other
president? It is too early to tell. With the printed word, the
slower process of turning the pages can sometimes lead a researcher
to lucky discoveries. My guess is that the books and the database
are destined to supplement rather than replace each other. After
fact-finding, educated analysis will still be necessary. A database
is a research tool, not a thinking cap.
</P>
<P>
   But Lincoln, a sometime inventor and a lecturer on the power of
books and the print media, might well have cheered the idea of
reaching a wider audience with his words _ in any form.

BLUE SCREEN: NOT `DEATH,' BUT ANNOYING 
</HEADLINE>

 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is a ``blue screen of death'' error?
</P>
<P>
   A. This error with the ominous nickname, when the computer just
stops and reverts to a blue screen, can happen in Windows 95, 98
and NT. It is usually called a fatal exception error in Windows 95
and 98, according to the error message displayed at the time of the
crash, but the higher-end Windows NT systems call it a Stop error.
</P>
<P>
   Many things can cause the error, like older device drivers on
your machine that are conflicting with the rest of the system.
Conflicts between two pieces of hardware and problems like bad RAM
chips on your motherboard can also cause fatal exception errors.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get the blue screen and the error message, you cannot
really do much other than restart or shut down the computer.
Utility programs like Norton Crash Guard offer to help you prevent
and recover from blue-screen crashes.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, you might go to Microsoft's Support Online
area and read article Q136337
(support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q136/3/37.asp). It gives
several tips for dealing with start-up errors and driver problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ My dear aunt Mildred, a 98-year-old Roman Catholic nun
who lives in a convent, stopped me at a recent family gathering to
broach the topic of the newfangled ways of modern society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you use the Internet?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Aunt Mildred,'' I confessed, ``I'm not quite up to speed
with that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she replied, thrusting a card into my palm, ``when you
get up to speed, here's my e-mail address.''
</P>
<P>
   It is getting to be embarrassing to be off line.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen times a day, people ask for my e-mail address. And
I have to tell them: I don't know how to e-mail. After more than a
decade of paying off college loans, I now discover at the age of 40
that I am illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, half of American households still do not have
computers. Not everyone is sitting around surfing the Net, visiting
Web sites and zipping off clever notes to their e-mail pals.
</P>
<P>
   It just seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when it was perfectly acceptable, even a bit
stylish or edgy, to be a Luddite. People thought you were an
Individual, or at least eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're just a dud, the technological equivalent of a
cigarette smoker or a mink wearer.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how society is losing patience with
techno-laggards, observe the nastiness that is creeping into the
computerized voices on telephone menus.
</P>
<P>
   The old message: ``If you are not calling from a touch-tone
telephone, please stay on the line, and an operator will be with
you shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   The new message: ``If you are not calling from a touch-tone
telephone, hang up and call back from a touch-tone telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Get with the program, Buster.
</P>
<P>
   Inter-nots, as we might be called, have become social misfits.
With e-mail, even far-flung co-workers can essentially shout across
the room to one another, sharing office gossip and trading work
tips.
</P>
<P>
   People who are out of the loop, like me, are just out of luck. I
know they're talking to one another. Worse yet, maybe they're
talking about me.
</P>
<P>
   There is a whiff of superiority about all of this, a
country-clubby we're-in-and-you're-not superiority.
</P>
<P>
   The smugness is well founded. Is there a realm of life that is
not made quicker or easier for those with a computer? Heaven help
the poor suitor who is unable to conduct a courtship without being
able to tap out sweet, unpunctuated E-nothings all day.
</P>
<P>
   For the E-less, there is no refuge. Scarcely a television
commercial flits by anymore without a Web address flashing across
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   And when people make small talk, the Internet seems to rank
somewhere on the interest scale between sex and money. (Listening
idly to all of this chit-chat must be what life is like for people
who do not follow sports.) Macho talk these days turns to souped-up
computers and high-powered components. It all gets so torqued it
sounds like gear-heads at the drag strip.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, of course, stocks with any remote connection to the
Internet are making zillionaires of people in the cyberknow. And
who bought these stocks at a pittance and sold them for bundles?
Not guys like me.
</P>
<P>
   So not only are computer people smarter, but now they're also
richer.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen? Weren't the computer guys supposed to be
the nerds, the geeks?
</P>
<P>
   I have always been in the bottom half of the technology class.
That is partly how I ended up in journalism. I was told there would
be no math.
</P>
<P>
   When I started working in this business in 1979, I used a manual
typewriter. Grudgingly, I moved to an electric typewriter, and then
to a word processor, when employment required it.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, I have used a portable Zenith 286. In the
broadest sense, this is defined as a computer. In my hands,
however, it is just a glorified typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   My machine is slightly smaller than a window air conditioner.
They no longer make computer cases large enough to fit it. I carry
it around in a big nylon gym bag with socks and underwear for
cushioning.
</P>
<P>
   People titter at my machine and brag about how small their
computers are. I don't understand this. What's wrong with a little
heft? Working with itsy-bitsy things makes me want to pick up a
brick and hurl it through a window. I like a machine that has taken
a few hard knocks, like its owner.
</P>
<P>
   My computer went on the blink recently. It was frightening. I
feared I might lose my old, old friend.
</P>
<P>
   I took it to a computer store and laid it on a table. The
computer technician touched it gently, as if it were a museum
piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix it, then?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing?'' he responded incredulously. ``I wouldn't have a
clue.''
</P>
<P>
   He told me about an old Israeli fellow in the next town, Abe,
who ran a satellite dish store and was said to be able to tinker
with all sorts of oddball devices.
</P>
<P>
   I took it to Abe and he fixed it.
</P>
<P>
   So my trusted old jalopy of a writing machine is still in
business. Change is not good. That has always been my motto.
</P>
<P>
   Distrust of fads has generally served me well. It saved me from
leisure suits and raw fish and microbrews, not to mention the
macarena.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, trying to live life on the cutting edge can
get dull. Chase trends long enough and you run out of gas, like the
aging yuppies. Or you take up cigars. Now that's hip.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I figured this information superhighway, as they
used to call it, was going to be. Just a flash in the pan. So I
stepped aside and waited for it to pass me by.
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I admit, I have been thinking about learning to use one
of the new computers. My aging 286 can't be expected to last
forever. And neither can Abe.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows. I might even learn about the Internet and start
sending messages on this newfangled e-mail thing.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to keep up with Aunt Mildred. &QL;

<P>
   In an advance that will allow people to program their VCRs while
also speeding down the freeway _ not that this is necessarily a
good thing _ a German company has come up with a way to turn
telephones into remote controls for household appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Siemens, calls the technology Residential Gateway.
It allows mobile or stationary phones to program a VCR, control the
home thermostat and turn on the power for coffee makers and other
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateway consists of the remote, called the Euroset 845
(which doubles as a telephone), and a receiver box that sits in the
home. Users enter commands into the Euroset, which sends radio
signals to the black box, which directs the signals to various
appliances. In the case of a coffee maker that you want turned on
or an iron you forgot to unplug, the device sends the appropriate
signal to the appropriate wall socket.
</P>
<P>
   With the mobile phone, users dial into the Euroset from just
about anywhere, punch in the commands and then have them sent to
the VCR or home alarm system.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether this will solve one of the world's
great challenges: people's ability to program the clock on the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   New Computer for $299? Well, Most of One
</P>
<P>
   Will computers join the likes of gum, batteries and magazines as
impulse buys in the checkout aisle? That's not implausible, given
the phenomenon loosely known as the Incredibly Falling Price of
PCs. The latest sign of that trend is a $299 computer from a
Seattle company called Microworkz Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the word's been getting out, the company's Web site and
phone line have been bursting at the seams with traffic, said Rick
Latman, the company's chief executive. Not one lacking in
confidence, he projects that Microworkz will produce 200,000
computers a month starting in April. ``How is Michael Dell going to
compete with us?'' Latman said. ``He'd better concentrate on
servers. We're going to take the low end.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts are not that ready to crown Microworkz. The
$299 computer comes with a Cyrix 300-megahertz processor, a
3.2-gigabyte hard drive, 16 megabytes of memory and a year of
Internet access. But calling it even a bare-bones machine is a
stretch, as it is missing a few big bones: a monitor, floppy drive
and a CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really just an Internet appliance,'' said David Stremba,
an analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif.
``To create a full-fledged system, it'll push it into $500.''
</P>
<P>
   Online Delivery Service Wants to Be a `Food Portal'
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cybermeals.com, the site that lets users order food
for delivery from thousands of restaurants across the country, was
reborn as Food.com. Robert Frank, the entrepreneur behind the
original site, hopes that food lovers will have even less reason to
leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the original site came from seeing Sandra
Bullock order a slice of pizza over the Internet in the movie ``The
Net.'' Among Frank's ambitions is to turn Food.com into a ``Food
portal'' (forgive him, it had to happen). He plans a potpourri of
culinary-related content, like stories about ``superchefs'' and
more recipes than you can shake a mouse (or is that mousse?) at.
Can the bonbon chat room be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   The site has already created a hunger among one group:
investors. Food.com said it had just secured $25 million in
capital, which means that some private investors are banking very
heavily that the modem is the maitre d' of the future. There's
already been one beneficiary: the man in Northern California who
sold the company its new domain name. That earned him enough, Frank
said, to ``put his daughter through college.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Coupons
</P>
<P>
   The use of coupons delivered via the Web is starting to take
off, according to a study by the NPD Group, a marketing research
company based in Port Washington, N.Y. The survey, which was based
on a questionnaire answered by 2,673 individuals who are online,
found that nearly a third of them get Web coupons for shopping in
an average month.
</P>
<P>
   While that is still a mere 3 percent of the total coupon use by
those households, NPD found that more people were planning to use
online coupons more often and in increased quantity. Of the 49
percent of respondents who were aware of online coupons, 87 percent
said they planned to use some or more online coupons in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Online coupons are often quite similar to the standard ones
found in newspapers and fliers. Shoppers go to the Web, print them
out and present them at the checkout register just as they would
with traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Smith, vice president of NPD Online, said people used Web
coupons in the ``same general pattern'' as regular coupons, mostly
for groceries. Online coupon users tend to be between the ages of
25 and 44, and a third of the online coupon redeemers have
household incomes over $75,000. The most popular coupon sites found
by the survey were Coolsavings.com and Valuepage.com.

   E-Mail Device Scaled Down for Children
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that pagers and cellular phones ring during the
opera. Now they might go off during nap time. Playmates Toys has
just released a just-for-children pager that is called Friend.link.
The $20 keychain toy can send e-mail-style messages via radio waves
to other Friends.links within 25 feet. The messages are entered
with a small data wheel and can be up to 48 characters long.
Children can also enter personal information like their sex, age
and hobbies. When that device comes within range of another unit
programmed with similar interests, the pagers will ring, alerting
the owners, much like last year's Japanese toy matchmaker, the Love
Getty.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting feature of the Friend.link allows the recipient
list to be customized. Users can choose to send a message to a
single friend, to all the Friend.links in the vicinity, or to only
boys or girls. The last choice could be an example of retrograde
sexual stereotyping or enlightened difference feminism, depending
on your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that at the target age, 8 through 13, people tend to
polarize into groups based on gender,'' said Tom McClure, director
of marketing for Playmates Toys. ``The girls talk about the boys,
and the boys talk about the girls.'' Now the playground battle of
the sexes can be waged electronically.

   Always In Touch
</P>
<P>
   A new program for the ICQ instant message system means users can
run, but they cannot hide. The Signaler, from the Israeli company
NECS, works by sending something like an electronic knock on the
door to a designated computer's modem. Even if the recipient is not
online, a window will open on the screen, signaling that someone is
trying to get in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Only users who download the Signaler software, available at
www.signaler.com, can send and receive the signals. Users can
choose a do-not-disturb mode when they would rather not be
bothered. NECS is offering the service free for a 21-day trial.
After that, users must pay $9.95 per month. The company is
developing the software for use with other programs, like Yahoo
Pager and AOL Instant Messenger.

   Plugged-in Gardeners
</P>
<P>
   Which of the following doesn't belong: a mouse, a modem and a
gardening hoe? It's a trick question: According to a new survey of
Internet users, they all belong.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings of the survey, compiled by Nielsen Media
Research, is that there is an unusually large overlap between the
people who use the Internet and the people who watch Home and
Garden TV. The survey found that men who use the Internet named
these as their top five commonly watched networks: Comedy Central,
Home and Garden, Fox News, MSNBC and MTV. Women in the same
category watched MTV, Home and Garden, CNN Headline News, the Movie
Channel and Comedy Central.

COURT QUESTIONS MEDIA INVOLVEMENT IN POLICE RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court questioned Wednesday whether
reporters and photographers who accompany police officers on
searches of homes trample on privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the help (to law enforcement) provided here? It is not
merely for entertainment?'' Justice David H. Souter asked during a
lively session on a pair of cases from Maryland and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The debate raised not only questions about whether journalists
can accompany the police on raids and searches, but also how far
live-action television shows, such as the Fox network's ``Cops,''
can go in bringing to the public images of officers arresting and
searching suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why you have to take the news media people into
someone's home ... it sounds like fluff,'' Souter said later.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Cordray, a Grove City, Ohio-lawyer representing
federal agents who allowed a newspaper reporter and photographer to
accompany them during a search of a private residence, argued that
the news media ``ride-alongs'' have been common for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a law forbidding police from taking
reporters with them,'' he told the court.
</P>
<P>
   His argument drew a quick retort from Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, who asked, ``Ride right into the house?''
</P>
<P>
   In the two cases, the high court must decide whether police
officers who take along reporters, photographers and camera people
to observe and film the execution of a warrant in a private
residence violate the Fourth Amendment guarantee against
unreasonable searches and whether those officers can be sued by the
private citizens involved.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules media ride-alongs are unconstitutional,
reporters and camera people will be limited to filming and
observing only those arrests and searches that occur in public
places.
</P>
<P>
   In his arguments before the court, Cordray told the justices
that media coverage was essential to ensuring accurate reporting
and raising public knowledge of police procedures.
</P>
<P>
   He also said reporters protect the rights of the individual who
is being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any mistake made by the police will be caught on camera for
the world to see,'' Cordray said.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington lawyer Richard Willard, who represented a
Maryland couple photographed by the Washington Post in their night
clothes as sheriff's deputies and deputy U.S. marshals
unsuccessfully searched for their fugitive son, said the media
coverage was an ``obvious'' invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only authority police have is to enter the home, (not)
bring along the media on a news-gathering expedition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willard's arguments were echoed by Los Angeles lawyer Henry
Rossbacher, representing a Montana couple whose ranch was raided by
federal agents accompanied by a Cable News Network camera crew. He
urged the court to penalize the law enforcement officers ``who came
to search for poison (and) brought along the press to search for TV
footage.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the extended session, most of the justices appeared
to side with Willard and Rossbacher. Along with Souter and
O'Connor, Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen G. Breyer and Antonin Scalia critically questioned the
policy of reporters accompanying the police on searches and
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia asked Cordray, ``Why don't you just ask the person,
`Would you mind if we bring in some cameras?'''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four news organizations have sided with law enforcement
officers in both cases to defend the media's watchdog role.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland case, Montgomery County sheriff's deputies and
deputy U.S. Marshals were accompanied by a Washington Post
photographer and reporter when they entered the Rockville home of
Charles and Geraldine Wilson the morning of April 14, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs taken were never published, and the search did
not turn up the couple's grown son, Dominic. At his parents'
request, he surrendered later that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilsons sued the police, claiming their Fourth Amendment
rights had been violated, but lower courts rejected their case.
</P>
<P>
   In the Montana case, about 20 federal agents accompanied by a
CNN camera crew arrived at Paul Berger's sheep and cattle ranch on
March 24, 1993, to search for evidence of eagle poisoning. At a
subsequent trial, Berger was acquitted of all charges except
improper use of a pesticide, a minor offense.
</P>
<P>
   CNN eventually used footage of the raid as part of its coverage
of government efforts to protect endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled
that Berger and his wife could sue the federal authorities who
organized the raid and allowed the television crew to come along.
``The record ... suggests that the government officers planned and
executed the search in a manner designed to enhance its
entertainment, rather than its law-enforcement, value,'' the
appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the cases in June.

TREASURES OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID M. OSHINSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am no expert on history CD-ROMs. In truth, I have consciously
shied away from them, seeing digital tools as a frivolous assault
on scholarly standards. After spending a week playing with The
Library of Congress: Eyes of the Nation, a new CD-ROM exploring the
American experience through documents selected from the world's
largest archive, I've been partly converted, much like the wayward
Puritan of the 1650s who made a ``halfway covenant'' with his
faith. Used in conjunction with more traditional methods, the
CD-ROM may well revolutionize the way we teach history.
</P>
<P>
   The Eyes of the Nation CD-ROM is divided into five parts. All
provide a glimpse of the treasures to be found in the Library of
Congress' fabulous special collections. (The DVD-ROM version has 19
additional exhibits, more than 1,000 additional images and three
hours of full-screen video.)
</P>
<P>
   Part One introduces the viewer to the world of rare books, maps,
prints and photographs, including the first known slave narrative
published on American soil (1760), a detailed sketch of the
Gettysburg battlefield by a Confederate topographer (1863), and a
poignant photo of two black women on their knees, decorating the
grave of a black soldier in the segregated Arlington National
Cemetery (1943).
</P>
<P>
   Parts Two and Three divide the 3,000 images on this CD-ROM along
chronological and thematic lines. Following a concise and
beautifully crafted overview of the American experience by the
historian Alan Brinkley, the images are placed into categories like
Arts, Entertainment, Transportation and War. Each category contains
a time line covering the course of American history. A journey into
The African-African Experience, for example, elicits a dozen images
from the years 1947 to 1957, including those of Charlie Parker
playing the alto saxophone, Marian Anderson performing with the New
York Philharmonic, Rosa Parks being fingerprinted by the police in
Montgomery, Ala., and social psychologist Kenneth Clark performing
the doll study that swayed several Supreme Court justices in Brown
vs. Board of Education. All the images are accompanied by crisp
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Part Four, my favorite, contains a series of multimedia exhibits
created specifically for Eyes of the Nation. These include things
like the step-by-step construction of the U.S. Capitol and the
satirical cartoons of the Gilded Age (1875-1900), in which
politicians, capitalists, immigrants and reformers are savagely
lampooned, in lavish color, by a rising class of American artists.
Carefully narrated, these exhibits demonstrate the ability of
archivists to create a powerful sense of time and place through the
creative use of primary sources.
</P>
<P>
   Part Five links the CD-ROM to the Library of Congress' American
Memory Web site, providing instant access to hundreds of thousands
of historical documents.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes of the Nation is billed as user-friendly, and it partly
succeeds. All the images can be individually retrieved, filed in
portfolios created by users, and printed. All contain a written
commentary. The viewer can also enlarge the image and zoom in on
the contents _ a good idea when reading an old letter or studying
battlefield maps.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the search function is confusing and incomplete. While
including all the images, it does not search the larger text. So my
attempts to locate J. Edgar Hoover, Barry Goldwater and Donald Duck
turned up nothing. Are they somewhere on this CD-ROM? I have no
idea.
</P>
<P>
   There also appears to be no cross-referencing. Using the word
``tennis,'' I could find no match for Billie Jean King. She is
categorized under ``feminism, women's liberation,'' and a viewer
seeking more information about her is given the image of that noted
athlete Bella Abzug.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, my search for Dwight D. Eisenhower turned up a single
image, although I'm certain from my own browsing that there were at
least two.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems. After 1970, the project clearly loses
momentum. The scenes become predictable: space shuttles, presidents
and first ladies, Michael Jackson performing ``Thriller.'' There is
little about the major changes transforming the nation, like the
extraordinary influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   At certain times, the project veers down a slippery political
road. You could easily come away from the images and commentary on
Vietnam with the feeling that every single American, with the
exception of the Pentagon planners, deeply opposed the conflict.
Nine images appear on the time line for War between 1970 and 1991.
One covers the shooting of student protesters at Kent State;
another focuses on ``Apocalypse Now,'' the ultimate anti-war film.
A third shows a CIA map of South Vietnam, but the commentary
ignores that image in favor of a diatribe against ``the
military-industrial complex.'' There are five separate images of
the Vietnam Memorial, emphasizing heartache and loss.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth image takes on the Persian Gulf war. It shows a wall
of death at the University of Rochester, representing the thousands
of Iraqis who were killed in the conflict. There is no mention of
how the war began or who bears responsibility for the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Given the extraordinary scope and beauty of this project,
however, these are minor quibbles. Eyes of the Nation is not meant
to be a textbook. It is a compendium of sights and sounds,
celebration and protest, pop culture and seminal ideas, reminding
us of the richness and diversity of American life. On that level,
it is a stunning success.

   WASHINGTON _ Before a skeptical House panel, the Pentagon on
Wednesday defended its program of mandatory anthrax vaccinations
for all troops, saying the shots are safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of the anthrax vaccination program,'' said Dr.
Sue Bailey, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. ``It
would be irresponsible if we were not using this vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the Defense Department ``is confident, as is the
Food and Drug Administration, that the FDA-licensed anthrax vaccine
is safe and efficacious (in) immunizing the total force against
anthrax.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, testifying before the House Government Reform
Subcommittee on Human Resources, said exposure to deadly anthrax
bacteria is a major threat to U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 countries, including Iraq, have or are suspected of
having anthrax spores, she said. The disease begins with flu-like
symptoms and within one to six days can result in total organ
failure. Without the vaccine, the mortality rate after exposure is
99 percent, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Surgeon General Charles Roadman told the panel that
although U.S. troops haven't yet been exposed to anthrax, it's
``not a question of whether but when we are exposed to this.''
</P>
<P>
   But the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., said many servicemen and women are afraid of the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missing element of the mandatory anthrax vaccine program
is trust,'' he said. Shays added that the use of Agent Orange
during the Vietnam War and illnesses suffered by troops after the
Persian Gulf War have ``made military men and women understandably
distrustful of the Pentagon on medical matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said Wednesday's hearing was the first of many
that he plans to hold on the controversial vaccination program.
</P>
<P>
   Current service members, however, told the panel that many
troops are afraid the vaccine will cause unknown long-term health
effects and some have refused to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Pfc. Stephen Lundbom, stationed at the Marine base at Twentynine
Palms, Calif., said 27 members of his unit initially refused the
vaccinations. All but five ultimately took them after being
threatened with loss of pay, extra duty, demotion and discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Lundbom said that when he first heard of the vaccination
program, he turned to the Internet for information. He said he
found a Web site that said no research had been conducted into
whether the shots cause birth defects, cancer or sterility.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, saying that much of the Internet information is
incorrect, has countered with its own Internet site that discusses
what it calls the ``myths and facts'' about the anthrax vaccine. It
plans to vaccinate 2.4 million active-duty and reserve military
members by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials have reported that about 200 service members
have refused to take the vaccinations. Some have been discharged,
and disciplinary action against the others is pending. Earlier this
week Robert Garner Jr., who served in the Army at Fort Sam Houston
in San Antonio, was demoted from sergeant to private and averted a
court martial by accepting a discharge under ``other than
honorable'' conditions for refusing to take the anthrax vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said the number of defiant service members is small
compared with the 223,000 troops who have received anthrax shots to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Mark S. Zaid, a Washington attorney who has represented service
members facing disciplinary action for refusing to take the shots,
said the numbers don't tell the full story. He said they do not
include people who initially refuse the shots but then change their
minds because they cannot risk losing their military careers or
having their pay and rank cut.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to quell fears among the military about the program,
which went into effect last year, Defense Secretary William Cohen
was recently photographed receiving an anthrax shot.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey and Army Surgeon General Ronald R. Blanck said they are
in the midst of receiving their series of vaccines, which consists
of six shots over an 18-month period and annual booster shots
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon admits that no long-term human tests have
been conducted on the vaccine, Bailey said the department is
unaware of any long-term health effects among people who have been
receiving shots over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine in 1970,
and it has been used by livestock workers, veterinarians and
military lab technicians since the mid-1970s. About 150,000 troops
were given the vaccine during the Gulf War in 1990-1991.

NEW BLENDERS IN TIME FOR JUNE WEDDINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of the Waring Blendor, which was introduced in 1937, with
its sexy Art Deco silhouette and its two-speed motor, as the
Platonic ideal. Blenders still perform much like the original
Waring but have been endlessly restyled. From the 16-button models
of the 60s _ back when buttons represented space-age convenience _
to the cordless models that came out a couple of years ago to the
most up-to-date versions with soft illuminated keypads, the blender
changes to mirror our passing technological obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a blender makeover is something to be taken lightly.
Scott Henderson, the director of industrial design at Smart Design
in New York, said that when hired by Cuisinart a couple of years
ago to breathe new life into an old appliance, the Smart team began
with an examination of the market leaders. ``We ground up a lot of
stuff,'' Henderson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   This long, messy process produced a machine that, Henderson
said, was intended to ``create a poignant psychological experience
for the blender user.'' Its base rested on four haunches, giving it
``the character of a kitchen pet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuisinart rejected Smart's zoomorphic approach and turned to an
Italian architect, Pino Spagnolo, who fashioned a blender that
looks less like a domesticated animal. With its rounded white base,
it harmonizes with Cuisinart's toasters and coffee makers. The link
between Henderson's proposal and Spagnolo's final product is,
apparently, a coincidence. Cuisinart named the new blender
Smartpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole keypad works on electronics,'' Mary Rodgers,
Cuisinart's senior manager for market communications, explained
when asked about the blender's IQ. ``It knows when you press a
button what speed it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bruno LeVerrier, an industrial designer in Caen, France,
began work on the newest Krups blender, he was told that the German
manufacturer wanted to distinguish its blender with an esthetic
that was faithful to the tenets of modernism. ``The design wants to
have a pure, symbolic shape,'' LeVerrier explained, adding that an
earlier blender he did for Krups had a ``female look, with a lot of
roundness.'' The new one, he said, is ``rather male.''
</P>
<P>
   Krups is not marketing LeVerrier's new machine, available since
January, as a boy toy. But the company has done the next best
thing: The imposing appliance, its oddly angled chrome base lending
it the look of a sophisticated laboratory tool, is called the Power
Xtreme Premium.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Reingewirtz, a Krups product manager in Closter, N.J.,
pointed out that earlier models were named Power X Plus and Power
Xpert, but she said, ``I can't tell you how it started.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she has to. Clearly, the Krups blender is Xtreme for
the same reason that the Cuisinart is Smart. Product
differentiation isn't just about pure forms or blender gender but
about language. The words don't describe the product; they describe
the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be the next new extreme,'' said J. Walker Smith, a
managing partner in Yankelovich Partners, the market-research
consultants. Although Smith cautioned that ``people don't like
being pandered to by marketers,'' he contended that Krups' use of
the magic letter was apt, given that members of Generation X are
now forming households. An extreme washer and dryer will,
presumably, be next. The Smartpower blender, on the other hand,
``has a special appeal to baby boomers, who think they're smarter
than everyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, compared to what appliance executives did in the
'60s, when they assigned names to an unprecedented number of
blender buttons, applying buzzwords like ``smart'' or ``extreme''
is child's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came out with our 16-speed blender, eight of us sat up
two nights straight, trying to get words with five letters, each
one sounding a bit higher than the other,'' one unnamed marketer
told Susan Strasser, the author of ``Never Done: A History of
American Housework'' (Pantheon, 1982).
</P>
<P>
   The Power Xtreme still uses some of those '60s words _ stir,
whip, chop, mix, puree and liquefy _ on its stylish, low-rise '90s
buttons. If the Power Xtreme were true to its name, it would employ
a whole new vernacular: agitate, convulse, slash, thrash, mangle
and destroy.

CLINTON DEFENDS AIR STRIKES BUT POLLS SHOW A DIVIDED U.S. PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (EDS: President is scheduled to address nation at 8 p.m. EST)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton appealed Wednesday for public
support for his decision to order air strikes against Yugoslav
forces in the Balkans, warning that a humanitarian ``catastrophe''
loomed without NATO intervention to stem murderous attacks on
civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, ordering the fourth U.S. military attack on a sovereign
nation in seven months, said the rampage of Yugoslav forces across
the Maryland-sized province of Kosovo has spawned 60,000 refugees
on the run in the last five weeks alone to join 200,000 other
predominantly ethnic Albanians who have fled mass executions, arson
and artillery salvos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo's crisis now is full-blown,'' the president declared in
brief remarks at the White House as cruise missiles began raining
down on Yugoslav targets in and near the embattled province.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not act, clearly it will get even worse. Only
firmness now can prevent greater catastrophe later,'' Clinton
added.
</P>
<P>
   British and American forces operating as part of the 19-nation,
U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) led the initial
attacks that included aircraft from a total of 11 nations.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was the first attack staged against a sovereign
nation by the NATO alliance since the Cold War-era alliance was
formed in 1949 to combat threatened Soviet-bloc aggression against
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Six 1950s-era B-52 bombers based in Britain launched more than
three dozen precision-guided cruise missiles against targets in and
near Kosovo. Two U.S. B-2 stealth bombers based at Whiteman Air
Force Base in Missouri dropped laser-guided 2,000 pound bunker
buster bombs in the first combat use of the billion dollar
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Warplanes based at Aviano, in northern Italy, swept across the
Adriatic Sea to strike targets in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warships also fired cruise missiles against targets in
Yugoslavia as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said allies resorted to armed force after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic rejected diplomatic persuasion to end
his year-old military crackdown to crush an independence movement
in the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of two million
people.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants Milosovic to permit an allied
peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops _ including 4,000 American
troops _ to enter the Yugoslav province of Kosovo to enforce a
yet-to-be negotiated cease-fire and political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who drew parallels on Tuesday between the Yugoslov
attacks and Nazi exterminations of civilians in World War II, said
``tens of thousands'' of ethnic Albanian civilians could be driven
from their homes in Kosovo into neighboring Albania and Macedonia,
unless the Yugoslav offensive is halted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the allied onslaught a ``stand against ethnic
violence and atrocity,'' adding: ``It will clearly be much more
costly and dangerous to stop it later than this effort to prevent
it from going further now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the operation was designed to demonstrate the
``seriousness'' of allied opposition to Yugoslav aggression;
dissuade attacks on civilians; and damage Yugoslavia's capacity to
wage war.

</P>
<P>
   Since last August, Clinton has ordered U.S. forces to attack
Iraq, Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking in London, said the
allies ``must now act'' to quell a year-old civil war that has
claimed the lives of more than 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, speaking at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, said the allies ``must stop the violence
and bring an end to the humanitarian catastrophe now taking place
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton canceled a planned three-day trip to Ohio, Nevada and
California that included political fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are deeply divided on the use of military force in
Kosovo, according to a Cable News Network/USA Today survey released
before the raids.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,018 adults questioned in a survey that concluded
Sunday, 46 percent said they favored U.S. participation in a
military operation, if necessary; 43 percent said they opposed U.S.
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were equally divided on whether U.S. national
interests are at stake. Only 42 percent said the United States
``needs to be involved in Kosovo in order to protect its own
interests,'' compared to 50 percent who said the United States need
not be involved.
</P>
<P>
   With the military operation underway, Clinton garnered reluctant
rally-round-the-flag support from some wary Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who had a long-planned
lunch with Clinton at the White House, issued a statement
afterwards that expressed support for troops involved in ``a
complex and delicate situation that involves European stability and
our own nation's security.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert added that he has questions about the long-term strategy
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who has questioned
Clinton's penchant for launching military operations overseas,
offered support for troops in the operation _ if not for Clinton's
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever our reservations about the president's actions in the
Balkans, let no one doubt that the Congress and the American people
stand united behind our men and women who are bravely heeding the
call of duty there,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a likely GOP presidential candidate,
said he supported the air strikes but said ``everyone wants to know
what Plan B is.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Chairman Jim Nicholson said ``the time for debate is
over,'' adding: ``The time for prayer has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials denied that Clinton cancelled his
political trip to the West Coast in response to Nicholson's demand
that the president forego a $1 million fund raising trip and remain
at the White House during the operation.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential hopeful John Kasich, a Republican congressman
from Ohio, said he would support the president's decision for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look _ the planes are flying,'' Kasich told reporters, adding
that he hoped the White House was mapping ``what the next step
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said the United States ``diminishes itself'' by becoming
entangled in ``civil wars and ethnic conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said a ``great power has to not only know when to go, but
when not to go'' to war.

   Clinton sought to brace the American people for the possibility
that U.S. pilots could be shot down _ and killed or captured _
during the second phase of the operation when piloted aircraft are
expected to be used to attack tanks, artillery, anti-aircraft
batteries and concentrations of Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action is not risk free,'' Clinton warned. ``It carries
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said he had ordered additional
search and rescue teams into the region to retrieve any downed
pilots. A Marine Corps team rescued Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady
in June 1995 after O'Grady evaded capture for six days after his
F-16 fighter was shot down by Bosnian Serb forces.

   The U.S.-led operation threatened to chill U.S.-Russia
relations. Clinton spoke by telephone with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin about five hours before the attack began but failed to
persuade the Kremlin leader to support the allied air strikes
against a traditional Russian ally in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov abandoned
a planned visit to Washington and turned his U.S.-bound aircraft
around over the North Atlantic to return to Moscow after receiving
a telephone call from Vice President Al Gore that the allies were
preparing to attack targets in Yugoslavia.

 By LUCIE YOUNG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty-two months ago, Mark Weinstein bought a
one-bedroom co-op in Manhattan's Chelsea section and asked Lloyd
Schwan to turn it into a colorful repository of playful storage
units and curvaceous 1970s-inspired design. The renovation is still
not complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``When am I going to get my stool?'' Weinstein asked Schwan at a
photo shoot that brought the sparring partners together. ``You are
just trying to humiliate me in front of all these people,'' Schwan
shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, 40, produces and promotes music videos for clients
like Janet Jackson and Busta Rhymes. Schwan, 43, is renowned for
curling, elastic, often cartoony pieces of furniture that artfully
blend multiple colors _ sometimes, 117 of them. The resulting
pieces can cost $3,000 to $15,000, and clients for his interiors
are usually creative types like Jenette Kahn, president of DC
Comics and Mad magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Like a marriage, the relationship between Schwan and Weinstein
went through phases. There was the honeymoon period, when promises
were made. (Schwan's intricate design for Weinstein's
600-square-foot apartment would be as tightly functional as a
ship's cabin, he said, and done in just three months.) The outlook
seemed rosy.
</P>
<P>
   This was followed by a period of intense disillusionment, when
nothing seemed to be turning out right. ``It's like scenes from the
movie `The Money Pit,''' Weinstein said. Battles ensued. ``You
can't be afraid to insult each other and get down and
mud-wrestle,'' he added. Eventually, they settled into a routine
that alternated between bickering and mutual admiration. Think Tom
and Jerry. Or Fred and Ethel. Or Felix and Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the project, designer and client worked in harmony.
Schwan's first drawings for the apartment mirrored Weinstein's
fantasy of having a space with a '70s vibe (the period when he was
coming of age, he said), a seating arrangement that fitted together
like a puzzle and lots and lots of storage for his 1,000 CDs and
pop videos and for his clothes. Weinstein didn't want to pay more
than $75,000, although Schwan said the budget ultimately escalated
to around $100,000. The difference included a desk fashioned out of
five types of fake wood.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation was extensive. When Weinstein bought the space,
it was painted baby blue and full of doors, Schwan said. The
designer stripped the interior down to the floorboards and then
rebuilt it. He punched out rounded doorways and a giant porthole
window to connect the living room and kitchen. In the bedroom, he
built in a wall of seemingly invisible closets and invisible
drawers for Weinstein's exuberant collection of hip-hop clothes. He
turned dreary kitchen cabinets into an arty assemblage of
mint-colored boxes of different sizes and depths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to feel like the hippest junior suite on the
planet,'' Schwan said.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate window treatments, linen squares hung off simple
drape hooks, are a surprise. Schwan developed that notion during
three months when he lived in the apartment to pick up its aura.
Weinstein was concerned that Schwan would stay on, especially when
the apartment came together. ``I had to phone and say, `Are you out
yet?'''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein holds informal business meetings in the apartment. ``I
think the people in my business appreciate something that is a
little fun and different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As in many other embattled relationships, Schwan and Weinstein
have a history. Eleven years ago, Weinstein, on a friend's advice,
commissioned Schwan and his former partner, Lyn Godley, to design
an elaborate media cabinet for Weinstein's previous apartment. The
result was not a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all standing there shaking as we put it together,''
Schwan said. ``None of the stereo stuff fitted in the shelves.''
But because the concept was so exciting (even if the stereo didn't
fit), the designers were asked to do other work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The piece looked so great and spectacular, I decided the rest
of the apartment was wrong and had to be redone,'' Weinstein said.
He gave Schwan and Ms. Godley the commission of a lifetime: 15 new
pieces of furniture for the apartment and a wood-tile floor that
Weinstein described as ``like a crazy game of Twister.''
</P>
<P>
   When Weinstein moved on, he sold almost everything. It was time
for a change, he said, but he wanted Schwan to work with him again.
</P>
<P>
   One conflict in the new apartment arose over the art, which
Schwan installed uninvited. Weinstein rolled his eyes at the
memory. What Schwan calls paintings are strips of plastic laminate
colored in dull '70s shades of blue, green, yellow and orange or
made to look like pieces of wood grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should someone mind if you put art on their walls?''
Schwan said, running a bony hand through his blond hair. He termed
the abstract pieces ``family portraits,'' a description that made
Weinstein snort in derision.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a way of getting revenge, Weinstein keeps his
grandmother's Oriental gilt, orange and blue tea set on a shelf in
the totem-pole-style living room cabinets that Schwan designed. ``I
know it annoys him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few more hiccups in the new apartment. A love
seat looked all wrong. (Schwan paid for that, Weinstein said,
because it ended up nothing like the drawing.) Wood floors had to
be refinished twice. (They both shared that cost, Weinstein said.)
Despite such problems, they can both laugh over the time Schwan
accidentally wired the television to a dimmer switch and blew it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Schwan said that snags are inevitable when clients have to deal
with original designs. Schwan, by the way, has developed a line of
furniture for Box Design in Sweden based on Weinstein's supposedly
unique bedroom floating shelves and living room media cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   But Weinstein remains devoted to working with a designer on an
apartment. ``You focus your money toward a maximum impact,'' he
said. He believes that Schwan's work has increased the value of his
apartment. ``I think I can realize a profit of $50,000 over and
above the cost of the apartment and of the structural renovation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he has come around to the idea that the design process
is never ending. ``Now things are needing to be adjusted and
redone,'' he complained, but with a note of relish in his voice.
The two began conspiratorially discussing improvements to
Weinstein's nearby 1,200-square-foot offices, which Schwan began
working on last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is he wanted me to do it in two weeks and on no
budget,'' Schwan announced. Weinstein sighed.
</P>
<P>
   The client in this case has come to realize that originality
comes at a price. ``Sometimes it's a comedy, but you live through
it because it doesn't matter if it's Lloyd or some other designer _
you are always going to have problems,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end justifies the bumpy route.'' he added, ``And the
occasional wrestling bouts. I hired Lloyd for his vision and his
ability to excite.''

   The Times will be choosing four Kosovo-related stories from the
following:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Washington) _ NATO launches airstrikes on Yugoslavia
to punish its leader for refusing to make peace in the southern
Serbian province. Detonations go off in Pristina, lighting the
hills over the darkened Kosovo capital; in Belgrade, witnesses
report eight explosions, some near a military airport and at least
one near a power plant. Developing. By Francis X. Clines.

Kosovo crisis through airstrikes, in the context of similar,
successful Allied bombings in Bosnia. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ President Clinton is expected to
address the nation at 8 p.m. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Once again, Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is gaining short-term political
capital from a policy that, while it may seem self-immolating to
outsiders, plugs into profound feelings of victimization and
historical injustice among Serbs, feelings that animate both rural
farmers and Belgrade sophisticates. The threat of NATO bombing has
solidified support for Milosevic among the young Serb intellectuals
who had formerly opposed him. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GERMANY (Berlin) _ German forces participate in a bombing
on European soil for the first time since World War II. By Roger
Cohen
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Russian media, in a surprising move,
criticized Prime Minister Primakov for placing Russian-Serb
relations above Russian-U.S. relations in abruptly returning home
Tuesday. By Michael R. Gordon.

   AIR-SAFETY (Washington) _ The National Transportation Safety
Board blames the crash of two Boeing 737s on a phenomenon it says
it can deduce but not explain, two simultaneous failures in a
hydraulic valve in the rudder. It makes what could be one of its
most far-reaching recommendations, that the rudder systems on more
than 3,000 such planes in service should be made ``reliably
redundant.'' By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-PINOCHET (London) _ The Law Lords, who constitute
England's highest court, rule that Gen. Augusto Pinochet must
remain in England and face possible extradition to Spain, but they
significantly narrow the charges on which the case will turn. By
Warren Hoge.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A late season storm will lash southern California on Thursday as
a potent jet stream disturbance moves ashore from the Pacific
Ocean. Intermittent showers will douse the coast and interior
foothills while isolated thunderstorms erupt in the afternoon as a
pocket of unusually cold air arrives aloft at altitudes near 10,000
feet. As the moist air impinges the interior mountains, it will
further moisten and cool, setting the stage for accumulating snow
in the upper reaches of the San Gabriel, San Bernadino and southern
Sierra mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will also surround
a slow-moving front stretched from eastern Texas to the South
Carolina coast. Farther south, warm and generally sunny conditions
will cover Florida. It will also be more humid than recent days
across the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   An expansive ridge of high pressure will spread over the upper
Middle West and Northeast Thursday. Sinking currents of air
associated with the high will promote abundant sunshine over the
region. A weak jet disturbance, however, will bring a few clouds to
the northern and eastern Great Lakes as well as interior New
England. Meanwhile, the clockwise circulation around the high
pressure will draw increasingly warm air north into the high Plains
and Front Range of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to mostly cloudy skies will cover the Pacific Northwest
with spotty showers expected west of the Cascade Mountains.
Steadier rain will arrive tonight in western Washington as a cold
sweeps through the region. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Weather Spotters Network &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many National Weather Service offices are currently sponsoring
severe weather awareness weeks to prepare for arrival of
thunderstorm season. While modern technology has increased the
ability of meteorologists to observe and predict severe
thunderstorms and tornadoes, the weather service maintains a
network of citizens to watch for developing severe storms. These
so-called ``weather spotters'' spend hours learning the important
characteristics that distinguish developing severe storms from
otherwise harmless cloud formations. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; FEATURE stories &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLEMANIA (Undated) _ The red-hot growth sector for media
analysis in 1999 is the apocalpse theory. And the word
``Millenarianism'' is the belief in a battle between good and evil
at the end of the millennium that lays waste to the earth and is
then followed by a thousand years of peace and human perfection.
(Mill(italics)i(end italics)nerianism, on the other hand, is the
belief in, um, hats.) What better way for the pop-cult eggheads and
satraps to earn their living than by pointing out for us the early
warning signs to the death of civilization? One such harbinger, the
seemingly inexplicable resurgence of professional wrestling, is
already being written about and spoken of by those on the critical
edge of the crackpot apocalypse. Wrestlemania, apparently, is the
end of the world as we know it. In our Age of Incivility, it should
come as only a small surprise that professional wrestling is now
the hippest ticket in town and a regular ratings juggernaut on
cable television. By Jeff MacGregor. &UR;  &LR; (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ARTISTS-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ Europe has more than 400
single-artist museums; in this country, there are fewer than 40. A
single-artist museum, as the clunky phrase implies, is a public
institution devoted to the work of one lone artist, and the
tradition has given rise to such universally beloved haunts as the
Musee Picasso in Paris, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Miro
Foundation in Barcelona and the Edvard Munch Museum in Oslo. And in
this country? Government indifference to the arts is an old story,
yet despite the obvious obstacles, artists' museums are finally
gaining some momentum. By Deborah Solomon. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ARCTIC-CIRCLE-FILM (Undated) _ Julio Medem, 40, makes
sophisticated, elegantly constructed films whose characters seem to
wander blindly through a maze of experience. The director has
earned a reputation as Spain's most promising auteur; but as an
artist, he prefers not knowing where he's going. Spanish audiences
have had no trouble connecting with ``Lovers of the Arctic Circle''
(``Los Amantes del Circulo Polar''), Medem's fourth feature and a
surprise hit. The movie will be presented in the New Directors/New
Films series at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan on April 7
and 8, and will open theatrically the next day. Highly stylized,
the film is a love story told alternately from the perspective of
each of the lovers, and it plays with the tension between the
lovers' fairy-tale idealism and the hazards of chance and will that
govern their fate. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TONY-GOLDWYN-FILM (Undated) _ About five years ago, the actor
Tony Goldwyn started getting restless. His performance in the 1990
off-Broadway play ``The Sum of Us'' had put him on the New York
theater map. The same year, his portrayal of the yuppie villain in
``Ghost'' had done the same in Hollywood. But he wanted more. His
response was perhaps inevitable for the son of the movie producer
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and the grandson of the Hollywood legend Sam
Goldwyn. He would find a script he wanted to act in and produce it
himself. He saw it as something that might happen 10 years down the
road. But it didn't turn out the way he expected because of a
script called ``The Blouse Man,'' by a poet and playwright named
Pamela Gray. As ``A Walk on the Moon,'' the film opened on Friday,
and although Goldwyn does not act in it, he is indeed one of the
producers and, more important, its director. By Sylviane Gold.

<P>
   NO-FRILLS-CINEFEST (Liverpool, N.Y.) _ The phrase ``film
festival'' conjures glamorous images: the beaches of Cannes, the
slopes of Park City, Utah, and a crush of photographers aiming at
the latest starlet. Then there's Cinefest, which prides itself on
offering lots of films and not much festival. Held at a
standard-issue Holiday Inn here off Interstate 81, just northwest
of Syracuse, Cinefest has quietly developed a reputation as the
un-Cannes. For four days, several hundred people gather to sit on
banquet chairs in the hotel ballroom and watch movies that run from
9 a.m. until well past midnight. The films being screened are not
orphans in search of a distributor or indies hoping to generate
buzz, but rather spirits from the past: rarely seen movies from the
silent and early talkie era. By Ted Loos. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NONPROFIT-MUSICALS (subslug) (New York) _ For musicals with big
bold intentions, they certainly didn't make much noise. The first
to come and go quietly was ``Parade,'' the funereal $5.5 million
Lincoln Center Theater show about the lynching of Leo Frank. Next
was ``Bright Lights Big City,'' the $500,000 musical adaptation of
the Jay McInerney novel that opened and closed at New York Theater
Workshop in what seemed like the span of a single yawn. The last to
depart, ``Captains Courageous,'' a $1 million musical that opened
in mid-February to the equivalent of a citywide shrug, is to vacate
the Manhattan Theater Club next Sunday. There you have it. Over the
course of a few punishing winter months, the musical hopes of three
of New York's most successful nonprofit theaters were smothered in
a blizzard of mixed-to-negative reviews. By Peter Marks. (Moved).
Photo.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BALLET (Undated) _ Rehash or celebration? As a work in
progress, the New York City Ballet's 50th anniversary year looks
like both. The celebration is, in effect, a retrospective: Now
halfway through the 100 ballets it plans to present through June,
the company leaned toward the familiar in its recent winter season.
Yet the packaging was often different, and new contexts made for
new insights. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   WEIR-THEATER (London) _ Ian Rickson says he admires auteur stage
directors like Robert Wilson and Anne Bogart, who leave their
emphatic imprint on a production. But he prefers to burrow out from
the inside of a play. And if people don't notice what he has done,
that may be the highest compliment. Rickson's work is on display in
``The Weir,'' by the 27-year-old Irish playwright Conor McPherson,
which opens on Thursday at the Walter Kerr Theater in Manhattan.
This meditative drama of barroom blarney that gives way to a sense
of loss and then of healing is the director's first Broadway
effort. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FORZA-OPERA (Milan, Italy) _ Last month under the direction of
Riccardo Muti, after an absence of 20 years, ``La Forza del
Destino'' returned to La Scala, where in 1869 Verdi introduced the
opera in its significantly revised, definitive form. By Matthew
Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   CHOPIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Another anniversary is upon us, yet the
music business is strangely muted. Frederic Chopin died 150 years
ago, and the relative silence has less to do with our forgetfulness
than with our despair. For what are we to give the man who has
everything? Centennials _ bi-, tri-, sesqui- or of whatever nature
_ promise concentrated looks, resuscitations of neglected works,
re-evaluations of worth, new editions and musicological
discoveries. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GRAND-MACABRE-OPERA (Undated) _ Probably no opera of the last
quarter-century has been seen by more people than Gyorgy Ligeti's
``Grand Macabre.'' Since its premiere in Stockholm in 1978, the
work has had several different stagings in Europe, though none so
far in this country. Now comes its second recording, taken from
public performances in Paris a year ago of the production made for
the 1997 Salzburg Festival (Sony SK2 62312; two CDs). Esa-Pekka
Salonen leads the Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta
Voices and an excellent cast, most of whom will be returning in
December, when the production moves into the newly reopened Royal
Opera House in London. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-ARTS-CENTER (Philadelphia) _ An emphatic article in a
newspaper here stated that the Philadelphia Orchestra, the only
major American ensemble to play on a proscenium stage, should have
a proper hall of its own. That was in 1908. Successive generations
have taken up the cry. Plans for a new hall were drawn up during
the music directorships of Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy,
Riccardo Muti and now Wolfgang Sawallisch. Finally, a plan may be
realized. Ground was broken last November for a new Regional
Performing Arts Center, with a 2,500-seat symphony hall and a
650-seat recital theater, scheduled to open in 2001. By Anne
Midgette.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROSCOE-MITCHELL-JAZZ (Undated) _ Roscoe Mitchell, whose album,
``Nine to Get Ready'' has just appeared, is a leading member of
jazz's forgotten avant-garde. Once hailed as an heir to Ornette
Coleman and Albert Ayler, Mitchell found himself pushed to the
margins in the 1980s by Wynton Marsalis and his traditionalist
followers, who reviled free jazz as an evil second only to fusion.
Since the early 90s, Mitchell has been staging a comeback,
recording and performing at a furious clip. He might not be welcome
at Lincoln Center, where musicians are expected to adhere to
blues-derived forms and steer clear of European dissonances. But
among younger jazz listeners who chafe at such restrictions,
Mitchell's audience is expanding. By Adam Shatz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ROCK-IMAGE (Undated) _ Today, rock-and-roll is having problems.
Promoters say there are no new bands with members under 40 that can
sell out stadiums the way wrestling can. Monster truck shows, on
the other hand, have no problem selling out stadiums night after
night. And monster truck shows don't even have real celebrities, as
wrestling does: just unseen drivers like Gravedigger, who is
basically loved because he takes his turns too fast and too tight
and likes to drive through stadiums destroying props. There's that
violence and danger again. And maybe that's what rock needs. By
Neil Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HIDDEN-MUSIC-TRACKS (Undated) _ The music of Whitney Houston,
the Offspring, Robert Earl Keen, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Beck and Jewel
has little in common, but the musicians do share one thing: they
all included hidden tracks on their most recent CDs. From
hip-hoppers to singer-songwriters to rockers, more pop artists than
ever are adding hidden tracks _ bonus tracks that are not listed on
the song lineup _ in an effort to surprise, delight, mock or annoy
fans. By Scott Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-LOW-CULTURE (Undated) _ There is nothing these days that is
too Low for High thought: trailer parks, snuff films, Mickey Mouse.
Some of this is because of the unparalleled power of American
popular culture, its extraordinary influence with world audiences
and its aggressively democratic perspective. Boundaries are
dissolving so fast that even the lowly life of a cultural critic is
swept up in the maelstrom: in recent months I have written about
swimming pools, video games and lingerie as well as Arnold
Schoenberg, Isaiah Berlin and Shakespeare. By Edward Rothstein.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ANCIENT-GAMES-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ On the surface, board games
seem intended to amuse and entertain, but on closer look they have
much in common with military campaigns or religious rituals.
According to a Chinese legend from the Qin Dynasty, to avoid
further bloodshed, a war between an uncle and nephew was settled by
a game of weiqi, a kind of chess. This and many other stories are
charmingly related through the nearly 100 objects exhibited in
``Games People Play: Ancient Pastimes of Asia'' at the E.&AMP;J.
Frankel gallery in Manhattan until May 1. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).

   WASHINGTON _ Business leaders from border cities in the

stepped-up efforts to halt drug smuggling and illegal immigration
are hampering trade between Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has become the United States' second largest trading
partner behind Canada since the passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement efforts to crack down on drug trafficking
and the lack of adequate infrastructure impede business between the
two countries, the business leaders contend.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Garcia, a San Ysidro, Calif., businessman and president
of the International Chamber of Commerce, complained that U.S. law
enforcement agents routinely hassle legal border crossers from
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And Garcia said agents with the Customs Service and Immigration
and Naturalization Service confront thousands of Mexican citizens
who cross legally to spend $3.5 billion each year with U.S.
businesses along the border from California to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Ambassador Jesus Reyes Heroles said NAFTA had changed
``the border concept'' from small towns marking the 2,000-mile
international boundary to an industrial region that encompasses the
cities of Monterrey, Mexico, and San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to base our actions on good neighbor principles,''
Reyes Heroles told about 100 business leaders attending the 3rd
annual U.S.-Mexico Border Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work hand-in-hand to find common solutions to the
various challenges that we face,'' Reyes Heroles said.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen attending the conference, sponsored by the
U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and the El Paso (Texas) Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce, complained that neither country has provided
infrastructure to keep up with increased trade.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Iovino of the Ford Motor Co. said delays on the
U.S.-Mexico border have disrupted shipping and cost U.S. automakers
more than $3 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. business executives also complained that Mexican
border officials were charging a duty on more than $50 in goods
purchased in the United States by Mexican citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on the border are having a tough time,'' said Rep. Ciro
D. Rodriguez, D-Texas. ``There is a need for us to look at NAFTA
and individual purchasing power, not just freight of products.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, said the business conference was
designed to alert members of Congress from outside the border
region to problems facing the Southwest border states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get better and more informed decisions here and in
Mexico City, that will provide us with better support,'' Reyes
said.

COMMENTARY: AFTER THE PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Farmer told me a few years ago that the civil
rights leaders of the 1950s and 1960s made a grave error when they
failed to develop plans to build upon their stunning successes.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, a co-founder of the Congress of Racial Equality, was one
of the big four civil rights leaders who led a midcentury movement
that changed this nation and influenced much of the world. The
others were Martin Luther King Jr., Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1995, Farmer said: ``We did not do any
long-range planning. So we were stuck without a program after the
success of our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar problem could face the men and women who, by their
protests, have thrown such a brilliant spotlight on the problem of
police misconduct in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the long effort to get someone to address the
pervasive evil of unwarranted police violence and the systematic
violation of civil rights and civil liberties has been successful.
The Police Department is being investigated by the U.S. attorney's
office in Brooklyn, the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, the
New York state attorney general's office and the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney's office is investigating the
shooting of Amadou Diallo, and the case against the officers
accused of attacking Abner Louima is expected to come to trial
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even the normally unyielding Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has been
forced to acknowledge that there is a ``reality'' that underlies
the concerns of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   But after the investigations are completed and the findings and
recommendations are in, what then? Reforms are coming, no doubt.
But even if they are effective and police misconduct is
substantially reduced, the problem of fighting crime will remain.
And that will require the good faith and mutual cooperation of the
Police Department and the community. It is hard to overstate how
difficult that will be in an atmosphere that is so charged with
mistrust and hostility. The initiative for such an effort will
probably have to come from the very people who are currently
marching, waving placards and offering their wrists up for plastic
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting is often the easy part. Now is a good time for
protest leaders to heed the lesson of James Farmer and start
planning ways to work with a better-behaved Police Department in a
continued crackdown on crime.
</P>
<P>
   There are people anxious to do this. A few weeks after Diallo
was killed, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer met in his
office with more than 100 members of the clergy. They came from all
over the borough and represented a wide variety of denominations
and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Roswell, the spokesman for Ferrer, said: ``The one thing
everybody at the meeting said was: `We could be a resource. But
they're not using us. The police don't even know us. They don't
come and talk to us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roswell said the clergy members wanted to work with the police
not just in the aftermath of the Diallo shooting, but in general.
</P>
<P>
   There are men and women across the city who feel similarly. One
of the unfortunate responses to the protests has been the repeated
suggestion by Giuliani and others that the people angry over police
misconduct have been critical of the entire department. Just the
opposite is true. Nearly everyone has offered words of praise to
the cops who routinely give the city an honest and brave day's
work. And most would like to help those cops.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer, who was arrested with 140 others outside Police
Headquarters Monday, is no more anti-cop than Giuliani. Rep.
Charles Rangel, when he was arrested last week, said, ``Insulting
the men and women who put their lives on the line daily to protect
our lives serves no positive purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters have already made a valuable contribution in the
fight against police brutality and other forms of misconduct. Their
tougher mission is to help craft a long-term fight against crime
while establishing the basis for permanently improved relations
with the police.

HOME CLINIC: FOR WINTER AND SUMMER, TIPS ON ADEQUATE ATTIC
VENTILATION

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good attic ventilation is important because it helps to
dissipate excess heat in the summer, making it easier to cool the
house and lowering energy costs. In the winter, a well-ventilated
attic expels water vapor that would otherwise condense in the
insulation. Proper ventilation also maintains a cold roof in the
winter and prevents the formation of troublesome ice dams.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the value of good attic ventilation has been
recognized only within the last few years, so most homes, even
relatively new ones, may not have good ventilation. Most homeowners
assume that a few vents through the roof will be enough to keep the
attic air circulating, but these may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   To tell if your attic is ventilated properly, first look for
these signs: In the summer, hot air and high temperatures in the
attic are indications that the air is stagnating and the space
needs to be vented. Hold your hand near the vents. You may actually
be able to feel a slight breeze -- an indication that the vents are
pulling air outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter, look carefully to see if moisture is condensing
on the framing members or on the insulation. This will happen when
the attic temperature is low and there is little air circulation.
As warm, moist air leaks into the attic from below, the moisture in
the air will condense on the cold framing unless vents draw it to
the outside.
</P>
<P>
   You can also tell if your attic is too warm by looking at the
roof after a snowstorm. A cold roof will have an even coating of
snow from the ridge to the eaves. If the roof is relatively clear
near the ridge but has snow accumulations near the eaves _
conditions that contribute to the formation of ice dams _ the attic
is holding too much heat and needs to be vented.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to evaluate the efficiency of the attic ventilation
system is by calculating the attic area and comparing it to the
vent area. Start by measuring the attic floor then estimate its
area. Next, measure the openings of the vent holes, including
soffit and roof vents. Determine the area of each then add up the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Most building codes require that there should be a minimum of
one square foot of vent opening for every 300 square feet of attic
floor space. This ratio is generally adequate if you have soffit
vents with other vents positioned in the roof at least three feet
above the attic floor. If your attic does not have vapor barriers,
you may need more vents so the ratio is closer to 1 to 150.
</P>
<P>
   Before adding vents to the attic, consider how attic ventilation
actually works. A good ventilation system requires vents near the
roof peak and also vents closer to the eaves. The warm air in the
rooms below the attic rises through the ceiling and mixes with
attic air that has been heated by the sun- baked roof. This hot air
will eventually escape through the top vents to the outside. Cooler
replacement air flows in through the lower vents to help push the
hot air out.
</P>
<P>
   This recycling air flow is generated by the temperature
differences between the peak and eave areas, but other forces help
the process. Wind currents passing over the roof cause a pressure
drop directly above the roof. This draws the hot attic air up
through the vents and it is replaced by cooler air coming in from
the vents below.
</P>
<P>
   There are different types of vents; rarely will one house have
all types. Soffit vents are positioned in the panels on the
underside of the eaves. Roof vents are positioned directly on the
roof. They have a flange that projects through a hole in the roof
into the attic. Turbine vents are another style of roof vent. They
have a rotating turret that harnesses wind action to draw air from
the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge vents are positioned on the roof peak and extend the
length of the roof. They draw air from the attic through slots cut
into the roof sheathing. Gable vents are positioned in the end
walls of a house, near the roof. They offer a good way to increase
cross ventilation in an attic without altering the roof line.
Cupola vents are small louvered structures on the roof peak. In
addition to increasing ventilation, they can add an architectural
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Next week this column will focus on the procedures for
installing the different types of vents. &QL;

 &HT;    BROAD DOUBTS SURROUND DECISION TO BOMB SERBS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Domestic opposition to the NATO bombing campaign in
the former Yugoslavia was high as the operation began Wednesday,
with opponents raising a wide range of objections.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Americans rally behind the president when he
sends troops into combat, and criticism was muted as the raids
began and Clinton began making his case for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   But in Gallup and ABC News polls released this week before the
bombs began falling, nearly half of Americans opposed using force
to help defend the province of Kosovo against Serbian aggression,
while about the same percentage were in favor.
</P>
<P>
   That lukewarm support would be severely tested by American
casualties. The ABC poll of 534 adults found only 37 percent saying
peace in Kosovo would be worth U.S. lives, and 59 percent saying it
would not.
</P>
<P>
   The dissent raises questions about whether the administration
has abandoned the unwritten rule of the post-Vietnam era: that
troops should go to battle only with clear and obtainable
objectives and the overwhelming backing of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The deep doubts about American intervention were reflected in
comments by leading officials and former officials as the Senate
was debating a resolution authorizing U.S. participation in the
strikes. The measure was approved Tuesday night, 58-41.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major objections:
</P>
<P>
   _ The country has no major stake in the conflict. ``My question
is, where is the vital U.S. national interest?'' said Sen. James M.
Inhofe, R-Okla. Pointing to civil strife and massacres in countries
such as Sudan, Algeria and Angola, he asked, ``Why is there no
outcry for these millions of people who are being brutally murdered
in other places in the world, but we are all concerned about the
humanitarian problems in Kosovo?''
</P>
<P>
   _ The military action will be ineffective. The United States is
in a ``no-win situation'' against President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia, said retired Army Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who served as
national security adviser during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take out his air defense net, no question about that,''
Scowcroft said on CNN. ``We can destroy his air fields. We can
destroy a lot of his military installations.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Scowcroft said, ``we cannot keep him from launching small
unit attacks in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no exit strategy. ``Bombing is no real solution
because there is no long-term strategy in place,'' said Sen. Jeff
Bingaman, R-N.M., a member of the Armed Services Committee. ``No
one knows what the next step will be.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The country could be drawn into a long involvement. ``We all
remember the promises made by the administration about Bosnia,''
said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who added that the president had sent
peacekeeping troops to that Balkan state in 1995 with a promise
that they would be home in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it has been more than three years, more than $14
billion, and there is no end in sight,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United States could damage key relationships. Former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has warned that the bombing will
relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians have been the historic protectors of Serbia,''
Kissinger told CNN's Crossfire. ``I do not believe that Russia has
the capacity to interpose itself militarily. ... But for this I
think we will pay a political price in relations with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   _ There is a threat of major escalation. Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, offered the darkest warnings, telling his Senate
colleagues, ``We're coming close to starting World War III.''

TROUBLE IN PARADISE: THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD IN PALM BEACH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As the Florida sun beats relentlessly on the
perfect palms and spotless thoroughfares, the residents of this
Mediterranean-style mecca are losing their cool over big houses.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, a Palm Beach neighbor of the oil billionaire
David Koch and his wife, Julia, who are gutting a landmark mansion
here (while still renovating the former Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
apartment on Fifth Avenue) filed suit to block them from enclosing
their upstairs porch. The neighbor charged that the second-story
alteration would block his ocean view.
</P>
<P>
   To many Palm Beach inhabitants, the lawsuit is symbolic of the
bad feelings whipping through the banyan trees, as hundreds of
newcomers from the north, younger than ever before, put down roots
in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is the town that used to be known as a place rich
people came to to die,'' said David G. Ober, the chairman of
Sotheby's Southeast, who, with his wife, Polly, is rearing two
teen-agers here. ``But if it was true, it's certainly not true
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, they're coming here to build.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report commissioned by the town, architectural
consultants hired to assess the Big House Problem found that zoning
issues in Palm Beach have become ``increasingly fractious and
divisive, causing citizens to turn against one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The town is faced with a paradoxical demand from citizens,''
they wrote. `` `Don't let them build any more big monster houses,
and don't get in my way when I want to add rooms to my own
house.'''
</P>
<P>
   On a trip from tiny Via Vizcaya up winding Lake Trail, the roar
of giant construction projects punctuates every block: rafters are
rising, and concrete mixers are grinding. Piles of sand and
cast-iron pipes dot yards awaiting new turf; pickup trucks and
painters' vans are parked helter-skelter.
</P>
<P>
   In one yard, workers are hoisting two dozen cast-stone columns
topped with Corinthian capitals with sea horses and shells. They
were trucked in, just as columns were shipped in from Italy during
this town's last heyday _ the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In a town nine miles long and four blocks at its widest, there
are at least 20 houses of more than 10,000 square feet under
construction _ more than at any time since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This island is sinking from the weight of the concrete,'' said
Judith Green, the author of ``Sometimes Paradise,'' a 1987 novel
based in Palm Beach, who has been coming here since she was 19.
``There are people here playing Monopoly _ building the most
conspicuous house just because they can.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also criticized longtime residents who allowed their
mansions to go to seed and to be replaced by new houses built with
new money. Some people, she said, ``run around screaming: `What's
happened to our island?' '' She added, ``Well, they couldn't keep
the place up, could they?''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest houses, rising on ``estate size'' lots (at least one
and a half acres), are almost indistinguishable from the vintage
villas, and that is the point. They are being built by this
decade's heirs and high-tech millionaires, who want that Palm Beach
look: the carved stone curlicues, the Gothic windows, the atriums
and the archways _ but without the tiny bedrooms, and with walk-in
closets and central air-conditioning. One house being constructed,
under a security guard's watchful eye, has windshield wipers on its
ocean-front windows, to wash off the salt spray every day.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Kochs are spending millions to remodel their
ocean-front mansion (the neighbor's suit was dismissed) and to
restore the ballroom by Maurice Fatio, one of the big four
architects of Palm Beach's heyday (along with Addison Mizner,
Marion Syms Wyeth and John Volk), whose work is the rage among the
new cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets away, Agi Rosos and Jacques Hava _ she runs her
family's chemical company in Chicago from here; he works for the
company _ have moved into what she calls a ``cozy little home'' of
8,000 square feet. She said her husband particularly likes the view
through a series of rooms, to their Picasso on the study wall.
Recently, ensconced in his media room, Hava jacked up the Dolby
digital sound on the latest James Bond movie for a visitor, sending
his wife scurrying. ``Other people have bigger home theaters,'' he
said, ``but I have the best one.'' The house is built of coquina
stone, locally quarried rock that looks as if it had been nibbled
away by sea creatures for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Along Lake Worth, which separates the island from the mainland
city of West Palm Beach, Damon Mezzacappa, a vice chairman of
Lazard Freres &AMP; Co, and his wife, Liz, are building a
12,000-square-foot Venetian-style mansion. Estee Lauder's son
Ronald S. Lauder is building behind her ocean-front house.
</P>
<P>
   In January, James H. Clark, the chairman of the Netscape
Communications Corp., paid $11 million for Il Palmetto, a
magnificent (but decrepit) Fatio-designed mansion. Extensive
renovations are de rigueur. Sydell Miller, the retired chairwoman
of Matrix Essentials, the beauty products company, is building a
37,000-square-foot house of stone, repeatedly cited by townsfolk as
too big, too bold and too austere.
</P>
<P>
   Showing off one house under construction, complete with Gothic
arches and minarets, Jeffrey W. Smith, 44, the Palm Beach architect
who has designed many of the new houses, including the Miller
mansion, stopped in his tracks and surveyed his handiwork. ``This
is fantasy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disneyland tries to do it, but they're doing it out of
plastic,'' he said. ``We're doing it in cast stone and stuccoed
clay tiles.''
</P>
<P>
   lorin thinks we still need &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New homeowners, like Mary and Antony Underwood, are arriving
younger and staying longer. The Underwoods, who emigrated from
England with their two daughters, live here eight months of the
year and run their private tour company from Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 census, the most recent, reports that Palm Beach County
was the second-fastest-growing county in the state. For the first
time in years, the number of births was twice the number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   To see the changes, take a drive down Royal Palm Way, the main
road from West Palm Beach. The newly built investment banking
headquarters are staffed increasingly by younger men and women who
were recruited by bank executives. At least four private
kindergartens have sprouted in the last five years in Palm Beach,
where there had been only one. On the block-long Via Mizner, there

   In many ways, Kenneth and Barbara Horowitz typify the new Palm
Beach family. Horowitz, a founder of Cellular One, commutes to New
York two days a week. The couple say they measure the season not in
the old way, by weeks, but in the new way, by the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm Beach is a small town, especially when the snowbirds
leave,'' Mrs. Horowitz said. ``The town employees are exceptionally
considerate, from the garbage collector to the policeman, who ride
their bikes and know our kids by name.'' She paused. ``We spend
most of our time with the other parents, watching our kids play
soccer. I guess you could say we're homebodies.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved from a two-bedroom cottage in Ithaca, N.Y., after
their second child was born. ``I couldn't bear to put on one more
snow suit,'' Mrs. Horowitz said.

Galleria is having a hard time saying goodbye. Not that the owners
of Nicole's Hallmark don't want to close. In fact, they say they've
been trying to leave the mall for a year. But now that the
world-famous mall is a week from closing, the card shop owners say
they've been treated poorly by the mall's managers and are sitting
on thousands of dollars worth of merchandise that they can't sell
because there are no customers at the mall anymore.

PALM BEACH, Fla.: Mrs. Horowitz said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The couple looked at almost 60 properties before buying a 1931
bungalow covered with bougainvillea on a huge lake-front lot. The
house had structural problems, so they tore it down and hired James
Carmo, a young local architect, to design an 18,000-square-foot
Spanish-style hacienda, with stenciled beams, a winding central
staircase _ and a lawn big enough for soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other kids' parents are renovating a big property _ bigger
than this,'' Mrs. Horowitz said. ``We're all trying to be very low
key.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horowitzes live in the north end of town, overlooking what
is still called Lake Worth, although it has long been opened up to
become part of the Intercoastal Waterway. While they have an
estate-size lot, there are hundreds of other, much smaller
100-by-120-foot lots in the neighborhood that worry town officials
and preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Now, preservationists are trying to change the way new houses
sit on these lots _ not only to make them smaller, but also to make
them more interesting, with the courtyards, well-proportioned
details and lush landscaping found in houses by the town's master
architects. In February, the town council voted to change the
zoning on smaller lots. But the changes, up for final passage on
April 5, are minor _ subtracting a foot and a half from some new
downtown houses and slightly reducing cubic footage for new houses
in the north end.
</P>
<P>
   Still worried about the town's architectural future, officials
and the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach, a private group,
have met with Urban Design Associates of Pittsburgh, who helped
plan Celebration, the new Disney town in central Florida. The
consultants have proposed a pattern book _ similar to ones of a
century ago, but with examples of what not to build: blocky
mansions with oversize windows and entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Land prices have doubled here in the last five years, creating
what Polly Anne Earl, the executive director of the foundation,
calls ``a divisiveness between neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One wants to introduce a mansion, another wants to sell to a
developer, another may want to keep the old scale of his house,''
she said. Compliance with a pattern book would be voluntary, but
bonuses _ like the chance to build a wider house _ could be granted
to those who follow the recommendations. The town council has
ordered a detailed study, due in two months.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach, most of the great houses have landmark status,
but that does not prevent the gutting of a historic interior. Only
houses more than 50 years old can be landmarks, but there is some
pressure to lower the age requirement to include 30- or 40-year-old
homes, like those by John Volk, who was still designing in the
1950s and 60s. Many people here also believe that large chunks of
the north end and parts of the town center should be protected
historic districts. But currently, Palm Beach does not have
district designations.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the town didn't need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even five years ago, the architects controlled what was
built,'' said Robert L. Moore, the town's outspoken director of
planning, zoning and building. ``We depended on them to design what
was in context. But now, their clients won't let them. They just
want the biggest house imaginable. And the architects have to go
along with it.''

   Growing Gooseberries
</P>
<P>
   Q. Several years ago, I bought a gooseberry bush. It has grown
and is now a monster with thorns but no gooseberries. I planted it
on a former compost pile (it was originally sickly), so maybe it is
getting too much nitrogen. What should I do to start it going in
the right direction?
</P>
<P>
   A. You may be right that excess nitrogen in the compost pile may
be promoting vegetative growth at the expense of flowers and fruit.
But there is another possible reason: age. Your gooseberry may
still be a juvenile, not yet ready to flower. If so, time will
provide the cure.
</P>
<P>
   Since your gooseberry is now well, this spring, before it begins
to grow, will be a good time to trim it back and move it from the
compost pile emergency room to a more worthy permanent site with
good air circulation and soil rich in organic material. Full sun is
preferred, but gooseberries, unlike other fruits and berries, will
do fine in partial shade. To keep it a reasonable size and at its
most productive, prune out canes more than three years old.
</P>
<P>
   Gooseberries, a member of the same family as currants (Ribes),
are much more popular in Europe than they are here. Many
gooseberries are highly susceptible to the powdery mildew that is
common in the United States. Breeding for disease resistance seems
to be at odds with great flavor, but there are resistant cultivars
(remember, resistant does not mean immune), like Hinnomakis Yellow,
Hinnomakis Red, Oregon Champion and Achilles, that produce great
fruit, sweet and juicy, not puckery and tough.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans don't realize just how tasty, or how beautiful,
gooseberries can be: light green, red, reddish-purple or golden
yellow. But even the best gooseberries are a risk. They flower so
early that in some years there may not be any bees around, or the
flowers may be killed by a late frost, reducing the harvest,
sometimes to nothing. Still, it's a reasonable price to pay for the
pleasure of fresh gooseberries and of pies, jams and gooseberry
fool.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, the federal government banned gooseberries
and currants because they are the hosts to white pine blister rust,
a devastating disease. The federal ban on gooseberries was lifted
in 1966, but they are still forbidden berries in some states and
counties. Check with your local cooperative extension office to see
if that gooseberry is an outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   A wide variety of gooseberries are available from Oregon Exotics
Rare Fruit Nursery, 1065 Messinger Road, Grants Pass, Ore. 97527,
(541) 846- 7578, catalog $4, and from Southmeadow Fruit Gardens, PO
Box 211, Baroda, Mich. 49101, (616) 422-2411, free price list.
</P>
<P>
   Send in the Bulbs
</P>
<P>
   Q. I must have planted at least 100 bulbs last fall, but, alas,
only a handful are sending up shoots. I was extremely careful to
plant the bulbs at the recommended depth. Is there anything I can
do to make sure I have blooms next season? I'm so disappointed to
miss out on my own daffodils, crocuses and tulips.
</P>
<P>
   A. You are simply a little too anxious for spring's peak. If
you've planted Dutch hybrid crocus (Crocus vernus), the
large-flowered ones like Flower Record, Pickwick and Jeanne d'Arc
commonly found in garden centers in the fall, they will continue to
tease you for a while because they are the last crocuses to bloom.
Earlier-blooming species, like C. chrysanthus (Blue Pearl, Cream
Beauty, Ladykiller, Prins Claus and Zwanenburg Bronze) bloom about
three weeks earlier, and C. tommasinianus (Ruby Giant, Whitewell
Purple and others) can be weeks earlier yet.
</P>
<P>
   Your daffodils and tulips will follow the crocuses, but exactly
when depends on whether they are early-, middle- or late-season
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding your anxiety is the fact that newly planted bulbs of
all types generally bloom two to three weeks later the first year
than they will in years to come. You can use this to your advantage
by planting bulbs every fall to extend the following spring's
blooming period.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy Problem
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have had a hanging ivy plant indoors, in a window that gets
quite a bit of light, for a couple of years. It hasn't really
thrived, but it hasn't died either. This plant produces a sticky
substance that creates a crust on the leaves and also falls onto
everything beneath it, especially when it's hot, but to a certain
degree year-round. My guess is that this is some sort of protective
mechanism, but needless to say, the sticky mess it creates is very
annoying. Is there anything I can do?
</P>
<P>
   A. That sticky mess, called honeydew, is not a protective
mechanism, and it's not even coming from the plant. It is _ how to
be delicate here? _ sap from the ivy that has not been entirely
digested. The culprits are soft brown scale insects, common on many
houseplants. They are quite small, and as adults they form a
flattish, yellow-brown oval, scalelike covering. Look for them on
the undersides of the leaves, along the midrib and on the stems.
They are good at hiding, very nondescript, mostly just sitting
there quietly, so look carefully, using a small magnifying lens.
</P>
<P>
   Juveniles, or crawlers, are even smaller than adults. They move
about, looking for a place to settle down, and are more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? If the ivy is that encrusted, I'd throw it out, buy
another plant, and check it now and then for pests. If you prefer,
crawlers and adults can be killed with insecticidal soap. Apply it
every two to three days, according to the label, until the insects
are gone. Or you can remove them one at a time, on an otherwise
boring evening, with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Because he hates what Slobodan Milosevic
has done to Yugoslavia, Milanko Zablacanski, a prominent actor
here, quit his well-paid job with state-controlled television three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because he wants a democratic way out of his nation's decade-old
cycle of ethnic conflict, gangster economics and deepening poverty,
Zablacanski joined the tens of thousands of Serbs who protested in
the streets of this capital for more than three months in late 1996
and 1997, demanding that Milosevic resign. He was with the noisy
crowds who compared the Serb leader to Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Just before NATO bombed Yugoslavia on Wednesday, however, the
actor said that he was honor bound to support a leader he loathes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to support Milosevic now. All the protests are now
absolutely unimportant because the West is soon to bomb my country.
This will make Milosevic stronger,'' Zablacanski said, echoing the
views of many well-educated and accomplished Serbs who have
struggled for years in an effort to try to end Milosevic's control
of what remains of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it seems, Milosevic is gaining short-term political
capital from a policy that, while it may seem self-immolating to
outsiders, plugs into profound feelings of victimization and
historical injustice among Serbs, feelings that animate both rural
farmers and Belgrade sophisticates.
</P>
<P>
   This nationalist wagon-circling _ a phenomenon that has been
provoked and amplified by shrewd manipulation of state radio and
television _ occurred to a limited degree in the first half of this
decade during wars in the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a dominant theme throughout most of the last year,
as violence erupted in Kosovo, a province in Yugoslavia that many
Serbs regard as their Jerusalem but where 9 of 10 people are ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   And with Western powers beginning what has been advertised by
the West as a major bombing campaign against military targets
across Serbia, it is happening again, even among Serbs who say they
know that Milosevic has behaved in a way deserving of being bombed.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind this wagon-circling on behalf of a largely
unloved leader derives from a toxic admixture of prideful Serbian
history and relentlessly misleading propaganda by the
state-controlled electronic press.
</P>
<P>
   As a piece of real estate, Kosovo is fundamentally different in
the minds of many Serbs from both Croatia and Bosnia. Quite unlike
both of those former members of the Yugoslav federation, Kosovo is
a treasured part of Serbian tradition. Obsessive popular attention
is paid in Milosevic's Serbia to a glorious and failed medieval
battle by Serbs in Kosovo against the Ottoman Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West has no idea what Kosovo means to the Serbian
people,'' said Zablacanski.

 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia: said Zablacanski. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zablacanski said the presence of NATO troops in Kosovo, even as
peacekeepers, is an unwarranted and unjustified instance of
foreigners interfering in business they do not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Scottish people wanted to separate from the United
Kingdom, would the West bomb to help Scotland become independent?
Of course not,'' the actor said.
</P>
<P>
   State-controlled television and radio, the only mass media that
most Serbs see or hear on a regular basis, fuel these sentiments
several times a day. Most people here, even many members of the
intelligentsia, do not see the television pictures of Serbian
police and Yugoslav Army forces burning villages in Kosovo that are
routine evening news fare in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The propaganda machine functioned in the same way during the
Bosnian war. Between 1993 and 1995, foreign correspondents who
witnessed the shelling of civilians in Sarajevo by Serbian
artillery would often draw incredulous stares from well-meaning and
well-educated Serbs if they spoke of the bloodshed they witnessed
in the Bosnian capital. People here said then that there must be
some mistake. They said they simply could not believe such
anti-Serb lies.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Kosovo has been sold in Milosevic's media as a
strong, but measured response to Albanian separatist terrorism. The
NATO bombing, in the same way, has been sold as foreign
intervention by a hugely powerful and arrogant Western powers
against outnumbered but courageous Serbs. Many people in Belgrade,
even those with the highest levels of education, seem to be buying
much of this argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, Milosevic can say after the bombing that he tried,
that he put up a fight,'' said Ivan Vujacic, a former member of the
federal parliament and an outspoken opposition figure. ``The
opposition cannot win in wars or chaos. We have nothing to do. No
where in world has an opposition party, even in a democratic
country, won anything during time of war. There is no way.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's political survival has depended on a seemingly
endless succession of losing fights. While losing wars, he has won
elections that outside observers said were more or less fair. His
political stability, although severely tested by failure in Croatia
and Bosnia, did not begin to weaken him substantially until after
those conflicts ended and international sanctions were eased.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here say it was then, in late 1996, that Serbs had
their first chance to question why state pensions were being paid
late, why the economy was in a free fall, why gangsters were taking
over Belgrade businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a real crisis, it pushes Serbia into an
existential debate,'' said Ivan Vejvoda, executive director of the
Fund for an Open Society, a pro-democracy group backed by the
financier George Soros that supports independent news media.
``People will then ignore the crumbling city and the lack of money.
Milosevic knows that. He is scared of normal economics. That is why
he is a crisis-monger.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trouble triggered by a sustained bombing of the Yugoslav
military machine, however, is likely to be substantially more
destabilizing for Milosevic than wars in distant republics,
according to some opposition figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the very short-term, the bombing will make him stronger,
but after a couple of weeks I believe that there will some kind of
anarchy and military forces in Serbia could split,'' said Zoram
Osdojic, a political analyst and former director of an opposition
television station in Belgrade that has been taken over by the
Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   During daylight hours on Wednesday this city seemed numb in
anticipation of NATO bombing. Serbs who said the only honorable
choice was to support Milosevic sounded miserable in their
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I have to do now?'' said Zablacanski, the actor.
He was scouring Belgrade on a shopping mission in anticipation of
the bombing. ``I have to go somewhere and buy some condensed milk
for my two sons.''

<P>
   A picture frame, usually the final fillip, the last deft
gesture, is many things to many people.
</P>
<P>
   Degas called the frame the reward for the artist. Picasso and
Matisse shopped flea markets for frames, paid the equivalent of $5
for 17th- and 18th-century gilded frames, then made paintings to
 &UR; fit &LR;  the frames. Monet, too, liked to see his paintings in
18th-century French frames. ``It meant that people could afford the
frames,'' said Laurence Kanter, curator of the Robert Lehman
Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 20th century, Marsden Hartley and John Marin, who
had little money, bought simple wood frames and painted them to
match their paintings, said Eli Wilner, a custom framer in New
York. In the mid 1950s, some Abstract Expressionists chose a
no-frame look, and in the '70s, thin frames, either metal or wood,
were popular.
</P>
<P>
   Framing a picture can be daunting. There is the wealth of
materials _ the rosy warmth of gilt, the gleam of silver, the charm
of carved wood. Colors are infinite, too, as are prices. But
choosing a frame for an Old Master, a vintage family photo, a quilt
or a snapshot taken yesterday, is really an exercise in visual
thinking. And although framers and curators insist that there are
no rules, the experts can suggest ways to think about framing an
object.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of a frame,'' wrote Nicholas Penny, Clore curator
of Renaissance painting at the National Gallery in London and
author of ``Frames'' (National Gallery Publications, 1997), is to
make a proper impression even when the picture is not looked at
``but simply `taken in' with the silk of a lampshade, the rosewood
of a piano and the porcelain of a teacup.'' A frame has its own
presence _ opulent or unadorned, showy or subtle. Think of it as
the bridge between the art and the interior of the home.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a frame was not a subject for discussion:
it was part and parcel of a painting. Until the 15th century,
artists painted on plaster, stone or wood, where the frame was
integral to the work. When an artist painted on a wood panel, the
frame was attached to the panel, and the entire panel was given to
the artist. In the 15th century, artists began to paint on canvas,
and the frame became detached.
</P>
<P>
   Because frames are so often a matter of fashion, it is a fallacy
to assume that a painting should be matched to a frame of the same
era. Listen to Kanter describe an imagined journey of a Titian
across three centuries: ``If King Philip IV of Spain had it, he put
it in a Spanish frame. If 50 years later, it went to England, it
went into an English frame, and if the Englishman had to sell it to
pay off his debts and sold it to an American millionaire, he'd put
it into a 18th-century French frame.'' Matching a painting with a
period frame is strictly a modern idea, he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes an artist offers framing clues. ``If an artist wants a
particular look _ a steel frame or a width of mat _ you go with
it,'' said Peter Perez, the conservation framer at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York. For a 1997 show at the Staley-Wise Gallery
in New York, David LaChapelle exhibited color photographs of models
in intricately designed, fantastical sets. The narrow wood frames,
painted brilliant shades of pink, red and green, were equally high
voltage. For a show at the gallery in November, his sets will be
simpler, and he has chosen understated chrome frames.
</P>
<P>
   When the artist's intent is unknown or impossible (or too
expensive) to realize, the art, by itself, will begin to speak to
the framer. Consider posters, for example. Perez often uses
aluminum frames, cool and minimal, for new posters, and wood frames
for 19th-century ones. For older posters, welded aluminum is too
shiny, too stark a contrast to paper that has darkened over a
century. For architectural renderings, he would use aluminum for
the drawings of Mies van der Rohe, matching modernism to modernism,
but for Frank Lloyd Wright, whose houses were designed to merge
with nature, he would choose wood.
</P>
<P>
   At J. Pocker &AMP; Son, a New York frame shop whose clients include
interior designers like Keith Irvine and Thomas Fleming, the issue
isn't necessarily the art. ``We talk furniture, furniture,
furniture,'' said firm president Robyn Pocker. ``Empire, Colonial,
Biedermeier.''
</P>
<P>
   If asked to frame a botanical print of a hydrangea for a room
filled with Biedermeier furniture, Ms. Pocker might use bird's-eye
maple veneer with black trim. If the house was Colonial, she might
suggest a blond wood frame.
</P>
<P>
   Once a frame is chosen, there is the question of selecting a
mat, the spacer that separates the art from the frame and from the
glass. ``If moisture gets in under the glass,'' Perez explained,
``art will stick to the glazing, and if the glazing breaks, the
photo is gone.'' A spacer can be nearly invisible, like
1/8-of-an-inch-thick strip of plastic, or it can be prominent, like
a thick, 6-inch-wide paper border. Framers recommend mats of 100
percent rag board made from natural fibers. Acids in chemically
treated paper can leach into artwork and leave brown spots, Ms.
Pocker said.
</P>
<P>
   A mat also gives the art breathing space. Art that goes to the
edge of the frame can look tight and cramped. When a 6-by-6-inch
photograph is surrounded by a 6-inch-wide mat, the photograph
appears to ``float in its own space,'' Ms. Pocker said. If the same
photo was framed with a narrower mat, it might get lost on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But not every picture needs a mat _ and sometimes barely a
frame. At the Museum of Modern Art, Perez stood in front of Roy
Lichtenstein's 10-by-14-foot painting ``Interior With Mobile.'' A
1/2-inch-wide, 3-inch deep, maple L-frame unobtrusively surrounds
it and protects the edges. ``This painting is so big that a strong
frame is superfluous,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about art without the capital A? The gently faded
photograph of grandma and grandpa at their wedding in 1928, the
background sepia toned, the picture frayed at the edges. A baby's
first birthday, the dimpled face smeared with vanilla ice cream and
crumbs of chocolate cake. A three-dimensional object like great
grandma's rosary. A small hand-hooked rug of a horse cavorting in a
meadow.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Malce and Jolie Kelter, antiques dealers who work out of
their house in New York's Greenwich Village, know when an object
needs framing and whether or not to do it professionally (spend
some money) or whimsically (spend a little bit of money). They are
reluctant framers of textiles like rugs and quilts. ``I like quilts
on beds, and I like rugs on floors,'' Malce said. Only when they
are ``very tender,'' as he says _ when it is a matter of wear and
tear _ does he suggest putting textiles on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If a textile is fragile, it should be given to a professional
framer, who also does restoration. The framer will stitch it onto a
piece of fabric, stretch it on a wood frame, and sometimes insert
it in an acrylic vitrine or box designed to filter ultra-violet
rays and protect the textile from dust. A box gives a
three-dimensional object more presence than if it's just hung
against the wall, Ms. Kelter said.
</P>
<P>
   When a collection is family photographs, scattered across
decades and ranging from sepia-toned pictures to Polaroids, Ms.
Kelter likes to connect them by texture. On her mantelpiece, she
has family photos in antique velvet frames, souvenirs of flea
markets. The velvet is slightly worn, purples fading to lavender,
burgundies to dark pink, but they unify the collection. Sometimes,
she uses large frames whose sheer size or extravagance says, ``Look
at me.'' She framed a portrait of herself by Dan Basen, a New York
artist who died in 1970, in an intricately carved tramp-art
rectangle, all dark and pointy. A collage of a photograph of Rocco
Malce, Malce's son, that incorporates Victorian decoupage is set in
an oval mahogany frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``An elaborate frame gives it good attention,'' Ms. Kelter said.
It is also whimsical. It can give import to a snapshot of Fred, the
family cocker spaniel.
</P>
<P>
   Perez offered a final thought: When you look at a painting, what
is it that you remember?
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be the frame.

 Charlton Heston promotes Missouri's concealed-carry proposal  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Actor Charlton Heston flew into Missouri's
two largest cities Tuesday for a whirlwind promotion urging
Missourians to vote yes for a concealed-weapons law, Proposition B,
on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, president of the National Rifle Association, spoke in
favor of the measure, saying it would support the constitutional
right people have to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at Downtown Airport in front of a sign that read,
``Honest Citizens Deserve the Right,'' Heston began his speech by
quoting Missouri's state motto, which translates from Latin into
``Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law.''
</P>
<P>
   About 450 people waited his arrival, crowding behind a velvet
rope. Like the parting of the Red Sea, the rope split the crowd
down the middle to allow photographers and news crews clear shots
of the man who once played Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd sported Proposition B signs and buttons and
wielded flash and video cameras. At least one woman held a
handwritten sign that read: ``Moses for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston's visit was sponsored by the NRA and the Missourians
Against Crime. He made a morning visit to St. Louis before speaking
at Kansas City's Downtown Airport. Also speaking were Wayne
Lapierre, executive vice president of the NRA, and Jim Baker, the
group's legislative affairs executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, in his 70s, walked with measured steps and a slight
stoop. He flashed his movie-star grin and thanked the audience for
being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to deter crime is to allow lawful citizens to
carry handguns,'' he said. ``Right-to-carry creates a climate of
uncertainty. In a world where the wolves can't tell the lions from
the sheep, the entire flock is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long event brought a show of solidarity from law
officers from nearby Missouri counties who support the bill. After
his speech, Heston stepped down and shook the hands of the two
dozen law officers to his right.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the airport terminal was at least one protester, Col.
Fred Mills, retired superintendent from the Missouri Highway
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sadly disappointed in this NRA road show, especially when
they're trying to make this into a Second Amendment right,'' he
said. ``Heston is a fine actor, but as a person, I'm disappointed
in his real life role: participating in a multi-million dollar
campaign where he's going around Missouri trying to deceive
Missourians on what this issue is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a narrowly focused issue against carrying guns
into our public places....If Proposition B doesn't pass, it won't
change the United States Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Fitzgerald, spokeswoman for the Safe Schools and Workplaces
Committee, agreed that Heston's arguments exaggerate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA is trying very hard to paint this debate into one
about rights in the Second Amendment,'' she said. ``This is not
about the right to have a gun. No one will lose their gun over
Proposition B. It's about whether we want every Tom, Dick and Harry
to carry weapons into our community.''

`THE SOPRANOS' MOB FAMILY POTION CAN BE ADDICTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone in therapy talks about mom, but Tony Soprano has a
unique family problem. ``What do you think?'' he asks, outraged at
his psychiatrist's suggestion. ``My mother tried to have me whacked
'cause I put her in a nursing home?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. In ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's brilliantly nuanced
series about a suburban New Jersey mob boss in emotional crisis,
the psychiatrist is helping Tony cope with this breakthrough: in
the Sopranos' world you truly can't trust your own mother.
</P>
<P>
   When the series began, Mama Livia Soprano was an irascible old
woman, addled and comic enough to hit her best friend accidentally
with a car. By the time Tony asks that question in the season
finale (to be shown on April 4), she has come to resemble a
maternal figure with roots in Greek tragedy and even Roman history.
</P>
<P>
   Her name should have been a clue from the start. An earlier
Livia was the Emperor Claudius' ruthless, scheming grandmother
(embodied by Sian Phillips in the mini-series ``I, Claudius'').
Both Livias are matriarchs who know how to play a bloody family
power game.
</P>
<P>
   Livia Soprano's darkening character is simply one strand in the
complex web of ``The Sopranos,'' which has become more absorbing
and richer at every turn. The series has pulled off an almost
impossible feat: it is an ambitious artistic success, the best show
of this year and many others; it has also become an addictive
audience-pleaser, the rare show viewers actually talk and get
excited about.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Marchand, who at first seemed unconvincing as the typical
Italian mother, has turned Livia into a singular character. Tony
was always more than the easy joke about a modern mobster on
Prozac, stressed out by the demands of the job. James Gandolfini
plays Tony with a deftness that masks the heft of a tragic hero,
with flaws that might make him hateful and a visible soul that
evokes sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Such depth helps explain why ``The Sopranos'' belongs among the
classic miniseries. In its leisurely use of the form, it is
strangely like ``Brideshead Revisited,'' ``The Singing Detective''
and ``I, Claudius'' (whose historical figures have often been
compared to a modern Mafia family).
</P>
<P>
   Because the end of this 13-week series was always in sight, it
could develop the self-enclosed dramatic tension of a feature film:
in the end, would his Uncle Junior take out a hit on Tony in a move
to control the family business, or vice versa? Yet it also took the
time to create ambiguous characters and the feel of a world through
dozens of impeccable small touches.
</P>
<P>
   With its flashy characters and human depths, ``The Sopranos''
suggests how thoroughly the Mafia wise guy has become ingrained in
American culture, the stuff of both family tragedy and satire.
Physically, Tony displays the trappings of a cliche. Overweight
with a receding hairline, he wears a jogging suit, gold bracelet
and pinky ring.
</P>
<P>
   He is a killer. Yet as he frets about his children's education,
about whether to put his mother in a nursing home, or about whether
an old friend has worn a wire for the FBI and has to be killed, his
emotional pain is real.
</P>
<P>
   Tony is the mobster as a suburban family man (with bimbo
girlfriends on the side) but also as a sensitive '90s guy who
wasn't loved enough as a child. Emphatically middle-class, he is
like one of your neighbors but with a more dangerous job; that
strategy allows viewers to sympathize and experience vicarious
danger at once.
</P>
<P>
   David Chase, its creator, is largely responsible for ``The
Sopranos,'' but the series' dual essence has been captured most
succinctly in an unlikely place: a tag line created by an
advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows Tony with his mob contacts on one side and his
mother, wife and two children on the other; the line reads, ``If
one family doesn't kill him, the other one will.'' There is no
better statement of the way the two sides of Tony's life converge
to give the series its suspense and emotional power.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest episodes only hinted at how rich and tangled its
themes would become. The turning point came in Episode 5, when Tony
took his daughter, Meadow, to tour New England colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Riding in the car, she asks him if he's in the Mafia; at first
he denies such a thing exists, then admits that maybe some aspects
of his business, ostensibly garbage hauling, are not entirely
legal. It is a surprisingly touching conversation, a moment of
painful honesty in which the father admits his imperfections and
viewers sympathize with his paternal emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while driving Meadow around, he happens to spot a man who
once ratted on the mob, then foolishly left the witness protection
program. While his daughter is talking to a counselor at Colby
College, Tony tracks down the man and garrotes him on camera.
Without destroying sympathy for Tony, the series rubs viewers'
faces in the fact that he is a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   That on-camera violence, so crucial to the audience's complex,
visceral response, is one reason ``The Sopranos'' could only appear
on cable. On network television, his character would surely be
sanitized, the violence toned down, the ambiguity cleared up and
the entire series diminished. The brilliance of ``The Sopranos''
depends on the trick of letting us see Tony's worst qualities and
getting us to identify with him anyway.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a later episode, his psychiatrist, Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine
Bracco), mentions her patient to her ex-husband, who warns:
``Finally, you're going to get beyond psychology with its cheery
moral relativism. Finally you're going to get to good and evil, and
he's evil.''
</P>
<P>
   But that voice, from an incidental character, sounds like a
disclaimer. It is out of step with the experience of watching ``The
Sopranos,'' which is gripping because it is so fraught with moral
relativism.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Melfi remains the weakest link in ``The Sopranos,'' perhaps
because she is not truly family. Occasional hints that she will be
drawn into Tony's world (he once had a crooked cop tail her on a
date) have gone nowhere, and she has remained the ultimate
outsider. Viewers, who share Tony's experiences, are more a part of
his family than she is.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, feeling inside a Mafia family has become a cultural
touchstone. There is some logic behind the coincidence that ``The
Sopranos'' shares a premise with the current hit film ``Analyze
This,'' a slight comedy in which Robert De Niro hilariously plays a
mobster who, like Tony, suffers panic attacks and ends up at the
psychiatrist. Psychiatry is common today, and it is irresistibly
funny to imagine a mob boss who is an emotional wreck.
</P>
<P>
   More telling, together these works suggest how deeply Mafia
movies have penetrated American culture. In ``Analyze This,'' De
Niro sends up his own classic roles in films like ``The Godfather,
Part II'' and ``Goodfellas.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Sopranos,'' Tony's men model themselves on movie
mobsters. One man has a car horn that blares out the first bars of
``The Godfather'' theme; another routinely impersonates Al Pacino
as Michael Corleone. Tony's stupidly impulsive nephew, Christopher
(Michael Imperioli), tries to write a screenplay about his mob
experiences and longs for tabloid fame. Frustrated at his
unimportance, Christopher complains that every movie mobster has
his own story arc. ``Where's my arc?'' he says. ``I got no
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony himself is smarter. When he is taken by a neighbor to play
golf at a country club, he is bombarded with questions: ``How real
was `The Godfather?''' and ``Did you ever meet John Gotti?'' He may
be a killer, but viewers feel for him at that moment; he is wounded
at being condescended to and reduced to a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   These '90s mobsters, after all, are a generation removed from
the movies that inspired them. ``The Sopranos'' knowingly hits
cultural nerves by responding to the present moment. Meadow reveals
the truth about their father's business to her younger brother,
Anthony, by showing him a Web site that features pictures of mob
bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Uncle Jackie!'' says Anthony as he spots one of his
father's best friends. (``The Sopranos'' has its own place on HBO's
Web site, which includes a section on the rock-inspired music that
is so integral to its realistic feel.)
</P>
<P>
   In the next-to-last episode (this Sunday) Tony becomes so
depressed he can't get out of bed. Even in this crisis, the series
maintains its focus on the credible details of ordinary life.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's wife, Carmela, is perfectly played by Edie Falco with a
toughened exterior that suggests how she has had to steel herself
to her husband's profession. Carmela says, ``If you want me I will
be at Paramus Mall getting your son a suit for his first formal.''
</P>
<P>
   One shrewdly drawn plot involves a situation that is absurdly
common in real life but rarely discussed. Carmela has a flirtation
with a priest, Father Phil, who comes to the house for ziti and
movies before safely fleeing back to the church.
</P>
<P>
   The final episode of ``The Sopranos'' reaches a crescendo of
action and intrigue, guilt and retribution. It sets up the story
for the next season, beginning in January. And the cumulative
weight of the previous weeks adds a delicious resonance to
everything Tony says. When he tells a friend whose restaurant he
has ordered set on fire, ``I didn't burn down your restaurant, I
swear on my mother,'' what exactly does he mean?

STUDENT SEEKS TITLE OF HOTTEST ACCORDIONIST IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Take a look at Jason Stephen. The hoop
piercing the 21-year-old's upper ear. The dark, rock 'n' roll
sideburns. The spiked, gelled hair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, take a look at his musical instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Piano keys on one side, constellation of white dots on the
other, pleated bellows in between. That's right, an accordion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the University of Missouri-Kansas City history major
hardly looks like a traditional accordionist, Stephen's hipster
image is a big reason he's a finalist for Hottest Accordionist in
America. The contest begins at noon Thursday in Branson, at the
Lawrence Welk Champagne Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much a contest for the past generation of players,
such as The Lawrence Welk Show's own Myron Floren (who will be one
of the judges) as for the next generation. Organizers hope people
like Stephen will appeal to younger music fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showmanship is the key to this contest,'' Stephen explained.
``It won't matter how good you are. It's going to be how you sell
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Stephen can play. Last summer, at the American
Accordionists Association's national competition in Louisiana, he
took first place in three categories.
</P>
<P>
   But his play, as much as his appearance, defies the stereotype
of the player who wanders between tables at an Italian restaurant
or whips up a dandy polka at weddings. For instance, in winning the
contest last summer he played a French jazz piece, variations on
``Dark Eyes'' and a tango.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all `Lady of Spain','' he said. ``I really believe
that Bach sounds better on an accordion than on any other
instrument, but I also like to play hip-hop, swing, rock 'n'
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   He started playing in first grade back in New Hampshire, when
his teacher passed out coupons for free accordion lessons at a
local music studio. At the end of the free month, he convinced his
parents he wanted to continue. By eighth grade, he had started
winning contests. And in high school he earned pizza money by
playing at retirement homes.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he takes six hours of accordion classes a semester
at UMKC, which has a national reputation for teaching the
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   And his play has made an impression. Dan Lennon, organizer of
the hottest accordionist contest, says Stephen is the most
classically trained of the finalists. Lennon, brother of the famed
Lennon Sisters, explained: ``There are hundreds of excellent,
talented accordionists in America. Always have been, probably
always will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we're looking for here is an entertainer. Sure, he
has to be able to play. But he also has to be able to get a crowd
on its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner will walk away with a trophy topped by a gold
accordion, the chance to play and record at the theater this summer
and a title that Jay Leno has already been making jokes about.
(Jay's line: ``The Lawrence Welk Theatre is searching for the
hottest accordionist on Earth. I hear their main concern is that
the search may never end.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Lennon noted that simply being chosen as one of the five
finalists was an honor. More than 150 players sent videotapes of
their work. Those not chosen ranged from a Northern Alaskan who
used the accordion to accompany his recitation on the meaning of
life to a man who was accompanying the Mexico City symphony
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists include a New York chanteuse, rock 'n'
rollers from New Jersey and California and a Cajun-style player
from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen, when he's not squeezing sounds out of his black box,
spends his days reading up on ancient Greek siege weapons.
Alexander the Great, he explains, conquered what was then the known
world partly because others weren't ready for his new approaches to
warfare. Stephen has translated that history lesson to his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opening is a secret,'' he said, smiling. ``But you know, if
this goes like I hope _ and I've spent a lot of time thinking about
this _ when I walk onto that stage, people's mouths are going to
drop open, because I'm going to be doing stuff they've never seen,
or dreamed they could see, on an accordion.''

<P>
   Just who exactly was Jay Lovestone anyway? As Ted Morgan reports
in his fascinating new biography, he was asked that question often
while writing ``A Covert Life: Jay Lovestone, Communist,
Anti-Communist and Spymaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of those few who remembered him,'' Morgan writes, ``fewer
still knew why he was worth remembering: `Boss of the American
Communist Party, wasn't he?' `Expelled by Stalin, as I recall.'
`Started his own party, what were they called, the Lovestoneites?'
`Handled foreign affairs for George Meany in the AF of L.'
`Something to do with the CIA, under the cover of the labor
movement.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Morgan goes on to point out, Lovestone was ``a Zelig-like
figure'' who kept showing up in the most unlikely places. For
instance, that was Lovestone, a teen-ager still named Jacob
Liebstein, who boxed for prize money on Bronx tenement roofs around
1910. That was Lovestone interviewing Stalin for an hour in the
Kremlin in May 1927.
</P>
<P>
   That was Lovestone learning to tie trout flies in the 1950s from
James Jesus Angleton, head of the Central Intelligence Agency's
counterintelligence division, and also making love to Louise Page
Morris, a former Powers model who became the American Mata Hari.
</P>
<P>
   That was Lovestone who gave President John F. Kennedy the line
``I am a Berliner'' in Berlin in June 1963. (Actually, writes
Morgan, he told Kennedy to say ``I too am a Berliner,'' which by
referring to other people would have avoided the double-entendre in
German, ``I am a jelly doughnut,'' but Kennedy couldn't pronounce
the German word for ``too.'') That was Lovestone having lunch with
Daniel Patrick Moynihan at the Century Club in 1976, urging the U.
S. representative at the United Nations to seek the nomination for
senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   If Lovestone resembled Zelig, it was not from a desire to efface
himself but rather because he liked to work behind the scenes. As
Victor Reuther, one of his rivals in the labor movement, said of
him: ``If Jay was invited somewhere, he would come in through the
transom even if the front door was open. He loved to be
conspiratorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, he was contentious, strong-willed and
ideological. ``I may be wrong but I'm never in doubt,'' he liked to
say. That lack of doubt imbued him early in his life with the
Socialist ideas that so many immigrant Russian Jews brought from
their struggle with czarist injustice. Intense study led him to
Communism, whose American party he headed by age 29.
</P>
<P>
   But in challenging Stalin's view that American capitalism was on
the brink of collapse in 1929, he failed to see that whatever
Stalin dictated through the Comintern had little to do with reality
but instead depended on the twists and turns of the battle to
succeed Lenin. Once Lovestone caught on he found himself purged
from the party and out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin's subsequent execution of his rivals and his elimination
during the Spanish Civil War of local groups that stood in the way
of a regime controlled by Moscow completed Lovestone's
disillusionment. He became as devout an anti-Communist as he had
once been a worshiper.
</P>
<P>
   Linking himself to the trade union movement, he got himself
picked by George Meany, the head of the American Federation of
Labor, to run his foreign affairs division. This led to undercover
work for the CIA, where he reported secretly to Angleton. For the
rest of his long career he devoted himself single-mindedly to
fighting Communism's advances throughout the world. In November
1954, Pageant magazine pronounced Lovestone, along with the likes
of J. Edgar Hoover and Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen, one of the top
anti-Communists in America.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, whose previous six books include biographies of W.
Somerset Maugham, Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and
William S. Burroughs, is by turns admiring of and delighted with
his subject. He writes stirringly of Lovestone's career as a
Communist, making especially vivid the complex factional battles he
fought in the 1920s and '30s. He credits Lovestone's campaign for
free trade unions in postwar Germany, France and Italy with having
saved Western Europe from falling under Soviet influence.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter two-thirds of his book, he pauses frequently to
portray some of the more exotic people Lovestone conspired with,
made love to, railed against or outraged. All the while, Hoover's
minions kept investigating him. It took them seven years to grasp
that he was spying against the Communists, not for them.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often Morgan strikes a wrong note. He titles his first
chapter ``The Blond Beast,'' because Lovestone happened to be
flaxen-haired and blue-eyed and was billed when he boxed as ``The
Blond Bum'' or ``The Blond Jew,'' none of which would seem to
justify evoking the figure of the notorious Nazi Reinhard (Blond
Beast) Heydrich.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the death of a CIA figure known as ``the
Grasshopper,'' because he was ``always hopping around the globe,''
Morgan writes a shade callously: ``In 1972, on a British Airways
flight from London to Brussels, he hopped his last. His plane
crashed on takeoff at Heathrow.'' You would never know from reading
``A Covert Life'' that the Bert Wolfe who was Love-stone's early
comrade and later rival is the same Bertram D. Wolfe who wrote the
distinguished account of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin, ``Three Who
Made a Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``A Covert Life'' remains an enlightening and lively
book. It offers a fresh perspective on the 1930s, making you
realize the degree to which the American Communist movement was a
tool of Stalinism, which, if it hadn't been resisted so vigorously,
might have done some of the murderous damage it succeeded in
working in postwar Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On a lighter note, Morgan makes you realize that if you've ever
had trouble grasping precisely what a Lovestoneite was, there's a
good reason. To judge from this biography, a Lovestoneite was
anything from a revolutionary dedicated to the violent overthrow of
capitalism to a believer in free enterprise as the only true
vehicle for the extension of democracy. But to get a true
understanding of what a Lovestoneite is, you must read ``A Covert
Life.''

   PHOENIX - Who would have thought that a column about seeing a
naked lady at the gym would cause such a stir?
</P>
<P>
   Not me for one, but plenty of people wrote me letters. Many of
them were nice (nearly all written by women), but the rest were
real NASTY (nearly all written by men). While I'm sure most nudity
enthusiasts are nice people, the ones I heard from were a roguish
lot, mean critters with poison tongues and boiling blood. For folks
who don't think twice about unveiling themselves in the wide open,
they sure are uptight when someone else has an opinion about
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they didn't know it, each scribe with a poison pen
became a contestant in The Cranky Naked Letter Writer Contest,
including Steve and Nancy, who actually wrote me a letter while
nude, and Don, who pathetically attempted to insult me by
insinuating that I was a latent lesbian and THEN quoted
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The letters were examined and scrutinized with several standards
including: General Idiocy; Complete Disregard for the First
Amendment; Level of Creepiness; Demonstration of Raw Aggression;
Number of Times the Panel of Judges _ me, my friends Godfrey and
Jamie, and my mom _ Burst Out Laughing While Reading It; and,
finally, Creativity.
</P>
<P>
   All contestants received the VOODOO Tweety Bird E-Mail Chain
Letter as a gift, which requires that they pass on the VOODOO
Tweety Bird E-Mail Chain Letter to 100 of their closest friends or
ultimately let karma dictate their cranky fate. Now let's move on

</P>
<P>
   Contestant: Capt. William W. Dials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never written to anyone in the news media in my life, but
your piece just got to me. Are you that hung up on nudity? Filthy?
WOW! You need to see some serious professional help if that is how
you feel. Did you happen to note what year in time you are in?
God's creation, the biggest miracle in the world, is beautiful. Man
invented clothes. And you're ashamed of YOUR OWN SEX no less? WOW!
Filthy? You have some clear hang-ups and they run pretty deep. I
caution you to stay away from beaches because the bikini has
evolved to nearly nothing, in case you hadn't noticed, and it may
cause you to have a complete nervous breakdown. Sheesh. This is
1999 for crying out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges' comments: As you know, Captain Bill, as Judge Godfrey
pointed out, after God made us naked, he also made it necessary for
us to crap, and none of the judges wanted to see you do that,
either. As for your proclamation that it is 1999, you are CORRECT!
And, in light of that, the judges sadly bowed their heads when we
realized that in 1999, some people still have to hear the words
``Knock! Knock!'' before they understand something is a joke. WOW!
Wait, wait _ one of the judges just saw another judge's naked calf
and she's having a nervous breakdown, Captain Bill, just like you
said! Are you psychic? Just kidding! OOPS, sorry, we mean, ``Knock!
Knock!''

First Runner-Up
</P>
<P>
   Entry title: ``I Pity Your Husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: Jack Lundeen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read your article in the Rep this morning and could not help
feeling sorry for you. You have not only lived a very sheltered
life but also one that has led you to endure some horrific
inhibitions. Your Catholic upbringing and slanted ideas from your
mother's point of view are real cause for concern. When you were
going to school, did you never take a shower after gym class or
extracurricular activities? Did you never have youth sleepovers
with your girlfriends in high school?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only pity your husband for what he must have to endure
when it comes to intimacy with you and your ideas about sex. You
should really talk to someone about your feelings before you
embarrass yourself by writing articles like the one I read today.
Maybe you should start writing for the Pope or doing radio work for
the Christian Coalition!
</P>
<P>
   ``Not surprisingly, your e-mail address seems incompatible with
AOL/CompuServe, so I am mailing my comments instead. You need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges' comments: Jack, your paranoia concerning e-mail really
scored points with us, especially in the General Idiocy category.
We wouldn't pick on Laurie's mom if we were you, since she has
nearly 34 years of hand-to-hand, mother-to-child combat experience
under her waistband. Believe us, she'll shut that fresh little
mouth of yours in five seconds flat, and can do it while she's
driving a station wagon (begin ital) and (end ital) wearing
flip-flops. In fact, Laurie's mom mentioned that maybe the letter
writer ``played around too much at his childhood sleepovers. Men do
that. You know, `Mine's bigger than yours,' things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges also wanted to advise you that you asked some very
pointed, personal questions in that letter, questions that you'd be
arrested for if Laurie were under 18. Considering that, you were
the landslide winner in the Creepiness category. Do you know what a
herd of angry Catholics looks like? We have a feeling you're about
to find out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Grand Prize winner
</P>
<P>
   Entry title: ``Oink! Oink! Pigger!''
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: R. Macejak.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are SICK! It is people like you in the world that make it
a perverted, degenerated place to live! God made our bodies and we
should be PROUD of them. It is man who societally changed people
like you into disgusting pigs. MAN made the human body a sick
vehicle of morbid attraction and abuse and shamefulness, and you
suckered right into that!''
</P>
<P>
   Judges' comments: Are you all right, Mr. Macejak? Take a deep
breath. There was only one comment that seemed appropriate enough
for this entry and that was: ``Lithium.'' Judge Jamie needed
clarification that if Laurie (begin ital) did (end ital) want to
take her clothes off in front of strangers and/or see them naked,
she (begin ital) wouldn't (end ital) be a ``disgusting pig''?
</P>
<P>
   So what if Laurie doesn't want to get naked in front of
strangers? How does that really affect you? Judge Godfrey suggested
that perhaps you once had a relationship with a pig that left you
scarred, hurt and vulnerable. Maybe you can hook up with the two
other naked ``winners'' at a bar, slug back a case of Coors Light
and commit a hate crime on a sweater. You can take turns, pull it
apart, row by row.
</P>
<P>
   All of the judges agreed that you should win the grand prize
because you took time out of your busy workday at IBM (as your
e-mail address indicates) to carefully and creatively compose your
thoughts, and because your letter made one of the judges laugh so
hard she tinkled in her pants.

`THE SOPRANOS' IS A CABLE SHOW THE NETWORKS TRULY WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SOPRANOS-MINISERIES-CLASSIC) 
(rk) 
 By   BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' is such a white-hot favorite in the television
industry that network executives are trying to figure out how they
can copy the breakthrough style of the HBO miniseries and perhaps
make up for the mistake several of them made in passing up the show
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the cable show has reached such a fever pitch that
two networks have even approached its production company to inquire
about the possibility of running episodes of ``The Sopranos'' after
they have appeared on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikely, given the show's cable-standard content,
which includes nudity, violence and enough florid street language
to curl a network censor's toes.
</P>
<P>
   But Brad Grey, the executive in charge of Brillstein-Grey
Entertainment, which owns ``The Sopranos,'' said Wednesday, ``The
networks are calling now to ask if they can air the shows we've
done already.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not identify the two networks that made the offer, but
he said, ``It never reached a serious stage because I just said
no.'' He said he doubted the show could have been edited in a way
that wouldn't compromise it creatively.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it is not as if the broadcast networks didn't have a
shot at ``The Sopranos'' the first time around. The show was
developed by the drama department of the Fox network in 1996, but
it never went anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Grey said the pilot script written by the show's creator, David
Chase, ``just came back with a no; we didn't even get any notes
from them.'' Grey said he then ``talked to CBS'' about the show,
but those conversations led nowhere. And, as usually happens with
scripts in Hollywood, word of ``The Sopranos'' drifted around.
</P>
<P>
   One executive who heard about it was David Nevins, the senior
vice president of prime-time series at NBC, who said: ``I had a
shot at it after Fox passed. I thought it was very good. But I
couldn't get anyone else interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the networks are more than interested; they're fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   As Carolyn Ginsburg-Carlson, the senior vice president of comedy
for ABC put it, ``I love the show; it's one of only three or four
shows I make it a point to watch every week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' is already a hit by cable standards, scoring
ratings higher than any cable channel series in the past three
years. In its Sunday night showing, the show is reaching about 3.7
million viewers, and in its four weekly showings it reaches more
than 10 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For the people who make television shows for a living, ``The
Sopranos'' is more than an HBO hit; it is a groundbreaker, a show
whose influence is likely to be felt throughout the industry in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Littlefield, the longtime NBC program chief who is now
scouting for talent to build his new production company, said the
show had prompted the industry to rethink what constitutes ``family
drama'' on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what network television has done with the
family drama, it just made them all dull,'' Littlefield said. ``We
all had blinders on as to how you can present a family on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   So are networks busy developing shows that will try to embrace
the more outrageously creative approach of ``The Sopranos?'' Not
yet, because most of their development was finished before the show
went on in January.
</P>
<P>
   Counting itself lucky in terms of timing, CBS does have a
Mafia-based drama in development. But its antecedent was the movie
``Donnie Brasco,'' not ``The Sopranos.'' And even broadcast
executives disagree on whether the networks could duplicate ``The
Sopranos'' style.
</P>
<P>
   How different is the HBO show now from what the networks saw in
1996? Danielle Clayman, the Fox drama executive who developed the
show (and admits to experiencing a ``personal loss'' over failing
to win support for it at the network) said: ``It's 90 percent the
same. The show's story is the same, but obviously it is spicier now
that it's on HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevins said the original script that he read would have been
evaluated by the network standards department. He added: ``I don't
believe we couldn't do the show on NBC. Content-wise, you could
take a little bit out and get it through.''

 UNDATED: it through.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Roth, a former president of Fox Entertainment who is now
running the Warner Brothers television studio, said, ``I think `The
Sopranos' is makable for a network. It could play on ABC on Sunday
night after `The Practice.'''
</P>
<P>
   That is not how Albrecht sees it. ``The networks would never
have put the show on,'' he said, adding that what Fox developed as
the original script is not the show that so impresses Hollywood
now.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that HBO was willing to take a risk and allow Chase to
direct the pilot himself. Then there was the crucial decision to
allow him to shoot the series on location in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The most important decision HBO made, Albrecht said _ and that
point was seconded by every other executive interviewed for this
article _ was selecting James Gandolfini to play the lead role of
Tony Soprano, the gang leader who is so harassed by business and
family problems (many of which overlap) that he goes into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Even one senior NBC executive, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said: ``If we had done the show, that guy would have
never gotten out of the casting room. He is overweight and balding.
Somebody would have said: `He's no TV star. Get somebody sexy.' And
we would have messed the whole thing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clayman said Fox had planned to use Anthony LaPaglia as
Tony. Even HBO hesitated on Gandolfini, Albrecht said, but only
because there were two other outstanding auditions for the role, by
Steve Van Zandt (best known for his guitar work with Bruce
Springsteen), who now plays a Soprano soldier named Silvio, and
Michael Rispoli, who played Jackie, the gang leader who died of
cancer midway through the season.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a network had taken the risk on Gandolfini, Albrecht
said, other decisions would have rendered the show a pale imitation
of what is on the air now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have tried to do New Jersey in L.A.,'' he said.
``And they would have included commercials. You put in commercials
and you change the dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the money. ``They would try to make this for $1.6
million an episode,'' Albrecht said. ``We're spending $300,000 to
$400,000 more.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield is one executive from the network side who agreed
that ``The Sopranos'' needed all the freedom that HBO provides.
``You can't just take that content and language out,'' he said.
``The content is part of that overall gestalt; it's part of what
surprises you. Those surprises are one reason you don't want to
miss any episode. I'm already wondering what I'm going to do on
Sunday night after next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht would like nothing better than to be able to provide
more episodes of ``The Sopranos'' for its rabid fans. He fears
breaking the show's powerful momentum. But new episodes will not be
back until next January. In July, HBO will repeat the first batch
of 13. And HBO has asked Chase to try to do more than 13 next year.
``I'm hoping for 15 or 16,'' Albrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime the rest of the television business will study
what executives have seen so far and try to take away some lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson is: there's reward in keeping an audience guessing,
keeping them on their toes,'' Nevins said.
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield said: ``I think what it's telling us is that we've
got to think differently when we create shows. But it also reminds
us that the world we live in is both diverse and really
outrageous.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ You never know what you will get with Shapiro and
Smith Dance, the modern dance troupe headed by the husband-and-wife
team of Danial Shapiro and Joanie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, you know what you will not get. At the opening of the
company's run at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night it was obvious
again that pure movement and form for its own sake are never its
concern. ``Shtick,'' a new solo for Shapiro, takes on the angst
behind a comedian's grinning exterior, while ``Notes From a
Seance,'' a mock Gothic romance, zeroes in on fake spiritualists.
</P>
<P>
   Both works are quirky and sharp-witted, and for all their
emotional messages, these messages come through best in Shapiro and
Smith's way with movement.
</P>
<P>
   Each piece, even Shapiro's solo, is jointly credited; and when
they get going, they are very good choreographers. The proof comes
easily in a superb quartet danced to Beethoven's ``Moonlight''
Sonata, in the middle of ``Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tadeusz Majewski as a committed pianist, Mathew Janczewski,
Kelly Drummond Cawthon, Wilson Mendieta and Midori Satoh plunged
deeper and deeper into a series of changing relationships that move
in and out of different dimensions as the movement itself changes.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography unwound itself like a huge unfurling rug with
two couples drawn into a group embrace and then pulled apart with
centrifugal power. The idiom is full of light and springy jumps and
rolls to the floor with never a break.
</P>
<P>
   This fluidity comes in part from the choreographers' training
with Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis. (Both danced in the Louis
company until 1985.) But there is also an eclectic range that
includes the natural rounded look of Isadora Duncan's dances,
exemplified by Ms. Satoh's brilliant performance, and the high
flying leaps and athleticism of the company as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many who came out of formalist training, Ms. Smith and
Shapiro have no trouble telling a story. Whether in these new works
they tell us something we do not know is another matter. But they
have a great gift for making movement shift before our eyes from
one emotional range to another. It is fascinating to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shtick,'' inspired by Borscht Belt comedians, Shapiro is a
cross between Marcel Marceau and a dangling marionette. The solo is
a variation on a familiar theme: the fear behind the public facade
of the star entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   Like Marceau, Shapiro has a mobile face and curly hair, but his
mimetic gestures become incorporated into a twitchy rocking dance,
a collage of movement that matches the word fragments on Scott
Killian's sound score. Happiness is the sound of laughter, and the
solo grows punchier as Henny Youngman's one-liners are delivered on
tape. In all, a penetrating study in agility and fragility.
</P>
<P>
   The theosophist Madame Blavatsky inspired ``Notes From a
Seance,'' which has some of the seriocomic features of Paul
Taylor's ``Night Shade.'' The satire is not always pointed, but in
this tale of gullible seekers of the unknown lies a wider moral
about hypocrisy and human nature.
 &UR;  &LR; The ruling conceit is a fictional letter written by the heroine
portrayed by Susie Bracken to a friend about her life in a
spiritualist commune. Paul Selig, who wrote the text, and Gayton
Scott, the live narrator, have all seen the right movies. Ms. Scott
puts on a hilarious deadpan British accent, and the letter has all
the references to gazebos one could desire.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Scott reads, the words are not illustrated so much as
expanded upon: when she refers to a waltz, men leap in to waltz
music and swing a leg wide behind them. The cast is mainly in
Victorian dressing gowns, and the jokes often work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith as Madame B. walks on water by standing on a divan
that is pushed along. Madame frowns on sex, but her accomplice, the
Professor, portrayed by Shapiro, has a complex duet with Ms.
Cawthon that leaves them suspiciously entangled. Ms. Bracken is
also attached to him, dangling upside down in a clever duet in
which she remains limp.
</P>
<P>
   John Beasant is the victim of a card-reading scam, and his body
becomes amazingly convex as he registers shock and amazement.
Janczewski's nuanced dancing turns a quivering solo into a suicide
image. When Madame B. ``dematerializes,'' as the text says, the
heroine takes over the new Elysium. The other composers heard live
or on tape were Chopin, Killian, Mischa Levitsky and Villa-Lobos.
Sean Murphy did the lighting. ``Notes'' is scattershot, but it
draws you in as a genuine creative effort.

NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Who would have thought that a column
about seeing a naked lady at the gym would cause such a stir? Not
me for one, but plenty of people wrote me letters. Many of them
were nice (nearly all written by women), but the rest were real
NASTY (nearly all written by men). While I'm sure most nudity
enthusiasts are nice people, the ones I heard from were a roguish
lot, mean critters with poison tongues and boiling blood. For folks
who don't think twice about unveiling themselves in the wide open,

nudity. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL;

MAKING BOOKS: TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To recap the battle over the sequel to the sequel of ``Gone With
the Wind'': when last visited in November, negotiations involving
best-selling novelist Pat Conroy, his agents, two book publishers
and the executors who control the rights to the saga were
concluding after nearly two and a half years of complexity and
fury, the literary equivalent of Sherman's siege of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers, like armies, can get bogged down in the marsh of
detail on the way to great victories. In this quaggy struggle,
Conroy apparently had been the winner, and he certainly emerged as
the only one who displayed any wit and audacity: In the book he
proposed, written from the viewpoint of Rhett Butler, there was
even the terrible possibility that he would kill off Scarlett
O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sadly, Conroy is gone with the wind, so to speak, from this
project, having dropped out after nearly three years of numbing
haggling. ``I went through more negotiations with this `Gone With
the Wind' than the Germans did in World War I with all the clauses
at Versailles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, getting back to the right metaphorical war, it seemed easier
maneuvering Lee to Appomattox Court House than realizing closure on
this deal. Conroy walked from the project, he said, because
Margaret Mitchell's literary executors, who are lawyers, wanted him
to pay a good part of their legal fees. ``They wouldn't tell me
what they were or how much, but it could have been $500,000. They
didn't seem to be serious people,'' he said. ``I wanted to do the
book badly, but they didn't want it badly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing his royalty agreement with the executors, Conroy
said, ``I thought that of every dollar I was going to make on the
book, I was giving 60 cents to a dead woman,'' Mitchell, ``and I
thought that was enough to show my good faith in the project.''
Conroy's advance was to come from the $4.5 million that the estate
would receive from St. Martin's Press for the privilege of
publishing another ``GWTW'' spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Anderson Sr., a lawyer and executor, said ``we agreed on
what was to be charged against receipts from the book before the
royalties were divided.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have thought we wanted him to pay all the attorney's
fees,'' he continued. ``We wanted certain attorney fees off the top
before the royalties were divided.'' A misunderstanding difficult
to conceive.
</P>
<P>
   With Conroy in, St. Martin's was gearing up for a great coup.
With Conroy out, St. Martin's is stuck with one of the trickiest
chores a publisher can face: finding the right author for a likely
blockbuster best seller. Moreover, while no one will confirm it,
several people involved in the negotiations indicated that St.
Martin's had but one more chance to find an acceptable author
before the executors are free to look for a new publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Richardson, president and publisher of St. Martin's trade
division, didn't agree or disagree on any of this. She quite
understandably declined to comment at all, as did the agent for the
executors, Owen Laster of the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   So this is a crazily unpredictable moment for everybody involved
with Scarlett O'Hara, except Conroy, and the stakes are high. The
first sequel to Mitchell's epic, ``Scarlett'' (Warner Books, 1991)
by Alexandra Ripley, was a huge commercial success. When St.
Martin's acquired the rights for a second sequel from Mitchell's
literary estate, the house planned to have Emma Tennant, its author
of two Jane Austen sequels, write the sequel to Ms. Ripley's book.
</P>
<P>
   But then Conroy said he wanted to do a ``GWTW'' book, and
everyone except his regular publisher, Nan A. Talese/Doubleday,
said ``Wow!'' or the equivalent. That is, until the executors heard
Conroy's ebullient ideas. Now that he has pulled out, St. Martin's
has to find an equally dazzling writer who can produce a good book
and satisfy the estate.
</P>
<P>
   In the end ``this was not a good deal for Pat,'' said Carolyn
Krupp, Conroy's agent. ``The executors were all over him, and he
doesn't respond well to being told what he can write and what not
to write. The executors said that they would be hands-off, but
still they had to read everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Over at Doubleday, where Nan Talese has her own imprint, it was
a jubilee day when Conroy walked. ``Nobody was happier than Nan,''
said one executive. Ms. Talese vehemently did not want her author
doing a highly visible novel for a competitor, particularly a book
that would take several years to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Now Conroy can get back to working on his next book for Ms.
Talese, nonfiction this time, to be titled ``My Losing Season.'' It
will be a chronicle of the 1966-67 basketball season at the
Citadel, where Conroy played point guard on the team. ``I thought
we had a good team, but we had a bad team,'' the author said.
Whatever, he has found and interviewed the coach and his teammates
and will weave all this into a passage-through-life journey.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, while St. Martin's is trying to keep this
project alive as a high-concept literary work, those with a craving
for the subject can satisfy themselves by buying all sorts of
executor-approved ``GWTW'' odds and ends _ books, Scarlett dolls,
``Frankly, My Dear'' baseball caps, T-shirts, a Mammy fan, musical
and nonmusical wristwatches, etc. _ on the Internet through
www.gwtwmemories.com.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the final word can be left to Conroy's agent, Ms. Krupp:
``If the executors want Scarlett to live forever, they should get
Anne Rice to write it. She'd be a perfect choice. Scarlett could be
a vampire.''

 &HT;    3 Georgians among top philanthropists
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A trio of Georgians are among the 100 most generous
Americans, Worth (April) reports in its third annual listing of
philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   They are media mogul Ted Turner, who ranks 23rd on the list with
total lifetime giving of more than $172 million; Atlanta
conglomerate builder J.B. Fuqua, 46th at more than $85 million; and
Bernard Marcus, chairman of Home Depot, 54th with donations of $72
million.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine doesn't mention Turner's 1997 pledge to donate $1
billion to United Nations causes over a 10-year period. Last year,
Turner's foundation announced it had so far donated $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Billionaire investor George Soros heads the list with charitable
giving of more than $2 billion, Worth says.
</P>
<P>
   As for Microsoft chief Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffett,
who often vie with each other as the richest men in the United
States, Gates ranks 15th with lifetime charity of $196 million,
with Buffett near the end at 90th place with giving of $40
million-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Good ol' boys go North
</P>
<P>
   Stock car racing is no longer the domain of Southern good ol'
boys, but a $2 billion industry quickly finding a national stage,
Fortune (April 12) reports in its cover story.
</P>
<P>
   The Nascar racing organization also may be the hottest marketing
vehicle in sports, with gross sales of more than $1 billion
expected this year for Nascar-sanctioned clothing, die-cast cars
and other race-related products.
</P>
<P>
   Primary sponsors pay from $5 million to $9 million to put their
logos across a car's hood, on the trunk or on the front of the
driver's shirt.
</P>
<P>
   State-of-the-art Nascar racetracks have opened outside the South
in places such as Las Vegas and Los Angeles, with more on the
horizon for Chicago and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Even Donald Trump is scouting the New York City area for a
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   A floor under the market
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (March 29) agrees the Dow Jones industrial average
will close above 10,000, and then some. But the magazine says the
Dow isn't likely to rise as far as fast in the future as it has in
the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is interest rates, which have fallen from as high as
14 percent in the 1980s to current levels just above 5 percent.
That lengthy drop in rates is largely responsible for the bull
market, Business Week says _ but rates can't fall another 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rethinking a merger
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, once synonymous with Wall Street, is now
``looking weary and confused, eclipsed in the marketplace by its
rivals,'' says Forbes (April 5).
</P>
<P>
   The magazine says that's why the New York securities firm is
reconsidering a merger offer from Chase Manhattan Bank _ as a way
to ``regain its glory.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Two enormous flashes filled the sky
shortly after 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Seconds later came the
explosions as the first NATO missiles struck somewhere south of the
city, possibly the airport, or one of the military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later the electricity went off, pitching the city into
blackness.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bright moon, tracer fire from an antiaircraft gun tore
upward into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   A few lone cars roared through the streets, mostly deserted long
before darkness fell. An hour later, ripples of powerful explosions
resounded far off in the distance. Otherwise, Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, lay dark and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The air raid sirens first sounded over the city just after 1
p.m., as a test apparently, but tensions were raised as people
piled into buses to escape the province. Many of those who stayed
behind prepared for a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers cleaned out the stores of basic supplies of sugar,
flour and candles. Long lines of cars formed at gas stations. Buses
pulled out of town, packed with passengers and belongings, heading
for neighboring Macedonia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Still other people were out walking the streets, soaking up the
warm sunny weather.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombing began Wednesday, the war being fought
here _ in villages, from the hills, and along the roads _ was
continuing in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   With airstrikes imminent, army and police units seemed to still
be pressing their offensive against the guerrillas in all parts of
Kosovo and stepped up police activity in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy explosions sounded across the northern part of Kosovo as
Serbian forces continued to shell guerrilla positions on either
side of the Cicavica mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Kosovo, near the main border crossing, the military
was out in force and the village of Gajre, taken by Serbian forces
almost two weeks ago, was on fire, reporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, police officers and army soldiers outside a police station
on the road north out of the city suddenly came under fire in the
mid-morning. The police threw themselves to the ground, rolling
behind a fence for cover as soldiers leapt out of their trucks to
take up firing positions.
</P>
<P>
   An officer in a black mask, worn as much to intimidate as to
obscure his identity, pulled his pistol from his belt and ordered
traffic to move away, fast.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of fire fight between the rebels and the Serb forces
has been occurring almost daily, frequently blocking the main road,
as the guerrillas, positioned on the hills, have kept the police
pinned down with bursts of automatic gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents said they expect the airstrikes to precipitate
still more violence. On Wednesday, armed paramilitaries, a new
sight in this city, drove through the streets in a green jeep.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians say they fear police raids, or a wave of
revenge attacks, while Serbs expect the guerrillas to take
advantage of the bombing, to strike in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``By increasing tension in the towns, the KLA would draw away
police and army from the region of Podujevo and Drenica,'' said
Milivoje Mihajlovic, editor-in-chief of Radio Pristina and of the
Serbian Media Center.
</P>
<P>
   The region of Podujevo and Drenica, where some of the heaviest
shelling and fighting has taken place in the recent offensive, hold
some of the heaviest concentrations of Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   The police were probably taking extra measures in the cities to
forestall any attack, Mihajlovic said. He was also sure that the
military would continue its offensive, as intensively as possible
despite the bombing, to keep pressure on the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas were bound to want to strike at the security
forces while those forces were preoccupied and weakened by the
bombing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the army does not reduce the danger of the KLA, the
continuation of the bombing will increase the danger of the KLA,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we somehow have a war between NATO and Yugoslavia, but we
have forgotten that the major issue is the situation with the
KLA,'' Mihajlovic said. ``Are they going to invade the towns? Are
they going to use NATO as an air force?''
</P>
<P>
   Serb fears may be real but whether the guerrillas are ready to
attack the cities in any sort of coordinated action is arguable.
</P>
<P>
   Although some groups appear to be conducting ambushes on police
units in the city, senior commanders say they cannot take the war
to the cities.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times this week, the general
commander of the KLA, Suleyman Selimi, said the guerrillas'
intentions were purely defensive, and he said they did not want to
target civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA has never killed a child or a civilian, and we are
fighting only their regime,'' he said of the ethnic Serbs in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He, like other commanders, said he wanted NATO troops on the
ground in Kosovo to bring order out of the chaos that most people
in Kosovo think will be the immediate result of the bombing.

MUSIC REVIEW: ZESTFUL VARIATIONS ON BACH'S `GOLDBERG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ It was some party. You half expected old Bach
himself to show up. After all, Christopher Beach, the director of
the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York
here, was summoning ghosts: that of Roger Norrington's
``Experience'' weekends on the campus a decade ago and the hoarier
one of the Pepsico Summerfares directed here by his mentor,
Christopher Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The weekendlong ``Exploration of the `Goldberg' Variations,''
attached for whatever reason to Bach's 314th birthday Sunday, had a
refreshing air of spontaneity. In part it had to, because of the
late cancellation of its keynote performer, Rosalyn Tureck, the
noted Bach pianist and harpsichordist, for medical reasons. But it
may also have represented a last gasp of innocence and local color
before the Bach Year to End All Bach Years (probably not),
commemorating the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in
2000, when the Bach industry takes over.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was well set in a preconcert lecture Friday evening by
Bach scholar Christoph Wolff, who located the ``kernel of truth''
in the famous tale of the variations. In Wolff's reading, Bach did
not write the work for the harpsichordist Johann Gottlieb Goldberg,
who was a mere 14 when it was published, to play for the diversion
of his insomniac patron, Count Hermann Carl von Keyserlingk.
Instead, Bach probably presented a copy of the printed score to
Keyserlingk, with whom he stayed when he visited Dresden, and
Goldberg caught up with it after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Tureck, who recently re-recorded the work on piano for
Deutsche Grammophon, was to have played it on harpsichord. John
Gibbons, the fine Boston harpsichordist, took over on little more
than a day's notice. Despite it all, he refused to play safe with
tempos except, perhaps, in the madly trilling 28th Variation, and
not surprisingly, his performance was a little scattered. But it
was also shapely and insightful.
</P>
<P>
   The variations were performed again, on organ by Anthony Newman
and on piano by Garrick Ohlsson, on Sunday evening. Newman's
performance started late, and he was asked to cut it short, so in
addition to skipping a number of sectional repeats, he indulged his
propensity for haste. The resultant blurring, especially in the
29th Variation, gave the performance a soft-edged feel, contrary to
the clean lines one might expect from the organ. The instrument
also gave the folklike strains running throughout the work and
culminating in the ``Quodlibet'' the unfortunate character of a
militant chorale.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlsson, who performed the work just two months ago in New York,
seems already to have cast it in a more personal light. There was
less sheer virtuosity here, but plenty of that in Beethoven's
``Diabelli'' Variations, which he tossed off to open his program.
Instead he seemed inclined to linger and savor, all with delicious
results.
</P>
<P>
   This listener missed a performance of the variations by string
orchestra on Sunday but caught the New York City Ballet performance
of Jerome Robbins' illuminating mix of musical analysis and
interpretation on Saturday. Here, Cameron Grant had the ungrateful
task of playing the work almost complete on piano at tempos often
seemingly not his own, whether uncomfortably fast or slow. He
performed honorably under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Related events on Saturday included Peter Schickele's delightful
presentation of P.D.Q. Bach's ``Goldbrick'' Variations and
discussion of musical humor; a generally fascinating program of
contemporary variations on the ``Goldberg'' theme by Kenneth
Frazelle, Christopher Rouse, Peter Lieberson, John Corigliano,
Richard Danielpour and Schickele, effectively performed by Marcy
Rosen, a cellist, and Diane Walsh, a pianist, and an evening of
typically compelling jazz stylizations of Bach by the elegant
French pianist Jacques Loussier and his superb trio, including
their first rendition of the ``Goldberg'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   But buried in the middle of it all, on Saturday afternoon, was a
little gem of a recital by Bradley Brookshire, a harpsichordist who
more and more appears to be the rising star on the New York
early-music scene. Brookshire played a fascinating series of
variation works leading up to Bach's masterpiece, as well as a few
items from Bach's own ``Art of Fugue.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the familiar _ Rameau's Gavotte and Variations, and
Handel's ``Harmonious Blacksmith'' _ came rare delights by Dietrich
Buxtehude (``La Capricciosa,'' a model for the ``Goldberg''
Variations, it turns out) and Bernardo Storace. Brookshire played
it all with remarkable technical ease and security. New York needs
to hear more of him, soon and often.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping, too, that Beach will expand his explorations into
other areas. But to judge from the way events ran late and pushed
others even later here, his board of directors should present him
with a stopwatch and a calculator as fond mementos of this one.

A HANDWRITTEN BIBLE WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early eighth century, the Benedictine monks of Wearmouth
and Jarrow in Northumberland, England, copied a monumental Bible,
which they presented to the pope in 716. In 1168, the Benedictines
of San Vito in Pisa created another, paid for by 60 laborers whose
meager donations were dutifully recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at the New York Public Library, an order of
Benedictine monks from Collegeville, Minn., unveiled the first page
of what they call the only handwritten and illuminated Bible to be
commissioned since the advent of the printing press more than 500
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's Abbey, a Benedictine monastery, and its associate,
St. John's University, both in Collegeville, have retained one of
the world's foremost calligraphers, Donald Jackson, to carry out
the project. Jackson, who holds the position of scribe to Her
Majesty Queen Elizabeth's Crown Office at the House of Lords, will
work with a team of artists and theologians to produce 1,150 pages
in seven volumes. The St. John's Bible is expected to be completed
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Its creators say it will be the first handwritten Bible to
interpret and illustrate Scripture from a contemporary perspective,
reflecting a multicultural world and recent strides in science and
technology. The Bible also will incorporate imagery from Eastern
and Western religious traditions as well as some Native American
cultures in the Minnesota area.
</P>
<P>
   The translation used in the Bible is the New Revised Standard
Version, which employs language inclusive of both sexes. For
example, said Brother Dietrich Reinhart, president of St. John's
University, it prefers ``humanity'' to ``man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible will be written at Jackson's scriptorium in Monmouth,
Wales, and at his artist-in-residence studio at St. John's. He has
developed a unique lettering for the Bible that will involve using
goose quills and handmade ink on vellum. His concession to modern
technology is his use of a computer to estimate the number of
letters on a page and other layout details.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible's estimated cost is $3 million, to cover the work of
Jackson and his scribes and craftsmen; materials like vellum,
pigments and gold leaf, and the administrative staff. So far,
$900,000 has been raised, Reinhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from specifications for where the illuminations should
lie, Jackson has been given artistic freedom. ``We don't know a
thing other than what the first page looks like,'' Reinhart said,
referring to the frontispiece, which features a menorah depicting
the genealogy of Jesus as portrayed in the Gospel according to
Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   A collector's edition and eventually a shortened facsimile are
planned, Reinhart said. The university also hopes to create a Web
site where pages will be presented as they are completed. The first
volume, ``The Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles,'' is expected
to appear on Christmas Day in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the calligrapher's Sistine Chapel,'' Jackson said in a
telephone interview from Minnesota. ``I realize now this is the
thing I have been preparing for all of my life.''

 (Eds: Deborah Solomon is the author most recently of ``Utopia
Parkway: The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell.'') 
By DEBORAH SOLOMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I don't know what it says about America that we have
a Yogi Berra Museum &UR;  &LR; but not an Alexander Calder Museum. Maybe
Calder didn't play on the right team. Or maybe the art world needs
better managers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, plans for a Calder Museum are under way, and they
sound inspired. A cross between an artist's studio and a
presidential library, the museum would bring together some 3,000
artworks and almost as many cardboard boxes packed with personal
papers and memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   By now we're so familiar with Calder's light-as-air mobiles that
we tend to take him for granted, but Calder is one of the deities
of American sculpture, and few would deny that his work deserves to
be seen in depth.
</P>
<P>
   Will the museum happen? Alexander S.C. Rower, the artist's
35-year-old grandson and the director of the Calder Foundation, is
having trouble finding a building. He recently made an offer on 2
Columbus Circle, that eccentric porthole-filled edifice owned by
the City of New York, but then so did Donald J. Trump, who wants to
construct a hotel on the site and can offer more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like twisting arms trying to get the city to understand
the benefits of culture,'' Rower said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rower has been flying to Paris to discuss the
museum with French officials, who, he says, keep using adjectives
like ``fantastique'' and suggesting that he relocate to France.
That kind of enthusiasm would help explain why Europe has more than
400 single-artist museums; in this country, there are fewer than
40.
</P>
<P>
   A single-artist museum, as the clunky phrase implies, is a
public institution devoted to the work of one lone artist, and the
tradition has given rise to such universally beloved haunts as the
Musee Picasso in Paris, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Miro
Foundation in Barcelona and the Edvard Munch Museum in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   And in this country? Government indifference to the arts is an
old story, yet despite the obvious obstacles, artists' museums are
finally gaining some momentum. New York may not want them, but
other cities do.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Norman Rockwell Museum opened in Stockbridge,
Mass., and the building itself, by Robert Stern, bespeaks its
serious ambitions. Since 1994, the Andy Warhol Museum has been
spreading the gospel of pop in the artist's hometown, Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Cy Twombly Gallery brought a note of haute elegance
to Houston. And in 1997, the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum opened amid
fanfare in Santa Fe, N.M., a shrine to America's favorite desert
prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Only a Pollyanna (or a publicist) could claim that all of these
museums have top-rate collections or impressive buildings. They
range widely in quality, with the Warhol Museum standing apart as
the most ambitious of the lot. But together they reflect a mounting
desire to honor American artists, and surely they're not unrelated
to the rise in art-market prices that has turned so many former
Bohemians into favored bank customers.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot of money to start your own museum _ and every
artist seems to harbor the fantasy. While writers can gather their
prose in books and composers can rely on CDs, artists have only one
way to bring their work together. As the painter Brice Marden says,
``If you have your own museum, when you end up dead, you're still
in control.'' Will we ever see a Brice Marden Museum? ``Maybe. If I
live to a ripe old age.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, few artists' museums are founded by artists.
Children, grandchildren and fierce widows are gaining expertise in
setting up tax-free foundations and appointing trustees to run
them. Every known _ and less known _ artist qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Chaim Gross Studio Museum in Greenwich Village,
which opened in 1995, or the just-being-built Abraham Rattner
Museum at St. Petersburg Junior College in Florida. Abraham who?
Like so many New York artists of his generation, Rattner
(1893-1978) headed to Paris in the 1920s, breathed the Cubist air
and was converted overnight into a ... not-so-great modernist.
Seeking more information, I looked him up in the famously
definitive 34-volume ``Dictionary of Art,'' only to find no
listing.
</P>
<P>
   Does America need a Rattner museum? On the surface, artists'
museums might sound like monuments of self-advertisement. Big
museums have not been sympathetic to the creation of specialized
ones, which threaten to splinter our culture into a jumble of
vanity fiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge gamble to put your prize possessions in your own
museum,'' says Robert Storr, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art.
``There are certain works that ought to be part of a dialogue, and
it's a pity to have them in a context where they're only another
piece in an artist's biography.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, why should artists allow curators at the
Metropolitan Museum or the Getty or the Art Institute of Chicago to
determine their place in Western art? Curators, traditionally, have
followed taste rather than created it.
</P>
<P>
   Artists' museums are a welcome antidote to the sameness and
smoothness of big museums, which typically link one or two works by
each of hundreds of artists into a suspiciously tidy story, one
that might open in ancient Greece, shift abruptly to Renaissance
Italy and take a detour to Impressionist France before closing (on
a triumphant note) in New York, the current art capital.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet art, to its makers, is not a story. It's a slow, solitary,
often messy process that takes place every day of the week in a
studio where the telephone is probably buried beneath mounds of
paint rags _ as artists' museums remind us. Instead of showing us
one painting in a gold-leaf frame, or one sculpture on a pedestal,
they show us one life. They allow us to see an artist whole; they
reinvest art with the romance and pathos of its creation.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, such institutions are integral to the cultural scene.
To be sure, when Americans go to Paris, they tend to head to the
Louvre and spend half a day wandering its labyrinthine halls. But
there is also the sweetly intimate experience of visiting the
dozens of art shrines one seems to find on every other block.
</P>
<P>
   They include the Musee Rodin, the Musee Delacroix, the Musee
Gustave Moreau and the Brancusi Studio, which reopened in 1997, a
stylish replica of the sculptor's atelier complete with piped-in
strains of his favorite jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Art pilgrims, of course, pride themselves on their sojourns to
museums in the south of France as well. They're out of the way, but
that's the point; by requiring you to travel long distances, they
give you the chance to prove your art devotion anew. Who would deny
that Nice would be far less nice without the presence of museums
devoted to Matisse, Chagall and Dufy, or that Cezanne put
Aix-en-Provence on the map?
</P>
<P>
   In America, by contrast, artist worship remains an alien ritual.
Sure, Americans love art; it's just artists they can't stand. Even
our most celebrated painters and sculptors tend to be viewed by the
public more as weirdos than as shining heroes, perhaps because
their life stories do not include exultant tales of last-second
touchdowns or sold-out concerts at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is athletes and rock stars who galvanize the deepest strains
of adulation, which makes one wonder how single-artist museums will
ever find enough support to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Their attendance tends to be on the low side, at least to judge
by last year's turnouts at the Warhol Museum (which drew 63,000
visitors), the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum (some 25,000 viewers
made the trek across New York's East River to Long Island City), or
the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas, the Minimalist wonderland
founded by the sculptor Donald Judd in the middle of
cattle-ranching country (10,000 visitors).
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Marfa is not easy to reach, but neither is
Memphis, which didn't prevent some 700,000 people from descending
on Graceland last year to commune with the ghost of Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   At least one artist's museum has proved a commercial hit _ and
do I have to add that it's not devoted to an American artist? The
Salvador Dali Museum, in St. Petersburg, Fla., drew some 225,000
visitors last year. It was founded by the Cleveland industrialist
A. Reynolds Morse and his wife, Eleanor, who spent half their lives
amassing Dali's work and the other half trying to give away their
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Museums everywhere turned them down. After reading about the
Morses' plight in a newspaper, officials in St. Petersburg quickly
volunteered a building; the museum opened in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   I visited the place in December and it seemed, well, surreal,
though not in the way Dali used the word. All in all, it feels less
like a museum than a sprawling store _ with five modest galleries
attached. It occupies a former warehouse perched on the edge of a
scenic harbor, and you enter through the gift shop. The day after
Christmas, the aisles were mobbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks just like Macy's!'' Marshall Rousseau, the museum's
director, gleefully exclaimed as he surveyed the jostling crowds. A
two-beat pause. ``Oops. I mean, it looks like the Metropolitan gift
shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in our age of overdeveloped museum stores, the Dali Museum
has no rivals for consumerist chutzpah. Prices start at 50 cents
for little matchboxes bearing reproductions of Dali's work, an odd
choice considering that he was nearly killed when a fire erupted in
his castle in 1984. Pencils, mugs and T-shirts carry a quotation
from Dali in one of four languages: ``The only difference between
myself and a madman is that ... I am not mad!''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he wasn't. One wishes for more madness, more imaginative
wildness, in the art on view here. The collection, which the museum
bills as the largest of Dali's work, contains about 1,700 paintings
and works on paper, including a few gems from the 1930s, when Dali
was still a young Spaniard with a dazzling talent for fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly we see the bombastic later pictures, the oversize
epics from the 50s like ``The Discovery of America by Columbus,'' a
theme that Dali believed perfectly paralleled his own arrival in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the Dali Museum is not the Prado, but it does represent a
valuable addition to the Florida cultural scene; it's the only
attraction on the west coast of Florida to merit three stars in the
Michelin guide. Besides, the museum was one of the first of its
kind in this country, so it deserves points for being a pioneer. On
the other hand, as I left the museum, I wondered a bit
disconsolately why I had come. I had traveled to Dali country in
search of an authentic art experience. Foolish notion. Instead I
had found just another Florida theme park.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And yet art pilgrims continue to wander, willing to go anywhere
to renew their faith. Information about artists' museums is
exceedingly limited, but there is at least one book on the subject,
``World Directory of Artists' Museums,'' which was compiled by
Selby Whittingham and published in London.
</P>
<P>
   The author claims that Europe remains the capital of artists'
museums, but that the situation here improved dramatically with the
opening in 1994 of the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, ``the first
major example of the genre in America.''
</P>
<P>
   I visited the museum when it first opened, and it did seem
impressive. It occupies a designer-name building by Richard
Gluckman and brings together about 5,000 artworks, most of them
Warhol's Warhols, owned by the artist at the time of his death.
Granted, the collection has some gaping holes; it skimps on work
from the early 60s, the pioneering years when Warhol went Pop.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have a first-class ``Marilyn'' painting and can
probably never afford one; nor is there a ``Dick Tracy.''
Nonetheless, the B-plus collection is compensated for by the A-plus
profusion of archival material. In the library, you can pore over
the endless ephemera that Warhol collected, including the ``Time
Capsules,'' 605 cardboard boxes stocked with fan letters and movie
ticket stubs and even a pair of brown shoes once worn by Clark
Gable. And let's not forget the important experience of having an
up-close glimpse at Warhol's fiber wigs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there's something antiseptic about the museum.
Truth be told, I think of it as the University of Warhol, a
research center filled with young people earnestly taking notes. Of
course, any museum runs the risk of squeezing the vitality out of
art.
</P>
<P>
   Museums, by definition, classify and catalogue objects, and
their taxonomic thrust might seem to go against the manic
inventiveness of art. Yet institutions don't have to feel
institutional. The best artists' museums don't just honor the dead;
they coax a vanished world back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed one shining winter afternoon when I paid a visit
to Renee Gross, a stout, red-cheeked woman of 88, and the widow of
the sculptor Chaim Gross. ``Would you like a snack of crackers and
cream cheese?'' she asked in a thick Russian accent, while leading
me on a spirited tour of the Chaim Gross Studio Museum, which bills
itself as the only single-artist museum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1995, four years after the artist's death, the museum
occupies a turn-of-the-century, cast-iron building on LaGuardia
Place in Greenwich Village. It's a picturesque place, a sculptor's
atelier preserved down to the last dusty detail _ complete with his
mallets and chisels, his boxes of steel wool and bottles of
benzine.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 300 sculptures in all, the massive heads and
undulating dancers that secured Gross' reputation as a wood carver.
Asked why she started the museum, Mrs. Gross replied without
hesitation, ''It would have pleased Chaim very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, few people know the name Chaim Gross, although framed
photographs hanging in the entranceway attest to a charmed life.
There he is, shaking hands with New York City Mayor Ed Koch or
Golda Meir. There he is, palling around with fellow artists like
Larry Rivers or Louise Nevelson.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph from 1937, taken at an early Gross exhibition,
shows Helen Keller in a floral straw hat, fingering the planes of
one of his sculptures with obvious pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the museum is free, although not many people come
by. ``Some days we get four visitors,'' Mrs. Gross said, ``and some
days we get 40 visitors. Some people ask good questions and some
ask dumb ones. The other day, someone asked me if Chaim had any
mistresses. I said he may have, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Chaim Gross Studio Museum stands as a reminder
that memorable museums don't have to be devoted to the likes of a
Dali or a Warhol. Seeing a minor artist in a personal setting can
be more rewarding than seeing a major artist in an impersonal one.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Chaim Gross Museum attracted only 4,000
visitors last year, to my mind it ranks as a success: it puts you
on intimate terms with art. It strips away the textbook ``isms''
and gives you a renewed respect for one man and the creative
struggle that took place day after day, year after year, inside his
studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaim's not popular now,'' his widow said. ``I don't
advertise, and unless you advertise you're forgotten. But Chaim
will be back. Anyone who takes the time to look can see he was an
original.''

 &HT;    Duke coming out of shadow
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ After pulling off one of the biggest upsets _
if not the biggest _ in women's NCAA Tournament history, Duke got
an unprecedented amount of media coverage Monday for its victory
against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But the questions weren't necessarily related to spoiling the
Lady Volunteers' bid for four consecutive titles. Instead, they
were queried about the reaction from Duke men's players Trajan
Langdon, Shane Battier and Chris Carrawell, who were in Greensboro,
N.C., for the East Region finals and were shown repeatedly during
ESPN's telecast of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters asked us, `So what did they say?' `` Duke center
Michele VanGorp said. ``It was disappointing. This is our time,
this is our moment, and that's what they want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   VanGorp said the players on both teams get along well and are
supportive of each other, as are coaches Gail Goestenkors and Mike
Krzyzewski. But as the first school to send both men's and women's
teams to the Final Four in the same year since Georgia in 1983,
it's probably going to be hard for the media to treat them
separately. Especially with the top-ranked men an overwhelming
favorite to win the NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get overshadowed by them because they have a tradition,''
VanGorp said. ``We're trying to establish one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once, I would like for it to be about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another game
</P>
<P>
   While the women's basketball world continues to reel from
Tennessee's upset to Duke, Goestenkors doesn't see what all the
fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was 5-4 after losing to Tennessee by 14 points in December,
then embarked on a 16-game winning streak. The team believes that
game gave it the confidence to reverse the score the second time
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's as big as everyone else thinks that it is
across the nation, because we did believe that we could win,'' she
said. ``Our goal was not to beat Tennessee. Our goal was not to get
to the Final Four. Our goal is to win a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a prospect that looked far from reality when Goestenkors
was hired in 1992 after being a longtime assistant at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils had missed the NCAA Tournament the five years
before her arrival. But by recruiting academically oriented players
_ much as Stanford did to win to national titles in the early 1990s
_ Duke has been in the NCAA Tournament for the past five years and
has been ACC regular-season champion the past two.
</P>
<P>
   No time to enjoy
</P>
<P>
   Despite Krzyzewki's encouragement to take some time and enjoy
her first Final Four trip, Goestenkors was in her Cameron Indoor
Stadium office at 8 a.m. Tuesday breaking down Georgia game film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Take at least this morning and this afternoon to
enjoy this; you really need to appreciate this,''' she said. ``But
this is such a busy day because we leave so early (Wednesday for
San Jose). It's just been a pretty hectic day.

 &HT;    Kennesaw State eyeing on-campus velodrome
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kennesaw State University officials are investigating
the possibility of building a $3 million velodrome on the Cobb
County campus.
</P>
<P>
   The decision whether to proceed could come within the next two
months, Kennesaw State President Betty Siegel said Wednesday at a
working session attended by 25 people. The bicycle-racing facility
would be financed through private donations, and no university
money would be used. Kennesaw State would donate on-campus land,
valued at $1 million. Construction would cost $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under consideration for the past two years, the project has
obtained a $250,000 matching grant from Jim Kennedy, chairman and
CEO of Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reached the point where I felt we needed an extra push,''
said Kennedy, a competitive cyclist who has held national and
international age-group records.
</P>
<P>
   The project was conceived by David Weller, a three-time Jamaican
Olympic cyclist who won a bronze medal at the 1980 Games. Weller
founded the Cox Atlanta Velo team, which just finished competing in
California and will race this week in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rich tradition of being involved in cycling at the
grass-roots level,'' Weller said, pointing out that the racing
track also could be used by the public, as well as by cycling
teams.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by Weller, the velodrome would be a multi-sport
complex that also would house a team handball facility on the
infield and a rollerskating track and picnic areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about opportunities that are not so
far-fetched,'' Weller said.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said she supports the project because it also would serve
an educational function.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ash, chairman of the university's Department of Health,
Physical Education and Sports Science, said a physiology lab
already on campus could work with athletes, and sports management
students could serve internships at the velodrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting as an academic endeavor that has
credibility,'' Siegel said.

LAURYN HILL: WITH A SONG IN HER HEART, A WOMAN OF THE PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lauryn Hill staked out her high-minded aspirations as
she began her set on Tuesday night at the Theater at Madison Square
Garden. From a darkened stage came Bob Marley's ``Redemption
Song,'' about music's promise of freedom and consolation; then she
sang ``His Eye Is on the Sparrow,'' about the certainty of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Reggae and gospel are touchstones for Ms. Hill, who's determined
to pass on positive messages along with a groove. But she doesn't
stop there. She also wants to update the sensuality and
confessional intimacy of smooth 1970s soul and to harness the
street-wise bluntness of hip-hop. For long stretches of her show at
the Theater she managed to do it all.
</P>
<P>
   Her first solo album, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill''
(Ruffhouse/Columbia), has sold five million copies and won the
Grammy Award for album of the year, making it clear that Ms. Hill
no longer needs the Fugees, the hip-hop group with whom she made
two albums.
</P>
<P>
   As both singer and rapper, she has forged a multilevel pop
persona: smart and vulnerable, affectionate and strong, fervent but
capable of admitting mistakes. She falls for untrustworthy men,
demands more of them and decides to rely on herself. And she
insists, to herself and to performers who would pander to mass
tastes, that ``music is supposed to inspire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill has placed herself in the lineage of visionaries like
Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Donny Hathaway, Curtis Mayfield,
Maurice White and Prince, musicians whose omnivorous tastes reflect
their unwillingness to accept any arbitrary barriers.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of gospel preaching, she offers her own
experiences as cautionary tales and hopeful parables while trying
not to set herself above her listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many awards I get or how many albums I sell,''
she announced on Tuesday night, ``I'm still the same person.'' She
added that she was ``no different'' from her listeners. ``I just
got opportunity, thank God,'' she said, and an organ chord swelled
behind her as if she were in a church pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Performers obsessed with their own responsibility can turn into
bores, but Ms. Hill knows better. Onstage, she put the music ahead
of the words: vocal phrases melted into cascading melismas while
the band's lush, rolling vamps evolved from quiet-storm romantic
soul to crisply syncopated reggae.
</P>
<P>
   Where Wyclef Jean of the Fugees uses his concerts as an
exhibition of his versatility, trotting out styles one by one, Ms.
Hill treats her music as a pool of kindred African-American (and
Caribbean) ideas from which any strain can float to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Girl talk, American and Jamaican-style raps, sultry crooning,
soulful exhortation and even a hint of jazz scat-singing poured out
of Ms. Hill, while her band followed every fluctuation. She had a
horn section to underscore her reggae leanings, a pair of disk
jockeys and a male backup MC for hip-hop effects and three female
backup singers to deliver gospel-soul responses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill could sound tender or aggressive, husky or airy; she
turned notes into spiraling long melismas or glided coolly through
her melodies. She is a student of pop-soul improvisation, borrowing
vocal lines from Bill Withers, Mavis Staples, Etta James and Aretha
Franklin. But while she openly relies on her musical ancestors, the
character she creates is her own.
</P>
<P>
   For the first third of her show, she was remarkable: confident,
improvisatory, utterly persuasive. Then she stopped trusting her
own material. She disappeared backstage for a 10-minute costume
change while her band dispensed drum and percussion solos (adding
Latin music to the show's palette).
</P>
<P>
   Then she returned with a lengthy, misguided ploy: a battle
between the disk jockeys playing records and the band backing her
in other people's hits, from the Jackson Five's ``I Want You Back''
to Jay-Z's ``Hard Knock Life'' to Bob Marley's ``War.'' But her own
songs had already demonstrated her range, better than the borrowed
songs, and eventually she returned to them.
</P>
<P>
   With the motherly love of ``Zion,'' the admonitions of
``Doo-Wop'' _ warning girls that some men are only after ``that
thing'' _ and the steadfast optimism of ``Everything Is
Everything,'' Ms. Hill sent the grooves from New York to Jamaica
and from the 1950s to the 1990s. As as the music pumped and surged,
she gently insisted that intelligence and fortitude are the best
foundations for a good time.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ At a border checkpoint Wednesday, Beckim
Ahmeti leaned against his white sedan, waiting for his cousin and
his family, silently praying they would make it out of Kosovo
before the bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming down from Pristina,'' he said, referring to
the capital of Kosovo, the war-torn Serbian province that lies to
the north of here. ``They said Pristina is a ghost town.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not surprising. For more than a year, as ethnic Albanian
separatists fought for independence and Yugoslav forces pummeled
them and the civilians who support them, the city of Pristina had
largely avoided the conflict that raged in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Gunfire is random. Grenades are tossed into cafes and
markets. Pristina is emptying out. Many of its residents are
fleeing, coming here to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 refugees are now in and around Skopje, the
Macedonian capital. As darkness fell Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, the solitary
police officer at the checkpoint on the road that leads out of
Kosovo into Macedonia said that about 2,000 people had crossed the
border Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers could swell if the Serbian forces of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic respond to NATO's bombing with
reprisals against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo. But with
each passing day, there are fewer Albanians left behind to feel the
boot of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that
about a quarter of Kosovo's 2 million people have been displaced,
some 25,000 over last weekend, when Serb forces began leveling
villages of the ethnic Albanians who comprise 90 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears that Macedonia could be dragged into a wider
Balkan war as a result of the NATO attack. That would be history
repeating itself. The first two Balkan wars of this century were
fought over Macedonia. Thursday, Macedonia, predominately
Macedonian, Albanian, and Bulgarian, has the most ethnically
diverse population of any country of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It also has 12,000 NATO troops dug in at the Kosovo border,
which may prove an irresistable target to angry Serb forces looking
to hit back over the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Given their history, Macedonians know this could well become the
second front of yet another Balkan war. Here in the capital, lines
at gas stations stretched for blocks Wednesday. The Vero
supermarket downtown was crammed with shoppers stocking up on
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   At the border, about 15 miles north, knots of taxi drivers stood
a few hundred yards from the checkpoint. Some had been sent by
Albanian organizations with instructions to pick up specific
families. Others were hoping to find someone desperate for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   One driver said he was ferrying refugees to Skopje for nothing.
Asked why, he replied, ``Because they don't have money.''
</P>
<P>
   A nearby police officer smirked, not believing the cabbie's
generosity. The officer said one woman had been kidnapped by a taxi
earlier. Further down the road, police were stopping taxis to make
sure they had willing passengers. Many of the taxis were crammed
with bags of clothing, pillows, lamps, and anything else the
refugees could carry to the border.
</P>
<P>
   As he waited for his relatives, Beckim Ahmeti said he did not
know if they would make it. They had given him vague plans for the
60-mile journey from their home. But they have no car and the
journey was hard, along a winding road that passes over a bridge

have mined in case NATO decides to send in ground troops.

<P>
   Ahmeti, 25, remembers making the same journey as a young boy,
but says it was not nearly as fraught with danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents moved from Kosovo to Macedonia in 1979,'' he said.
``I still went back and saw my family. But not lately. It was too
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmeti said most refugees are being put up by friends and family
in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will be left outside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Ahmeti, a tall man at well over 6 feet, sprang to
attention. His eyes fixed on a group of dark figures passing
through the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's them,'' he said, almost to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmeti walked briskly over to his cousin, hugged him, kissed his
cousin's young son, then led his cousin's wife and the sleeping
baby she held to the car.
</P>
<P>
   More relieved than elated, they drove off into the darkness at
approximately the same time the first cruise missiles were launched
toward the Balkan mountains.

ANTI-APARTHEID CLERIC SENTENCED TO 6 YEARS FOR EMBEZZLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ A judge on Wednesday sentenced former
anti-apartheid activist Allan Boesak to six years in prison for
stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to help needy
children and educate black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak, 53, was convicted last week on one count of fraud and
three counts of theft. He was found guilty of using money from
foreign donors, including singer Paul Simon, to buy two luxury
homes, a recording studio and other things.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, John Foxcroft, referring to a letter sent by
Archbishop Desmond Tutu in defense of Boesak, acknowledged that the
former cleric had played an important role in ridding South Africa
of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, when it came to a serious crime like theft, ``all
must be treated alike.'' If anything, he added, Boesak's position
made his crimes more egregious.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom here was packed with Boesak's supporters, and
after the sentencing, many questioned whether South Africa's
justice system, heavy with apartheid-era judicial appointments, was
still working with a dual standard.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak's sentencing comes a day after a judge in Pretoria gave a
suspended sentence to a white farmer who shot and killed a
6-month-old black girl about a year ago. The baby was strapped to
the back of an older cousin who was walking across the farmer's
property. The children were relatives of workers who lived on the
farm.
</P>
<P>
   The justice minister has asked for a report on the case.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the sentencing, Boesak appeared to be
fighting back tears, but after being released pending an appeal, he
was defiant. Boesak, who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, has consistently denied all the charges, saying they were
the result of a witch hunt by the former apartheid regime. ``My
innocence is not touched in one way or the other by a conviction of
this court,'' he told reporters outside the courtroom. ``The last
word is not spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the farmer's sentence, Boesak said: ``I have not
fought for the murderer of a black child to walk free and for
something like this to happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boesak's case has gripped this nation, in part because of the
details of his lavish spending and in part because because of the
support he has gotten from President Nelson Mandela, who raised
money for his defense and attacked the prosecution's case. Mandela
eventually apologized. Wednesday, Mandela said he would have no
further comment on the case until the appeals process ended.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, Foxcroft denied an application for an
appeal. But Boesak's lawyer, Mike Maritz, said he would fight the
decision before the appellate court. He has a 21-day window to make
the motion, during which time Boesak can remain free.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for a suspended sentence, Maritz had said that Boesak
had been punished enough already, noting that he was bankrupt, and
that his career had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But the state prosecutor, G.C. Gerber, asked the court to give
Boesak a sentence at least as tough as the one given to his former
bookkeeper, Freddie Steenkamp, who was convicted of embezzlement
last year and given a six-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Foxcroft agreed that Boesak had already suffered and said that
he took ``no pleasure'' in sentencing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely that he will be able to slip into
obscurity,'' the judge said, ``and the stigma will probably follow
him to the end of his days.''

ISRAEL ENDURES GENERAL STRIKE BY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel shrugged off a general strike Wednesday as
400,000 unionized workers walked off state jobs but failed to halt
most essential public services or to force the government to accept
their wage proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Mail deliveries stopped, passport offices closed, and garbage
trucks remained in garages as the workers conducted a shutdown of
state agencies and a slowdown in government-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But a court order kept skeleton crews running state utilities
and bus and train lines, minimizing economic disruption.
</P>
<P>
   With negotiations with the Finance Ministry indefinitely
postponed after a bitter bargaining session Tuesday, union leaders
have pledged to increase pressure Thursday with further work
stoppages at airports, seaports and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at strikers,
accusing them of trying to blackmail the government. Netanyahu
pledged to resist the proposal for an immediate 14 percent salary
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest that workers go to work,'' said Finance Minister
Meir Sheetrit. ``Anyone who strikes and does not work will not be
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has proposed a 3.85 percent raise, about equal to
the projected inflation rate. The government contends that routine
wage adjustments pushed up median state salaries 4 percent last
year. The workers counter that their last wage increase, in 1997,
was undercut by a higher than expected inflation rate of 8.6
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The strike occurs in a bitter campaign leading up to Election
Day on May 17. Netanyahu said the unions had timed the stoppage for
maximum political effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unthinkable that in a democracy, on the eve of
elections, they should point a gun at the public's head and on
false grounds try to extort money from the public treasury,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The effects on the campaign, however, seem muted. None of the
major candidates for prime minister endorse the stoppage or the
wage proposal. Netanyahu's comments notwithstanding, few
politicians appear to see a tactical advantage in vociferous
strike-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the strike inadvertently underscored the weakness
of an organized labor movement that remains rooted in the
government jobs while high-tech business provides most new
employment and the government is selling state industries.
</P>
<P>
   Bezeq, the national phone company, which is selling controlling
interests to private investors, was hit by wildcat maintenance
walkouts last week to protest planned staff reductions. Wednesday,
Bezeq announced that it would cut its work force further, to 6,500
or less this year, down from 8,300 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As its economic power has declined, the Histadrut labor
federation has become politically marginal. The federation was once
the organizational and ideological backbone of Labor and its
predecessor parties, which for decades ran Israel. But its leader,
Amir Peretz, broke ranks with the party this year and is heading
the parliamentary slate for his own small new Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
   Labor, meanwhile, is so distanced from its historic union roots
that its campaign posters do not even mention the party's name. The
party leader, Ehud Barak, who has chosen to be identified instead
as the candidate of broader One Israel movement, conspicuously
declined Wednesday to back the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the strike,'' Barak said, ``it doesn't matter who is right.
What matters is who is suffering, and the public is suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   With schools already closed for the Passover holiday next week,
when other public services are also routinely suspended or
curtailed, the strike seemed more like an early start to a
government vacation than the paralysis that the unions had
advertised. Businesses remained open, and flights resumed on
delayed schedules after a three-hour morning shutdown of Ben-Gurion
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Israelis are inured to national and municipal work
stoppages, which almost monthly disrupt telephone service or school
schedules or welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, strikes have shut airports, universities,
the state water company, the weather service, Social Security
offices and, even, the Labor Ministry. Histadrut itself was the
target of a strike by disgruntled employees, who at one point
blocked Peretz and other officials from entering the federation
office.

INTRUDERS TURN TAIL, AND JAPAN THRILLS TO ECHOES OF ITS OWN ROAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan called on North Korea on Wednesday to seize and
hand over two ships that set off a crisis Tuesday in the Sea of
Japan, and the government here seemed to exult in its relatively
firm response to the ships' infiltration.
</P>
<P>
   Japan let the two ships escape, apparently into North Korean
waters, Wednesday morning for fear that continued pursuit could
lead to a naval clash with North Korea. But for the first time
since World War II, Japan dispatched destroyers and had them fire
warning shots at intruding vessels, and coast guard patrol boats
fired warning shots for the first time since 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis, which dominated news in Japan, began when routine
monitoring detected unusual radio communications by a ship
approaching the Japanese coast. Coast guard planes and boats sent
to investigate found two ships that bore false markings of Japanese
fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the gunfire and a dozen warning bombs dropped by
Japanese planes, the ships fled to the open sea, and Wednesday
morning Japan gave up the chase when it could no longer protect its
destroyers with air cover. Japanese officials were particularly
concerned when radar detected North Korean aircraft approaching.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has not commented, but Japanese officials seem
convinced that the ships were North Korean naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Three theories are making the rounds of Japanese intelligence
analysts: that the ships were doing routine intelligence gathering,
that they were dropping off or picking up agents in Japan, or that
they were smuggling drugs or other contraband into Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, but it has
contacted the North Korean mission to the United Nations and the
North Korean Embassy in Beijing to ask for the ships to be
returned. So far, North Korea has not responded.
</P>
<P>
   Sadaaki Numata, the chief Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Wednesday that the Japanese destroyers could not have gone beyond
warning shots. Japan restricts the use of force to self-defense,
and Numata said that this restriction would permit firing on the
fleeing ships only if they were firing at Japanese ships.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese constitution drafted by Gen. Douglas MacArthur
after World War II states that Japan must ``forever renounce war as
a sovereign right of a nation and the threat or use of force as a
means of settling international disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials seem to be hoping to use the incident to
bolster their case for new military guidelines that would make it
easier to use force or to support U.S. troops in a crisis in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and other officials seemed delighted
with their show of force. The use of destroyers and warning shots
signaled a seriousness that has rarely been seen before.''We
consider that this kind of action is important to demonstrate our
determination to insure our national security,'' Obuchi told
Cabinet ministers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although North Korea has not commented on the two ships, it has
reiterated its view that the real threat to peace in the region
comes from the United States, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. and South Korean warhawks are these days busy with
frequent war exercises under different names aimed at making an
outbreak of war against the North a fait accompli, bringing war
exercises closer to a real war,'' the official North Korean news
agency said Wednesday. It referred to ``the ulterior intention to
expand the U.S. colonial domination and ferocious fascist
repressive rule to the North.''

PINOCHET ARREST UPHELD, BUT MOST CHARGES ARE DISCARDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also PINOCHET-CHILE; this story was budgeted earlier as
PINOCHET-BRITAIN) 
(bl) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ England's highest court ruled Wednesday that Gen.
Augusto Pinochet must remain in England and face possible
extradition to Spain, but they significantly narrowed the charges
on which the case will turn.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-1 decision, the Law Lords said that the former Chilean
dictator could not be extradited on allegations of crimes committed
before 1988, the year in which torture committed overseas became a
crime punishable in Britain. Almost all of the crimes against
humanity with which the 83-year-old general is charged date from an
earlier period of his 1973 to 1990 rule of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The Lords also directed British Home Secretary Jack Straw to
reconsider whether he wanted to go forward with the extradition
proceedings now that Pinochet had been found no longer answerable
to the major counts against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of this decision,'' Lord Browne-Wilkinson, the
senior law lord, said, ``is to eliminate the majority of the
charges leveled against Senator Pinochet by the government of Spain
and relied upon as the basis for extraditing him.'' The general had
himself declared a senator for life as a way of immunizing himself
from any prosecution in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition request from Spain that Straw approved in an
``authority to proceed'' decision in December had been predicated
on charges of murder, conspiracy to murder, hostage-taking, torture
and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday night, Straw promised to heed the
court's direction to review his finding ``as swiftly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict's unexpected emphasis on the extradition issue
served to overshadow a significant finding on the principle of law
on which the five-month old Pinochet case first reached the Lords:
the claim of sovereign immunity. All but one of the seven judges
turned down the general's claim that as a former head of state he
was immune from arrest, an almost complete reversal of the original
High Court verdict on the question last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is loud and clear _ head of state immunity does
not grant freedom to commit crimes against humanity and acts of
torture,'' said a spokesman for Amnesty International, a
participant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But while the general lost that critical legal argument in
Wednesday's verdict, he gained ground in his personal struggle to
leave England and return to Chile. His lawyers Wednesday afternoon
obtained a hearing before the High Court on Monday to seek his
early liberation by emphasizing the point that the lesser charges
do not constitute a substantial enough case to hold him any longer.
</P>
<P>
   In an undramatic and crisply delivered address to the peers
seated along the red leather benches in the ornate Lords' chamber,
Lord Browne-Wilkinson explained the reasoning behind the panel's
decision as the principle of double criminality: ``Nobody can be
extradited to a foreign country unless the conduct alleged against
him constitutes a crime under both the law of the foreign country
and the law of the United Kingdom.'' That changed, he said, when a
new Criminal Justice Act came into force on Sept. 29, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the charges postdating 1988 and therefore still
confronting Pinochet were an isolated charge of torture and certain
other charges covering conspiracy to torture and conspiracy to
commit murder in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Foes and allies of Pinochet who have been angrily facing down
one another since the general's arrest each found validation of
their points of view in Wednesday's decision, and there were
celebrations among both the backers and opponents gathered outside
the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision dispels any doubts,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy
director of Human Rights Watch. ``Not even a self-proclaimed
president like Pinochet can claim immunity after torture or give
himself amnesty for his crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilean Foreign Minister Miguel Alex Schweitzer, who is one of
the general's lawyers, said, ``Compared to what we had before, this
is good.'' Fernando Barros of the Chilean Reconciliation Movement
said, ``It has been confirmed that the Spanish case now has no
substantial basis on which to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters had been hoping for a Lords decision that would have
permitted Pinochet to leave England immediately, but they spoke
confidently of their expectation that he might achieve his goal now
in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now five months old, the Pinochet case is one that has shaken
international law, galvanized human rights and exile groups and
stirred bitter and passionate old antagonisms in Chile and other
countries with recent experiences of dictatorial regimes. It has
brought a host of diplomatic problems for Britain even though the
government has been at pains to say that the detention of Pinochet
has been from the start a police and judicial matter rather than a
political one.
</P>
<P>
   The general has been protesting his arrest in London on Oct. 16,
saying that as a former head of state he has sovereign immunity.
That view was upheld in a unanimous verdict by a three-judge panel
of the High Court on Oct. 28 but reversed in a 3-2 decision of five
Law Lords on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The British police had arrested the general in response to an
application from a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, seeking his
extradition to Madrid to stand trial on charges of genocide,
torture and kidnapping in connection with the death or
disappearance of more than 3,000 people in the years after he
seized power in a coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon is conducting an investigation into the atrocities
committed during the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the
1970s, and he exploited Pinochet's presence in London to take his
surprise action based on the mass of evidence he had been
assembling. At the time of his arrest, the general was in a London
clinic recuperating from back surgery and planning his return to
Chile a week later.
</P>
<P>
   After the Law Lords' original decision, Straw validated the
Spanish claim, and the general was obliged to appear in person for
the first time since the highly charged episode began. He sternly
told a bail hearing Dec. 11 that he did not ``recognize any other
court, except in my country, to try me against all the lies of
Spain.'' The magistrate nevertheless continued his house arrest,
prompting predictions that he would be unable to leave England for
at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Then in a development that deeply embarrassed the British
judiciary and led to the 12 days of hearings ending Feb. 4 that
produced Wednesday's new finding, the Lords set aside its earlier
decision because one of the judges who ruled against the general,
Lord Hoffmann, had not disclosed his association with Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in Britain's history that the Lords had
ever reviewed one of their rulings, and the naming of seven Law
Lords instead of the customary five was seen as a measure of the
gravity of the case for Britain and its court system.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet and his wife, Lucia, have been living in a rented
mansion in an exclusive suburb in Surrey south of London since his
hospital release Dec. 1. A Chilean military plane landed at Brize
Norton Royal Air Force on Wednesday morning prepared to ferry him
home. It was the third time since October that a Chilean aircraft
has been idling at the Oxfordshire field on the same mission. Once
again Wednesday, it moved to a side runway and took up a parking
space.

FORMER ITALIAN PREMIER CHOSEN TO HEAD EUROPEAN COMMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Leaders of the European Union on Wednesday appointed
former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi to take over as
president of the European Union Commission, the powerful
Brussels-based executive body whose top officials resigned in a
corruption scandal last week.
</P>
<P>
   The quick decision, at the start of a summit meeting, was
supposed to signal European cohesion and a determination to give
new impetus to the continent's integration in the city that long
symbolized Europe's division into rival blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Santer of Luxembourg, the 61-year-old president of the
European Commission, and his 19 fellow commissioners quit after a
report by an independent panel of experts found the Union's $100
billion annual budget was mismanaged and said it was ``becoming
difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commission runs important areas of European policy,
including trade and antitrust matters, and the resignations had
threatened to bring paralysis at a time when the Union is
attempting an ambitious reform of its budget that would open the
way for new members from the former East bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Prodi, a center-left politician who lost the
Italian premiership last summer, should help avert such paralysis.
The European Parliament, which must act on the leaders' decision,
indicated Wednesday that it would back him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Prodi would take office for a five-year term only at
the end of the year, his appointment is expected to clear the air,
allowing the departing Commission to work in a caretaker capacity
until then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nomination is a great demonstration of trust for Italy,''
Prodi said. ``I am delighted for Italy. We must make the machinery
of the Commission work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the European
Union, has been particularly concerned that the crisis at the
Commission not hold up reforms that would cut its big contribution
to the European budget and open the way for Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary to join the Union. Such enlargement is seen by
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder as an important symbol of a
continent-wide integration.

<P>
   But Europe's most virulent divisions _ those that have plagued
the Balkans for much of the last decade _ quickly overshadowed
Prodi's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 15 leaders spent much of the day discussing the
conflict over Kosovo. Although the presence of four neutral nations
prevented explicit backing for NATO air strikes, the European Union
spelled out the reasons for military action.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued before the NATO attacks began said:
``Aggression must not be rewarded. An aggressor must know that he
will have to pay a high price. That is the lesson to be learnt from
the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Making clear that European patience with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has finally run out, the heads of state said
their action was ``directed against the irresponsible policy of the
Yugoslav leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But neutral Austria, a European Union member, said in a
statement that it would close its airspace to NATO planes striking
Yugoslavia because there was no clear United Nations mandate for
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Several European nations, including Germany and France, have
expressed concern in recent months over what they saw as a need for
a specific mandate from the U.N. Security Council to attack
Yugoslavia. But after long efforts to negotiate a settlement at
peace talks in France, those concerns have been replaced by
indignation at Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO will act for as long as it take for Milosevic to regain
his humanity,'' Schroeder said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a shaky start at the head of a previously untried
coalition of Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens, the
German leader is looking desperately for a success at the two-day
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He wants an agreement to hold down agricultural spending, which
accounts for close to half of the European budget and chiefly
benefits southern countries including Spain, Italy and France.
Without such an agreement, farm spending would soar when any new
members with large farm sectors, like Poland, join.
</P>
<P>
   Although an outline agreement to hold farm spending to about $44
billion a year was reached this month by agriculture ministers,
France has since expressed reservations. It is far from clear that
an accord will be reached in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said the image of the European Union had suffered from
the corruption at the Commission and would have to be restored by
Prodi. One commissioner, Edith Cresson of France, was shown to have
hired a friend to do spurious scientific work for the Commission at
a cost to European taxpayers of close to $200,000.

COLUMN: FUMING OVER SMOKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday, March 26)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being a former smoker, I am, of course, one of the most
militant, obnoxious, uncompromising, jerk-wad, anti-smoking zealots
on the face of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   I have no sympathy whatsoever for the five or six remaining
nicotine addicts who must trudge outside (preferably in a cold
rain) to indulge their habit. If I happen to pass within 30 yards
of their little cell of stink, I make a big production of fanning
the air with my hand and screwing up my face in a look of disgust.
</P>
<P>
   At baseball stadiums, where smoking is prohibited except in
certain areas shared by lepers, Republicans and other social
pariahs, if I see someone's hand so much as brush his or her pack
of Marlboro Lights, I start hollering for the usher, making a sound
much like Donald Sutherland made in ``The Invasion of the Body
Snatchers.''
</P>
<P>
   I laughed when California passed a law outlawing smoking in
bars. Drive 'em into the sea, boys. Make 'em smoke under water.
</P>
<P>
   New York recently passed a law where they can confiscate the
cars of drunken drivers. This seems a little extreme to me.
</P>
<P>
   However, I would have no problem if they passed a law where they
can confiscate the car of someone caught smoking. Maybe follow it
up with a brisk flogging, then make 'em sit in a bar for eight
hours without smoking.
</P>
<P>
   I'm against flag burning, but not for patriotic reasons. It's
the smoke that bothers me.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers whine that they are being singled out for persecution.
This is absolutely true, of course, and totally justified. The
amazing thing is that smokers actually figured out that they are
being persecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Because, let's face it, smokers _ and remember, I used to be one
of them _ are not exactly the sharpest knives in the drawer. Thirty
years of medical research have pretty much proved that you're
better off, health-wise, giving yourself a plutonium enema than
sucking on a Winston 100.
</P>
<P>
   As I recall, there's even some sort of government warning on
every pack of cigarettes, something subtle like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Warning! These things are poisonous! They will kill you! Just
handling the pack could lead to a horrible, agonizing death! We've
had lab rats die of cancer simply by chewing on magazine ads! If
you want to kill yourself, there are better ways. Like a gun or
jumping off a high bridge. And let me tell you another thing, pal.
You still listening? Hello? Anybody home?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to smoke these cigarettes no matter what I tell
you, aren't you? I could tell you these Salems are filled with
gunpowder and the top of your head will blow off the instant you
light up and it wouldn't make a bit of difference, would it? Well,
fine. Go kill yourself; see if I care. I'm warning you, pal. You
light one of these babies around me, I'm calling the cops.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that cigarette smoking causes cancer is probably the
single, most widely known fact in America today. Little kids learn
that smoking is bad for you before they learn their colors or how
to eat with a spoon. And yet many of these kids will grow up and
start smoking. Why?
</P>
<P>
   In America, which as we all know is a great country, some adult
cigarette smokers _ grown-up people who presumably know their
colors, how to eat with a spoon and maybe a few other things _ are
suing the tobacco companies because they heard a rumor that
cigarette smoking may have some harmful side effects, such as
death. They blame their health problems on the tobacco companies
because the tobacco companies, for some strange reason, neglected
to mention these harmful side effects in their advertising.
``Welcome to Marlboro Country! It's a cancer ward! Pretty cool,
huh?''
</P>
<P>
   This is very imaginative on the part of smokers, I must say, but
not nearly as imaginative as the Pennsylvania man who sued God for
failing to intervene when his (the man's, not God's) employer, U.S.
Steel, fired him in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Donald Drusky accused God of taking no
corrective action and, by means of damages, asked God to return his
youth and grant him the guitar-playing skills of famous guitarists,
as well as resurrecting his mother and pet pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   Also named in the lawsuit, which a judge cruelly threw out on
the grounds that it was frivolous, were former Presidents Reagan
and Bush, the television networks, all 50 states, every single
American, all federal judges and the 100th through 105th
Congresses.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette smokers may cash in by claiming their addiction is the
fault of the tobacco companies, but if they're looking for the
really big bucks, they should definitely think about suing God.

`DRY CLEANING' PUTS A PRESS ON BISEXUAL THEME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 26 by  NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Dry Cleaning'' is one of those French films that
presumes upsetting middle-class propriety makes it profound. It's
actually rather obvious and more than a tad trite, though it's also
observant, convincingly played and _ that other French specialty _
stolidly analytical about life-altering emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Berling and Miou-Miou play Jean-Marie and Nicole
Kunstler, a hard-working couple who've spent their lives together
running a dry-cleaning business in a dull provincial town. They
have a nice son and a comfortable apartment above the store, but no
time or disposable cash for much else. Their last vacation was
eight years ago, and that was to a trade show in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   One night, after a meeting with other small-businesspeople to
discuss a looming recession, the Kunstlers visit a cabaret that's
featuring a brother-sister drag show. The next day, the male
performer Loic (Stanislas Merhar) brings his stained dress to their
store. The conservative couple is intrigued by the handsome young
man, and after a second visit to the club they almost succumb to a
night of wild passion with the siblings _ which only leaves them
even more curious and bothered.
</P>
<P>
   When his sister takes off with some guy, Loic is left alone and
destitute. The Kunstlers take him in, and he proves to be a very
talented pants-presser. He's even more adept at coaxing Nicole out
of her jeans, but it's Jean-Marie he's really interested in. As for
the man of the house, Jean-Marie can't tell if he's jealous of Loic
or attracted to him. Either way, it's freaking him out.
</P>
<P>
   There's a complex balance of affections in this triangle;
everybody seems to truly care for everybody else, even as they're
driving one another nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Miou-Miou was not the most impressive actress to emerge from the
late French New Wave, but she does some of her soundest work here
as she poignantly exposes a good but frustrated woman's desperate
need for excitement _ or for something, anything, a little
different from the usual routine.
</P>
<P>
   The men are good but go more for standard interpretations,
Berling heavy on stuffy and sensitive and Merhar coy and needling.
Director Anne Fontaine isn't overly imaginative, either. She seems
to think that the discovery of repressed bisexuality is the height
of interpersonal drama.
</P>
<P>
   Fontaine is actually more perceptive about offhand behavioral
details. Despite their crushing ordinariness, the people in ``Dry
Cleaning'' are quite interesting. It's the plotting and thematic
agenda that's affected by the fumes.

<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ Despite appearances, the police cruiser
frequently parked next to Clemmons Trucking Inc. off U.S. 82 in
Gordo is not part of a speed trap, says Gordo Police Chief Todd
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that a police officer parks his patrol car there when
he goes to work at a second job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It acts as a deterrent,'' said Hall. ``That's a secret we
would like to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   But the daily sight of the police car has given that location a
reputation on the Internet as a speed trap. The Gordo location and
hundreds of others around the country are listed in the Speedtrap
Registry at www.speedtrap.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site might sound useful to motorists, but some police
officers question its accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can send in information to these sites without any
basis on fact,'' said Tuscaloosa Police Capt. David Hartin.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he thought the Web site was more entertaining than
useful.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was concerned that speeders would think the site
would help them avoid a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure people know we are doing our job to keep
them safe,'' Hall said. ``Speeding is not worth risking your lives
or the lives of others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Speedtrap Registry lists places where users say tickets have
been issued. Anyone can submit a location with details such as time
of day, speed limits and costs of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site lists several locations where motorists have been
ticketed in Tuscaloosa, but Hartin said these areas were not speed
traps.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that many police departments, including the one in
Tuscaloosa, announce the locations where they will be running
police checks through news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Speedtrap Registry creator Andrew Warner readily admits that
some of the information posted by his readers may not be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to be 100 percent correct,'' said Warner, who
is 24 and who works for a computer company in Atlanta. ``But this
is a great start.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, which Warner launched four years ago when he was a
college student, averages about 100,000 visitors a week who browse
it for potential enforcement areas.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who received his only speeding ticket while driving
through Kansas in 1995, said he often used the site when he went on
vacation. The 24-year-old said the site was useful to alert
motorists of areas where officers might be lurking or where
authorities recommended that drivers slow down for dangerous roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you are speeding or not,'' Warner said, ``it's human
nature to be on the lookout for the people who are on the lookout
for you.''

`EDtv' LEAVES YOU LONGING FOR SOMETHING DEEPER 
(For use  Friday, March 26 by  NYTimes News Service clients) By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; ``EDtv'' comes in the wake of two exceptionally
fine and perceptive television satires, ``Pleasantville'' and ``The
Truman Show.'' Directed by Ron Howard and written by the
tube-trained team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (``Happy
Days,'' ``City Slickers,'' Howard's ``Parenthood''), the well-acted
``ED'' is the most conventional of the three and, in some ways, the
easiest to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But almost inevitably, as ``ED'' unfolds in its amusing, mildly
critical way, you keep longing for something sharper, deeper and
more absorbing to hit the screen _ even though you know that, with
these guys at the controls, that's never going to pop up on this
particular channel.
</P>
<P>
   Though very similar to ``Truman'' premise-wise, ``ED'' goes for
an illusion of realism rather than allegorical fantasy. It's set
right now, in a real place (San Francisco) and boasts a self-aware
camera subject (depending on your definition of self-awareness).
</P>
<P>
   Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey, well-cast and working hard) is
a likably useless, 30ish guy with nothing particularly going on in
his life. As his more ambitious but equally unsuccessful brother
Ray (Woody Harrelson) notes, Ed's job at a video store is the kind
of minimum-wage work most people grow out of, not into.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ed is chosen as the subject of a ratings-starved cable
network's desperate venture: 24-hour continuous coverage of one
guy's life. Within days, Ed's a sensation. People can't get enough
of his down-home charm (his family hails from Texas) and, um,
willingness to share such peculiar intimacies as his
toenail-clipping techniques. And then things really get
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Ed catches Ray _ and so, of course, does the live camera crew
that follows him everywhere _ with a one-night stand and, when
trying to comfort Ray's betrayed girlfriend, Shari (``Dharma &AMP;
Greg's'' Jenna Elfman, touching and true in the film's most
emotionally demanding role), ends up kissing her on national
television instead. The republic swoons, but soon cries for sudsier
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Majorities of USA Today poll respondents quickly tire of Shari
and want to see Ed date a sexy English trollop (who else but
Elizabeth Hurley). Ancient, embarrassing secrets about Ed's mom
(Sally Kirkland) and disabled stepdad (Martin Landau, giving the
film's deftest comic performance) are dredged up, as is Ed's long
missing-in-action bum of a biological father (Dennis Hopper).
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Ed stops enjoying celebrity and realizes that the
media overkill is not only messing up his life, but the lives of
everyone he cares about, too. This leads to a predictable showdown
with evil network executive Rob Reiner, whose portrayal of arrogant
media amorality is dead-on perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Ed becomes a heroic crusader against runaway privacy
invasion deserving of a presidential medal of honor _ or, at least,
a President Clinton medal. It's crowd-pleasing, but in fact the
film is more interesting during the few scenes in which Ed himself
tries to stage-manage others' emotions into ``better'' TV _ or when
Ellen DeGeneres, as the show's ambitious but sympathetic producer,
manipulates Ed into living his life more dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   These moments touch upon a more complex idea of how show biz
twists everything, but it's never developed to a really challenging
degree. The real commercial corruption here lies in the movie's
state-of-the-art overload of product placements. I suppose Howard
could claim that he was making a comment about how everything is
sponsored in the TV age. But he sure sold a lot of advertising
space in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Howard never has been the kind of filmmaker critics consider
personal. If you can find confessional or obsessional links between
such slick and varied products as ``Splash,'' ``Parenthood,''
``Cocoon,'' ``Ransom'' and ``Apollo 13,'' you have a Film Comment
article.
</P>
<P>
   But ``EDtv'' obviously speaks to Howard's experience as a child
actor, and the film's most persuasive moments are those in which Ed
weighs the pluses and minuses of his fishbowl existence. It's not
exactly profound, but compared to how feelings are packaged in most
of Howard's cinema, it's unusually engrossing. &UR;

`GIANTS' CLIMBS TO NEW HEIGHTS, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 26 by  NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 1 1/2 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Among Giants'' may be the first movie ever made
about a bunch of working-class blokes who paint high-wire
electrical towers. And, who knows, it may not be the last. There's
certainly plenty of emotional ground yet to be explored because the
makers of this movie have decided to concentrate on pretty aerial
views, hazy metaphors and half-baked characters. The originality
has been confined strictly to the setting.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad because with fine actors like Pete
Postlethwaite (``In the Name of the Father'') and Rachel Griffiths
(``Hilary and Jackie''), this could have been a much more absorbing
movie. But as it stands now, you'll leave the theater wondering
more about electrical towers (when was the last time you saw a
fresh coat of paint on one of those?) than you will about what you
saw on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among Giants'' was written by Simon Beaufoy, the English
screenwriter who gave us ``The Full Monty.'' Beaufoy has a knack
for creating warm, believable blue-collar characters, but, here, he
shows his limitations when forced to fashion a story that requires
more than a one-note gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   Postlethwaite plays Ray, a 50ish hard-hearted English loner
separated from his wife and kids. Ray takes risky, high-paying jobs
so he can have the freedom to get his thrills climbing cliffs in
his spare time. His latest gig involves painting miles and miles of
electrical pylon towers along the Yorkshire moors.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he's been recruited for this job on the sly, although
the movie never quite makes that clear. The one certainty: Ray and
his scruffy band of painters must finish painting before the power
is turned back on (how the people served by these towers get their
power in the meantime is a mystery); otherwise, someone is going to
be in for the shock of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ray soon faces a different challenge, though, and one he's not
emotionally prepared to handle. A footloose backpacker, a woman, no
less, (``This is not right!'') wanders into the boys' party and,
after demonstrating some climbing prowess, lands a job on the crew.
Gerry (Griffiths) and Ray eventually begin a fervent romance, which
leads soon enough to a naked romp through an abandoned water tower
that has both actors' full monty on extended display.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the climbing, you know there will be a close call or
two with gravity. And given that the work is being done on
electrical towers, someone is bound to get an unwanted charge out
of the situation. Toss in some strained metaphors about knowing
when to hang on and when to let go and you've got a clunker of a
movie that never manages to get off the ground. &UR;

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As NATO's bombs and cruise missiles took
the Balkan wars he initiated to his doorstep on Wednesday night,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic called on his people to
defend their country ``by all possible means.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, about 8 p.m., four hours after the Serb president had
addressed the nation on television, the first cruise missiles hit
in Kosovo. Air raid sirens sounded in Belgrade. Flashes of
anti-aircraft fire dotted the night sky and over the next few
hours, three large orange fireballs could be seen on the city's
outskirts, one to the northwest in the direction of a large air
force base, and another to the south, near Zarkovo, where there is
an aircraft plant.
</P>
<P>
   State television interrupted its programming to announce the
airstrikes, urging the population to remain calm. ``The criminals
of NATO can inflict a lot of damage,'' one of the anchormen said.
``But they can never win and they can never defeat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Local editors said that the Serb Information Minister Alexandr
Vucic had called them in and given them a list of regulations,
which included the requirement to call NATO ``criminal,'' and
injunctions not to demoralize the population with detailed
descriptions of targets.
</P>
<P>
   Serb authorities also moved to cut off the transmission of
television pictures from Western networks, in particular those from
NATO-member countries.
</P>
<P>
   On state television, there was much martial music and canned
film of brave Yugoslav soldiers handling sophisticated weaponry,
and the first two state television channels showed an old movie
called ``Battle on Kozara,'' about the victory of Yugoslav
partisans over the Nazis. Keeping to the theme, the foreign
ministry issued a statement saying: ``From this moment, neo-Nazi
America suspends international law.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the military chief of staff said that 20
installations had been targeted by NATO forces, including the
civilian and military air field near Pristina, the Kosovo capital,
and the air base northwest of here at Batajnica. A Serb who spoke
to his mother there by telephone said that a large explosion had
blown out the windows of houses, including hers, about a mile from
the airbase.
</P>
<P>
   The sky over a blacked-out Pristina was full of explosions and
light, and there were reports of explosions in other Yugoslav
cities, including Krusumlija, Pancevo, Novi Sad, Golubovac,
Danilovgrad and the air base near Podgorica, the capital of
Montenegro, the other republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way to tell how accurate the strikes were, and
no specific reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In his television appearance, a defiant Milosevic said the
decision not to allow foreign troops into the southern Serb
province of Kosovo was the right one to protect Yugoslavia's
sovereignty. He hinted darkly that NATO wanted to occupy all of
Yugoslavia, and said: ``What is at stake here is the freedom of the
entire country, and Kosovo was only the door intended to allow
foreign troops to come in and steal away our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said that he still wanted to solve the Kosovo problem
peacefully, with equal guarantees for all the people of the
province. But he vowed: ``We will defend the country if it is
attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, at Batajnica, where the air base is,
Milosevic's citizens were scarcely gung-ho. They were depressed,
anxious, slightly hostile and still disbelieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe they'll bomb us; something will happen,'' Sadi
Dragan, staring up at the sunny sky outside his auto-parts shop.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has moved in the last few days to try to insure that
people have access only to the approved state media. Early this
morning, police shut down the independent radio station, B92, which
has been an important dissident voice to official propaganda, and
detained its editor, Veran Matic.
</P>
<P>
   Matic was released 8 hours later, around 11 a.m. on Wednesday,
but the radio's transmitters were sealed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, in Belgrade, the police shut down a
satellite transmitter of the European Broadcasting Union used by
Western television networks, which were forced to transmit from
government facilities. Later tonight, those broadcasts were
themselves restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Obradovic, a former general in the Yugoslav army who now
leads an opposition party called Social Democracy, also criticized
NATO's decision to use military force in an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Milosevic is most guilty in bringing
the country to war,'' Obradovic said. ``But NATO will also be
losers, and the ones who will lose the most are ordinary civilians,
in Serbia and especially in Kosovo. As a general, I tell you, even
in the most modern war, civilians are the main casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Obradovic, 51, who spent his whole career in the military before
quitting in 1992 out of disgust with Milosevic's Balkan ambitions,
said that the Yugoslav army ``will defend Kosovo, and they do not
joke when they say they will defend it in every possible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the army would prefer a different policy, Obradovic
said. ``Milosevic not only brings us into a war with the whole
world, but he pushes us into a war with one another. That is the
whole organizing principle of his politics, if he has one.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said that the West miscalculated the difficulty of any
Serb accepting foreign troops and a loss of control over Kosovo.
``It may sound like only a phrase, but it is really true that
Kosovo is something special to the Serbs. And it is also true that
the person who signs a document giving up Kosovo will have the
stamp of a traitor on himself and his children forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic would rather lose Kosovo, said an official considered
close to him, than to be accused of surrendering it. ``If it is
lost, we keep the right to reconquer it, even 100 years from no,''
he said. ``If we give it away, it is lost forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo itself, having driven thousands of ethnic Albanians
out of their homes as it pursues the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
Yugoslav military and police units began to disperse their heavy
equipment in preparation for NATO attacks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces were making it very difficult for Western
journalists to move freely outside Pristina, the capital, where the
testing of air raid sirens caused panic among the population.
</P>
<P>
   In Batajnica, near a monument to the town's World War II
dead,by, one man spoke about the difficulty of life here, about
Yugoslavia's decline under Milosevic and the need to work two jobs
to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   He has two sons, ages 6 and 4, he said, and thinks only of them
and their future. ``If I thought that my sons' lives will be better
in 20 years, I would go lie on the tarmac of the Batajnica air base
and wait for the bombs, throwing a party for my friends,'' the man
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think this attack will make their lives or this
country any better,'' he said. ``Quite the contrary.''

ARAB PLANS TO RUN FOR PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the ever-shifting chess game of the Israeli
election campaign, Azmi Bishara has put a new piece on the board.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli Arab member of Parliament and political philosopher,
Bishara said he will join the race for prime minister, becoming the
first Arab to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He said the move is a calculated power play, intended to thrust
the problems of Israel's 1 million Arab citizens onto the agenda of
a campaign that has tended to ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   Bishara hasn't the slightest chance of winning the May 17
election, 17, and he has already drawn fire from Arab critics. But
he hopes to make the difference in a close race by throwing his
support behind the candidate who is committed to solving the
problems of Israel's Arabs, long disadvantaged in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is empowerment of a minority,'' Bishara said in an
interview. ``There has never been such an effective tool, and now
that the electoral system has moved the center of gravity to the
race for prime minister, we have to be there. This is power that
should be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of a new breed of Israeli Arab politicians, Bishara, 42, a
Christian from Nazareth, asserts that the Arabs in Israel, one out
of six Israelis, should be recognized as a national minority in a
``state of all its citizens'' that would grant genuine equality to
Jews and non-Jews alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of the Arabs in Israel is missing from the debate
between the candidates,'' Bishara said. ``If we aren't in the race,
the issue won't exist and we'll be nothing more than a stock of
votes. I want to put the Arab issue on the agenda of the election
for prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Bishara is well on the way to collecting the
required 50,000 signatures to submit his candidacy, and he is
planning to throw his hat in the ring at a news conference
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by surveys showing that many Israeli Arabs would vote
for an Arab candidate for prime minister, Bishara optimistically
predicts that he will win at least half of the Arab turnout, or
more than 150,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Arab critics dismiss those figures as an illusion and argue that
Bishara's candidacy will waste votes needed to unseat Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose policies most Israeli Arabs
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Arab voters have traditionally favored the dovish Labor Party
over Netanyahu's conservative Likud. But if enough of them vote for
Bishara, they could drain support from Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak in a three-way race with Netanyahu and his other main
competitor, Yitzhak Mordechai of the new Center Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bishara countered by citing opinion polls that have consistently
shown that even without his candidacy, none of the three main
candidates would get more than 50 percent of the vote, forcing a
runoff between the two leading vote-getters.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks ahead, Bishara plans to use his electoral leverage
to bargain with Barak or Mordechai for his support. The price of
his endorsement and withdrawal from the campaign, he says, will be
an ironclad, signed commitment to address the problems of Israeli
Arabs. An alliance with the hawkish Netanyahu is out of the
question, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a 50-50 race the Arabs can tip the scales,'' Bishara said.
``Why should I be in anyone's pocket without trying to have an
impact? We're ready to negotiate with the candidate who is prepared
to solve the problems of the Arab population. We'll all mobilize
and work for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishara ticked off the most urgent demands: a halt to
expropriation of Arab lands; approval of master plans for the
expansion of Arab communities; increased budgets for Arab schools;
Arab participation in state planning and building councils;
appointment of Arabs to the boards of major state corporations;
supply of public services to dozens of Arab hamlets that lack
sewers, water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   For all the novelty of Bishara's move, it has not won the
support of other Arab political leaders, who fear that it will hurt
chances of defeating Netanyahu. Many Arab rivals accuse Bishara of
trying to salvage a political career threatened by the possible
failure of his party, the National Democratic Alliance, to get
enough votes to enter Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no more than a media gimmick that neutralizes the Arab
vote and harms the prospect that the Arab population will throw its
full weight to topple Netanyahu,'' said Muhammad Barakeh, leader of
a competing party, the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality.
</P>
<P>
   Bishara asserted that if his conditions are met, he will deliver
his votes to one of Netanyahu's opponents and in the process drive
an important point home to the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will understand what I mean when I say a state of all
its citizens,'' he said. ``This is an important civics lesson for
both Jews and Arabs.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For half a century, the United States and other
countries have pursued political goals through air power, bombing
their adversaries in an effort to persuade them _ force them, if
possible _ to change their policies.
</P>
<P>
   It has seldom if ever worked, unless combined with resolute
action on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why the Clinton administration's
explanation of its policies underwent a subtle shift on Wednesday.
In the hours just before missiles began striking targets in Kosovo,
there were vehement denials at the State Department and at the
White House that NATO was trying to bomb Yugoslavia back to the
bargaining table and force President Slobodan Milosevic to sign a
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of force was there to help him come to the
conclusion that a peaceful solution was the best solution,'' said
State Department spokesman James Rubin. But the use of force, as
opposed to the threat of force, was completely different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What NATO was now trying to do, President Clinton said Wednesday
afternoon, was ``to stop the brutal repression'' by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strikes have three objectives,'' he said _ to
``demonstrate the seriousness of NATO's opposition to aggression,''
to deter Milosevic ``from continuing and escalating his attacks''
in Kosovo, and to damage Serbia's capacity to wage war in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   A top Pentagon planner conceded, ``We have no great expectations
that Milosevic is going to back down and agree to a satisfactory
peace settlement because of one bombing raid or 10.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Clinton nor other senior U.S. officials would
address the questions that troubled many in this and other NATO
capitals: What would constitute success for the NATO effort? If the
ultimate goal is peace in Kosovo, who is to maintain it once the
bombs have stopped falling? Is the plan to keep bombing more or
less indefinitely? If so, how will that help Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   ``These bombs are not going to do the job,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who served as a naval pilot in the Vietnam war.
``It's almost pathetic. You're just going to solidify the
determination of the Serbs to resist a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to drop the bridges and turn off the lights in
Belgrade to have even a remote chance of changing Milosevic's
mind,'' he said. ``What you'll get is all the old Vietnam stuff,
bombing pauses, escalation, negotiations, trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is expected to announce his candidacy for president
next month, said the administration was caught with unpalatable
alternatives _ bombing, which he said ``has never worked without
ground forces,'' and the use of ground forces, which he said had
little support on Capitol Hill or in the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly irritated by the president's critics, Rubin said that
``in their opposition to the use of air power, they have offered no
alternative other than the appeasement of President Milosevic's
policies, which is something unacceptable to this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But in fact some of the critics offered more.
</P>
<P>
   David Owen, the former British foreign secretary, said in a
trans-Atlantic telephone interview that he sympathized with
Clinton's wish to make a stand in Kosovo. But it was ``completely
useless,'' he added, to resort to air power while letting it be
known that there was no intention of using or threatening to use
ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO seems to think it can have half a war,'' said Owen, who
worked as a high-level mediator in the Bosnian crisis. ``They
should have built up ground forces in Macedonia _ not a token
force, a big one, say 60,000 troops or more. The only thing that
will get Milosevic's attention is the real prospect that you're
going to sweep his troops out of Kosovo and stay there to keep them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   An allied force of 25,000 in Kosovo was the goal, of course, of
the peace treaty that Milosevic spurned after talks near Paris. But
invading in order to install such a force might require as many as
100,000 men, and they would have to impose peace, not keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Once before, Milosevic yielded to the force of bombing. But that
was during the Bosnian crisis. Bosnia was an independent country,
and the problem was that of the Serbs who lived there, not that of
Serbs who live in a province (Kosovo) that is Serbian. And the
bombing of 1995 was backed by a Croatian ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, bombing has worked only when followed up. More often,
it has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler pulverized the East End of London, to say nothing of
industrial cities like Coventry, without weakening the Churchill
government or the British people's will to resist. The United
States never broke the spirit of Ho Chi Minh or the North
Vietnamese with its ceaseless raids on Hanoi and Haiphong. Quite
the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Iraq offers a relevant case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of bombing that preceded the all-out American ground
attack in the Persian Gulf war in 1991 reduced the efficacy of such
fighting units as the Republican Guard. But as Washington admitted
at the time, it was not enough. Tanks and infantrymen were also
needed.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since then, there have been many more air attacks,
each intended to ``teach Saddam Hussein a lesson'' or to ``maintain
our credibility'' or to ``reduce his war-making capacity.'' None
has accomplished much.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes this time are much higher. A botched operation could
seriously damage the effort to formulate a new peace-keeping and
crisis-management role for NATO, which Clinton had hoped to unveil
at NATO's 50th anniversary summit here next month. Even a
successful operation could seriously damage American relations with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from the broader implications, the bombing campaign,
which is the first offensive action ever undertaken against a
sovereign nation by NATO, constitutes a leap in the dark. No one
really knows how Milosevic will react or, for that matter, how the
Kosovo Albanians will react. Protected by alliance bombers, they
may feel less inclined than before to accept the peace agreement,
which includes an interim autonomy deal that would defer
independence for at least three years.

<P>
   PARIS _ It looks, some say, like a European replay of the 1980s
on Wall Street: hostile takeovers, poison pills, white knights and
an endless stream of high-priced investment bankers pitching new
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Europe has never seen anything quite like it. LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton is trying to buy Gucci Group of Italy.
Gucci is seeking refuge by teaming up with yet another French
raider, Francois Pinault.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Olivetti, an Italian computer and communications
equipment maker, is making a hostile bid for Italy's biggest phone
company. And France's largest banks are in a three-way takeover
brawl that has amazed both the country's financial elite and the
French government.
</P>
<P>
   For all the adventurism, though, something big is missing.
Despite the talk of an integrating Europe driven to get together by
its new single currency, very few deals so far involve cross-border
transactions between European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many of the mergers seem intended at keeping foreigners
_ especially other Europeans _ at bay. Indeed, many such deals are
explicitly promoted on nationalistic grounds.
</P>
<P>
   When Banque Nationale de Paris announced a surprise bid to take
over its two main rivals, its chairman noted that ``there are three
main banks in France and they should remain in French hands.'' In
Italy, the head of Olivetti appealed to the same sentiments in
justifying his $58 billion hostile bid for the national telephone
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have a tendency of viewing banks or industrial
corporations as national treasures,'' said Herbert Aspbury, head of
client management at Chase Manhattan in Europe. ``This is probably
the first step or a necessary consolidation process, but I don't
think the second step of cross-border mergers will happen
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Europe's biggest cross-border deals have been with
American companies. Daimler-Benz took over Chrysler Corp. Deutsche
Bank is acquiring Bankers Trust. Koninklijke Ahold, a big Dutch
supermarket company, bought Giant Food in the Washington-Baltimore
area.
</P>
<P>
   Within Europe itself, national deals have been the rule. Banque
Nationale de Paris shocked the French establishment two weeks ago
by launching a hostile takeover attempt against Banque Paribas and
Societe Generale, just a month after those two announced their own
plans to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The French battle follows major bank mergers in Switzerland,
Spain and Germany. Indeed, Switzerland's two largest banks, UBS and
Swiss Bank Corp., set the pace a year ago by forming the world's
biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern has continued. Just last Sunday, Italy's four
biggest banks announced plans for two separate takeovers worth
about $26 billion in all.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism prevails as well in fields like car manufacturing.
The French government has made it clear it would almost certainly
block any attempt to buy Renault, in which it still owns 44 percent
of the shares. But it is willing to allow Renault to buy a 35
percent share of Japan's Nissan Motor. Fiat of Italy is out of
reach, because the Agnelli family retains firm control through a
convoluted network of affiliated companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers have run aground even in the defense industry, where
European governments badly want their national aerospace companies
to unite in a single powerful enterprise. Those plans have been
derailed by deep disagreements among British, French and German
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions seem to prove the rule, too. In what would be one
of Europe's biggest cross-border deals, Hoechst AG of Germany and
Rhone-Poulenc of France announced plans in December to merge their
pharmaceutical businesses. But that deal is on shaky ground, in
part because the two companies worked so hard to be politically
correct.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc agree to pool their
shares in a ``merger of equals,'' they also agreed to build a new
headquarters in Strasbourg, as close to the border between France
and Germany as it is possible to get.
</P>
<P>
   That was all well and good. The problem was that most experts
believe Hoechst is worth more than Rhone-Poulenc. That generated
complaints from Hoechst's biggest shareholder, Kuwait Petroleum
Corp., which is worried about being short-changed and has still not
given its approval.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the merger frenzy does signal a revolution in
European business practices. The clubby corporate networks, in
which banks and conglomerates hold each other's stocks, are
breaking down. Companies that once relied on their local bank to
raise money are now turning to global stock and bond markets. As a
result, European executives are more exposed to unwanted takeovers
if their companies' shares sink.
</P>
<P>
   But the upshot is a jarring blend of new-age buccaneering and
more old-fashioned national protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between these impulses is particularly vivid in
European banking, which has always been a politically sensitive
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent such evidence came this weekend, when four of
Italy's biggest banks announced two separate mergers. Unicredito
Italiano, itself the product of a smaller merger two years ago,
said it would acquire Banca Commerciale Italiana for $16 billion in
stock. San Paulo-IMI, Italy's biggest banking group, said it would
buy Banca di Roma for $9.7 billion in stock.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a fearsome barrage of air and missile power,
President Clinton and a largely American force Wednesday answered
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to end his
military offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But that answer in that small part of the world only raised
larger questions about US foreign policy all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   With US troops engaging in hostile action over Iraq, providing
security for embassies around the globe, responding to terrorist
attacks, assisting humanitarian operations after natural disasters,
and attempting to disrupt the production and movement of illegal
drugs, Washington is presiding over a military for all seasons, but
is motivated by no one great reason.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's response to the year-old crisis in Kosovo
demonstrated, as the US response to Saddam Hussein and to the
terrorists who bombed US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania did last
year, that Clinton's mobility in foreign affairs has not been
substantially curtailed. Despite his impeachment and the bitter
trial in the Senate, the president's ability and willingness to
project US force abroad has not been diminished.
</P>
<P>
   But the president still has not articulated a vision for the
role of America in world affairs, producing a vacuum not only in
this country, but also in diplomatic circles. In an age when there
is no Cold War antagonist, and when the threat from China is more
prospective than real, there remain no guidelines for the
application of US force, no walls between police action and
military action, no sturdy principles of US engagement.
</P>
<P>
   The president underlined the difficulty five weeks ago in his
radio address delivered the day after the Senate impeachment trial
ended. In his remarks proposing to send as many as 4,000 US troops
to Kosovo if a peace agreement were reached, Clinton said,
``America cannot be everywhere or do everything overseas. But we
must act where important interests are at stake and we can make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the principals in the Washington political wars has been
able to articulate when Americans should be involved, what US
interests are at stake, and how US forces can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   This discomfort was palpable in the capital this week, as the
Senate debated a measure that would have barred funding for
airstrikes and other military activities without explicit prior
congressional approval. As the likelihood of airstrikes grew, the
Senate put the measure aside in a gesture of solidarity when
American lives were on the line, but the discomfort remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo's crisis is now full-blown,'' the president said
Wednesday. ``And if we do not act, clearly it will get even worse.
Only firmness now can prevent greater catastrophe later.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the president set out three objectives _ to curtail
aggression, deter attacks on civilians, and damage Serbia's
capacity to continue its offensives against Kosovo _ there exists
no more fundamental expression of US objectives in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to fashion a coherent world view for the new
millennium is not confined to Clinton or to the Democrats.
Republicans, too, have been reluctant, if not unable, to establish
principles and guidelines for a world without superpower rivalry.
Though the Berlin Wall, and the world communist threat itself, fell
a decade ago, political leaders of both parties have struggled to
define the extent or, perhaps more important, the limits of US
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The split is evident even in the nascent GOP presidential
campaign. Among the contenders, three Republicans, Senator John
McCain of Arizona, publisher Steve Forbes, and former Governor
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, expressed support for airstrikes in
Yugoslavia before the operation began. The other candidates opposed
US involvement, with the exception of Elizabeth H. Dole, who had
not taken a position on the issue. Wednesday, however, she issued a
statement asserting that ``this action can be instrumental in
forging a peaceful solution to a dangerous, escalating military
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   This issue divides Republican candidates more than perhaps any
other as the 2000 campaign approaches. But presidential nomination
struggles rarely touch on foreign affairs _ the great exception in
recent years is 1968, when tensions over Vietnam boiled over in the
Democratic primaries _ and there is little indication the
candidates will clash over broad foreign policy objectives in the
next several months.
</P>
<P>
   The great expectation is that the Kosovo involvement would be
surgical and relatively brief, removing the overriding issue from
public attention _ but leaving the big questions unanswered.

 PARIS: in stock. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the biggest brawl is here in Paris, where bankers and
political leaders had become increasingly alarmed by the merger
mania under way from Switzerland to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   At a black-tie dinner hosted by France's top bank executives
last December, France's finance minister warned the bankers they
were in danger of being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often in the past, infighting in France has prevailed
against preparation for the future,'' said Dominique Strauss-Kahn,
the finance minister. ``Today, the following question is posed: How
do you _ how do we _ wish to manage these indispensable reforms?''
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear: The banks had to pull together or risk
being brushed aside. Indeed, the three biggest had already been
sounding each other out for more than a year. Michel Pebereau,
chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris, known universally by its
initials BNP, had fruitlessly courted Societe Generale. Banque
Paribas, which focuses on investment and corporate banking, had
repeatedly insisted that it did not want to merge with an ordinary
commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``In France, we were very late in restructuring our banking
industry,'' said Laurent Treca, a board member of BNP. ``Many of
the things taking place here had already occurred elsewhere in
Europe _ in Italy, in Spain, in Belgium. But in France, there were
no major moves on French banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government was desperately trying to privatize
the deeply troubled state-owned bank, Credit Lyonnais. Having
bailed out the government-owned bank from billions of francs worth
of bad loans in everything from French real estate to a Hollywood
studio, officials were (and still are) trying to sell off the
sanitized institution and its new management.
</P>
<P>
   But the French government made it clear it did not want its big
banks in foreign hands. Bidding rules for Credit Lyonnais blocked
any institution from acquiring more than 10 percent, and industry
executives argue that French regulators would have simply blocked
foreigners from taking over one of the three big healthy banks.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign rivals were certainly interested. Rolf-Ernst Breuer,
chairman of Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfort, repeatedly told analysts
and investors that he wanted to form an alliance with a French
bank. He even proposed buying a significant stake in Credit
Lyonnais.
</P>
<P>
   Though French regulators never explicitly blocked Deutsche Bank,
Breuer concluded that he could never make an acceptable deal. Last
month, he announced that Deutsche Bank would simply build its own
skeleton structure of 10 bank branches in France.
</P>
<P>
   But French banks were also under pressure from one of France's
most influential financial figures, Claude Bebear, chairman of the
French insurance conglomerate AXA. AXA holds about 6 percent of
BNP's shares and 7 percent of Paribas'. AXA executives sit on both
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Bebear, who had built AXA into a global giant by acquiring
companies as varied as Equitable Group in the United States and
Union Assurances de Paris, had been chafing for a merger for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he thinks is that French banks are too small and not
profitable enough,'' said Christophe Dufraux, a spokesman for AXA.
``If French banks want to be among the top players _ the way we did
it in insurance _ they needed to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say Bebear shook things up last October, when
he publicly criticized Banque Paribas for failing to convince
investors of the wisdom of its strategy. Though the comments were
measured, French banking executives immediately interpreted them as
a wake-up call for Paribas.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, continued to insist
throughout last fall that he still did not want to merge with a
retail bank. But he apparently changed his views in private, and
opened up talks with Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   When Paribas and Societe Generale announced their plan in early
February for a $16 billion merger, French government officials were
ecstatic. Strauss-Kahn called the merger ``a direct response'' to
his wishes and said it would lead to ``a strong and dynamic French
financial sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Pebereau said very little, but hired Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. as his
investment banker to map out a response. He got some help from
investors, who disliked the proposed merger and pushed down the
value of both Paribas and Societe Generale in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, BNP announced an unsolicited tender offer for all
the stock in both of its rivals. Pebereau, whose move stunned
government officials, was also quick to wave the French tricolor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is capable of dominating this sector on a global
scale,'' he said. ``Through this alliance, we do not risk losing
personality and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bebear of AXA publicly sided with Banque Nationale de Paris last
week. But analysts say it is far from clear that BNP will prevail.
The offer must still clear several hurdles with French regulators,
and the target banks may well fire back with a higher offer of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins, the deeper question is whether France
and indeed other European countries become more open to
cross-border mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer, of Deutsche Bank, politely announced in Frankfurt last
week that he would stay out of the fight unless he was invited in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening in front of our eyes in France right now is
very French,'' he said at a news conference to discuss his own
company's results last week. ``The nature of the process does not
allow a foreign bank to get involved.''

AN AVALANCHE IS STILL DEADLY

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The party of German skiers traveled from Berlin to
hit the slopes of Lech, Austria, for their Christmas vacation.
Their instructor had warned them snow conditions could not be more
dangerous, but they went anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor refused to take out the skiers when they arrived.
They called him a coward and said they would ski without a guide.
The instructor finally relented, insisting on leading them to the
least threatening descent he could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``He crossed it himself and then they followed and the whole
hillside came down in a rush, rising over them as a tidal wave
rises. Thirteen were dug out and nine of them were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer was not a contemporary news reporter describing last
month's ``white death'' in the Alps, but Ernest Hemingway. A skier
himself, he was chronicling the events of the winter of 1925-26 in
Austria, ``the year that so many people were killed in
avalanches.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced last month in Europe _ and by a recent fatal event
in Alaska _ avalanches remain as potentially deadly to skiers and
other winter recreationists today as in Hemingway's day. In Austria
alone, February's slides killed 38 people and stranded 15,000; at
least four people were killed Sunday when an avalanche buried
snowmobilers at Turnagain Pass, about 62 miles south of Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   But avalanche forecasting and preventive measures _ though far
from failsafe _ have advanced significantly since the mid-1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Europeans were a little shocked,'' observed
Richard Armstrong, a senior research scientist and avalanche expert
affiliated with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the
University of Colorado. ``They thought the barriers they'd built in
the mountains above the towns were more effective. They thought
they had better control.''
</P>
<P>
   Man is wresting better control over avalanches, at least on this
continent, according to Armstrong. Avalanche fatalities are
exceedingly rare for skiers schussing in-bounds and obeying posted
warning signs at North American ski resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what a ski area wants you to believe,'' Armstrong said.
``There's risk in every recreational activity, but that's a minimal
one. Anything that happens is usually out-of-bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this sense of security is the improvement in
forecasting techniques for comparatively small areas, such as ski
resorts. A typical forecast might span only a half-dozen avalanche
paths. These routes are not surveyed by a ski patroller digging
holes to determine the snow's stability but by one of many
``automatic weather stations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the sophistication of these automatic weather
stations, you can get a much better idea any time of day what the
weather is doing to increase avalanche hazards,'' Armstrong
explained. ``So instead of having only one (manned) station, they
have an array of automatic stations scattered around at critical
points of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Augmenting the weather stations is another method of forecasting
known as ``nearest-neighbor models.'' In this approach, a
forecaster enters data on weather and snowpack at a given location
in his computer, which searches for similar conditions at adjacent
sites to determine whether they've led to avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   The information these techniques try to uncover is how likely
the snowpack is able to support its own weight, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   For backcountry skiers who might visit a resort only to ride
lifts that provide access to out-of-bounds terrain, the outlook is
entirely different. (Skiing in unpatrolled areas outside a resort's
boundary is permitted, as long as there are no signs indicating
they are closed to the public.)
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for large wilderness areas are little more than
educated guesses, based on assessments of snow characteristics by
observers. In Colorado, for example, some 30 to 40 observers might
telephone their assessments to the state's avalanche center, which
uses the data to provide general information on avalanche hazards
for several regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put instruments on every slope or every
mountaintop,'' Armstrong said. ``So the focus is on education. We
try to educate people so they can get basic information on how a
snowpack has developed. Once they're out there, we hope they can
make the right decisions.''

JUSTICES QUESTION PRESENCE OF NEWS CREWS IN POLICE SEARCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supreme Court justices across the ideological
spectrum were sharply critical Wednesday of police and other law
enforcement officers who allow reporters and photographers to
accompany them as they search homes for evidence and suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you have to take photographers into someone's house?''
Justice David H. Souter demanded of a lawyer for two groups of
federal agents who brought journalists with them as they executed
search and arrest warrants on a Montana ranch and in a Maryland
home. ``You can have a news conference when it's over,'' the
justice said.
</P>
<P>
   The question before the court was whether media ``ride-alongs''
of this sort violate the constitutional rights of people whose
encounters with law enforcement authorities turn into unwelcomed
photo opportunities. Two cases, combined Wednesday in a single
argument, demonstrated both the variety of police-press
collaboration and the range of judicial responses to it.
</P>
<P>
   One federal appeals court, ruling in a Montana case in which a
Cable News Network crew accompanied federal wildlife agents onto a
ranch to search for evidence that eagles were being illegally
killed there, held that the network's presence turned a lawful
search into one that was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
The court, the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in San Francisco,
reinstated a suit the ranch owners had brought against the agents
and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, almost simultaneously, another federal
appeals court refused to allow a Maryland couple to pursue their
suit against county and Federal agents who brought a Washington
Post reporter and photographer into their house in an unsuccessful
effort to arrest their son, a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   That court, the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in Richmond,
Va., held that no matter what the constitutional merits of the
couple's lawsuit _ a question it did not decide _ the law at the
time of the search in 1992 was sufficiently unclear as to make the
officers immune from personal liability.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning one of the agents' lawyers Wednesday, Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor described the Maryland incident as ``an amazing
invasion'' of the couple's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Souter dismissed as ``fluff'' the proposition by a lawyer for
the federal agents that the presence of the news media at searches
and arrests serves a broader public interest by documenting police
behavior and preventing abuses.
</P>
<P>
   From the justices' responses Wednesday, a two-part decision
would not be surprising. The court could rule both that the police
practices violate the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits
unreasonable searches, while at the same time concluding that these
particular officers, operating in the early 1990s under official
manuals that encouraged ride-alongs as good public relations, could
not reasonably have been expected to know that.
</P>
<P>
   The liability of the media itself is not directly at issue in
the cases before the court, Wilson vs. Layne, No. 98-83, and Hanlon
vs. Berger, No. 97-1927. The Maryland couple, Charles and Geraldine
Wilson of Rockville, did not sue the Washington Post. The Montana
ranchers, Paul and Erma Berger, did sue CNN along with the federal
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Constitution applies only to government behavior, a
private entity such as a television network would ordinarily not be
liable for a constitutional violation, but the 9th Circuit held
that CNN's close cooperation with the government agents had made
the network a ``state actor.'' The justices have taken no action on
CNN's appeal, which remains pending on the Supreme Court's docket.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cordray, the lawyer representing the federal agents in
both cases, told the court that whether media involvement turns a
particular search from a lawful into an unconstitutional one should
depend on a ``reasonableness test'' that would ``balance the nature
of the intrusion and the objective served'' by the media's
participation. The purpose of the Fourth Amendment was ``not only
to preserve privacy but to prevent abuses of government power,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not every day that lawyers for law enforcement agencies
sing the Fourth Amendment's praises before the Supreme Court, and
Justice Antonin Scalia could not resist teasing Cordray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not say to the person, we're going to do you a favor'' by
bringing a news crew along to show that a search was ``absolutely
fair,'' Scalia said, adding: ``Why don't you ask the homeowner if
he wants that protection? Why force it on him?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Willard, the lawyer representing the Maryland couple,
said the court should apply ``not a balancing test, but a
bright-line rule drawn at the door of the home.'' He said that when
the police execute a warrant, ``they have one purpose, to
effectuate an arrest, not to bring along the media on a
news-gathering expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices indicated by their questions that they saw
important differences between reporters and photographers covering
searches and arrests in a home, on the one hand, and in less
private places, on the other. They asked questions about the
daylong search of the Bergers' 75,000-acre ranch that were not
resolved during the course of the argument.
</P>
<P>
   The search took place on the grounds and in outbuildings. The
agents briefly entered the ranch house but did not search it. One
wore a hidden microphone that broadcast conversations taking place
in the house for CNN's benefit. A CNN camera was mounted on the
front of one of the government cars. The network withheld its
broadcast until after Berger's criminal trial in 1994 on charges of
poisoning eagles; he was acquitted of that charge, but convicted of
a misdemeanor, misusing a pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing in the press was absolutely designed to maximize the
intrusion,'' Henry Rossbacher, the Bergers' lawyer, told the court,
adding: ``There can be no greater affront to privacy than a
worldwide broadcast.''

   AVIANO AIR BASE, Italy _ As the sun sank, American and NATO
warplanes rose into a misty Italian sky to deliver the
long-promised punishment to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 6 p.m. local time on Wednesday, two U.S. Air Force
F-16s, their wings bristling with missiles and bombs, led the wave
from the long and wide runway at this air base Italy shares with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The planes were followed by almost seamless stream of aircraft
-- futuristic F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter-bombers, F-18s
fighters piloted by the Canadians and the Spanish, A-10
tank-killing Warthogs, EA-6B Prowler radar-jamming aircraft, and
modified C-130 cargo planes which serve as airborne command centers
to direct the air assault.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles are the U.S. military's weapon of choice in this
high-tech version of gunboat diplomacy, as practiced this decade in
Iraq and the Balkans. They are accurately guided by satellites,
fired from a distance and place no U.S. personal at risk. Scores
were launched by U.S. Navy ships on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are greater and more perilous at Aviano.
</P>
<P>
   In 100 minutes Wednesday at dusk, some 70 planes thundered into
the air from a single runway nestled in this bucolic valley in
Northern Italy. The waxen smell of jet fuel hung in the air, as did
an unspoken anxiety about the mission American pilots were leading.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials stress that pilots from five NATO nations are
involved in operations from Aviano. But American flyers comprise
the bulk of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 U.S. pilots and servicemen live and work at this
air base and the hamlet of Aviano nearby. An olive-drab tent city
near the aircraft hangers accommodates many of those without
families.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials and the families of the pilots are naturally
fearful that some of the planes will not come back, a fact made
clear in Aviano not by what they said, but by what they refused to
say.
</P>
<P>
   In the town center, American dependents did not want to discuss
the night's mission. At the base, the U.S. commander, Air Force
Brig. Gen. Daniel Leaf, considered holding a news conference, but
in the end decided to remain quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were told the pilots would not be available for
interviews now or in the future during the operation against
Serbia. Media exposure would identify them to the Serbs and thus
jeopardize them should they have to bail out over hostile
territory, said Maj. Scott Vadnais, an air force spokesman at
Aviano.
</P>
<P>
   Watching warplanes rip into the night sky, punctuated by the hot
glow of their afterburners, is not unlike watching a violent
thunderstorm -- simultaneously beautiful and frightening. The
multi-billion dollar arsenal of warplanes at Aviano is profoundly
graceful and terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic will wonder what hit him,'' a camouflage-clad U.S.
airman said to himself while standing on the tarmac watching the
planes soar to the east, across the Adriatic Sea and on to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no open discussion here of the failed diplomacy
over Kosovo and the ultimate effect of this night's formidable rain
of pain on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The focus was starting and completing the first night of combat
for which pilots have trained for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pointy-end-of-the-spear kind of experience,'' said
Vadnais.

GEORGIA LEGISLATURE APPROVES PLAN FOR TRANSPORTATION SUPERAGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In January, it seemed a radical proposal for a
conservative state: a transportation superagency with broad powers
to impose transit systems and highways on local governments,
restrict development, and even put pressure on cities and counties
to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many supporters predicted that Gov. Roy E. Barnes would have a
hard time getting his plan through a skeptical state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a measure of the seriousness of Atlanta's struggles
with traffic and sprawl that both houses of the Legislature passed
the proposal on Tuesday with only a few mutterings of dissent, and
only one change of any significance.
</P>
<P>
   When Barnes signs the bill early next month, Georgia will assume
a leading role in the growing national effort to limit the urban
sprawl that is choking so many cities in air pollution and traffic
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do something fairly drastic to reverse a 30-year
trend of developments that allowed Atlanta to sprawl,'' said John
A. Williams, chairman of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce,
which put the full force of the local business community behind the
bill. ``We're going to have to work very hard to quickly reverse
this trend, while still allowing the region to grow and prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   So many people are moving to Atlanta that ever-widening rings of
rural counties around the city are finding their roads clogged with
commuters. The region, which has doubled its population in the last
three decades, to 3.1 million people, is ineligible for federal
money for new road projects because its ozone level is one of the
worst in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes acknowledged Wednesday that the problems will take years
to correct. But the bill is intended to overcome years of inaction
and squabbling among local governments in the 13-county Atlanta
area, many of which have competed for new development while
remaining unable to agree on a regional plan for growth and mass
transit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, if a county decides to build a shopping mall in
an overly congested area, or an area without adequate
transportation, a newly created Georgia Regional Transportation
Authority could in essence veto the mall by refusing to issue
permits necessary to tie it into the road system. The authority can
plan and build new rail or bus systems or car-pool lanes, and if a
county balks at paying required taxes, the authority can withhold
vital state money until the county complies.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, whose election campaign last year was based on a promise
to reduce congestion, staked much of his political capital on the
bill, and is likely to have the loudest voice in how it is
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday he would like to see more buses and some light
rail lines built in the region, and because he appoints the 15
members of the authority, his proposals are being taken very
seriously. Many people involved in shaping the bill said
legislators seemed relieved that a prominent political figure was
willing to stake his reputation on such an intractable issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the previous reluctance of this region to come together
around regional solutions, I thought it would be very tough to get
this passed,'' said Jim Chapman, executive director of Georgians
for Transportation Alternatives, a citizens group that supported
the bill. ``But what happened was that almost everyone now accepts
there is problem. When Barnes said give me the magic wand and don't
complain, no one else had a better idea.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Early on, the biggest stumbling block appeared to be rural
legislators, concerned that the authority would spend the state's
transportation dollars exclusively on Atlanta. Barnes had to
compromise on a formula that guaranteed counties outside the
Atlanta region a steady stream of road money.
</P>
<P>
   But many lawmakers also seemed impressed by a Georgia State
University study that showed the effect on the rest of the state if
Atlanta began to be perceived as a dirty, congested city and its
growth began to decline: a loss of 530,000 jobs outside the
metropolitan area by 2050, along with cutbacks of up to $1.7
billion a year in state money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they realized that if we didn't do something in the
metro area, there was going to be a great big sucking sound when
those federal dollars are withdrawn,'' said Charlie Smith Jr., a
state representative who helped manage the bill through the House.
``And we couldn't abandon the metropolitan Atlanta area, so when
all that federal money was gone, some state money would have to go
in and where was it coming from? From the rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The final votes _ 41-12 in the Senate, and 158-14 in the House _
were considered a triumph for Barnes, who also won most of the rest
of his legislative package. But in a news conference Wednesday, he
took pains to reassure the state that his Transportation Authority
would not shut down the engine of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole process in regard to regional transportation has
been to make sure we continue to grow and not to stop it,'' Barnes
said. ``But it has to be growth in a planned sort of way; it has to
be growth that is served by infrastructure. These are tough
decisions that have to be made, but we have the framework in place
now to make those tough decisions and to begin the solution to the
problems.''

 &HT;    Jazz trumpeter captures film roots on new album
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard has been living a
double life. His career divides neatly between tours and recordings
with his band and his work as a composer for movie soundtracks _
most frequently with Spike Lee, an association that began with
``School Daze'' (1987).
</P>
<P>
   But with his latest album, ``Jazz in Film'' (Sony Classical),
the 37-year-old New Orleans native combines the best of both
worlds. Among the movie themes Blanchard arranges are those for
``Chinatown,'' ``The Subterraneans,'' ``Taxi Driver'' and his own
``Clockers.'' It also includes two selections from Duke Ellington,
whose themes for ``Anatomy of a Murder'' and ``Degas' Racing
World'' make the most sensible segue into the combo format.
</P>
<P>
   We recently spoke with Blanchard, who brings his sextet to
Sambuca's Jazz Cafe for shows tonight and Friday. Audiences can
expect to hear some snappy new approaches to vintage cinematic
sounds. And, guaranteed, it'll be Celine Dion-free.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You had the great tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson on the
album. He must have been a treat to work with?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like a dream come true. There were huge lessons to learn
there. We took a lunch break and we all were out in the lobby
trying to figure out what we were going to eat. I realized that Joe
wasn't there, so I went to find out if there was anything he
wanted. There's Joe Henderson at the piano with the (sheet) music
playing through all the chord changes. That a person on that level
sits down and does that and has so much respect for the music
taught me a lesson. My hunger went away _ quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You did the score for Spike Lee's upcoming film, ``Summer of
Sam.'' Doesn't that seem to be a departure for him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Everybody says that. The interesting thing about it is it
seems to be a departure. Spike is very much like Woody Allen. Those
guys do New York stories. They have a certain style. The Son of Sam
is definitely a New York thing and that fits up Spike's alley. I
remember when I moved away from Brooklyn. Man, I thought he was
going to hang me!
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Son of Sam?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, Spike! He's such a New York guy.''
</P>

 &HT;    Gas companies' competition for business accounts heats up
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost six months after Georgia's natural gas industry
was deregulated, marketers are going after business customers
tooth-and-nail.
</P>
<P>
   They have gone to great lengths to snag residential customers,
with expensive ad campaigns, free gas credits and other giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta Gas Light Co.'s 100,000 business customers _
accounting for only 7 percent of the total _ are perhaps the most
highly prized because they offer ``more bang for the buck.'' More
gas is sold for every dollar spent on marketing, billing and
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dogfight,'' said Timothy Sheehan, marketing manager for
Shell Energy Services. He noted one business can easily buy the
equivalent amount of gas as 400 homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very competitive, more than residential,'' added Deb
Stone, commercial marketing director at Columbia Energy. ``Larger
accounts can be easier to serve and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Darby, senior vice president at SCANA Energy, said the
South Carolina-based supplier decided early on to focus on
residential customers rather than face the ``huge amount of
competition'' in the commercial market. SCANA claims a 45 percent
market share, with businesses accounting for only 2 percent of its
total customers.
</P>
<P>
   A. Clifton Payne, vice president for marketing at Georgia
Natural Gas Services, said some competitors have engaged in
``irrational pricing'' to build their commercial customer rolls.
``I don't see how some of the marketers can sustain the pricing
they have for some of the customers right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many larger companies, empowered by the sheer volume of gas
they purchase, have been able to negotiate special rates. Some have
hired high-powered consultants to negotiate contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Clarkson, senior vice president of Service Resources, said
his Atlanta-based energy consulting company has represented
companies such as Home Depot, Target, Wachovia, Emory University,
Haverty's and Upton's. He said many of his clients are saving ``at
least 30 percent'' on their gas bills.
</P>
<P>
   Most marketers quote standard rates for smaller businesses that
are lower by a few cents per therm than residential rates. But as
establishments and their consumption gets larger, marketers become
more willing to cut special deals.
</P>
<P>
   Larger business customers are even taking bids. In many cases,
employees who also sign up are offered reduced rates for their
homes. Special rates also have been negotiated with trade
associations that give marketers the inside track with member
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most highly-sought accounts are those with multiple
locations. Restaurants and fast-food chains are at a premium
because they use high volumes of gas year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell-based Peachtree Natural Gas even put a Korean-American
dry cleaner on commission to market to the hundreds of cleaners
operated by Koreans in the metro area. John Kim, who operates a
cleaner in Buckhead, first approached Peachtree in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knocked on the door, introduced himself and said he had
definite marketing plans in mind,'' said Donna Peeples, vice
president of Peachtree. Kim secured the endorsement for Peachtree
of the 300-member Korean Cleaners Association of Atlanta and has
signed up about 120 dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   Dry cleaners are a ``good, steady load,'' Peeples said. ``It's
one thing to have heavy usage in the winter, when everybody else is
using gas, but it's another to have a steady baseload year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim said monthly gas bills can run anywhere between $600 and
$1,200 and that Peachtree's rates are between 25 percent and 30
percent cheaper than Atlanta Gas Light Co.'s.
</P>
<P>
   Some Korean cleaners may not be totally fluent in English and
have language problems negotiating with marketers. But, Kim said,
``Money talks. Everybody understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Yun Kim, who operates a dry cleaner in Roswell and is president
of the cleaners' association, cited savings as his reason for
signing up with Peachtree.
</P>
<P>
   Shell has signed agreements with the Building Owners and
Managers of Atlanta and Georgia Textile Manufactuers Association,
both huge gas consumers, to make special rates available to members
and their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Shell is also supplying Georgia restaurants of McDonald's,
Popeyes and Church's fried chicken. The Houston-based company hopes
to develop national accounts with such companies as deregulation
expands into gas and electric utilities in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Among other deals:
</P>
<P>
   _ United Gas Management has signed up Harry's Farmers Market and
United Parcel Service's corporate headquarters in Sandy Springs,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   _ GasKey is serving DeKalb County Schools, Zoo Atlanta and 200
U.S. post offices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reliant, formerly known as Noram Energy Management, has scored
with Home Depot. Jim Laird, manager of energy programs at Home
Depot, said the company is saving about 20 percent on annual gas
bills for its 25 Georgia superstores, totaling about $300,000 last
year. He attributed most of the savings to lower gas commodity
costs and said deregulation has allowed the home imporovement
retailer to take maximum advantage of commodity price swings. Home
Depot's contract with Reliant pegs rates to prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia Natural Gas Services has a contract to provide gas
service to 19 Georgia Applebee's and Rio Bravo restaurants. William
R. Kampbell, energy buyer for Kansas-based Applebee's
International, said a contract will reduce annual gas bills from
$145,623 last year to $11,959 this year.

SKEPTICAL JUSTICES QUESTION POLICE ALLOWING MEDIA TO JOIN THEM ON
ARRESTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday considered whether
police violate the Constitution when they allow reporters to
accompany them on arrests or searches of a suspect's property.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, hearing cases from Montana and Maryland, also
weighed whether police who invite the media along can be held
liable for violating the suspect's Fourth Amendment right against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices, citing the privacy rights of individuals,
appeared disturbed by the decision of U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service officers to bring television reporters and cameras along as
they searched Paul and Erma Berger's 75,000-acre Montana ranch on
March 24, 1993. Justices also seemed perturbed, based on the same
privacy concerns, with the decision of the U.S. Marshals Service
and local police to allow two newspaper reporters, one with a still
camera, to join the officers as they tried to execute an arrest
warrant at the Rockville, Md., home of fugitive Dominic Wilson's
parents at 6:45 a.m. April 14, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The cases the high court heard depart from the usual Fourth
Amendment litigation in which a defendant urges the justices to
rule a search unconstitutional in order to prevent incriminating
evidence from being used in court.
</P>
<P>
   In the Montana and Maryland cases, the people searched are suing
the police, saying the officers violated their constitutional right
against unreasonable searches and seizures by bringing the media
along.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the police argued that the officers acted
constitutionally when they invited the reporters. But even if the
police did violate the Constitution, they cannot be sued because
they acted under a reasonable belief that their actions were
legitimate, the attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys for the people searched countered that the
officers exceeded their constitutional authority. The attorneys
also argued that the police could not have reasonably believed that
bringing reporters and cameras to watch them execute search and
arrest warrants was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Richard Cordray, representing the police in the Montana
and Maryland cases, told the high court that officers have a
legitimate interest in having reporters join them as they execute
warrants. He said media coverage of the police in action could
boost public confidence in crime fighters and deter people from
violating the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Justices David H. Souter and Antonin Scalia expressed
concern that police, in their desire for good public relations,
might trample on the privacy rights of people. Souter said the
police can avoid the privacy issue by holding press conferences
after executing a search warrant and extolling how successful their
action was.
</P>
<P>
   A sarcastic Scalia wondered aloud if the police have enough
authority to let family members attend an arrest or search.
Imagining himself the subject of a police search, Scalia told
Cordray that ``personally, I'd rather have your sister-in-law
along'' than the media.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from the justices, Cordray, of Grove City,
Ohio, conceded that police bringing reporters into a person's home
would raise serious constitutional concerns. But Cordray, referring
to the Maryland case, said it is reasonable for the media to be
present when officers execute an arrest warrant, one of the most
important elements of police work.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting Cordray, attorney Lawrence Fletcher-Hill argued that
the police cannot be held liable even if the high court decides
that the Constitution barred them from inviting the media to the
searches. No court had ruled on the validity of the controversial
searches when they were conducted in the early 1990s and,
therefore, it was ``reasonable'' for the police to believe their
invitations were proper, argued Fletcher-Hill, an assistant
attorney general of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the people searched, Henry Rossbacher, said that
the police may invite to arrests and searches only those people
needed to help in executing the warrant, which generally does not
include reporters. For example, police searching someone's house
for stolen goods can certainly bring along the person whose items
were stolen to identify the property, said Rossbacher of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Assisting Rossbacher, attorney Richard Willard objected to the
contention that the police acted reasonably in bringing reporters
along, saying the media's attendance violated the privacy rights of
those searched. Willard, of Washington, urged the justices to adopt
``a bright line rule drawn at the front door of the home,'' which
the police cannot allow the media to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Media outlets joined in a legal brief urging the justices to
rule for the police. ``A rule that it is unreasonable per se to
permit the press to observe the execution of a search warrant will
unnecessarily deprive the public of valuable information about the
functioning of its government,'' the media companies wrote in their
brief.
</P>
<P>
   Souter said officers could reasonably believe that media
presence during an arrest or at a search is a valid method for
building public support for law enforcement. ``We live in a
political world,'' said Souter, adding that good press could result
in increased funding for the police.
</P>
<P>
   Willard, however, rejected the public-relations argument, saying
``the framers of the Fourth Amendment would roll over in their
graves'' if police were free to bring reporters into the private
residences of people being arrested or searched.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the cases,
Hanlon vs. Berger and Wilson vs. Layne, by July.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the controversial search of the Bergers' Montana ranch,
officers found the poison Furadan, which Paul Berger put on sheep
carcasses in an attempt to kill eagles and other predators on his
ranch. Paul was convicted of the federal crime of using a
registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.
</P>
<P>
   The Bergers sued the officers who invited the media. The 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, reversing a lower
court decision against the Bergers, said it was unreasonable for an
officer to believe he could invite reporters on a search.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland case, police, with reporters in tow, entered the
home of Charles and Geraldine Wilson, whose son was wanted on a
charge of violating probation. The officers found Charles Wilson in
his underwear and Geraldine Wilson in a sheer nightgown. One
reporter took notes and the other took pictures. Charles and
Geraldine Wilson sued the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
reversing a lower court decision for the Wilsons, said the officers
reasonably believed their invitation to the media was permissible.
The appeals court did not address whether the police violated the
Fourth Amendment.

 &HT;    Unknown physical force may be pushing Pioneer 10
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Strange things are happening to Pioneer 10, the little
spacecraft launched in 1972 and now winging its way through deep
space outside our solar system, researchers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists described the problem as a slight, unexplained
acceleration of the spacecraft. A similar problem is affecting its
sister craft, Pioneer 11. Nothing that the physicists have in their
repertoire of possible causes can explain the situation -
suggesting an unknown physical force may be acting to speed the
spacecraft along.
</P>
<P>
   If no explanation is forthcoming, ``then we must consider the
small probability that nature is saying something new,'' says
Martin Nieto, a physicist with the Los Alamos National Laboratoryo.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto presented the findings at the 100th annual meeting of the
American Physical Society in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He said several explanations have been offered for the slight
acceleration, but none of them are conclusion. For instance,
scientists thought it might be due to heat from the instrument
compartment being vented from the rear of the craft, computer
errors or gas leaks from the altitude-control thrusters. But none
of those pan out.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists have suggested that a fifth unknown force - the
other four are gravity; electromagnetism and the strong and weak
forces in atoms - may be present in the universe, but none was
willing to discuss such a possibility on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nieto said the effect is not observed in planetary or asteroid
orbits. What is needed is a force that affects the 570-pound
Pioneer spacecraft, but does not affect planets or asteroids. That
would be a ``tall order,'' Nieto said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers are the first man-made objects to break free of our
solar system. The spacecraft are expected to travel for thousands
of years, eventually within hailing distance of other stars.
</P>
<P>
   In other reports Wednesday at the APS meeting:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Researchers with NASA say that almost everywhere they look in
the universe, they are finding an abundance of big organic
molecules. These molecules may be the precursors for life, and
their ubiquitous presence adds more evidence to theories that life
may be common in the universe. ``We probably are only at the
beginning for finding even more complex organic molecules,'' said
Lou Allamandola of NASA's Ames Research Center in California.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  John Simpson, a noted University of Chicago scientist who also
worked on the Manhattan Project that produced the world's first
atomic bomb, urged the development of safe nuclear reactors that
could meet a growing energy demand while reducing the risk of
nuclear fuel proliferation for bombs. ``The world isn't going to
wait around for the United States to phase out of nuclear energy,''
said Simpson. ``The developing nations represent 90 percent of the
world's population and they're going to go nuclear. We have to face
that fact.''

<P>
   It's a message he's been touting this week at the 100th
anniversary meeting of the American Physical Society. Krauss, who
has been called the successor to Carl Sagan for popularizing
science among the masses, ridicules the idea of an alien invasion _
and other sci-fi concepts masquerading as science on popular TV
shows and movies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there are no extraterrestrials out there. Krauss
believes millions of planets around other stars in the universe
harbor life, although far fewer probably have intelligent life. But
he believes even if advanced civilizations exist elsewhere in the
universe, they are bound by the same laws of physics we are. Those
laws would make it pretty tough for them to get to Earth or
anywhere else in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the nearest star to Earth is about four light
years away. Others are hundreds, thousands and even millions of
light years away. A light year is the distance light, which travels
at 186,000 miles per hour, travels in an entire year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in empty
space, so you don't just zip from star to star,'' says Krauss. Even
if an advanced civilization could build a spaceship that could
travel at near the speed of light, the energy requirement would be
stupendous, equivalent to the energy produced by many stars.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss is especially critical of TV shows and movies that
purport to explore reports of alien visitation, from mind-altering
implants to abductions, and treat it as ``news.'' One such program
was broadcast in February by NBC: ``Confirmation: The Hard Evidence
of Aliens Among Us?''
</P>
<P>
   It is little more than ``yellow journalism,'' says Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss, however, is a fan of ``Star Trek,'' the TV and movie
series about the starship Enterprise's travels through the
universe. In flitting about the galaxy, the ship bends all kinds of
physics laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's compelling science fiction,'' he says, adding that he is
fascinated with the explanations the crew offers for overcoming the
limits of physics.
</P>
<P>
   In his lectures and in his 1996 book ``The Physics of Star
Trek,'' Krauss reveals what the series got wrong _ and what it got
right _ about science.
</P>
<P>
   An example of a ``physics blooper'': One episode shows an
explosion in space, obviously hundreds of miles away, as viewed
from the bridge of the Enterprise. It is seen and heard at exactly
the same moment, even though sound does not travel in empty space.
(And even if it did, light and sound travel at different speeds.)
</P>
<P>
   Krauss also pokes holes in the idea of a transporter, the ``Star
Trek'' gizmo that gave rise to the phrase, ``Beam me up, Scotty.''
One of the many problems he finds with such a machine is having to
encode all the information in a human body _ including all of the
atoms whose number amounts to 10 followed by 28 zeros _ to zap it
from one place to another. ``That's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he puts down most of ``Star Trek's'' gadgets and gizmos,
he ends up on the side of human imagination. While its writers may
not have gotten everything right, the power of the imagination
could one day make travel to the stars possible. ``But it will
never be a round trip.''

KINGS HOPING TO FINISH 9-3 TO MAKE PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even for one of the top teams in the NHL, the task
would be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   And the Los Angeles Kings are not one of the top teams in the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   As they looked Wednesday at the schedule for the final
three-plus weeks of the regular season, beginning with a home game
tonight against the league-leading Dallas Stars, several Kings made
a prediction: The team probably needs to post a 9-3 record in its
final 12 games to have a realistic shot at making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the hunt,'' defenseman Doug Bodger said
following practice at Iceoplex. ``We're going to do our best to put
a streak together.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings finish 9-3, it will be a major accomplishment,
considering the remaining schedule includes two games against
Dallas, two at Colorado and one at Detroit, the three teams most
likely to skate with the Stanley Cup at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a visit to Boston, where the Kings have won twice
since the 1980-81 season, two games at Nashville (the Kings are 0-2
against the first-year Predators), a home game against the Mighty
Ducks (against whom they are 0-5 this season) and a home game
against the St. Louis Blues (who the Kings haven't beaten in two
years).
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to go after this first game,'' Coach Larry
Robinson said when asked if there was a more palatable way for the
Kings to view their task. ``It's all you can worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the first game is against the Stars, against whom
the Kings have suffered four one-goal losses this season. The Kings
haven't beaten Dallas since Barry Melrose was coach, posting an
0-10-6 record since then. ``I'm sure it's definitely a mental
thing,'' Robinson said. ``You question if you're ever going to beat
them. I think if there ever was a time where we wanted to beat
them, this would be the time.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE PUCKS: Defenseman Dave Babych, acquired Tuesday in the
trade that sent Steve Duchesne to Philadelphia, is expected to
participate in the morning skate today, but probably will not play
tonight, Robinson said. ``I think he brings a hell of a lot of
experience,'' Robinson said. ``He maybe will give us some
stability. He's not the answer to the future. But he's still a good
player.'' Babych, 37, was the second player chosen in the 1980
draft, right after the late Doug Wickenheiser was selected by
Montreal and eight picks before the Kings chose Jim Fox, now the
color commentator on their telecasts. ... Of the Duchesne trade,
Robinson said, ``I'll be the first one to say he's not totally the
reason we are where we are. At the same time, he's part of the
reason. We had higher expectations of him running the power play
and it didn't work out.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an unexpected move that is likely to dampen merger
speculation surrounding the nation's third-largest bank, the Chase
Manhattan Corp. said Wednesday that William B. Harrison would
succeed Walter V. Shipley as chief executive on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Chase also said that Thomas G. Labrecque, 60, the bank's
president and chief operating officer, would retire on June 1.
Harrison, 55, currently a vice chairman who supervises Chase's
lucrative corporate banking and trading businesses, will assume
Labrecque's duties at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley, 63, who will remain the bank's chairman, has repeatedly
said that he plans to retire at the latest by November 2000, after
his 65th birthday. Analysts and other observers had expected a new
chief executive to be named closer to that date. Within the bank,
it was widely believed that Shipley might try to recruit a new
chief executive through a merger with another major financial
services firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the promotion of Harrison, who is slated to add the
chairman's title to his portfolio when Shipley retires, resolves
the timing of the succession issue at Chase _ if not fully putting
to rest the possibility of a merger sometime within the next year
or two. Chase has courted a number of brokerage firms recently but
is not desperate to consummate a merger, largely because of the
stellar financial results the bank has been posting.
</P>
<P>
   While Shipley's imminent retirement undoubtedly made the bank
more attractive to certain merger partners, Shipley scoffed at the
notion that he was holding his job out to affect a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press reports that sort of portray me wandering around
offering the CEO position, that's not how things work,'' he said
Wednesday. ``We feel very comfortable with how the company is today
and looking forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase executives and bank advisers have said privately that
Chase, which wants to enhance its ability to underwrite and sell
stock, is likely to try to snap up Lehman and Paine Webber in quick
succession or merge with J.P. Morgan rather than pursue a deal with
larger firms like Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Merrill's chief executive, David H. Komansky, told analysts last
Friday that his company, while not ruling out a merger in the
future, was in no hurry to do a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Harrison's ascension indicates that Chase
will eventually set its sights on a smaller partner. ``I think the
perception in some quarters that they were managing the company for
a merger may have caused some unrest within the senior ranks,''
said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``But I
think the announcement will probably deflate takeover speculation
involving major brokerage firms and may lead to a deal with a
second-tier firm like Lehman Brothers, Paine Webber, or J.P.
Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Merger issues aside, Harrison, who joined Chase in 1967 after
earning a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of
North Carolina, was not considered a shoe-in for the top job. An
executive reshuffling in late 1997 appeared to weaken Harrison's
position at the bank, leading many analysts to believe that Marc
Shapiro, Chase's head of finance and risk management, would succeed
Shipley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Harrison is a very reasonable choice but I think the view
on the Street was that Marc was going to get the job,'' said David
Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. ``Having said
that, this is a real vote for continuity because Harrison's done a
very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, although not regarded as a particularly charismatic
leader, has a strong command of Chase's operations and has
effectively corralled some of the more abrasive egos within Chase's
executive suite, most notably that of James B. Lee, the volatile
head of Chase's large corporate lending business.
</P>
<P>
   Shipley, a modest and well-regarded executive who has quietly
managed two of the largest mergers in the banking industry,
Wednesday made note of Harrison's talent for managing diverse
personalities. Shipley said that was one of the leading factors in
Harrison's favor when he began asking Chase's board to anoint his
successor about six months ago, a decision which he said had
nothing to do with merger considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the board's judgment that he was the right guy,''
Shipley said in a telephone interview. ``Bill is the architect of
what now represents about two-thirds of the bank's earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said he planned to make few drastic changes. ``The
value story that Walter and Tom have created here is something I
feel great about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added he would continue to oversee Chase's corporate
businesses and did not intend to appoint a chief operating officer,
president or any other executive to be second-in-command. He said
all of the bank's senior executives in the consumer and corporate
businesses would retain their current titles and positions.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was speculation Wednesday about Shapiro's
commitment to Chase after having been passed over for the chief
executive's spot, Shapiro said in an interview that he was
``excited about the company'' and firmly intended to stay. He noted
that he and Harrison had been close friends for two decades and
that he ``admires what Bill has done'' at Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Although Labrecque shared senior duties with Shipley, he was
never considered a serious contender for the chief executive spot.
Labrecque was the chief executive of Chase Manhattan when it merged
with Shipley's Chemical Banking Corp. in 1996. The new bank kept
the Chase name, but was otherwise dominated by Chemical executives.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts expected Labrecque to leave after that
merger was completed, he remained longer largely because of his own
determination and Shipley's willingness to accept him as an equal.

TURKEY NIGHT OFFERS SMALL TASTE OF INDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Some have called Irwindale Speedway a mini
version of nearby California Speedway in Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 25, it will seem more like Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   That's the night when the twin-ring oval is the site of the 59th
Turkey Night Grand Prix, the Indy 500 of open-wheel midget cars.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several marquee races on Irwindale's 68-event
inaugural season schedule. Others include two NASCAR Featherlite
Southwest series races on July 31 and Oct. 2 and a USAC Coors
Silver Crown series event on Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   None should be be bigger then the Turkey Night Grand Prix, which
in recent years has been held at Mesa Marin Speedway in Bakersfield
and Perris Auto Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   A list of past Turkey Night competitors reads like a who's who
of open-wheel racing, including four-time Indianapolis 500 champion
A.J. Foyt and Indy Racing League standout Bill Boat. Boat won the
event for three consecutive years from 1995-97 before graduating
full-time to the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine the history of the event with this facility,
there's certainly the possibility for it to be as big as (the
Indianapolis 500),'' said Tommy Hunt, USAC's vice president for
Western States Operations. ``(Turkey Night) is such a huge event
for USAC with a lot of history. And this is such an incredible
place. It's a great combination.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Turkey Night Grand Prix tops the list of showcase
events, it's not the only reason to head out to Irwindale Speedway
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The USAC Coors Silver Crown series event on Oct. 16 will
showcase some of the drivers who will compete at the November race,
including 1998 champion Jay Drake and 1999 USAC points leader Jason
Lefler.
</P>
<P>
   The two NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Tour events feature
slightly smaller versions of the ones raced on the NASCAR Winston
Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 series champion, Steve Portenga of Reno, Nev., will
lead the charge around the Irwindale half-mile oval.

 &HT;    Ohio gov. pledges to uphold `the union tradition'
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Wes Hills
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft, whose grandfather remains a
villain to the American labor movement nearly 50 years after his
death, drew a standing ovation Wednesday from the Ohio AFL-CIO when
he promised to withhold support from any effort to dismantle ``the
union tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor's show of support highlighted a day in
which Ohio union leaders flexed their muscles against a backdrop of
shrinking membership and a statehouse legislative agenda full of
anti-union proposals.
</P>
<P>
   It also marked another movement by the governor away from his
own party's conservative wing and toward the political center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a welcome comment by him to try to find middle
ground between labor and a Republican governor so we can work
together toward some common goals,'' said Tom Ritchie, Dayton-based
regional director of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees' Ohio Council 8.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie was among about 300 participants at Ohio AFL-CIO's
Legislative Conference who marched a block and half through the
center of downtown Columbus from the Adams Mark Hotel to the
statehouse where they fanned out for individual meetings with
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders interpreted Taft's remarks to mean that he would
not support a so-called right-to-work bill now before the
legislature. It would remove any requirement that workers join
unions or pay dues as a condition of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Taft, in a hurried exchange with reporters, declined to comment
on specific legislation. But Scott Milburn, his spokesman, said the
governor was referring to the right-to-work bill, cosponsored by
Dayton-area Rep. Jeff Jacobson, a Phillipsburg Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news,'' said Wes Wells, executive director of the
Miami Valley Regional Labor Council
</P>
<P>
   Taft's grandfather, the late Sen. Robert A. Taft, who died in
1953, was the author of the 1947 Taft-Hartley labor law which
weakened unions by calling for cooling-off periods before strikes
and requiring union officers to sign affidavits disavowing
Communist Party connections.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction of the the governor, Ohio AFL-CIO President
William Burga recalled labor's opposition to Taft's grandfather but
urged the audience to give the governor a polite welcome. Burga
said Taft was the first Republican governor who has agreed to
address a legislative meeting of the state labor group. Burga, in
an interview, called Taft-Hartley, the ``worst labor act ever
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor warmed up to Burga and the crowd right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also want you to know that I respect who you are and what
you are all about,'' Taft said. ``Everyone who works in Ohio today
owes the union movement, the labor movement, a great debt of
gratitude for improving wages, working conditions, benefits and
workplace safety.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that as governor he recognized the ``role that unions
have played and will continue to play in making Ohio one of the
most productive places in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   While he and union members may not agree on everything, Taft
said that he wants them to have a ``relationship based on open
access and easy communication.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thanked them for supporting his health care reform
proposal, the Patient Protection Act, which would give consumers
the right to sue their health plan for medical malpractice. Taft
has had trouble finding Republican support for this plan.
</P>
<P>
   Burga, the state AFL-CIO president, was pleased with Taft's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it about time? Whether they're Democrats or Republicans,
they're supposed to be on the side of the people. We represent the
working people, not just union members.''

IMF OFFICIAL EXPECTS MORE AID FOR INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A senior official of the International Monetary Fund
said here Wednesday that he expected the fund to approve more
financial aid to Indonesia in a board meeting in Washington on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Neiss, the fund's Asia Pacific director, said, ``the IMF
will propose that the existing commitments be increased.'' He said
such an increase requires the board's approval, but added, ``I
would expect that the board will agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's chief economics official, Ginandjar Kartasasmita,
had asked for an extra $1 billion in aid in a meeting last month
with the fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
   Neiss would not say how large the increase would be. But last
year, the fund approved an additional $1 billion in aid to
Indonesia, raising its total commitment to $11.2 billion. All told,
Jakarta is receiving a $43 billion rescue package from the fund and
other international aid groups .
</P>
<P>
   The fund has already disbursed $8.8 billion, and analysts said
the Indonesian government was worried that unless the IMF agreed to
pledge more, the country might have trouble soliciting aid from
other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's move to release more aid is both an acknowledgment of
the steps Indonesia has taken to overhaul its shattered economy and
a sign of how far it still must go to join the ranks of the
recovering in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Neiss said Indonesia needed the extra help because, unlike South
Korea or Thailand, it was not yet attracting private capital.
Analysts said foreign investors were generally steering clear of
Indonesia as it made a trouble-prone transition from the Suharto
era to a more democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neiss praised Indonesia for taking steps to clean up its
ruined banking system. On March 13, the government of President
B.J. Habibie closed 38 banks, took over seven and indicated it
would bail out nine others.
</P>
<P>
   The move came after a sudden two-week postponement that had
provoked new cries of cronyism from government critics. Critics
said that politically connected bankers had pressured Habibie to
order the delay so that they could raise capital and save their
banks from closure.
</P>
<P>
   Neiss said that while he regretted the delay, ``I prefer
postponement to things going wrong.'' He added: ``No bank owner in
any country would like to have his bank closed. They will fight
tooth and nail to keep it open.''
</P>
<P>
   Neiss made his remarks to reporters at an investment conference
in Hong Kong sponsored by Credit Suisse First Boston. Earlier in
the day, he sparred with a leading critic of the fund: Jeffrey D.
Sachs, a Harvard economist, who has accused the fund of aggravating
the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs renewed those criticisms Wednesday, saying that the fund's
insistence on high interest rates and stable currencies had
deepened investor panic and capital flight in Thailand and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Neiss replied that the fund's policies calmed South Korea when
it was hit by a wave of capital outflows in late 1997. He also said
the fund should not be blamed for the region's collapse. Rather, he
said, the governments did not respond quickly enough to the
unfolding crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, Neiss struck a mostly optimistic note. He
predicted that most Asian economies would return to growth in the
second half of 1999. ``When we say the worst is over, we are simply
stating the facts,'' he said. ``The larger task of getting the
recovery off the ground is still before us.''

COLORADO PROFESSOR TO HEAD RESPECTED BIOMEDICAL INSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Del., Md.) (rk) 
 By   NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has chosen as its next
president Thomas R. Cech, an expert on the chemistry of biological
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment will make Cech a significant patron of
biomedical research, giving him the power to dispense more than
$500 million a year in research funds and to shape research
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The institute had a colorful beginning as an instrument created
by Howard Hughes, the eccentric aviator and industrialist, to
minimize interference by the federal government in his industrial
empire.
</P>
<P>
   It has grown over the last 15 years to become a prominent player
in the world of biomedicine. Its awards are highly coveted because
they are more generous than those given by the National Institutes
of Health, the major source of federal funds for biomedical
research.
</P>
<P>
   The 318 scientists now supported by the institute include many
of the nation's most prominent biologists.
</P>
<P>
   Cech, who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1989, is in some
ways a surprising choice because at 51 he is comparatively young
and still actively engaged in research. He is a professor at the
University of Colorado and has a reputation for the rigor of his
experiments as well as for his enjoyment of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna Gray, president emeritus of the University of Chicago and
chairwoman of the institute's board, said Cech (pronounced check)
was chosen because of his scientific credentials and his interest
in education, the institute's two principal activities. ``He is a
first-rate scientist with excellent taste in science, someone who
is widely respected and admired within the scientific community,''
Dr. Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, over which Cech will assume control next January,
has an endowment of $11.4 billion. Its offices are in a sumptuous
new building in Chevy Chase, Md., near the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   The institute was founded by Hughes in 1953 and vested with
ownership of the Hughes Aircraft Co. at a time when the Air Force
seemed intent on taking control of the company because of Hughes'
chaotic management. But the institute did close to nothing until
Hughes, its sole trustee, died without a will in 1976, leaving no
instructions as to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Its modern era began in 1984, when a Delaware court vested
control of the institute in a board of nine trustees. The new board
sold its single asset, Hughes Aircraft, to the General Motors Corp.
for $5.2 billion and made peace with the Internal Revenue Service,
which had long been on its heels.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Purnell W. Choppin, its president since
1987, and W. Maxwell Cowan, its chief scientific officer, the
institute has come to finance the best of the nation's academic
biologists, replacing the National Institutes of Health as their
major patron.
</P>
<P>
   Cech said he had ``many ideas but no agenda'' until he took
office. He also said he would continue to spend one week a month in
his Colorado laboratory.

MINING DIAMONDS IN THE DESERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ ``If you build it, they will come'' became the
catch phrase in ``Field of Dreams,'' the movie that starred Kevin
Costner.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Cactus League has made it work in the real world,
only there are no corn fields to be found here in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The Cactus League is booming now, attracting major league teams
to the Valley of the Sun faster than you can say Dodgertown. Ten of
the major leagues' 30 teams conduct spring training here, with more
expected to come, possibly even the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of Cactus League teams are playing at facilities that have
been built within the past six years. The oldest -- the Angels'
6-year-old Tempe Diablo Stadium -- still sparkles in the desert
sun.
</P>
<P>
   The trend now is to put two teams in one extra-large complex.
That's the case in Peoria, where the Mariners and Padres share the
Peoria Sports Complex, and in Tucson, where the Diamondbacks and
White Sox share Tucson Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs (Mesa) and Brewers (Maryvale) train in new facilities,
and the Giants play in a rebuilt Scottsdale Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the growth of the Cactus League can be traced to the
departure of the Cleveland Indians, who left Tucson for Florida in
1991. That prompted the Arizona state legislature to form stadium
districts to provide funds to improve existing facilities and to
build new ones. A rental-car tax in Maricopa County helped raise
most of the approximately $100 million that revitalized the Cactus
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland was the only team in Tucson and they shocked
everybody by moving to Florida,'' said Jerry Geiger, president of
the Cactus League since 1996. ``It was a wake-up call. Other teams
were worried about other teams leaving. If there were only four
teams here, there would not be enough competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the turnaround was the `T' word (tax) nobody wants
to hear about,'' Michael Scully, executive director of the Maricopa
County Sports Commission, told the Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Based on surveys, out-of-state and out-of-area fans pump $100
million a year into the Arizona economy.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is up throughout the Cactus League this season, after
a slight drop in attendance last year blamed on El Nio-related bad
weather in early March.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who train at Mesa's HoHoKam Park, are traditionally
the biggest draw, and are even more attractive this year with Sammy
Sosa the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we were heading into a better season. Thank you,
Sammy,'' Robert Brinton, head of the Mesa Visitors and Convention
Bureau, told the Arizona Republic. ``It's more festive all
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are considering joining the party in Arizona after
spending 50 years in Vero Beach, Fla. They are negotiating to move
to the Fort McDowell Yavapai-Apache Indian Reservation, located
northeast of downtown Phoenix. The complex would cost $20 million
to $30 million and hold 12,500 fans. The Dodgers would likely share
the facility with another club, possibly the Royals, Blue Jays,
Astros, Rangers or Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have not ruled out staying in Vero Beach, which
relies on the $30 million generated by the team for its economy
every spring. Vero Beach and Indian River County have proposed
buying Holman Stadium, the practice fields and the conference
center from the Dodgers, then leasing them back to the team for a
minimal amount.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that the Dodgers could train in Arizona, a 1
1/2-hour flight from Los Angeles, and that Southern California fans
and sponsors would be more likely to visit might be too good for
the Dodgers to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough decision for them to make,'' Geiger
said. ``The economics of the decision favor Arizona. But we also
understand and appreciate the 50-year tradition they have there,
going back to the old Brooklyn Dodger days in Florida. It's going
to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have always been a part of the Cactus League, but
until 1993, split spring training between facilities in Mesa,
Ariz., and Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the benefits of a new ballpark, clubhouse and front
office facilities, the Angels have enjoyed the convenience that has
resulted since moving to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to the coaching staff and the front office,
performance didn't improve, but the ease with which it took to
prepare improved,'' Angels general manager Bill Bavasi said.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi, once the Angels' director of minor league operations,
said the biggest impact the move had on the organization was at the
minor league level.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' minor league camp is at Gene Autry Park in Mesa, but
with no central spring training headquarters in place, the club had
to rent trailers to serve as their spring training offices every
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the games there were like road games for us, because the
players would have to dress at a hotel nearby,'' Bavasi said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one prickly situation that was solved by moving to Tempe.

COMMENTARY: AGAINST INTERNAL AGGRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Never will so many nations inflict so much
destruction with so little relish.
</P>
<P>
   Because outrage is absent and the public's war spirit is
lacking; because few in NATO want to see the collateral damage sure
to be inflicted as bombs go astray; and because foreign policy is
so foreign to our economy-fixated discourse, Americans are asking
as we go in: What national interest impels us to intervene to stop
an independence movement from losing?
</P>
<P>
   Four categories of answers, the first three of them unhappy:
</P>
<P>
   1. THE SIMPLIFIERS: President Clinton painfully gives the reason
designed to stir emotion and rally popular support: ``President
Milosevic ... has again chosen aggression over peace.'' Serbian
forces are ``burning down Kosovar Albanian villages and murdering
civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   2. THE THOUGHTFUL INTERNATIONALISTS: Senators like Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., and John McCain, R-Ariz., are reluctant to see us
lurch into combat commitment with no end in sight. They find
themselves forced to support the bombing of the Serbs because to do
otherwise after all our threatening would be to reveal the alliance
of Western nations as a pitiful, helpless giant.
</P>
<P>
   3. THE ANTI-WILSONIANS: Henry Kissinger exhibits ``great
unease'' at NATO's decision to intervene; his conceptual framework
holds Woodrow Wilson's principle of self-determination to be unduly
idealistic and destabilizing. He stops short of saying we should
not join the bombing because he does not want to disestablish the
foreign policy Establishment.
</P>
<P>
   4. THE AMERICA FIRSTERS AND THE QUAGMIRE-AVOIDERS: Now that the
McGovernite left has fallen silent about taking sides in a civil
war, anti-war voices are mainly from the Republican right, and they
alone are unconflicted. They condemn the multilateral intervention,
arguing: If Serbia refuses to allow a province coveted by
neighboring Albania to secede, outsiders have no right to label
such defense of its national borders ``aggression'' and to support
the rebels. Russia agrees: If NATO can help the Kosovars break away
from Serbia, then it can help the Chechens break away from Russia.
That's why Yevgeny Primakov had to turn around and go home.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in a separate school with President Wilson, who was three
generations ahead of his time. Wilson was an arrogant idealist, a
troublemaking rearranger of national borders who summed up his
vision thus: ``Every people has a right to choose the sovereignty
under which they shall live.'' (Great principle; bad sentence
structure.)
</P>
<P>
   We now live in a world of satellite-televised brutality and
computer-samizdat suffering; repression is hard to hide. If a large
ethnic group dominating the demography of a province wants to be
independent, it can assert its desire for self-determination in a
dramatic way that earns a decent respect of the Opinion of Mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this desire is misplaced, overlooking the strengths of
national diversity and the blessings of the melting pot. Quebecers
think about separation; unrepressed by Canada, they decide
democratically to stay in. Puerto Ricans, able easily to dissolve
ties to the U.S., wisely choose not to. East Timor, bloodily
annexed by Indonesia, can now opt in or out.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when a people _ bonded by linguistic, cultural,
racial or religious ties _ is denied the expression of its culture,
and then demands sovereignty from despots? If those oppressees are
ready to shed their own blood and that of their territorial hosts,
their sometimes self-induced agony, projected on the world's
attention screen, becomes a persuasive argument for ``humanitarian
intercession.''
</P>
<P>
   If the repressing country is powerful, the sovereignty does not
change; too bad for now, Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   If its leadership is savagely dictatorial but vulnerable, as in
Iraq, repression is restricted from outside: We'll enforce your
autonomy, you Kurds, but no independent Kurdistan lest your
compatriots in Turkey and Iran get ideas.
</P>
<P>
   If the villainous sovereign is relatively weak and the potential
bloodshed is horrendous, then in we go (with bombs, not troops) to
save the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent and principled? Not quite. But the trend at century's
end is toward self-determination, propelled by a world audience
humanely averse to seeing casualties up close.

PRO- AND ANTI-PINOCHET CHILEANS BOTH PLEASED BY BRITISH DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also LONDON-PINOCHET) 
(bl) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Both supporters of Gen. Augusto Pinochet and
family members of the ``disappeared'' expressed mostly muted
enthusiasm for the British legal ruling that upheld the detention
of the former dictator while throwing out all but three of the 30
charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   The complex ambiguities of the decision by the Law Lords, who
constitute England's highest court, reduced the size and intensity
of demonstrations by human rights groups and Pinochet supporters
that occurred throughout the day. No arrests were reported even
though the Communist Party and other groups held demonstrations
without permits and slowed traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But the complete absence of violence and the moderate tones of
the political debate reflected how Pinochet and his legal problems
have receded in importance since his arrest five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean human rights groups cheered that the panel of the House
of Lords agreed with their position that Pinochet did not have
immunity as a former head of state and is still eligible for
extradition to Spain. But Pinochet's supporters said they thought
that they could eventually win his release on appeal since the two
primary remaining charges _ that he was involved in the torture of
a single prisoner and in a conspiracy to torture others after 1988
_ would not stand up to judicial scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief address to the nation Wednesday evening, President
Eduardo Frei praised the British decision, saying it followed the
arguments of his government's lawyers that it was up to Chilean
courts to judge the acts of Chilean leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This judgment recognizes the sovereignty of Chile,'' he said.
``Now it is up to the British interior minister to decide whether
to allow an extradition based on such reduced charges.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chilean television broadcasted live the court's
proceedings, the initial responses at offices of opposing
organizations, the Group of the Families of the Detained and
Disappeared and the Pinochet Foundation, were strangely identical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinochet remains a prisoner,'' exclaimed Sola Sierra,
president of the leading human rights group, to a cheering group of
people who had pictures of their missing relatives pinned to their
chests. ``They'll keep looking for arguments to free him, but this
decision shows that the international community believes no one has
the right to assassinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Santiago, at the Pinochet Foundation, a few hundred
supporters waved their fists, broke into applause and embraced in
victorious hugs when they heard that the Law Lords decided that he
could not be extradited to Spain on charges of committing crimes
before London signed the 1988 torture convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of the charges have fallen to the ground,''
said Andres Chadwick Pinera, a conservative senator. ``Only a few
minor police violations are left.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marco Antonio Pinochet, one of the general's sons, was less
ebullient. ``The ruling helped the defense in some senses, but it's
no victory,'' he said, speaking on Chilean television from London
after leaving his father's side. Pinochet added that his father was
calm but was not in a celebratory mood.
</P>
<P>
   Political commentators said the calm in Chile underscored how
little the arrest of Pinochet, who is now a senator for life, has
changed the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Polls measuring the standing of candidates running in December
elections have barely budged, with Ricardo Lagos of the Socialist
Party retaining his strong lead.
</P>
<P>
   And though two conservative parties criticized the government's
diplomacy to free the general, the armed forces remained in the
barracks and their support for Frei has actually become more vocal.
</P>
<P>
   An exception came Monday when the head of the air force, Gen.
Fernando Rojas Vender, angered government officials with a speech
in which he likened domestic tensions surrounding the Pinochet case
to the tensions leading up to the 1973 coup led by Pinochet that
toppled the socialist government of Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas Vender, who is retiring next month, was forced to retract
his remarks. Political experts said his inflammatory speech
reflected his frustrations with Frei's refusal to purchase a new
fleet of fighter jets and reports of a congressional probe into
allegations of air force corruption.

STOCK CAR FRENZY TOUCHES DOWN
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Stock car racing is one of the country's
fastest growing spectator sports. NASCAR events annually draw more
than six million fans and have worked their way into mainstream
America.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale Speedway, which is scheduled to open its gates
Saturday, hopes to take advantage of that frenzy twice this season
when it plays host to a pair of NASCAR Winston West 250-lap events,
in June and August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely will be the marquee event there,'' said Glendora
businessman Joe Nava, Winston West team owner for the No.77 Ford
Taurus driven by Joe Bean. ``That's going to be good for Irwindale
and be good for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cars are identical to what you will see in Winston Cup.
We have good equipment with good drivers. You're going to see a lot
of side-by-side racing. It should be very exciting. We're just
hoping we can be the inaugural winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Winston West series, which has launched the careers
of Winston Cup regulars Derrike Cope and Chad Little, is nearly as
old as NASCAR itself.
</P>
<P>
   It started in 1954 when it was known as Grand National West. It
has experienced nearly the same amount of growth as Winston Cup.
This year, series sponsor Winston has increased its contribution in
the points fund from $50,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for us to get two Winston West races is pretty
prestigious,'' said Doug Stokes, Irwindale Speedway's director of
communications. ``A lot of tracks have just one race, and we have
two. If you're a NASCAR fan, it's a really big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston West cars are virtually the same as those raced in
Winston Cup events. Both feature wheel bases of 110 inches and
maintain a minimum weight of 3,400 pounds. The cars are powered by
a 358-cubic inch V-8 engines. The difference lies in the
compression ratio; Winston West cars are limited to a 9.5-to-1
ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The series visits tracks ranging in size from Irwindale's
half-mile oval to Roger Penske's two-mile D-shaped California
Speedway in nearby Fontana. The tour also competes at Las Vegas
Speedway and on two road courses, including Sears Point Raceway in
Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   The events held at California Speedway, Las Vegas and Sonoma
serve as support races for Winston Cup events, so most of the 30
drivers who compete regularly on the starter series are excited to
come to Irwindale's new half-mile superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Las Vegas (and some of the other big tracks), other races
are the headliners,'' said Dan Bixler, marketing director for
Winston West rookie Rick Ware. ``At Irwindale, we will be the big
cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither Jeff Gordon nor Dale Earnhardt will drive at
Irwindale, some of the future stars of Winston Cup will be
competing, including 1997 series champion Butch Gilliland of Chino
Hills and Sean Woodside of Saugus.
</P>
<P>
   El Monte's Kenny Smith, winner of the California Lotto in 1994,
is also slated to compete.

AID WORKER ESCAPES KOSOVO HOURS BEFORE BOMBS FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head of operations for a Northwest-based aid agency was one
of the last Americans to flee Kosovo Wednesday, passing massed
Serbian troops, tanks and artillery to reach safety in Macedonia
just hours before the start of NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Heselius, a 66-year-old great-grandfather who has worked
in the strife-torn province for Mercy Corps International since
since 1993, said in a telephone interview that he led a convoy of
six vehicles from the Kosovo capital of Pristina to the Macedonian
border Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it might be a bit touchy getting out because it was
very tense _ quiet but tense _ in Pristina this morning,'' Heselius
said after arriving at the Skopje, Macedonia, office of Mercy
Corps. ``We passed a lot of heavy artillery, tanks and military
personnel about six or eight kilometers from the border, then heard
some heavy artillery firing behind us after we had passed that
area. We crossed the border about 8:35 a.m. Everybody was glad to
be out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Heselius could have fled to safety on Tuesday after leading two
evacuation convoys on the one-hour journey from Pristina to the
Macedonian border. But on both trips, some Albanian members of
Mercy Corps and other aid agencies were denied permission to cross
the border because they didn't have the proper documents.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to abandon his local staff at the frontier, Heselius
and another American, Scott Charlesworth, returned to Pristina with
the group late Tuesday and spent a very tense night. Wednesday
morning, just hours before NATO began bombing, they made a final,
successful dash for the border.
</P>
<P>
   Heselius said his ethnic Albanian colleagues _ four adults and
seven children _ drove their own vehicle and had arrived safely in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Among Heselius' passengers were two CNN correspondents whose
vehicle tires had been slashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were probably the last Americans to leave Pristina,'' said
Heselius, a former businessman who lived in Kirkland from 1991
until early 1993, when he joined Portland-based Mercy Corps as head
of the agency's Kosovo operations. ``The CNN crew had no
transportation. The civilian (Serb) population in Kosovo was
getting dangerous. Many of them are armed and this kind of
situation gives them a reason to do anything they want to do. You
can see the animosity and there's not much you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heselius, a devout Christian, said he prayed Wednesday before
making the final journey to the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I felt pretty good about it,'' said Heselius. He
plans to stay in Macedonia in hopes he will soon be able to return
to Kosovo and resume the aid program he established six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will soon come to some sort of solution,'' he
said. ``If so, I've got to go back in to help people. There are a
lot of people in there who need help.''

REPUBLICANS SEEK TO CAPITALIZE ON IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as congressional Republicans work publicly to
shed their image as the party of impeachment, party officials
behind the scenes are using the trial of President Clinton as a
fund-raising tool with conservatives to help Republicans keep
control of the House of Representatives next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee on Tuesday began testing a
direct-mail appeal for a ``Republican Impeachment Supporters
Election Fund.'' The letter, signed by Jim Nicholson, the party
chairman, says, ``The Republicans who impeached President Clinton
are now being targeted for defeat by one of the most vicious
liberal Democrat, Big Labor Boss, special interest group campaigns
in American history.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The appeal notes that a $20 contribution would amount to 10
cents ``per Republican congressman who voted for impeachment and is
under attack,'' and asked for contributions as high as $60. ``The
defeat of our Republicans by those vowing revenge will be President
Clinton's final victory and it will undercut our chances of
recapturing the White House in 2000,'' the letter says.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee, which raises
money for House races, is considering a telephone appeal that would
feature one or more of the 13 House managers who prosecuted the
president. Some House Republicans are also in the process of
creating a ``Defend Our Managers'' Web site, which they hope will
draw at least 10,000 hits, raising an average of $10 each. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And several House Republicans are using political action
committees to raise money for the the House impeachment managers or
else benefit from their appeal in conservative circles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republican drive is the flip side of Democratic efforts to
capitalize on impeachment. Determined to win back the House,
Clinton himself has raised more than $9 million for Democrats since
mid-January, and party officials attribute the surge in donations
to a backlash against Republican efforts to remove the president.
People for the American Way, a civil liberties group, has begun a
$5 million ``Recall the Right'' drive to help Democrats regain
control of the House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they are responding to reports that Clinton is
seeking to defeat them because of their drive against him. ``You
feel very uncomfortable trying to make money off of impeachment,''
said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, the chairman of the
House Republican re-election effort. ``You almost cheapen it. But
the president has done it. The Democratic leaders are doing it. You
can't sit idly by and be a punching bag. We are testing the market
on an appropriate way to respond.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are not yet certain how successful the appeals will
prove. Some of the party's big business donors were uncomfortable
with the impeachment drive, but officials say that the House
managers have become conservative cult heroes who are spawning
spontaneous fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, Jane Chastain, a conservative radio
talk show host and commentator for Crawford Broadcasting, asked
listeners last month to ``adopt'' a House impeachment manager and
held an adoption ceremony on her show. ``The phones were just
jammed,'' she said in an interview on Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said she told listeners to help in any way they could,
including providing campaign funds. ``If you're a good adoptive
parent you support your kids in every way they need to be
supported,'' she said. ``They need your prayers. They need your
encouragement. In some cases they need your dollars.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the managers, said
he is now in high demand as a party speaker. ``It's been an
unbelievable experience for me,'' Graham said. ``I sit in an
airport for five minutes reading a paper and half a dozen people
come up and just kind of shake my hand and say we're really proud
of what you tried to do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist experimenting with fund raising
through the ``Defend Our Managers'' Web site said the appeal of the
Internet is that unlike direct mail, it is an inexpensive way to
prospect for donations. ``On line has low overhead, low
maintenance,'' he said. ``If it is out there it will come. If it's
not it will cost you $90 bucks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that that many of the managers will actually
need huge infusions of money. Only two are from districts that are
considered competitive between the two parties _ Reps. Steve Chabot
of Ohio and James Rogan of California. Rogan is weighing whether to
give up his seat and challenge Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year.
Another of the House managers, Rep/ Charles Canady of Florida, will
not be running for re-election because he made a term-limit pledge,
and says he intends to abide by it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals go on. Rep. Christopher Cannon of Utah, one of
the House managers, was reported on Wednesday in The Hill newspaper
to be creating a House Managers political action committee to
handle checks that have been coming in spontaneously to the 13 men
who prosecuted the president. Jeff Hartley, a political aide to
Cannon, said the congressman had received about $3,000 in such
small donations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, who is not running again in 2000
because of a term-limits pledge, created a PAC in February that she
named ``Helen's List'' to support candidates who share her
conservative views. In a fund-raising advertisement in the national
edition of The Washington Times this month she said ``the Clinton
pit bulls are already working at raising money they will need to
elicit revenge on the House managers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., who has long had his own PAC,
has supplemented it with a House Managers Defense Fund. In a recent
fund-raising letter, he asserted that Clinton ``wants the scalps of
all 13 House managers and any other Republican who dared to blemish
his all-important place in history.'' &QL;

EX-OFFICIAL URGES BEIJING TO END TIANANMEN `COVER-UP' 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Two months before the 10th anniversary of the
crackdown on student protesters in Tiananmen Square, a former top
Chinese official has sent an impassioned letter to China's leaders
urging them to end a decade-long ``cover-up'' and to renounce the
order that sent soldiers to disperse the demonstrators, killing
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only one thing to say and that is to urge you to
reverse the assessment of the 1989 student demonstrations without
delay,'' wrote Bao Tong, a former Central Committee member jailed
from 1989 to 1996 for sympathizing with the protesters. ``The
events of June 4, 1989, are shameful to humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have repeatedly defended their decision to
forcefully move out the protesters, who they said were involved in
a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao's letter, dated Thursday, is an opening public salvo in what
is likely to be a tense prelude to the anniversary. Despite
constant surveillance, Bao has remained the most prominent Chinese
critic of the government's actions in 1989, expressing the
misgivings that many citizens feel but dare not utter.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the politician, he argued in the letter that the decision
to fire on students must be re-evaluated because it was morally
wrong and because it undercuts public support for China's ruling
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letting the wrongful assessment of the events to remain
without reversal means the continuation of severe pain for the
Chinese people,'' Bao wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have taken pains to insure that June 4 will pass
uneventfully, hoping to focus attention instead on the communist
regime's lavish 50th anniversary celebration, planned for Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have recently become more aggressive in closing down
political discussion groups and publications that were tolerated
just a year ago. And several former student protesters say they
have been visited by local public security officers and warned
``not to make trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest deterrent is that Tiananmen Square _ the
only open space in this packed city of 14 million _ is currently
boarded up with high walls, closed for renovation in preparation
for the Oct. 1 celebrations. The project was originally scheduled
for completion this spring but local officials recently announced
that the reopening had been postponed until July.
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary Chinese still regard June 4 as far ``too
sensitive'' to discuss in public. But privately, many remain deeply
chagrined about the decision to use force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people in Beijing and hundreds of thousands of
bystanders from other parts of the country watched the events
unfold,'' Bao wrote, adding: ``The history of bloodshed remains in
people's hearts; they will not forget.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Bao said he wrote the letter out of
the conviction that ``when each of us begin to speak out and make
our own views known, it will become increasingly necessary for the
leaders to reconsider the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bao has been warned about his ``unapproved'' contact
with foreign reporters and the police screen visitors to his home,
he is cryptically optimistic about his current situation: ``My life
seems free, it should be free and I hope it stays free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter is addressed to President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji and the members of the Politburo Standing Committee. In
the late 1980s, Bao was chief of staff for Zhao Ziyang, then the
Communist Party chief.
</P>
<P>
   But in May 1989, both Zhao and Bao opposed the used of force to
disperse the demonstrators. Both lost their jobs in the days before
the June 4 crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao has been in under house arrest ever since. On May 28, 1989,
a government driver picked Bao up at his home in Beijing for a
supposed meeting _ and drove him to prison. He spent the next seven
years in solitary confinement, followed by a year of house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He was freed just before President Clinton's visit last summer
and immediately started speaking out on issues like free speech and
the rule of law. Expressing a common view on the streets in
Beijing, Bao says the student leaders were naive and certainly
``made mistakes,'' but adds that their protests were ``orderly''
and nonviolent. ``Whatever they did or said should be dealt with
according to democratic principles and the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bao, a political insider in the spring of 1989, places
responsibility for the crackdown on Deng Xiaoping, China's top
leader at the time, who died in 1997. He takes issue with the
conventional wisdom that China's current leadership could never
criticize the crackdown because many were already in power at that
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the tragedy happened, most of you were not in the highest
level decision-making positions in handling the event (except for
one who bore a lesser responsibility) and had no involvement in the
case,'' he wrote. ``It is unnecessary for you to bear such a burden
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``one who bore a lesser responsibility'' is a reference to
Li Peng, the current head of the National People's Congress, who
was China's prime minister in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Bao's letter also contains a Cassandra-like warning: That if the
Party does not reverse the verdict, 1.2 billion Chinese will rise
up and do it themselves.
</P>

   ``If you were to initiate the reversal of the judgment of the
1989 students demonstrations, the benefits to China would be great
and the cost would be minimal,'' he wrote. ``Such a course of
action would be beneficial to the people and to all of you, and
especially in strengthening the reputation of the Party. Therefore,
I believe it best for me to urge you, rather than others, to take
such action.''

MANY SERBS HAVE LITTLE BUT PRIDE TO HOLD ONTO

<P>
   BELGRADE _ As low-flying missiles streaked over this capital,
signaling the start of NATO's bombing campaign, many Serbs went
about their business Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night with remarkable indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Lights stayed on in homes and businesses throughout the city,
and people could be seen waiting for city buses even after the
first explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Beaten down from the wars that broke up Yugoslavia, and the
severe economic downturn that followed it, many Serbs have nothing
to cling to except their national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are small,'' said construction worker Tomislav Krstic, 53,
``and NATO will break their teeth on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with him was Momo Kalkan, a Serb from the Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo, who with his wife has been run out of two
homes in this decade's Balkan conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our third war. Why not smile? It's the only weapon we
have,'' said Kalkan, who runs a grocery store here. ``We came to
Belgrade emptyhanded. Our life is the Serb story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government line, that the West has unfairly singled
out Serbia as the whipping boy of Europe, plays well with many
here. The Serbs had few other stories to hear Wednesday, after Serb
officials cracked down on independent news outlets and
international broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an atmosphere where everything is presented as a kind of
defense of the motherland, the distinction between the regime and
the country becomes less and less,'' said Vojin Dimitrijevic, a
human rights activist and former head of the international law
department at Belgrade University.
</P>
<P>
   Air-raid sirens went off in Belgrade at about 8:05 p.m. local
time. Soon afterward, reporters on the roof of a downtown hotel saw
two bright flashes near Abala mountain, to the southeast of the
capital. Two orange flashes to the northwest of Belgrade followed,
and a dull thumping could be heard in central Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hit appeared to be to the southeast, where a bomb
led to a bright orange blaze. Repeated flashes and sparks from the
blaze suggested the missile may have hit a munitions supply.
</P>
<P>
   City and federal officials here had dug in for a fight even
before the bombings. The government, operating under an ``imminent
state of war,'' prepared bomb shelters for citizens. Local,
state-controlled television gave citizens directions on what to do
during a bombing, followed by patriotic scenes of happy Serbian
family life and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn, Serb police walked into the downtown offices of
B-92 Radio and arrested the independent station's editor in chief,
Veran Matic. They demanded that reporters move away from their
computers and set down their telephones, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The police, accusing the station of having exceeded the allowed
power limit for radio transmissions, delivered a Telecommunications
Ministry order banning the station from transmitting, said Matic,
who was released after spending eight hours in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The order removed Belgrade's last source of independent
broadcast news. The police also removed a critical piece of
satellite equipment required to transmit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so-called virtual repression,'' Matic said.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite equipment also was seized Wednesday from some foreign
TV outlets, including CNN. Reporters were told they could transmit
only through state-run studios.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic indicated to the West that it was willing to continue
talks on Kosovo. Serbia faces airstrikes because Milosevic has
refused to sign a Western-brokered peace agreement that gives broad
political autonomy to Kosovo, a southern province of Serbia
overwhelmingly populated by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an 11th-hour appeal from US special envoy Richard
Holbrooke, Milosevic was steadfast in rejecting a Western demand
that he allow 28,000 NATO-led troops into Kosovo to police the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In a taped appearance on state-run Serbian TV, Milosevic said he
wanted ``to continue to look for a peaceful solution to the problem
of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Serb leader said, ``The only acceptable decision,
the only right decision, was to refuse the presence of foreign
troops on our territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said he wanted to ``continue the political process''
but also ``to defend our country in the manner in which it is
attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's brother, Borislav, the Yugoslav ambassador to
Russia, also appealed for further talks.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke was in Budapest Wednesday, and Milan Bozic, a Yugoslav
government minister, said in an interview that he was confident
Holbrooke would return to Belgrade to continue talks. Holbrooke's
final public words before he left Belgrade after failed
negotiations Tuesday night were a reminder that Milosevic had his
telephone number, in case the Yugoslav leader changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   But a US diplomatic source said Holbrooke's visit to the
Hungarian capital _ a six-hour drive from Belgrade _ may be only
personal. Holbrooke's wife, Kati Marton, has Hungarian roots and is
involved with a national cultural event in Budapest this week.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombing, downtown Belgrade was quieter than usual,
but not deserted. For the first time in weeks, the weather was
springlike, drawing out pensioners to sun themselves on city
benches even as it gave NATO planes clearer skies for more accurate
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Some people began stocking up on supplies, and there were long
lines at gasoline stations. But shop shelves were not empty, and a
sense of panic was absent among the populace.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and banks were open, and mail was delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else are we to do when our country is under threat?''
said Bozic, the government minister. ``It's the choice between
flood and fire. Either choose to have solidarity and integrity, or
choose to be bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the aftermath of the bombs, both physical and
political, leaves many here worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic for the first time will understand the reality _
that Serbia is a very unstable country,'' said Zoran Djindjic,
president of the anti-Milosevic Democratic Party. ``Bombing is
opening up a Pandora's box. A lot of things could come in this
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess the power structure would be seriously
threatened, once faced with a military defeat,'' said Milan Protic,
senior fellow at the Institute for Balkan Studies. ``The options
are so tragic _ between occupation and bombardment. We might get
both.''

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The Team That Can't Lose was in a little bit
of trouble _ not too much, mind you, but enough to create an uneasy
moment or two.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Krzyzewski sensed it. Further down the bench, the mood was
growing more somber by the moment. Things hadn't quite reached the
crisis stage, but something needed to be done, and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Without a word, Trajan Langdon defused a potentially touchy
situation.
</P>
<P>
   A runner. A 3-point bomb, then another and another. In all, 11
points in less than three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble? What trouble?
</P>
<P>
   ``They were daring Trajan to shoot,'' Duke teammate Chris
Carrawell said a little later. ``I might dare me, but I wouldn't
dare him to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple dared and regretted it. In the seeming blink of an eye,
the fifth-year Blue Devils senior turned a four-point deficit into
a five-point lead. If John Chaney's team wasn't quite finished, it
was well on its way.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaskan Assassin had struck again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Trajan's hitting, it changes the whole game,'' Carrawell
said. ``He hits three or four in a row, you've got to guard him
now. That opens up Elton (Brand) inside.''
</P>
<P>
   It did this time, too, as Brand rallied from a ragged start to
finish with 21 points. Langdon's 23 were even bigger, though, a
fact hardly lost on the losing coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is as pure a shooter as I have seen in the game of
basketball,'' Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of it all, from Krzyzewski's point of view, was that
Langdon had turned the game around so calmly, without so much as a
hint of the panic that could unnerve a young team feeling pressure
in the Tournament for the first time. And typically, he had done it
without raising so much as an eyebrow, much less a voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trajan _ because he's so quiet and humble _ you don't look at
him and say he's a great leader, but he's been a great leader for
us,'' the coach said Wednesday. ``Our kids really respect Trajan.
Behind the scenes, he does amazing things with this club, not only
by example _ because he's our hardest worker _ but by things he'll
say in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll close the door. He won't necessarily have one of those
fire-and-brimstone talks, but he'll say, `OK, this is what coach
meant.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like my interpreter. He does a really good job.''
</P>
<P>
   For Langdon, taking command may have been in the genes.
Certainly, it was suggested by his birth certificate. When Steve
Langdon _ a professor of anthropology at the University of
Alaska-Anchorage _ and his wife, Gladys, brought their son into the
world, they gave him a name that virtually precluded him from being
anywhere but out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trajan'' is for a Roman emperor who put an end to the
persecution of Christians. ``Shaka,'' his middle name, is taken
from a Zulu leader who organized his tribe into a nation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would that be the end of the influence Dad has had on his
son's athletic career. Leaving little to chance, Steve Langdon
carefully structured the process, taking the boy to Florida for a
baseball camp one year.
</P>
<P>
   At age 14, Trajan spent time at Loyola College in Baltimore,
where he played pickup basketball games with older players and
honed his pitching skills with a catcher whom his father had
arranged to work with him.
</P>
<P>
   In time, he developed enough skill in both sports to earn a
basketball scholarship from Duke while also playing three years in
the San Diego Padres' minor-league system. Eventually, basketball
won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of Alaska know basketball,'' he says. ``In the villages
and outlying areas, basketball is the main sport. It's the one kids
relate to and try to play. Basketball is what they grew up on.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, folks back home know Trajan Langdon. When he returned
as Duke played in the Great Alaska Shootout in 1995, he couldn't
play because of knee problems but still was followed by autograph
seekers wherever he went. Schools and groups around the state court
him to visit and give motivational speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, he was back again when the Blue Devils returned
to the Shootout. This time, he made the all-tournament team even
though Duke suffered its only loss of the season, dropping a
two-point game to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Now, March offers a chance to clear up some other unfinished
business.
</P>
<P>
   While younger teammates have known little but success in Durham,
N.C., Langdon was around for the dark days _ Krzyzewski's back
problems, a losing season (13-18) in 1995 and the rebuilding that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out the next year with the knee problem, Langdon
experienced a different sort of disappointment the past two
seasons, including last year's South Regional final when Duke blew
a 17-point lead and lost to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Falling short of the Final Four _ a virtual birthright at Duke
when Langdon first arrived _ was bad enough, but adding to those
unhappy memories was the knowledge that he hadn't been much help.
In the Blue Devils' past two trips into the bracket, Langdon made
just 19 of 68 shots, including 11 of 38 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got worn down because he carried us _ further probably than
we should have advanced a couple of times,'' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams weren't as talented or versatile as the one Langdon
leads into Tropicana Field to face Michigan State on Saturday
night. William Avery, Shane Battier and Elton Brand were freshmen a
year ago, and Brand was injured and barely a factor against
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Langdon can lead without having to do it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different mindset,'' he said. ``I put too much pressure
on myself in the postseason the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such a talented team, they don't really need my shot,
or if I don't shoot well, we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does shoot well, winning is a whole lot easier. Against
Temple, Langdon made six of seven shots (five of six from 3-point
range), loosening up the middle and helping Brand find room to
operate. In three NCAA games (he sat out the opener against Florida
A&AMP;M with a foot injury), Langdon has hit 19 of 30 3-point tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches and my teammates have ultimate confidence in me,''
he said, ``and I have ultimate confidence in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That bond could be tested again Saturday. When the teams met in
the Great Eight in December, Duke came away with a 73-67 win
despite being outrebounded 41-25 by the Spartans, a game in which
Brand grabbed just three boards.
</P>
<P>
   The difference? Langdon's 23 points on 7-of-12 shooting, 4-of-7
from outside the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more balanced now,'' Krzyzewski said. ``But everything
we do starts with Trajan.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a player his coach calls ``the bridge'' between Duke eras
old and new tries to finish what these Blue Devils have started.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a special kid,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I'm happy for
everybody, but I'm especially happy for Trajan.''

ISTANBUL EX-MAYOR'S JAILING FUELS TURKEY'S TENSIONS ON RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When former Istanbul Mayor Recep Tayyip
Erdogan enters jail Friday to begin serving a sentence for
subversion, he will be the most visible victim to date of an
intensifying campaign against what military commanders and their
civilian allies say is Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Erdogan resigned at the end of 1998 after he was sentenced for
reading a poem that said: ``The mosques are our barracks, the domes
are our helmets, the minarets are our spears and the faithful are
our warriors.'' That was judged an incitement to religious
rebellion, and Erdogan, until then thought of as a rising star of
the Islamic political movement, was given a 10-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict between the secular establishment and
religious-oriented political parties, which has dominated Turkish
politics in recent years, is intensifying again. Prosecutors are
threatening pro-Islamic politicians with political bans, jail
sentences and even execution.
</P>
<P>
   The most aggressive prosecutor, Vural Savas, was given a public
seal of approval Wednesday when senior generals paid him a visit.
Afterward he advised against repeal of a law that permits
prosecutions of public figures on the ground that they are
fomenting religious or ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament was about to consider a repeal last week when the
military chief of staff, Gen. Huseyin Kivirkoglu, said he opposed
it. His warning effectively ended the debate.
</P>
<P>
   A national election is due in April, and polls suggest that the
Islamic-oriented party is likely to do well, perhaps even finish
first, as it did in the last election, in 1995. That prospect
deeply upsets secular leaders, who accuse the party of harboring a
secret agenda aimed at wiping away the secular state.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 election produced a government led by the
Islamic-oriented Welfare party, but it collapsed after a year under
intense military pressure. Last year the party was outlawed and its
leader, former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, was banned from
politics for five years. But the party has re-emerged under a new
name, Virtue, and Erbakan appears to be directing it from behind
the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   That has outraged prosecutors, and in recent days they have
mounted a concerted attack on Virtue, seeking to outlaw it and to
prosecute its leaders for sedition. Erbakan may also be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Most startlingly, one prosecutor has indicted four former
members of the banned Welfare party and demanded that they be
executed. He charged the four _ one who was the party's deputy
chairman and three others who were members of Parliament _ with
``seeking to undermine the current constitutional state and replace
it with a state based on religious principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment has not been administered for more than a
decade, and few expect that the indicted men will suffer it. The
mere mention of the possibility, however, is evidently intended to
show pro-Islamic politicians how seriously the government
disapproves of their activities.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Virtue party insist that they support the secular
state and merely want Turks to embrace their religious roots and
incorporate religious ethics into public life.
</P>
<P>
   Those political and legal clashes are not the only ones
convulsing Turkey in the pre-election period. A spate of terrorist
attacks has followed the arrest of Kurdish guerrilla leader
Abdullah Ocalan in February. In response, the police have launched
a fierce crackdown. Sunday they arrested more than 2,000 people who
celebrated a traditional spring festival that has become a focus of
Kurdish protests.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed police in a mostly Kurdish
neighborhood of Istanbul charging into crowds of demonstrators and
beating men and women. Shots were fired on both sides, and some
protesters shouted slogans supporting Ocalan and his rebel
movement.

METHODIST MINISTER ACCUSED OF BLESSING SAME-SEX UNION GOES ON
TRIAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ill.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; CHICAGO _ For the second time in a year, a United Methodist
Church minister will face an ecclesiastical trial on a charge that
he violated a church law against ministers' officiating at same-sex
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, the Rev. Greg Dell, 53, has been formally charged
with disobedience to Methodism's ``order and discipline'' for
having blessed the union of two men in his church, Broadway United
Methodist Church, here in Chicago last September.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will begin on Thursday, with 13 ministers acting as a
jury and a retired bishop as judge, in a church sanctuary in
suburban Downers Grove. A verdict could come on Saturday.
Conviction could lead to loss of his ministerial credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In its largest sense, the trial illustrates a national
controversy, in both religious and secular spheres, over same-sex
unions. Even while gay men and lesbians have filed lawsuits in
states like Hawaii and Vermont seeking legal recognition of their
unions, the federal government and a majority of states have passed
laws against recognizing the legality of such bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Many religious groups have been wrestling with questions of how
to relate to the gay men and lesbians in their midst. But while
much of the controversy in Protestant denominations has turned on
whether to ordain noncelibate homosexuals as clergy members,
controversy over same-sex unions has become acute lately among the
country's 8.5 million United Methodists, who constitute the
nation's second-largest Protestant denomination, after the Southern
Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this is because the church, whose members include
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Sen.
Bob Dole, is theologically diverse, including liberal and
conservative wings, as well as a broad center. It also lacks a
single, central authority, like the pope, but at the same time does
not permit its congregations the sort of autonomy found within
Jewish synagogue organizations and some other Protestant
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the church's top policy-making body, the General
Conference, voted to place the following sentence in the church's
rule book: ``Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions shall not
be conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted in our
churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the sentence was not inserted among the book's specific
regulations, but in a section detailing advisory stands on issues
like the use of tobacco and alcohol, some questioned whether it was
binding.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, who had blessed the union
of two women at his church in Omaha, was narrowly acquitted in a
church trial after his lawyers argued that the sentence was
advisory. (Creech's bishop did not reappoint him to his pulpit,
however.) In August, the denomination's highest court, the Judicial
Council, ruled that the sentence had the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Dell blessed the union of Karl Reinhardt, 33, a
high school English teacher, and Keith Eccarius, 41, a computer
systems analyst, at a service attended by about 150 people at
Broadway Church. Eccarius had been a member there for eight years.
He and Reinhardt, who met at a Christmas party in 1996, had asked
Dell to officiate at their union a year before the ceremony was
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Within Dell's case some would discern an additional ethical
question. Can a clergy member violate a denominational law if he or
she believes the pastoral care of an individual requires it? Or
does such law-breaking, especially in a highly contentious issue
like this one, threaten the integrity of the institution to which
that clergy member belongs?
</P>
<P>
   Dell, who is married with an adult son, says about 30 percent of
the people in his urban, 181-member congregation are gay men and
lesbians, and it would be discriminatory not to offer them the
ministerial services he provides to heterosexual members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense will be, the only way I can obey the order and
discipline of the denomination is to violate this rule in this
context,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Stephen C. Williams, who has agreed to prosecute
the case for the church's Northern Illinois Conference, said the
issue was one of a minister's being accountable to the vows he took
to uphold church rules. ``He's free to try to change church law,''
Williams said of Dell. ``He's not free to break it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell, who attended Duke University Divinity School with Creech
in the 1960s and remains a friend of his, said he had officiated at
33 same-sex unions since 1981. He does not call them weddings,
because such ceremonies lack legal sanction. Among other clergy
members here, Dell has a reputation as a supporter of liberal
social causes, an inclination he traces to the influence of his
childhood pastor, a Methodist minister in suburban Chicago who
spoke out against racism in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   After the Judicial Council ruled that the pronouncement on
homosexual union had the force of church law, Reinhardt and
Eccarius asked Dell if he still felt he could officiate. Reinhardt
said they would have ``fully understood'' had Dell decided they
needed to find another minister. ``I did it as an act of pastoral
ministry,'' Dell said in the interview. ``I didn't do it to raise
attention to this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Bishop C. Joseph Sprague, head of the Northern
Illinois Conference, filed a complaint against Dell, saying he was
bound as bishop to uphold church law, but also saying he personally
disagreed with the stand against same-sex unions. Sprague has said
he will make no further comment until after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said he saw the trial as a test of ``the nature of
ministry,'' the latitude a clergy member is allowed in working with
a particular congregation.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dell's critics offered a somewhat similar appraisal of
what is involved in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about issues of conscience, both on Greg's side
and the side of others,'' said that critic, the Rev. Scott Field, a
Methodist minister in nearby Naperville, Ill., who also serves on
the board of Good News, an evangelical caucus within the United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Field said he saw a ``collision between moral visions'' in the
case. For Methodists on both sides of the issue, he asked, ``can we
still walk together?''

BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF TELEVISION ACCOMPANIES BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hours before the first NATO missiles struck Yugoslavia
Wednesday, a new type of warfare flared in Belgrade: a battle for
the control of televised images.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that dramatically reshaped broadcast coverage of the
first day of military hostilities, Serbian police officers raided a
Belgrade hotel and confiscated equipment necessary to transmit live
and taped television footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally cannot feed our own pictures,'' said a frustrated
M.L. Flynn, senior foreign producer of NBC News. ``We've been
shooting all day in Belgrade, and now we can't get any of the
pictures we enterprised into our story.'' Added Marcy McGinnis,
vice president for news coverage at CBS: ``It turns TV into
radio.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, the situation had grown more dire for
journalists, as Serbian authorities arrested and detained about two
dozen reporters and producers.
</P>
<P>
   From a visual standpoint, television faced an unusual battle
Wednesday. Instead of the dramatic, on-the-ground footage that is
meat and potatoes to networks when war breaks out, viewers were
mostly fed thin gruel _ locator maps alongside still photos of
network correspondents delivering reports by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The preemptive strike against television by Serbian authorities
illustrated both the medium's power and its vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   From Vietnam to the Gulf War, images beamed out by television
have arguably been the key variable in molding public opinion. But
increasingly, that fact means that television _ and the free flow
of information _ has been the first casualty of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the propaganda war is as big as the military war,''
said Janet Kolodzy, a former senior producer at CNN who is now a
writer-in-residence at Emerson College. ``The Serbs want to control
the images, want the images told the way they think they should be
told. They want to control the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Kalb, a former network reporter who is now at Harvard's
Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy,
said the Serbians view ``a news story as part of a propaganda war.
The war will be fought in two arenas: the arena where the bombings
take place, and the other arena will be the image of the bombings
that is presented to the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Wednesday, virtually the only images available to
networks came from Serbian TV. To some network officials, it was
puzzling that Yugoslavia chose to choke off independent televised
images of damage and casualties that could engender some sympathy
for its cause. But others saw the crackdown as a symptom of the
deep anger Serbian authorities harbor toward the international
media for what they consider biased coverage of the Kosovo
conflict. It is an anger that has some networks worried about the
safety of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very dangerous,'' said CBS's McGinnis. ``We're even
hearing from the veteran correspondents, who've been in every war
known to man, that tensions are very high, even higher than the
Baghdad tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   There was danger for journalists in Kosovo even before
Wednesday's airstrikes. ABC reporters James Wooten and Mike Lee
were ordered out of Kosovo _ and relocated to Belgrade and
Macedonia, respectively _ after they were threatened, according to
an ABC spokeswoman. Safety concerns also prompted NBC to order
reporter Ron Allen to move from Kosovo to Belgrade, according to an
NBC spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a CNN spokesperson confirmed that CNN reporter
Christopher Burns left Yugoslavia after authorities told his
network that the reporter's life might be in danger. Officials have
denounced CNN on Yugoslavian television as ``a factory of lies,''
and also have broadcast Burns's picture.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Brent Sadler was also threatened by gun-wielding men when
he and several colleagues transmitted a report from Pristina prior
to the attack. One of the men held two bullets in his hand, pointed
at CNN employees and said, ``these bullets are for you.'' After
Sadler finished his report, he discovered that the tires on his
vehicle had been slashed.
</P>
<P>
   The move Wednesday against the television networks by Serbian
authorities occurred in two stages.
</P>
<P>
   First came the shutdown of the satellite transmission equipment.
Initially, authorities allowed the networks to broadcast reports
from a state-controlled TV station. That raised fears of
censorship, since the authorities could pull the plug at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, forced to resort to a
telephone hookup, spelled out the consequences for viewers before
she was detained by Serbian police: ``We can no longer broadcast
independently. We have to broadcast either by telephone or through
facilities provided by state-controlled media.''
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, however, once the military attack on
Yugoslavia began, Serbian authorities eliminated even that option.
``The Americans have been kicked out'' of the studio, said NBC's
Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   Network officials said the Yugoslav government offered no
explanation for the crackdown. It forced the networks to scramble
for ways to get the story out. Correspondents delivered their
reports over satellite telephones, sometimes accompanied by
previously taped images that had been fed earlier to bureaus in
London or elsewhere. Producers made plans to transport taped
reports to other transmitting stations, perhaps beyond Yugoslavia's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary confronting TV news organizations was exacerbated
because viewers have grown accustomed to continuing live coverage,
with pictures, during times of crisis. ``It doesn't stop us from
reporting the story, but it stops us from showing the visuals you
wish to have,'' said CBS's McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time TV networks have had to confront
government hostility. During the 1991 Gulf War, the Iraqi
government censored reports and the US military tightly controlled
media access to information. Chinese authorities tried to halt TV
transmissions during the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Network producers Wednesday vowed not to be deterred by the
Serbian authorities. ``It's not the perfect situation, but I think
we'll be fine here,'' said NBC's Flynn. ``We'll always figure out a
way to tell a straight story.''

 &HT;    Georgia lawmaker: Customs detains blacks more often at airport
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) called Wednesday for a
formal investigation into allegations that blacks are being
targeted for customs inspections at Hartsfield International
Airport based on nothing more than the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints come from a half-dozen customs inspectors who say
the unwritten rule at Hartsfield is to ``go after blacks.'' Lewis'
action also was prompted by a recent report on Fox Television's
WAGA-TV that alleged that customs inspectors at Hartsfield are more
likely to detain blacks than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who
oversees the Customs Service, saying that he has been told that 90
percent of the individuals sent to Atlanta-area hospitals to be
X-rayed for drugs were black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced, based on what I've heard, that there is a
systematic pattern on the part of the custom agents in Atlanta to
select black males,'' Lewis said. ``There's something that's not
fair about this, something that is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee, which is conducting a
comprehensive review of the Customs Service's enforcement and
commercial operations, also will review how the agency conducts its
inspections. Senate Finance Chairman William Roth (R-Del.) plans to
hold hearings on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Roth said that he was aware of the allegations
of racial discrimination during the customs process nationwide. He
said he has expressed concern to the upper ranks of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that we can work together to successfully
identify and address any weaknesses in customs' overall
management,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Murphy, a Customs Service spokesperson, said the
department would thoroughly investigate the allegations about
inspections at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take this very seriously,'' Murphy said. ``We will take
immediate action and do what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Murphy noted, the agency's own statistics tell a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, officials searched three times more whites than
blacks during customs inspections last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2 million passengers passing through Atlanta last year,
about two dozen were X-rayed to detect drugs. About 16 of those
people were black, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the agency's policy is clear: Smugglers can be of
any shape, size or color, and there is no room for discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smugglers come in all races,'' Murphy said. ``Babies have been
used to smuggle drugs as have 70-year-old grandparents. I do not
believe we are being discriminatory. In fact, our policy is just
the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that inspectors go through 12 weeks of training and
are given additional training on cultural sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Cathy Harris, a customs inspector for the
last 13 years in Atlanta and Miami. It is a matter of routine, she
said, for the agency to single out blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Nigerian, forget it, your name is in the computer,''
said Harris, a senior inspector who has filed several complaints
over the last four years alleging discrimination in customs
inspections. She also has filed complaints alleging that she has
been subjected to discrimination and sexual harassment at the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a hostile work environment,'' said Harris, who
said she has been singled out for coming forward with her
complaints. ``They have done everything to me except handcuff me
and throw me against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy would not comment on Harris' complaints because they are
pending in court.

GETTING HIP TO THE `MOD SQUAD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 26 by  NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Toward the end of the laughably stupid (M)TV
update, ``The Mod Squad,'' writer-director Scott Silver tries to
pretend that his plot-free movie has been, all along, a savvy,
self-referential goof on cop films.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you have the priceless chance to hear little Claire Danes
proclaim (a la Mel Gibson and Danny Glover), ``I'm getting too old
for this (stuff).'' Which, to use the ``hip'' lingo of the ``Mod
Squad'' universe, I can only reply, ``Duh.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at 19, Danes should be old enough to know better. For
starters, ``The Mod Squad'' wasn't all that cool (at least with
young people) when it was on television 30 years ago. The kids on
the show, after all, were narcs. How hip is that?
</P>
<P>
   But with teen spirit fueling Hollywood's all-mighty quest for a
fast buck, the idea of three cool kids playing cops must have
sounded like a sure-fire winner. And who knows, in more capable
hands, maybe it could have been.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we get drivel. Three adolescents _ a smart-aleck rich
kid, Pete (Giovanni Ribisi); a ``solid'' dude from the ``hood,''
Lincoln (Omar Epps); and tough cookie Julie (Danes) _ have been
recruited by a police captain (Dennis Farina) to infiltrate youth
culture and bust evil hipsters. Why them? Who knows? The other
squares in the department must be too busy scarfing down doughnuts
to be able to fit in with the beautiful people.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of jail time for their various
transgressions, the contentious trio agrees to become undercover
cops. Of course, they play by their own rules. That goes without
saying. They're solid.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay gives the actors plenty of room to strike poses,
but that's about it. Danes, Epps and Ribisi are talented performers
and their presence saves ``The Mod Squad'' from complete
unwatchability. But Silver hasn't bothered to give this movie a
story and the action scenes would seem out of place (not to mention
poorly constructed) in a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   The movie isn't harder to watch than any of the old '70s cop
shows like ``Mannix'' and ``Kojak.'' The thing is, you can see them
on television for free. The costumes and soundtrack are rooted in
the '70s, too, but spun with a 21st-century sensibility. It's candy
for the eye and the ear while the mind drifts and grows nostalgic
about Clarence Williams' Afro.

HOLLYWOOD'S SHOCKED AND APPALLED AT MIRAMAX? OH, PLEASE!  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's still nothing quite as exhilarating as the spectacle of
some of Hollywood's toughest wheeler-dealers, each of whom has an
average income exceeding the GNP of many countries, as they take
umbrage at the shabby behavior of an upstart not yet in their club.
</P>
<P>
   Such outrage! Such piety! Such wounded feelings!
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us: such bliss!
</P>
<P>
   These guys remind us of the Bible-thumping, nostrum-peddling,
dream-selling scalawags who roamed the American West even before
Hollywood was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to the ghastly events that unraveled in slow motion
Sunday night at the Academy Awards show when Steven Spielberg's
World War II melodrama, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the odds-on
favorite to control the night, was lyrically humiliated by
``Shakespeare in Love.'' The English romantic comedy, directed by
John Madden, won the best picture Oscar and six others. How did
``Shakespeare in Love'' do it? Some would have you believe only by
hook if not by outright crook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which had been hailed as something of a
holy object even before its release in July, and which then went on
to become a huge box office hit, won only five awards. True, they
did include an Oscar for Spielberg's direction, but in the virtual
reality of Hollywood, that's a virtual sop for the industry's
virtual savior. Witness the responses to this upset as reported by
my colleague Bernard Weinraub in The New York Times on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The main villain: Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman (with his
brother Robert) of Miramax Films, the company that released not
only ``Shakespeare in Love,'' but also Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' the Italian-made concentration camp comedy that was
named the best foreign language film of the year. Weinraub reported
that ``Dreamworks, which produced `Private Ryan' with Paramount,
was devastated'' by the Miramax victories. The principal criticism
directed at Weinstein: During the Oscar voting period he spent too
much money promoting his nominees in ads taken in the Hollywood
trade papers, Variety and The Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The head of another movie company complained: ``Look at what
happened last night. The machinery Harvey put in place is like a
juggernaut. All productions, all sense of logic and in some
instances a sense of fairness is thrown out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember these charges are issuing from Hollywood, a town where
the gospel always has been that you have to spend a buck to make a
buck. Suddenly everybody's talking as if defending an Augustinian
City of God against the forces of that other fellow: not the Devil
exactly, but the unfashionable Harvey Weinstein from Brooklyn and
Queens, educated at the State University at Buffalo. Even when
dressed in designer suits, he gives the impression of having sat up
all night in a stalled commuter train. No wonder he lives in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The people in Miramax's Los Angeles office said the company
bought fewer pages in the trades to promote ''Shakespeare'' (an
estimated 118) than Dreamworks and Paramount to promote ``Private
Ryan'' (an estimated 165). It's at this point the West Coast
outrage becomes interesting and Hollywood-devious.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, no one competently addresses the fact that
the Oscars are voted by 5,500 card-carrying members of the Motion
Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences, employees of the same
executives who are so hypocritical about the success of Miramax.
What the opposition really seems to be saying is that the voters
are stupid and/or as susceptible to trade ads as toddlers are to
the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   There are changes going on in movies that Hollywood seems to be
serenely unaware of, though the industry itself has both monitored
and encouraged them. For one thing, the academy voters are no
longer dominated by the Old Guard that made Hollywood a company
town. Voters are younger now; many, possibly, are younger than the
baby boomers who run the business and often dress as if they were
their own children. The only vested voter interest today is in
movies in general, not in particular titles or studios, at least
not in any way that would seriously destabilize voting results.
</P>
<P>
   As Hollywood has earnestly dumbed down its movies to suit more
naive, impressionable audiences, it has fractured the movie
audience, whose young, fad-oriented core group harbors tastes
Hollywood can neither safely predict nor understand.
</P>
<P>
   All the hard-sell hustle and ``unfair'' trade advertising in the
world could not have turned ``Shakespeare in Love'' into the
serious hit it has become if the potential had not been there to
begin with. It's a very special movie, initially because of its
grandly funny, multilayered, Oscar-winning screenplay by Marc
Norman and Tom Stoppard, the incomparable Czech-born, English
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   It's both a brilliant, comic send-up of historical films
(blocked genius category) and a sweetly limpid and affecting love
story that rediscovers some of the romantic power within ``Romeo
and Juliet.'' In this fashion it delights various different movie
audiences that otherwise seldom overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Poor old ``Private Ryan'' apparently came out of the starting
gate too soon for the excitement to endure into Oscar time. It's
last summer's movie. At the speed with which movies are consumed
today, that's almost like saying it's as old as the original ``King
Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   For me, it still has the manner of a movie that was found in the
editing room: the director and his associates, realizing the
unusual tactile power of the Normandy landing scenes, filmed with
hand-held cameras, decided to let it run at length (nearly 30
minutes), in this way to lend authenticity to the more or less
commonplace World War II battle movie that followed.
</P>
<P>
   How could a film hailed for its authenticity have featured a
war-weary Army lieutenant (played by Tom Hanks) who looks as it he
had spent his training in England hanging out at McDonald's? You
don't have to hire an entire research department to find out what
the guys on those beaches looked like: lean and exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to knock Spielberg's talents. He's one of the best,
though not necessarily when dealing with Big Issues, which, as in
``Schindler's List'' and ``Amistad,'' he simplifies and
sentimentalizes. He has a child's-eye view of the universe. He
demonstrates an uncanny appreciation for children's fears and
fantasies in ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' and ``Empire of
the Sun,'' even in ``Jurassic Park.'' To hail him as an Eisenstein
is to mislead him and the public.
</P>
<P>
   The short theater life of even good films today may be one of
the reasons that ``Private Ryan'' lost to ``Shakespeare.'' Another:
the pompous ad campaign that announced the pre-Oscar re-release of
``Private Ryan.'' This would include radio spots that solemnly
prepared us for the return of ``the most honored film of the year''
(or some such verbiage), intoned in the slightly bogus manner of
someone selling an over-the-counter elixir designed to cure
obesity, cancer and liver spots.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood fury directed at Miramax and particularly
Weinstein is based on something else. The Brothers Weinstein are
not only unfashionable but, even worse, seriously successful.
Coming from what Hollywood considers nowhere, they incorporated
Miramax in 1979 and released their first film, ``The Secret
Policeman's Other Ball,'' in 1982. Before being acquired by Disney
in 1993, which deepened their pockets considerably, they had
released an impressive list of foreign and American independent
films.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: ``Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' ``Pelle the
Conqueror,'' ``My Left Foot,'' ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and
Her Lover'' and ``Cinema Paradiso.'' The hoopla surrounding the
success of ``The Crying Game'' in 1992 put the brothers in the
public eye.
</P>
<P>
   These are the guys whom their Hollywood colleagues are now
bad-rapping for caring only about winning Oscars. Is there anybody
even remotely connected to the movie industry who doesn't share
that dream? The way the Weinsteins acquire movies often looks as if
they used a vacuum cleaner. They have released more than 150 since
the early 1980s. But they've also released a high percentage of
innovative and very popular works to reach audiences that the
bigger boys in Hollywood have let go.
</P>
<P>
   This post-Oscar outrage is a joke. Come on, fellows: shut up or
invite the Weinsteins to join the club.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Stung by NATO's decision to launch air strikes against
Yugoslavia, Russia on Wednesday night suspended cooperation with
the Western alliance and denounced the attack as an act of brazen
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the public words, however, was a tempering factor: Russia
still needs billions of dollars in Western loans.
</P>
<P>
   That need was underscored by Russia's announcement on Wednesday
night that Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, would arrive in Moscow this weekend
for another round of talks. A senior American official said on
Wednesday that the visit was occurring with the encouragement of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between the imperatives of its pro-Yugoslavian foreign
policy and its pressing economic needs, Russia did its best on
Wednesday to head off a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation, President Boris Yeltsin urged
President Clinton not to go through with the air strikes and made
an impassioned television address carrying the same message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appealing to the whole world,'' Yelstin said. ``I am
appealing to people who survived the war, to those who experienced
the bombings, their children, to all political figures. As long as
there remain some minutes, let's persuade Bill Clinton not to take
this tragic, dramatic step.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, for his part, telephoned the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, to encourage him to reach
an accommodation on the Kosovo issue. Washington's and Belgrade's
rebuffs to the Kremlin's appeals were taken here as a powerful blow
to Russian pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our American partners were not the only ones who wiped their
feet on us,'' said Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of the Parliament's
committee on foreign affairs. ``Unfortunately, our Eastern European
partners did so as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps announced by Yeltsin on Wednesday were, in part, an
effort to salvage a measure of respect. Protesting NATO's bombing,
Yeltsin recalled Russia's envoy to NATO, Lt. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin.
The Russian president also suspended Russian participation in the
alliance's cooperative military exercises, known as ``Partnership
for Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Those steps, however, were largely symbolic. Zavarzin has
devoted much of his energy not to strengthening ties between Moscow
and the alliance, but to fighting a losing battle against NATO
expansion. And Russia's cooperation with the ``Partnership for
Peace'' program has been very modest, partly for budgetary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also said somewhat ominously on Wednesday night that
Russia reserved the right to take ``appropriate measures,''
including military steps to safeguard its security.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's vague allusion led to speculation among Russian
hardliners that the military might move nuclear weapons back into
Belarus, where they would be closer to NATO nations. But centrist
politicians assailed the suggestion as wildly impractical, noting
that it would backfire by fanning support for a further enlargement
of the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarussia,
outside the borders of Russia, have to do with this?'' former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said derisively. ``We must not end up
in isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   What Yeltsin did not say on Wednesday night was as important as
what he did say. He did not, for example, threaten to shelve the
START-2 treaty, though its approval by the Parliament will almost
certainly now be delayed in the Communist-led Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he promise to send military aid to Yugoslavia, though a
late-night Russian television call-in show reported that would-be
patriots were flooding nationalist organizations and local
government offices with offers to volunteer to fight with the Serbs
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Primakov canceled his trip to Washington on Tuesday
after he was already en route, in protest of the decision to bomb,
Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's atomic energy minister, stayed in
Washington. He had arrived several days early to complete the
negotiations on the sale of uranium from Russian nuclear warheads _
an accord worth billions of dollars to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why Russian officials take umbrage at
the bombing, beyond their ties with Yugoslavia, including
resentment of America's superpower status and concern about NATO's
setting a precedent for intervention into internal ethnic strife of
the sort that occurred in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's close embrace of the Milosevic regime has not gone
without criticism here. Primakov himself received something less
than a hero's welcome after the dramatic U-turn in the sky that
brought him back to Moscow on Tuesday. Some critics complained he
had put Yugoslavia's interest ahead of Russia's while others
fretted that Russian influence had dwindled to a point that not
even Belgrade was afraid of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow is Becoming the Hostage of Milosevic,'' the newspaper
Izvestia noted in a front-page headline.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly, there were many politicians who rushed to support
Primakov's decision to turn his plane around. Communist lawmakers,
an increasingly important part of his power base, backed Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   So did Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, a presidential aspirant who
insisted that Russia had no other means to demonstrate its
unhappiness with Washington's policy.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Russia's leaders rallied around the flag, the very
public dissent among Russia's political elite was noteworthy,
raising questions at home about Primakov's stewardship of foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The most stinging criticism came in a front-page article in the
newspaper Kommersant, which charged that Primakov had risked the
IMF credits to demonstrate a Bolshevik-style solidarity with the
anti-Western regime in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko Party, also
criticized the Kremlin's handling of the Yugoslav issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky said the prime minister should have gone to Washington
to express his concerns about a NATO strike. Russian diplomacy
toward Belgrade, he continued, was marked by helplessness and
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no plan,'' he said. ``Only a protesting
attitude, which is the most counter-productive in international
affairs.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
FORT WORTH _ Bobby Labonte has a difficult decision to make this
week at Texas Motor Speedway. The Corpus Christi native has to
decide whether racing in pain is worth the gain.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labonte loves to compete on the track in his home state. He
finished in the top 10 in each of the first two Winston Cup races
at the 1.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   But Labonte comes to Texas with a fractured right shoulder
blade, the result of a practice-session crash last week at
Darlington. He also ranks third in the Cup points race, only 26
points behind leader Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Grand National points leader Matt Kenseth helped Labonte
stay close in the points chase by replacing Labonte early in the
race and driving the Interstate Batteries Pontiac to a 10th-place
finish last weekend at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   Now Labonte has to decide what's best for him and his team:
Should he try to go the distance in Sunday's Primestar 500 and
fight the pain in his shoulder or hope Kenseth can provide another
quality performance?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take it one day at a time,'' Labonte said. ``We
went to work Monday in rehab and have been treating the shoulder
all week. On Friday, we'll evaluate it and see where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has decided he will not compete in Saturday's Coca-Cola
300 BGN race. Former BGN champion Steve Grissom will drive the MBNA
Pontiac for the Joe Gibbs team.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on the Cup race isn't as easy. At age 34, Labonte
is considered one of the rising stars on the Cup circuit and one of
the few who has any chance at unseating Jeff Gordon for the Winston
Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte must carefully consider what is best for the team this
weekend at TMS. Is he likely to garner more points by driving the
entire race with one good arm on the steering wheel, or is Kenseth
more likely to drive the No. 18 Grand Prix to a competitive finish?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be there if Bobby needs me,'' Kenseth said. ``I hope he
doesn't, but I will do whatever Bobby wants me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has to start the race to earn the points, which he did
at Darlington. He was supposed to turn the driving over to Kenseth
on the first caution, which came on the fourth lap.
</P>
<P>
   But Labonte was so far back in the field that the leaders would
have lapped his car had he tried to make the switch then. He
toughed it out for another 39 laps before rain brought out a red
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth took over when the race resumed and did better than
anyone on the Gibbs team could have hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt did a real good job for us,'' said Jimmy Makar, Labonte's
crew chief. ``He had to come from last all the way to 10th. I think
Matt had a good time in the car, and we had a good time with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, who will become a full-time Cup driver next year,
thought he could have moved up still more had the race not ended
early because of the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran as hard as I could and passed as many cars as I could,''
Kenseth said. ``I really didn't know where we were until the race
was over. When they told me we were 10th, I said, `Wow. That's
pretty good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bobby did a tremendous job of staying out there as long as
he did. I know he was in pain, but he sucked it up and stayed with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte admits he probably would not have been able to drive the
car to a top-10 finish as Kenseth did, but his 43-lap effort showed
Labonte what he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't feel all that bad, better than I thought it would
be,'' Labonte said. ``That definitely relieved a lot of pressure
off my mind. Just knowing I could get back in there made me feel a
lot better about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing while hurting is nothing new for the Labonte family. Big
brother Terry is known as NASCAR's ``Ironman`` because of his
record 607 consecutive starts. A few of those starts were made when
most people would have been in a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby has been through this situation before, when he fractured
his left shoulder blade in 1995. That injury also came in a crash
at Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte drove 110 laps the next weekend at Bristol before
getting out of the car and letting David Green take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labontes are tough,'' Makar said. ``But you can only be so
tough. When you've got something broken and it hurts you, it's
going to be hard to do your best. Since we've been through this
thing with Bobby before, we know what to expect with his
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte could hold off driving until Sunday by letting Kenseth
qualify the car for him Friday. But Labonte wants to get track time
on the rebuilt surface at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Makar and Gibbs say they will not allow Labonte to drive if they
feel he is endangering himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first concern is Bobby's health, even before points and
everything else,'' Makar said. ``It would take a little bit of wind
out of our sails, but Bobby and his family is what matters most to
us.''

DOW FAILS TO JOIN IN AS NASDAQ RISES FROM TUESDAY LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks caught fire in the last 90 minutes
of trading Wednesday, lifting the Nasdaq composite index to a 1.83
percent gain, a recovery of more than half of what it lost in the
broad market selloff Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The late rally did little, however, for blue-chip stocks as the
Dow Jones industrial average, dragged down by American Express and
oil issues, slipped 4.99 points, to 9,666.84, receding further from
the 10,000 mark it flirted with last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq rose 42.44 points, to 2,365.28. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index gained 6.45 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to
1,268.59.
</P>
<P>
   The session began ominously, with markets in Tokyo and Hong Kong
skidding about 3 percent overnight and tension building from NATO's
decision to begin bombing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of turning to renewed selling, the market steadied.
One contributor, analysts said, was Abby Joseph Cohen, the
influential Goldman, Sachs strategist, who predicted the Dow would
rise to 10,300 by the end of the year, up from her previous
prediction of 9,850.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect 1999 and 2000 to be years of ongoing profit
expansion, with better aggregate gains than 1998, which was
disappointing,'' she said in a report to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor may have been bullish words from Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. about IBM, which also announced a $3 billion order for computer
parts from EMC. IBM, the Dow's biggest gainer, rose 4 1/8, to 169
1/2. EMC jumped 5, to 118 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   A government report of the biggest decline in more than seven
years for big-ticket manufactured goods also seemed to help settle
the stock market because a slowing economy implies lower interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The market mostly marked time until President Clinton announced
the beginning of the bombing in Yugoslavia, apparently dispelling
some of the uncertainty that Wall Street detests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a surge of buying in high-tech stocks,'' said Anthony
O'Bryan, a market analyst at AG Edwards in St. Louis. ``Perhaps
that's signaling that the worst of the correction is over.''
Sometimes the most auspicious market turns, he added, are those
touched off by no particular news, but only a sense that the
pendulum has swung too far.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed in
Overland Park, Kan., said a sound high-technology sector was
essential if the market is to resume its advance. ``It's tough for
the stock market to make a lot of progress with tech bumping
along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology issues, along with blue chips, paced the market's
long rise into record territory but have succumbed of late to
evidence of slackened growth and fears of overvaluation, especially
compared with lesser stocks, which have mostly lagged.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small companies, for example, has
fallen 8.9 percent this year, compared with a 7.87 percent gain for
the Nasdaq and a 5.29 percent gain for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Internet deal found no shortage of buyers.
Miningco.com Inc., which supplies human guides for people trying to
search the Web, saw its initial public stock offering, priced at
25, soar as high as 62 1/4 before closing at 47 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high-technology gainers were Microsoft, up 4 11/16, to
171 1/4; Intel, up 4 11/16, to 119 1/4; Dell, up 2 13/16, to 38
1/2, and Cisco, up 4 1/8, to 104 7/16.

AIRSTRIKES REVEAL SPLIT WITHIN REPUBLICAN PARTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-MILITARY, KOSOVO-RATIONALE and
KOSOVO-CONGRESS, which will move shortly.) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision to bomb Kosovo on
Wednesday sparked Republican reactions that revealed divisions
within the GOP on how to conduct foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The differing opinions have been evident as lawmakers in
Congress wrestled with whether to support the president.
</P>
<P>
   But they have also surfaced among likely presidential candidates
who want to stake out a firm position without interfering with
current policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   On one end of the spectrum, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, echoing the
assessment of her husband, former Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole, endorsed the mission based on humanitarian and strategic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., argued ``American
lives are being put in jeopardy because of a civil war in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, grudgingly supported the
president's decision while slamming the administration for its
handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   McCain voted to support the airstrikes, but said, ``Congress and
the American people have good reason to fear that we are heading
toward another permanent garrison of Americans in a Balkan country
where our mission is confused and our exit strategy a complete
mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McCain, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
added, ``Our adversaries around the globe will take heart from our
inability to act in concert to defend our interests and values.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose father led the nation
in the 1991 Persian Gulf War with Iraq, has been notably reticent
about the military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes that it is a decision for the commander- in-chief
who has the military and intelligence information,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush believes if we are going to commit American
troops we must be sure there is clear mission and an achievable
goal and an exit strategy,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Among other contenders, conservative television commentator Pat
Buchanan, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, and conservative activist Gary
Bauer opposed the attack; former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander
supported airstrikes but opposed ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The range of reactions mirror the ongoing debate within the
Republican Party over what the U.S. role should be on the
international scene.
</P>
<P>
   Their divisions also reflect the lack of consensus among the
American public, whom polls show are almost equally divided on the
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say candidates walk a fine line as they
attempt to highlight their differences with the administration
while at the same time not appearing to undercut American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have got to be very careful. We are involved in an act of
war and you have to be supportive of the nation and its
commander-in-chief,'' said Greg Mueller, an adviser to candidate
Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is supporting the airstrikes but opposes placing U.S.
ground forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Mueller said the impeachment damaged the president's
credibility, giving candidates more latitude to criticize Clinton
and be openly skeptical of his promises.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle cited the impeachment in his
critique of the president's Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said the Balkan situation has spiralled out of control
because Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic sensed ``a weakened
American president.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bush administration, in which Quayle served, warned
Serbs in 1992 to stay out of Kosovo, Quayle now, as a presidential
candidate, is questioning the extent of U.S. involvement in the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States can take the lead when it comes to
intelligence, logistics, medical help and things like that,''
Quayle said. ``But when it comes to ground troops and ground
support, I say that you really need to have the Europeans there.
It's a European problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole argued that Kosovo is more than that.
</P>
<P>
   She called the region of ``important consequence to America's
national interest.'' She cited humanitarian concerns, particularly
the allegations of ethnic cleansing by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The fissure within the Republican Party between those who
advocate international involvement and those that have opposed
interference abroad have been around for years. Some Republicans
actively opposed U.S entry into both world wars.
</P>
<P>
   But one expert said some of the Republican response reflects not
just philosophical or political differences with the Clinton
administration but the failure of the White House to adequately
explain its Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case has not been made as what our strategy is and what
our interests are to justify the commitment,'' said Ed Djerejian,
director of the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice
University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   George Edwards, professor at Texas A&AMP;M University, argued that
Clinton has the advantage because Milosevic, who has been blamed
for massacres of ethnic minorities in his country, is easy to cast
as the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is such a monster. It is very helpful to the extent
you can demonize,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only Republican candidates who face risks in staking
out positions on Kosovo. Vice President Al Gore, leading in polls
on the Democratic presidential contest, is inextricably tied to the
administration policy and could face criticism if lives are lost.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's adversary in the Democratic primaries, former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, was quick to criticize the administration's
strategy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are escalating our commitment without establishing a clear
exit strategy. As with Bosnia, we run the risk of becoming bogged
down in a quagmire whose end we cannot predict,'' he said.

<P>
   With the Yugoslav economy already battered and trade limited
since international economic sanctions were first imposed in 1992,
air strikes by the United States and its NATO allies against
Yugoslavia are unlikely to cause great economic harm.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the economic impact, Andrew Kenningham, an East
European economist at Merrill Lynch in London, said, ``It's
completely irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's total exports in 1998 rose to $3 billion, from $2.4
billion in 1997, and of that total, only $12.6 million went to the
United States. The country imported $73.9 million worth of U.S.
goods last year, according to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Both numbers were up from 1997, when $10.4 million of Yugoslav
goods _ about 0.4 percent _ were shipped to the United States, and
Yugoslav imports from the United States totaled about $54 million.
Yugoslav exports consisted primarily of manufactured goods,
machinery and commodities.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began air strikes against Serbian military targets in the
former Yugoslavia on Wednesday because Belgrade refused to sign a
peace deal on Kosovo and halt Serbian violence against ethnic
Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
   Although the direct economic impact of the military actions will
be limited, there could be a negative impact on relations between
the United States and Russia or on Wall Street if the military
action rattles investors, said Morris Goldstein, a senior fellow at
the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Italy was Yugoslavia's largest trading partner in 1997; taking
about 12 percent of its exports. Macedonia and Germany accounted
for about 9 percent of exports, and Russia, a traditional Serbian
ally, accounted for 7 percent. Yugoslavia's primary exports are
food, such as fruits and vegetables, chemicals, iron, steel and
textiles. Before economic sanctions were imposed, the United States
sent aircraft, computers and other products there.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's thinly-traded currency, the dinar, fell slightly to
10.66 dinar to the dollar Wednesday, down from 10.7 on Tuesday.
That means that one dinar is worth a little more than 9 cents. It
has lost more than half its value in the year since the Kosovo
conflict began, moving from 4.85 to the dollar, or about 21 cents,
to its current level. As a result of a possible devaluation, the
dinar had traded as high as about 11.15 during the past 12 months,
said Jamie Coleman, managing foreign exchange analyst at Thomson
Global Markets in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions prevent trading of the dinar in the United States.
Elsewhere, Yugoslavia's lack of hard currency means that the dinar
can be purchased as an investment, but it cannot be sold, and must
therefore be bartered for other products.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's economy is among the victims of the civil war that
broke out in 1991, and it is now characterized by black market
dealings, bartering and hyperinflation. The breakup, which left
Yugoslavia with only two republics, Serbia and Montenegro,
destroyed the country's industrial sector, cutting off Serbia's
large manufacturing sectors from suppliers and outlets _ a
situation that was worsened by international sanctions, imposed in
June 1992 and lifted in January 1996. The United States imposed
sanctions again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Before the civil war, a Yugo plant in Kragujevac, for example,
that rolled out 200,000 vehicles a year, had been a centerpiece of
the economy. The cars, priced at $4,000 apiece, were exported to
other East European countries and to the United States in 1986. But
the small, boxy cars quickly became known for their shoddy
construction and were withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1992. By
1996 production at the Kragujevac factory, about 90 miles south of
Belgrade, fell below 10,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Few U.S. companies have a presence in Yugoslavia. ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a U.S. drug maker that had some operations in
Yugoslavia, merged those operations with a Yugoslav drug maker in
1991, and its assets there were seized by Serbian police and
paramilitary forces in February. Nike Inc. has manufactured a small
amount of footwear-related equipment there, a spokesman said,
adding that he would have to check on the present situation.

MILLIONAIRE PROPOSES OVERHAUL OF CALIFORNIA'S CAMPAIGN FINANCE
LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ron K. Unz, the Silicon Valley millionaire who
sponsored the ballot proposition that effectively ended bilingual
education in California last year, is proposing a sweeping new
measure that would overhaul the state's campaign finance and
disclosure laws and take reapportionment out of the hands of the
Legislature and turn it over to an independent commission.
</P>
<P>
   The complex proposal, dubbed the California Voters Bill of
Rights, would require all contributions of $1,000 or more to be
disclosed electronically over the Internet within 24 hours of their
receipt by a campaign committee, bar candidates for statewide
office from raising money except in the 12 months before their
primary election, impose a contribution limit of $5,000 per
election to candidates for statewide office and ban corporate
contributions outright.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also impose voluntary spending limits for
gubernatorial candidates of $6 million in a primary and $10 million
in a general election for candidates who agreed to accept partial
matching public funds, which could only be used to finance
television, radio or other electronic advertising.
</P>
<P>
   California is one of a relative handful of states with no
contribution or spending limits, and campaigns here consistently
break national spending records, with the two major candidates for
governor last year having spent a total of more than $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Unz, a Republican, said in an interview Wednesday that he was
confident he could gather the 670,000 signatures needed to put the
measure on the ballot in the state's primary election next March,
and that it would win easily. But the proposal drew quick criticism
from a bipartisan range of political consultants and campaign
finance experts who described it as an unwieldy mix of worthy
ideas, administrative complexities and tepid changes certain to
prompt a welter of legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of reform, the most important one we can
make is full and instant disclosure,'' said Leslie Goodman, a
Republican political consultant in Sacramento. ``But this just
sounds like the Rubik's Cube of campaign finance reform all wrapped
up in one initiative. On the one hand, it has the seedlings of some
important reforms, but also some complex and untenable elements in
the context of a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign, a
Washington group that advocates public financing of campaigns,
dismissed the core of Unz's proposals as ``very '70s style
reforms,'' that address only ``a tiny percentage of the playing
field'' of the richest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like there are new '90's bells and whistles in terms
of disclosure,'' Ms. Miller said, adding, ``I'm not ridiculing it
and saying it's not useful relative to the wide-open nature of
California law right now. But will it address the fundamental
issues of money in politics? No, it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Unz noted that a 1996 ballot measure that set contribution
limits of $500 for statewide candidates has been blocked by federal
courts as unconstitutionally restrictive. That measure's principal
backer, Tony Miller, a Democrat and former acting state secretary
of state, has signed on as co-sponsor of Unz's current proposal.

 LOS ANGELES: current proposal. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new measure is Unz's latest foray into the politics of the
nation's most populous state, since the overwhelming victory last
June of his Proposition 227, which essentially ended bilingual
education programs in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Unz ran an unsuccessful primary challenge to then-Gov. Pete
Wilson in 1994, but has now chosen to become a major player in the
state's ballot proposition wars, which in recent years have
increasingly decided important policy issues in the face of
legislative stalemate or inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Mr. Mischief now,'' said Bill Carrick, a leading
Democratic political consultant who has been active in major
campaigns here. ``He's decided that he doesn't want to pursue his
own personal political ambitions but wants to play initiative
politics instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Unz contended that, ``Many of the people who obviously would be
opposing this are people vested in the current system, and many of
those people have done very well.'' He added, ``But if we're
talking about many of these being worthy proposals, then why hasn't
the state Legislature implemented them for all these years?''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the measures Unz proposes would be novel and
relatively noncontroversial, like immediate Internet disclosure of
campaign contributions, which has yet to be required by any state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one who does that on a 24-hour turnaround,'' said
Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonprofit group in Washington that studies campaign
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures, like a proposal to require a statewide
referendum on pay increases for state officials that exceed the
Consumer Price Index, will doubtless be popular with voters in an
era of wide distaste for politics and politicians. So might a
requirement that candidates liquidate their campaign funds after
each election, giving half of whatever is left over to their party
and half to the state's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   But other elements, like turning legislative redistricting over
to a commission of retired judges appointed by legislative leaders
from both parties, are certain to draw intense opposition,
especially from Democrats, who control both houses of the
Legislature and the governor's office for the first time in nearly
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``An initiative is only as strong as its weakest proposals,''
said Dan Schnur, a former aide to Wilson who is now a political
consultant. ``The problem with a sweeping initiative is it's easy
to run against.''
</P>
<P>
   Unz declined to say how much he was willing to spend of his own
money, or raise from others, in support of his plan, but one of the
state's most prominent Republican strategists, Ken Khachigian, said
the money would be better spent in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party's got to realize that if we try to raise $8 million
or $10 million for one of these things in an effort to change
redistricting, it would be better spent by putting it into Assembly
and Senate campaigns and winning back the Legislature,'' Khachigian
said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The three waves of NATO missile attacks and
airstrikes on Wednesday opened what officials said would be a
protracted assault to weaken the Yugoslav military, but would do
little immediately to end President Slobodan Milosevic's bloody
crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first barrage of several dozen of cruise missiles _ fired
from six B-52 bombers and from four American warships, two American
submarines and a British submarine _ started falling on air
defenses across the breadth of Yugoslavia, Pentagon and NATO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial wave was followed quickly by two waves of strikes by
scores of fighter jets and bombers from the United States and seven
other NATO nations, including Britain, Germany and the Netherlands,
the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's strikes did not target the Serbian troops and tanks
that have been systematically destroying village after village in
Kosovo with renewed fury since peace talks collapsed last week.
Instead the battering focused largely, though not entirely, on the
air defenses and the command network that pose the greatest threat
to American and NATO pilots crisscrossing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a few days of this,'' a NATO official said, ``before
you can put in a larger number of the aircraft you need to go after
the forces involved in the repression.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Wednesday included strikes by F-117 ``stealth''
fighters, as well as the combat debut of the B-2 ``stealth''
bomber, which at $2.1 billion each is the most expensive warplane
ever built. Two of the B-2 bombers, flying from Whiteman Air Force
Base in Missouri, each dropped 16 2,000-pound bombs.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Yugoslavia's air force and anti-aircraft missiles
mounted a fierce defense, according to American and NATO officials.
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said that all American and
allied aircraft had returned safely to their bases after their
raids, despite claims by Yugoslav officials to have downed a NATO
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav air force, made up largely of Soviet-era MiG
fighters, joined the battle against NATO's warplanes, in what
officials said was the most serious air-to-air combat since the
Persian Gulf war in 1991. The Pentagon reported Wednesday night
that NATO pilots were confident they had shot down at least three
MiG's. Two of the pilots reporting shootings were Americans, the
other Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, declined to discuss the operation in detail, but vowed to
press the attack until Milosevic agreed to end his repression of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians or until his armed forces posed little
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are striking a range of military targets, including
Yugoslavia's extensive air-defense system, its command and control
system, and the military forces that Yugoslavia is using to
suppress the Albanians in the province of Kosovo,'' Cohen said at
the Pentagon Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   One NATO official said that Wednesday's assault was the
beginning of at least three nights of strikes. Such attacks enable
American and NATO forces to build on its technological advantage,
the official said. Each night of strikes will be followed by a day
of work to assess damage and prepare for new raids.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said the campaign could last much longer,
depending on a variety of factors, including weather and the
success of Serbian defenses. The officials said they have a clear
idea of how much damage NATO hopes to inflict, though how to
measure it they would not say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we want to accomplish,'' a senior Pentagon
official said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and the Pentagon have described the military
objective to be degrading the Serbian military's ability to wage
war against insurgents in Kosovo, officials said they still hoped
the severity of the opening shots would encourage Milosevic to
relent. By day's end, however, there was no sign of that, with
Yugoslavia declaring a state of war.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military poses a far more formidable threat to
pilots overhead than Iraq's battered air defenses ever could during
four nights of American and British raids in December or during the
on-again-off-again skirmishes that have continued since.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the Pentagon fears that Serbian air defenses _
including 60 sets of Soviet-era SA-2, SA-3 and SA-6 surface-to-air
missiles, as well as hundreds of anti-aircraft artillery and even
shoulder-fired missiles that could down a low-flying jet _ could
pose a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's planning for the raids included a prediction that
at least a dozen American and NATO aircraft could be lost if the
fighting continues, a senior Air Force official said. ``Given time,
we can take it all down,'' the official said, ``but that comes with
a high degree of risk, a risk that we as a country have not been
used to in some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days ahead, the strikes are expected to again include new
waves of cruise missiles, including those fired from the British
nuclear-powered submarine, the Splendid, which last October became
the first non-American ship equipped with American cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Yugoslav air defenses have been sufficiently disrupted,
NATO's attack will broaden to include other military targets,
including those inside Serbia that are vital to supporting the
repression inside Kosovo. Those include military bases, lines of
communication, fuel supplies and ammunition dumps, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will hit all the barracks, all the supply lines, until all
the forces in Kosovo ground to a halt,'' the NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen took pains to say that the strikes are aimed at
Milosevic's ``military infrastructure'' alone and that NATO forces
were avoiding civilian casualties. In Brussels, NATO's
Secretary-General Javier Solana tried to draw a line between the
people of Yugoslavia and Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is not waging war against Yugoslavia,'' he said.

AMERICA ONLINE PLANS TO LAY OFF UP TO 1,000
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By   MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ In an effort to pare redundant
operations resulting from its acquisition of the Netscape
Communications Corp., America Online &UR;  &LR; Inc. Wednesday announced
plans to lay off between 700 and 1,000 employees at the newly
combined company.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the layoffs will come at the Dulles, Va.,
headquarters of America Online, which has 9,500 employees, and half
in Netscape's offices here.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Pittman, America Online's president, said the
dismissals would be across all divisions but that the impact would
be more heavily felt in corporate positions like accounting, human
resources and public relations than in engineering or product
development.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said he sought to send the message to Netscape employees
that ``they are not some bolt on AOL, and this is not some
assimilation game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are putting two public companies together and really
integrating them, there are jobs that fall out of that,'' he said,
adding that America Online would seek to carry out the layoffs
within two weeks. ``We're trying to be fair with folks, very
straightforward and very quick so there's not any lingering
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   The one-and-a-half hour meeting at Netscape's headquarters was
the first face-to-face gathering of executives from America Online
and employees of Netscape since the acquisition was announced in
November. Since then, the value of the deal has soared to $10
billion from $4.2 billion as a result of a precipitous rise of
America Online's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting followed days of nervous speculation by Netscape's
2,300 employees, some of whom had already begun exploring other job
opportunities. But several Netscape employees who attended the
meeting said that the reception for America Online was not
unfriendly and that they were relieved to have some sense of the
company's direction.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, one Netscape employee said, the only overt
hint of cynicism about America Online came from an employee who
asked whether the giant online service would put its logo on the
Netscape building. When the answer was ``No,'' employees cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts viewed the layoffs as a positive step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there are cuts from both sides shows me that
they are looking to truly integrate Netscape,'' said Paul Noglows,
a senior analyst for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, a San Francisco investment
bank. ``There is a high level of commitment here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the mood has not been all that gloomy at Netscape since
the merger was announced, in great part because the acquisition
entails swapping Netscape stock for America Online's stock at a
fixed ratio, meaning that Netscape employees who own stock have
seen their net worth rise rapidly in recent months with the run-up
in America Online's shares. The stock closed Wednesday at $117.375,
down $3.625.
</P>
<P>
   And Netscape employees who do face layoffs are expected to be in
high demand at other Silicon Valley companies. Several employees
said they had already been contacted by headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Chroman, a principal in the Chroman Group, a recruiting
and consulting firm in Silicon Valley, said the Internet market was
``booming,'' adding that she did not think displaced employees
``would have any difficulty finding jobs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, some Netscape employees did not wait around to find out
what would happen. One former engineer who left Netscape for
another Silicon Valley firm said he did not want to risk the
uncertainty of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have a family, I would have stuck it out,'' said
the engineer, who requested anonymity. But, he added, he remains
concerned that America Online will impose a more conservative
culture on the laid-back style of Netscape, where dogs roam freely,
employees wear shorts to work and cubicles are decorated with
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said the company had no intention of altering Netscape's
culture. ``We fully expect Netscape to behave differently,'' he
said. ``All we care about is what comes out in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing layoffs, America Online said it would
slightly reorganize its corporate structure, adding a new
management division to oversee Netscape's enterprise software
business.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have four product groups: Netscape
Enterprise; Interactive Services, which will oversee America
Online, Compuserve, the Netscape browser, Netcenter and AOL TV; the
International Group, which will focus on expanding the company
overseas; and Interactive Properties, which will manage the ICQ
chat business and the Digital Cities local guides.

   VIENNA, Austria _ The key to raising the price of oil, OPEC has
decided, is found more in politics than economics.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of internecine fighting over which country should
produce how much oil, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries cut through a lot of haggling here Tuesday to reach a
production-cutting accord that was underpinned by the strength of
newly arrived at political alliances.
</P>
<P>
   The deal struck with four major independent oil-producing
countries to withhold 2.1 million barrels a day from the market
marks a departure for OPEC, where the dominant policy makers have
over the years been oil ministers. By contrast, this agreement _
which will reduce OPEC production by nearly 8 percent, and global
output about 3 percent _ was created by diplomats, princes and
prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that the principal component of the deal
was a new political truce struck between Saudi Arabia and its
political and ideological rival in the Persian Gulf, Iran.
</P>
<P>
   It was remarkable that a deal over oil production involved
visits by Iran's foreign minister and oil minister to the Saudi
capital late in February and early in March, followed by telephone
negotiations between Crown Prince Abdullah, the effective leader of
Saudi Arabia, and President Mohammed Khatami of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saudi Arabia could see that the huge drop in revenues due to
lower oil prices was hurting the moderate president of Iran,'' said
former Algerian Oil Minister Nordine Ait-Laoussine, who observed
the OPEC meeting here and knows his way around the economics and
politics that govern the Middle East. ``Khatami was coming under
pressure from fundamentalist hard-liners in Iran, which is not in
the best Saudi interest. Abdullah knows he can't have bad relations
with both Iran and Iraq,'' Ait-Laoussine said. ``After all, he
lives in that neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   For Prince Abdullah, Ait-Laoussine continued, an agreement to
raise prices by cutting production ``was the only way of helping
Khatami in Iran and easing the pressure on the budget in Saudi
Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the pact disconnected from Venezuela's new government,
installed a month and a half ago. It reversed a policy of violating
OPEC production limits practiced by the previous administration,
which had little regard for Venezuela's status as a founding OPEC
member. The new government declared itself in alignment with OPEC
and blamed the previous policy for contributing to a devastating
fall in oil prices and income.
</P>
<P>
   The depressed price of crude oil over the last year also helped
persuade four big independent oil producers _ Mexico, Norway, Oman
and Russia _ to amend their own free-market stance. The four have
in a way become de facto members of OPEC by agreeing to cut their
production levels.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideological and political shifts were buttressed by a
change in relations with the big multinational oil companies that
OPEC once considered adversaries. After decades of battling big oil
for political and physical control of prices and production, OPEC
won _ only to find itself in the same trenches. With the steep fall
in prices, both producers and companies are bleeding, eager to
cooperate to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that Iran, Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait and even
Saudi Arabia are inviting the companies they kicked out 30 years
ago to come back and invest in their oil industries. ``Nothing
moves markets like fear,'' said Peter Gignoux, manager of the
petroleum trading desk at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``Around
the oil markets today, you will not find a bear. All wish OPEC good
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even the best intentions can falter. Prices that had
moved up in anticipation of OPEC's production cuts weakened today
for a second day on the possibility that some producers would try
to cheat and sell more oil. Crude oil for May delivery fell 17
cents a barrel, settling in New York trading at $15.34.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cheating is widely viewed as less likely now than it was
in the past, because OPEC members seem to have learned the
consequences of subverting their own agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East Economic Survey, an authoritative newsletter in
its coverage of the oil business, commented, ``OPEC has at last
succeeded in coming to grips with the core of the problem of
intolerably low oil prices, that there is no alternative to cutting
oil production.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC and its new fellow travelers do have some hurdles
remaining. Iraq, for example, is not part of the accord, and has
nearly doubled its production in the last year under the United
Nations oil-for-food program, to 2.7 million barrels a day. The
Iraqis have promised to push this to three million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of weak world demand. The use of oil
in Asia, which is mired in economic problems, has yet to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   At least with Iraq, it appears that the eventual solution will
be, again, politics. Speaking to journalists in Vienna on Tuesday,
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Rashid pointed at the way, saying: ``Iraq
needs to be consulted, and a dialogue should be established with
us. Without this, we will not concern ourselves.'' Translation:
Make a political deal with Iraq similar to the deal between Saudi
Arabia and Iran.

SENATOR LIMITS NUMBER OF TEXAS STUDENTS WHO MIGHT QUALIFY FOR
VOUCHER PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The number of children who might be eligible to
participate in a school voucher program was drastically cut,
perhaps in half, Wednesday by a key state senator proposing the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Teel Bivins, chairman of the Senate Education Committee,
amended his voucher proposal _ actually called a ``public education
scholarship program'' in Senate Bill 10 _ to limit participation to
5 percent of eligible schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The change means that if the Legislature approves the plan,
perhaps only 71,500 schoolchildren will be eligible to attend
private schools with public tax dollars, rather than the previous
estimate of 143,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins' original proposal would have made vouchers available to
all low-income students who failed the most recent state-mandated
testing program in the six largest metropolitan areas: Harris,
Bexar, Dallas, El Paso, Tarrant and Travis counties. But his
amendment now would limit participation to 5 percent of those
schoolchildren. Students also would have to be enrolled in the
current and previous school years in public schools to get a
voucher.
</P>
<P>
   It remains uncertain whether a voucher bill will pass the
Legislature this year; efforts in the past two sessions have
failed, but Gov. George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry are behind
a voucher plan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Perry told a meeting of newspaper executives
that he thinks the Senate will pass a limited voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   Debate was still raging in committee Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, an Amarillo Republican, said he put the cap on
eligibility to try to make a voucher experiment more acceptable to
those who believe it would be too much a financial drain on public
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   The cap ``will assure we don't have a mass exodus'' from public
schools, Bivins said.
</P>
<P>
   But testimony from many people who jammed the Education
Committee hearing Wednesday indicated the change did not lessen any
of the opponents' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ill-prepared for the level of emotion that surrounds
this issue,'' Bivins said as he greeted a hearing room so packed
with people who wanted to testify that many were sitting on the
floor and standing in hallways hoping to get into the room.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that proponents and opponents are equally
passionate in their beliefs. Opponents say it will create a
financial drain on schools, that there is no solid research to
support claims that students will do better scholastically and that
private schools cannot provide services for physically, emotionally
and mentally disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents argue that parents should have the right to send
their children to whatever schools best suit their needs, and that
the nation's first experiment in vouchers in Milwaukee has been
successful. They also contend that school choice is already
available _ but only to those families wealthy enough to afford
tuition at private schools or to move to neighborhoods with
top-rated public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who is right,'' Bivins said. He added that his
only purpose in suggesting Texas adopt a voucher plan is to
``create a laboratory in which we can test these theories.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also amended the bill to require private schools
to provide transportation to voucher students if those students
would have been provided school bus transportation by their public
schools. The change was offered by Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount
Pleasant and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been concerned for some time that the Achilles heel in
any broad-based voucher program is that if you do not provide
transportation ... only those who can afford transportation are
afforded choice,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, private schools would receive 80 percent _
about $4,000 _ of state and local funding that is allotted for each
child; the remainder would remain in the child's home school
district.
</P>
<P>
   Among other stipulations, private schools would have to agree to
take all applicants or use a public lottery to select voucher
students if they had more applicants than room. They would be
prohibited from charging voucher students' parents more tuition
than what the voucher pays. And they would have to administer the
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills tests to all voucher students
in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Bivins plan, the voucher experiment would
automatically end after five years unless private schools can
demonstrate that voucher students post TAAS test scores 10 percent
higher than their counterparts in public schools.

 &HT;    DESPITE CONFIDENCE, U.S. MILITARY WARY OF RISKS IN KOSOVO
CAMPAIGN

   WASHINGTON _ Although the allied warships and bombers at the
vanguard of strikes against Yugoslavia returned safely to their
bases Wednesday, U.S. officials tried to prepare the American
public for a conflict much bloodier than the high-tech wizardry of
past bombing missions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a risk-free military operation,''
Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
during a briefing for reporters at the Pentagon after the first
wave of American and allied forces -- including the batwinged B-2
stealth bomber, had pounded military targets throughout Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While the first bombing raids had targeted Yugoslavia's air
defense system, Shelton emphasized that the system is still ``very
capable'' and ``poses a considerable threat'' to the NATO aircraft
launched against Serb forces being used to attack civilians and
villages in the embattled, independent-minded Yugoslavian province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the relatively primitive air defenses of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has a sophisticated
Soviet-built anti-aircraft system. In addition, anti-aircraft
equipment is easily hidden in the forested terrain of Kosovo. And
the province is frequently covered by clouds or fog, both a
hinderance to laser-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate, the capability of the air defenses all make this
a very tough environment in which to operate militarily,'' Defense
Secretary William Cohen said at the Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making every reasonable effort to protect our forces
while eliminating carefully defined military targets,'' Cohen
added. Even so, ``all military action involves risk,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, too, emphasized the risk to allied forces.
But ``the dangers of acting now are clearly outweighed by the risks
of failing to act: the risks that many more innocent people will
die or be driven from their homes by the tens of thousands; the
risks that the conflict will involve and destabilize neighboring
nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cohen and Shelton provided few details of the military
action against Milosevic, they emphasized that the bombing would
continue until the Serb leader halts his aggression against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. To bring a halt to the NATO bombing, Milosevic
has to ``stop his slaughter of innocent people,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Yugoslavian military targets from Belgrade to
Pristina in Kosovo began with air- and sea-launched cruise missiles
fired by American B-52 bombers and NATO ships based in the
Mediterranean and Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said there had been some ``engagement'' between Yugoslav
and NATO planes, but gave no details. When asked about unconfirmed
reports of a NATO plane being downed, Cohen reported that ``our
aircraft have returned safely'' after the first wave.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air force also included Air Force F-117A stealth
fighter bombers and two radar-avoiding B-2 bombers, the first
combat role for the $2.1billion aircraft. Cohen said the B-2
aircraft ``performed according to its capabilities.'' He would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said the initial bombing raid sought to degrade
Milosevic's air defense system ``in order to reduce the risk and
the threat to our pilots and air crews in subsequent missions.'' He
indicated, however, that there has not been adequate time to assess
the initial damage caused by the NATO strike.

MICROSOFT MAKES PROPOSAL TO SETTLE ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET.) 
(mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. made an opening step toward trying to settle its
antitrust battle with the government in a four-page proposal sent
to the Justice Department on Monday, lawyers close to the case said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, described as a ``framework'' by one person close
to the case, suggests easing Microsoft contract restrictions on
personal computer makers, Internet service providers and others in
the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions _ some of which Microsoft has already
loosened under pressure from the industry and the government _
limit manufacturers somewhat in what appears on the first desktop
screen when users turn on their machines or restrict Internet
service providers in the distribution of competing browser
software.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft proposal, according to people who have seen
the document, does not mention any of the broader remedies to
curbing the big software maker's market power that the company's
critics insist are necessary to restore competition in the
industry. Those suggested remedies have included breaking up
Microsoft into separate companies or forcing it to license the
programming code for its industry-standard Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor the Justice Department would comment on
the Microsoft proposal. But Microsoft is likely to contend that it
represents a serious overture that could fundamentally alter its
relationship with personal computer makers, who are the key
distributors of Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal apparently falls well short of the expectations of
both the Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The California attorney general, Bill Lockyer, called the
Microsoft proposal ``a minimalist opening offer that is far from
what anyone in our group would expect to be adequate,'' adding,
``It was a very small offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's antitrust suit accuses Microsoft of repeatedly
using its monopoly in the operating system market to stifle
competition and innovation. During the trial, which began last
October and recessed for a lengthy break in February, the
government alleged that Microsoft thwarted competition by, among
other things, restrictive contracts, giving favored pricing deals
to manufacturers who favor Microsoft software and rewarding them
with marketing funds.
</P>
<P>
   The remedies in any settlement, the government says, must insure
greater openness, or ``transparency,'' and be enforceable. That is
why Microsoft pricing pacts with personal computer makers and its
marketing development agreements have been a focus of the trial,
and why forcing Microsoft to publish its price lists and open up
its marketing contracts to scrutiny have been among the remedies
they have sought.
</P>
<P>
   In its document, Microsoft has not offered to publish price
lists or open its marketing agreements to third-party monitoring,
said a person who has seen the Microsoft proposal.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of Revlon Inc. rose sharply for the second
straight day Wednesday on speculation that a buyer may soon step in
and rescue the cosmetics giant from its huge debt and weak
performance lately in the powder and perfume business.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon surged $5.1875, or 30.4 percent, to $22.25 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Its stock has risen 54 percent over the last
two days on heavy volume. Wednesday, 4.5 million shares changed
hands compared with average daily volume of 145,600.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are reacting to growing speculation that Revlon and
the billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, who controls 83 percent of its
shares, may be near a deal to sell the struggling company, which
makes Revlon, Colorstay and Almay cosmetics, to a larger
consumer-products concern.
</P>
<P>
   The two names mentioned most often by bankers and analysts as
potential buyers are Unilever NV of the Netherlands and the Procter
&AMP; Gamble Co. in Cincinnati. Both companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   While investors have signaled their ebullience about a possible
deal, Perelman is unlikely to sell his stake without a significant
premium to the $24 a share at which the stock traded when he took
Revlon public three years ago. He bought the company in a leveraged
buyout in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon, which is based in New York, declined to comment
Wednesday on the market activity and takeover rumors. Perelman also
declined to comment through a spokesman for his holding company,
MacAndrews &AMP; Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   If a potential buyer is courting the company, ``it's a wide open
question what this thing is worth,'' said Tim Drake, an analyst at
the Bank One Corp., which is Revlon's fifth-largest shareholder
with about 330,000 shares. ``But even with the debt, the purchase
price they would have to pay is not out of line with other
acquisitions of that sort.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that Revlon would sell for ``in the range of $30 to
$50'' a share.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, Drake said, the French cosmetic giant
L'Oreal SA bought Maybelline Inc. in 1996 for $44 a share. Sales of
cosmetics companies typically command between one and half to two
times sales.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear whether P&AMP;G or Unilever wants to snap up
Revlon at all. Bankers and analysts said P&AMP;G, which makes Cover
Girl and Max Factor cosmetics, was an unlikely buyer because it
would likely run into antitrust problems. A sale to Unilever, they
said, would be a better fit because, while that company owns the
Elizabeth Arden cosmetics line, it has only a small presence in the
mass retail market.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Unilever's vast international operation, coupled with
Revlon's powerful global brand name, would give the company a
substantial competitive edge in the marketplace. ``My read on this
is that Unilever would be interested in Revlon's foreign markets,
particularly the European markets, of which I think the company has
had a spotty performance,'' said Terrence Dwyer, a analyst at KDP
Investment Advisors in Montpelier, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon suffered last year from a loss of consumer purchasing
power in Asia, Russia and Latin America as well as from a slowdown
in the domestic cosmetics market as drug stores consolidated and
pared inventories. In the most recent fourth quarter, for instance,
the company reported an 82 percent drop in earnings on flat
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Revlon, whose stock had declined by 60 percent over
the last year before the run-up of the last two days, said it would
dismiss about 7 percent of its worldwide work force, or about 1,200
people, to cut costs. The company has about $1.7 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said companies the size of P&AMP;G and Unilever could take
on the debt load, but the amount could also make reaching an
agreement on a selling price a point of contention. ``The debt
level is really a function of how much you are willing to pay,''
said William Steele, an independent analyst in San Francisco who
follows consumer companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the Revlon name alone would be worth a
premium. Perelman may be more receptive these days to selling some
of his holdings after several notable stumbles in recent years. He
sold the debt-ridden Coleman Co., the maker of outdoor camping
equipment, to the Sunbeam Corp. last year but then watched his
investment in that company tumble after the household appliance
maker reported huge losses that sent the stock tumbling from a high
of $52 to about $5. Perelman did not do much better with
Consolidated Cigar Holdings, which he controlled until selling it
last year at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Revlon struggling, Perelman may be more likely to
unload it at the right price.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a marketing standpoint they have not come out with
anything since the Colorstay, age-defying kind of things they
introduced three years ago,'' said Allan G. Mottus, publisher of
The Informationalist, a cosmetics industry trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Mottus said the company has also faced stiffer competition from
L'Oreal's Maybelline brand in the United States and P.&AMP; G.'s Oil of
Olay cosmetics lines in Europe. At the same time, Revlon stuck
retailers with too many promotional items and has failed to develop
aggressively more competitive fragrance, hair color and skin-care
lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has been stubbing its toe for a while now,'' Mottus
said. The Revlon board seems to have noticed. After the company's
dismal performance last year, the board cut the salary of George
Fellows, Revlon's president and chief executive, by 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question really is, `Can this group sustain the company?'
'' Mottus said of Revlon's management. ``From Ron Perelman's point
of view, that has to be a major issue.'' &QL;

U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS POLITICS DIDN'T HALT MEXICO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.. Calif.)   (bl)  
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior U.S. Customs official said Wednesday that
a major inquiry into money laundering by Mexican banks was stopped
only after undercover agents had been unable to proceed in talks
with corrupt bankers to move more than $1 billion that was said to
belong to the Mexican defense minister and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that included his first public comments on the case,
the Customs official, John Hensley, head of the Los Angeles office,
wrote, ``Numerous attempts by the undercover agents to push for a
meeting with this alleged general/minister were unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley also said that when a defendant in the case linked the
money to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, he did so only ``in a
hypothetical manner,'' speculating that because the amount was so
large ``maybe it belongs to the president or his Cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, as well as one by Customs Commissioner Raymond
Kelly, strongly denied political motives for closing the operation.
The letters, to the head of a House subcommittee, Rep. John Mica,
R-Fla., were made public as the former senior agent in charge of
the case, William Gately, testified to the panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The letters referred to statements that they said were made in
an article March 16 in The New York Times. The article quoted
government officials and Gately as having said senior Clinton
administration officials had declined to extend the undercover
operation past its scheduled end in May to investigate the planned
transaction, which Kelly described as ``a significant allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Hensley strongly denied statements they attributed to
the article but that it did not make.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the charge that the case was brought down ``so that
U.S. officials could keep a high-ranking Mexican government
official from being investigated as part of the case is grossly
untrue and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   But the article merely quoted Gately as complaining that no
strong effort had been made to pursue or follow up the traffickers'
proposal and speculating that foreign-policy concerns, along with
other reasons, might have been involved.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the face of failed peace talks, NATO forces
opened an assault on Yugoslavia with cruise missiles and bombs on
Wednesday as President Clinton denounced President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia for waging ``brutal repression'' in Kosovo
that, he warned, threatened to destabilize neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles began striking Serbian targets within minutes of
Clinton's announcement that the long-threatened attack was under
way. It was expected to be a broad, sustained barrage designed to
stun the Yugoslav leader and punish a military that has conducted a
yearlong onslaught against the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo's crisis is full-blown,'' Clinton declared. ``And if we
do not act now, clearly it will get worse. Only firmness now can
prevent greater catastrophe later.''
</P>
<P>
   The first explosions of incoming missiles erupted in the night
skies of the Kosovo capital, Pristina. The Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug said the city's main commercial and military airport had
been hit.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets struck after a day in which Yugoslav forces
maintained their military pressure against the ethnic Albanian
majority in Kosovo. Steady streams of alarmed residents fled toward
Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Sirens sounded and the flash and thunder of explosions cut
through the night sky of Belgrade and other scattered targets,
including the northern Serbian town of Novi Sad and the main
airport in the Yugoslav coastal republic of Montenegro. One
explosion was reported near Batajnica, the main Serbian airport and
military base near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic, who over the past decade started the
terrible wars against Croatia and Bosnia, has again chosen
aggression over peace,'' Clinton said gravely in his afternoon
announcement of the military attack by the 19-member NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, a defiant Milosevic called for defense of his
nation ``by all means possible,'' terming Kosovo ``only the door
intended to allow foreign troops to come in and steal away our
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade government, denouncing ``neo-Nazism,'' called for
the U.N. Security Council to condemn ``NATO's criminal, terrorist,
underhanded and cowardly attack.''
</P>
<P>
   American defense officials said the targets in the initial wave
of attacks by warships and bombers included missile batteries,
radar installations and military communication sites in Kosovo,
Belgrade and other key areas. Some air-to-air combat was reported
by Pentagon officials, who said all NATO planes had returned
safely.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, which has longstanding ties
to the Yugoslavs, angrily denounced the American-led raids as
``open aggression'' and ``a blow to the whole world community.''
Clinton had tried to justify the military action on Wednesday in a
35-minute phone call with Yeltsin. But the Russian leader recalled
his chief military envoy to NATO and reserved the right to take
``adequate measures,'' including military ones to insure security.
</P>
<P>
   After months of threats, NATO finally resorted to military
action as Milosevic, far from heeding peace overtures, stepped up
his latest offensive against ethnic Albanian villages and
guerrillas in the Kosovo Liberation Army. Since violence began
escalating a year ago, more than 400,000 ethnic Albanians have fled
their homes as Serbian forces have torched and bombarded villages,
massacring civilians in some raids. In recent decades ethnic
Albanians have come to outnumber Serbs by 9-1 in Kosovo, which
Serbs long have revered as the birthplace of Serbian nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate fear about the mounting violence in Kosovo, the
southernmost province of Serbia, which is Milosevic's Yugoslav
power base, is that it might reignite the ethnic and religious wars
in the Balkans that NATO earlier worked to resolve in Bosnia with
the commitment of troops.
</P>
<P>
   Critics who until now accused the Clinton administration of
equivocating in facing Milosevic's assault on Kosovo fear that
Albania and Macedonia could be drawn into a larger war or even
break up if the Serbs are not prevented from an ``ethnic
cleansing'' of the Albanian majority in Kosovo. Even beyond that,
it is feared that Turkey and Greece, two NATO members, might take
opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, voiced qualified support
for the NATO attack. ``Whatever reservations about the president's
actions in the Balkans,'' the Mississippi Republican said, ``let no
one doubt that the Congress and the American people stand united
behind our men and women who are bravely heeding the call of
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the first uninvited offensive against a sovereign
nation by NATO, the alliance founded 50 years ago as the European
bulwark against the cold war military power of the Soviet Union.
NATO's 17 days of air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia in
1995 were conducted at the request of the embattled Bosnian
government against military targets of the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   No detailed casualty reports were immediately available. But
scores of Yugoslav military bases and depots, aircraft and
munitions factories were expected to be targeted by NATO forces
equipped with more than 400 bomber aircraft from European bases,
and missile weaponry aboard a half dozen warships in the Adriatic
region.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The operation marked the first combat use of the B-2 ``stealth''
bomber designed to elude radar, according to Pentagon officials who
said two B-2's had journeyed from Whiteman Air Force Base in
Missouri on a mission to drop dropped satellite-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear responsibility for the air strikes lies with President
Milosevic, who has refused to stop his violent action in Kosovo and
has refused to negotiate in good faith,'' said NATO's secretary
general, Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO attack began after Milosevic rebuffed a final peace
plea from the United States intended to restore the autonomy that
Milosevic had stripped from Kosovo and its ethnic Albanian majority
10 years ago. Under diplomatic prodding, he signed a peace
agreement in October but then reneged. The proposed peace plan
would end his repression of the Kosovars and include the deployment
of thousands of NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing Milosevic for ethnic violence and atrocity, Clinton
conceded that NATO forces risked casualties against Milosevic's
modernized military. But he warned: ``The dangers of acting now are
clearly outweighed by the risks of failing to act: the risks that
many more innocent people will die or be driven from their homes by
the tens of thousands; the risks that the conflict will involve and
destabilize neighboring nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO attack was authorized after Clinton's envoy, Richard C.
Holbrooke, paid an 11th-hour visit to Milosevic and failed to
persuade him to join the peace proposal accepted by the ethnic
Albanians. The military task then was placed in the hands of NATO's
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark of the United States, with
orders to deal with Milosevic's authoritarian assault on the Kosovo
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right decision, and we have to see it through all the
way,'' said Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the NATO action had three objectives: ``to
demonstrate the seriousness of NATO's opposition to aggression;''
to deter Milosevic from ``continuing and escalating his attacks on
helpless civilians by imposing a price for those attacks,'' and
``if necessary, to damage Serbia's capacity to wage war against
Kosovo in the future by seriously diminishing its military
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   While the congressional Republican leaders' support of the NATO
attack was qualified, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., declared, ``The
danger of inaction in Kosovo _ of doing nothing _ greatly exceeds
the dangers of the action begun today.''

 &HT;    Triumph over pain Smoltz's breakthrough
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Don't let the numbers fool you.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz's 17-3 record last season looked great on paper. But
it came at a hefty price _ constant pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the outside, I was effective,'' said Smoltz, who twice went
on the disabled list while recovering from his second elbow surgery
in three years. ``On the inside, I was miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 31, he has learned to deal with pitching and pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back over the year, and I really was the most proud
I've ever been,'' Smoltz said. ``It was the greatest year I've ever
had, under some very difficult circumstances. I didn't enjoy it.
But when it was over, I said `Man, it's amazing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz had surgery to remove bone spurs from his right elbow in
December 1997. It was the same surgery he had had in 1994, only
this time he didn't have six months to recover. So he began 1998 on
the disabled list, made his comeback after a rehab tour through the
minor leagues and then had to go back on the disabled list in late
May after the elbow flared up again.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he was stellar.
</P>
<P>
   When Smoltz came off the DL in June, he went 13-2 in 18 starts.
He won 12 of his last 13 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   His strong performances have carried into the spring. Smoltz
didn't look as sharp on Tuesday against the Mets as he has most of
the spring, but it was still a good outing. He gave up two runs in
five innings, which increased his ERA to 1.93.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready for the start of the season,'' Smoltz said.
``Every year the goal in spring training is to throw pain-free, and
you try and get hitters out and you try to get ready for the
season, and ... I've accomplished all three.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that success came when he started using a change-up he
developed. It was a pitch born of necessity and perfected through
conversations with Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone, Greg Maddux
and Tom Glavine. He has stopped throwing his split-finger, to ease
the pressure on his elbow, and he hasn't missed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's developed a lot of pitches,'' manager Bobby Cox said.
``He's still got the crackling curve and the zippy fastball....
He's tough to hit now, because he does have variety and almost the
same velocity.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz said, ``I've become a much better pitcher because I've
had to find a different way to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz got away from baseball this offseason. Instead of
starting rehabilitation a few weeks into the offseason as he has
the last several years, he had some bone chips removed in October
and followed that with rest. He didn't start working out much until
several weeks before coming to Florida. As a result, both his elbow
and his mind are fresher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could deal with last year, I could deal with any year,''
Smoltz said. ``I was as good as I'll ever be. I still can't believe
I was 17-3. On the flip side, I know how much better I can be if I
could just somehow be healthy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The B-2 ``Stealth'' bomber, the most expensive and
intricate aircraft ever built, made its combat debut on Wednesday
in a world far different from the one for which it was conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said two Stealths from Whiteman Air Force
Base in Missouri took part in the Nato attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Each B-2 dropped about 16 2,000-pound satellite-guided bombs,
said Brig. Gen. Leroy Barnidge Jr., the base commander. He provided
no details on the targets or damage inflicted, but Defense
Department officials said they included command bunkers and
air-defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at Whiteman, Tech. Sgt. Dee Ann Poole, said she
did not know if either plane came under fire. She said both planes
completed their missions unscathed and that no one aboard either
aircraft was injured. Each B-2 carries a pilot and a weapons
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The safety of plane and crew were surely of high concern to the
Pentagon. Each B-2 costs well over $2 billion (total development
costs have been easily 10 times that), and its critics have
suggested that it is not only the most expensive plane ever but one
of the costliest white elephants as well.
</P>
<P>
   The radar-dodging aircraft was conceived to carry nuclear
weapons into the territory of the Soviet Union, an adversary that
no longer exists. With the break-up of the Soviet empire, the B-2s
backers suggested that its 6,000-mile range would make it ideal for
delivering non-nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   One critic scoffed at that notion. ``It's the equivalent of
saying we're going to send a Rolls-Royce down into a combat zone to
pick up groceries,'' Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But now as defense secretary, Cohen said the B-2 had ``performed
according to its capabilities.'' He described it as ``a stealthy
aircraft that can fly in all weather'' and carry a hefty bomb load.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics have expressed doubt about the B-2's stealthiness,
wondering whether it can really make itself invisible to radar.
There was even doubt for a time about the plane's ability to fly in
heavy weather, given its supposedly ultra-sensitive radar-evading
skin.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts about weather prompted an Air Force demonstration in
1997. Hoses sprayed water on a B-2, with no apparent ill effect.
``We fly in the rain all the time,'' one pilot said. ``Do people
think the skin is made of sugar?''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force would not say when the two B-2s would return home
to Whiteman. They are among nine on ready at the base, Poole said.
The other 10 in the Air Force's possession are at Northrup
Grumman's plant in Palmdale, Calif., having their computer systems
upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in civilian life, computers can become obsolete almost
overnight, even those on a $2 billion aircraft, Poole said.

 &HT;    O'Brien both a wonderful father and coach
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ March will forever be a painful time of
year for Jim O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   It was eight years ago this month that his wife, Chris, died
from a heart ailment. She was 41.
</P>
<P>
   Her death left him alone to raise two teen-age daughters, Amy
and Erin, now 22 and 24. Both, not surprisingly, are basketball
coaches like their father.
</P>
<P>
   The two were in Knoxville, Tenn., last week to share in their
dad's _ and really, the family's _ biggest professional triumph: A
regional final victory that earned Ohio State a berth in the Final
Four. It is O'Brien's first trip to the national semifinals in 22
years of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying, I was happy, I was sad,'' said Erin, a former
Division II player who is an assistant women's basketball coach at
Vanderbilt University. ``I was just so happy that my sister and I
were there. It was great to just get on the court and give him a
big hug and tell him how proud we were of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy, who works for an insurance company in Boston and coaches a
freshman girls' team at a local high school, said her father was
almost speechless after the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just saying, `Can you believe this? Can you believe
this?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens Saturday when Ohio State (27-8) faces
Connecticut (32-2), this improbable run by a Buckeye team that
finished 8-22 last season will remain one of O'Brien's fondest
memories. But while the success has been extremely gratifying, he
and his daughters know it is not the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned through the death of my mother that life is more
important than a game,'' Erin said. ``That the love you have and
the closeness you share is the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her father rarely, if ever, asks specifically about
basketball during their weekly phone conversations and occasional
visits. ``It's, 'How's life?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Life hasn't been easy for the O'Briens since Chris died in 1991.
But through adjustments, some small, some not so small, the three
have grown stronger and closer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien immediately altered his work schedule to spend as much
time as possible with his daughters. Sometimes, he took the girls
on trips with him and the three visited France, Italy and
Yugoslavia together. At dinner time, prom time or game time _ both
Erin and Amy played basketball in high school _ he was there. And
when his daughters needed a companion for a visit to the doctor or
the dress shop, O'Brien went along.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was involved in our lives through my mother almost,'' Erin
said. ``She was initially the one we would turn to. Then he became
the sole confident, where we were turning to him and he had to deal
with everyday issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all we had so no subject was taboo. And now we feel
comfortable going to him about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Amy: ``He's had to learn a lot of things about girls that I
don't think he wanted to know. But it's worked out and our
relationship has definitely grown.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien acknowledged there are many facets of his daughters'
lives that he's involved with ``that at one time I wasn't.'' He
spoke about his experience as a single father only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that a lot of parents have to go through,'' he
said. ``I don't think it's all that unique. I was very fortunate
that they were two well-rounded kids. I think I was more dependent
on them than they were on me.'' Their father offered as much moral
and emotional support as he could. He tried to become the big
booster their mother was of their Westwood High School sports teams
in suburban Boston. (In addition to basketball, Erin and Amy played
softball and soccer.) In fact, O'Brien insisted his daughters, both
guards like their dad, participate in their basketball team's state
semifinal game three days after their mother's death. He was in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Amy and Erin will be in the stands cheering him.
They hope to again watch their father celebrate with a victory
dance as he did in Knoxville. And maybe this time, he'll be more in
step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they win their next game, we have to give him some
dance lessons,'' Erin said.

ROY JOHNSON, ADMIRAL IN CATALYTIC VIETNAM INCIDENT , DIES AT 93  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., La., Md., S.C., Ariz., Ore., Alaska)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Lee Johnson, the Navy admiral who oversaw what the
government said were defensive attacks against North Vietnamese
torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964, died Saturday in
Virginia Beach, Va. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   What became known as the Gulf of Tonkin incident contributed to
U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, and Johnson was the commander
of the U. S. Seventh Fleet in the Western Pacific during the
confrontations on Aug. 2 and Aug. 4, 1964.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson cited what he said was North
Vietnamese aggression in his Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which was
overwhelmingly approved by Congress three days later and became the
political foundation for the war. The resolution gave the president
power to take all necessary measures to quell and prevent
aggression by the North Vietnamese. It was repealed by Congress in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Only two Democratic senators, Wayne Morse of Oregon and Ernest
Gruening of Alaska, voted against the resolution, questioning the
president's assertion of serious aggression by the North
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the turning points of the war,'' said Stanley A.
Karnow, the author of ``Vietnam: A History'' (Viking Press, 1983).
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and journalists have debated whether the North
Vietnamese boats engaged in aggressive behavior against the
American destroyers Maddox and C. Turner Joy. Some have asserted
that the president concocted the incidents to counter the
accusation by the Republican presidential candidate, Barry
Goldwater, that he was not taking strong action against Communism
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin E. Moise, a professor of history at Clemson University and
the author of ``Tonkin Gulf and the Escalation of the Vietnam War''
(University of North Carolina Press, 1996), said the confrontation
on Aug. 2, involving the Maddox, did not stem from an unprovoked
North Vietnamese attack, as the White House contended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Moise said, North Vietnam boats approached the Maddox
in retaliation for the shelling of an island in the gulf by other
American ships, with Vietnamese crews, three nights before. He said
the crew of the Maddox, feeling threatened as the boats moved
toward them, opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Johnson, was aboard the Oklahoma City, in port in
Japan. After receiving word that the Maddox was engaged in battle,
he ordered increased air support and then ordered the Maddox to
leave the area, Moise said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Aug. 4 incident, involving the Maddox and the C.
Turner Joy, Moise said the officers of the two ships believed that
they were under attack and opened fire. Having set out from Japan
two days earlier, Johnson was miles from the gulf when he was
informed of the action and did not countermand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who were there, and they are still divided on
whether there was or wasn't an attack,'' said Moise, who
interviewed the admiral in 1988. ``Admiral Johnson told me he was
having trouble determining whether there was or wasn't an attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was born on March 18, 1906, in Big Bend, La., graduated
from the Naval Academy in 1929 and three years later became a naval
aviator. In World War II, he served in the Pacific aboard the
carrier Hornet. He received the Air Medal for Meritorious
Achievement in Aerial Flight as commander of the Hornet's Air
Group. He also received a Legion of Merit with gold star, a Bronze
Star and two Distinguished Service Medals.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the Korean War, and in 1955, was given command of
the Forrestal, the first of the nation's super aircraft carriers
and rose to command the Seventh Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   After the confrontations in the Gulf of Tonkin, in March 1965,
Johnson was named commander in chief of naval forces in the
Pacific. He retired from the Navy in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 69 years, Margaret, and a son, Roy Lee Johnson Jr.,
died last year. Johnson is survived by a daughter, Jo-Anne Lee Coe
of Alexandria, five sisters and three grandchildren.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Flint, Mich., was built for production. It's the city that put
America on wheels.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the city whose skyline abounds with smokestacks has taken
some major hits, and production is down.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1980s and '90s, Flint gained more notoriety for
producing gang violence than automobiles. It built a reputation as
being a place you don't even want to visit, much less live.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, Flint is again being talked about as a place of
production, though the talk is still not about cars. It's about
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those players are at Michigan State, which plays Duke in
the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Flintstones: Mateen Cleaves, Antonio Smith, Morris
Peterson and Charlie Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth be told, it's not good to have that many guys from the
same city, because usually they are hated rivals,'' Michigan State
coach Tom Izzo joked. ``Actually, it has been a great thing for our
team. And it's not like they just keep to themselves, but they have
included everyone else into their group and made us much closer as
a team.''
</P>
<P>
   And much better as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Flint foursome are the Spartans' top two scorers and
rebounders and, more important, their team leaders. All told, the
Flintstones account for 55 percent of the team's point production,
54 percent of its rebounding and 68 percent of its assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the floor with my boys from Flint, it seems like
we're playing at home,'' Cleaves said. ``We know we've come a long
way, but we're not about to forget where we came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely a day goes by that the group does not mention being proud
of its hometown and looking forward to going home to talk to the
next generation about how hard work can pay off, regardless of
where you are from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing for more than just Michigan State, our families
and ourselves,'' Cleaves said. ``We're playing for Flint. That is
something to be proud of. We know the city is behind us, and we
hope we're giving it some good publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flintstones are walking advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Flint has produced the likes of Glen Rice,
Trent Tucker, Roy Marble and Andre Rison, but none has had the
impact on the city's image the Flintstones seem to have.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps that Cleaves and Smith won a state title
together at Northern High School in 1995, Bell was Mr. Basketball
in Michigan his senior season (1997) and Peterson led the city in
scoring as a junior and senior.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cleaves is a two-time All-American, Smith is projected as
an NBA draft prospect, Bell is one of the Big Ten's best defenders
and Peterson might be the best sixth man in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Several national news outlets have chronicled their stories, and
many more will this week leading up to the Final Four. They are
easy to spot, thanks to a prominent tattoo of ``Flint'' in Old
English lettering on the upper right arm of all but Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know where we're from so they can form a
better opinion of Flint,'' Smith said. ``All you hear about it is
the negative, but we wouldn't be here doing as well as we are,
going to school and playing basketball, if it couldn't be done.
Kids need to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in St. Petersburg, Fla., the stands at Tropicana
Field will be packed. Millions more will be watching on television
when Michigan State tries to beat a team that is billed as one of
the best in college basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   For the Flintstones, though, No. 1-ranked Duke is simply a team
trying to keep them from realizing their next goal _ playing in the
next game. Just like it is at the Berston.
</P>
<P>
   If you are familiar with urban ballplayers, you know they play
with a unique intensity. One of the most significant reasons for
that is what's at stake _ the right to play the next game.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' eyes light up when you ask him about Berston
Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball players may be born in hospitals, but in Flint, the
Berston is where they grow up, where true hoopsters build their
reps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the spot,'' Cleaves said. ``If you can play there, you
can play anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A physical 6-2 junior, Cleaves overpowers most point guards. And
though his statistics appear normal, he knows how to win games.
Those two attributes were necessary to be successful at his old
stomping grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really call a foul, because you're gonna be doing
some hacking yourself,'' Cleaves. ``Plus if you do call one, you
have to argue like crazy to get it, so it's not even worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with the NCAA Tournament, you win or you're out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be so many people there waiting to play that if
you lost, you might as well go home 'cause you weren't getting
another up,'' Cleaves said. ``People everywhere, just waiting to
play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Even many who would seem more suited to playing other sports
found their way to Berston. Coaches know that is where you go to
find talent. That's where Izzo found Smith, his first recruit and
his first Flintstone.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 6-8, 250-pound strongman, says he would probably be a
better football player than basketball player, but he couldn't
resist the lure of the game in Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have some guys that will stick to football, like Andre
Rison or my brother (Fernando, a five-year NFL veteran who played
with the Jacksonville Jaguars last season), but that is very few,''
Smith said. ``There is nothing else to do there but play
basketball, and if you can play basketball, you know you can be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flintstones are proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all taught the value of hard work,'' Peterson said.
``We're from a blue-collar town, and that is part of our makeup.
It's a part of our makeup that we are very proud of.''

 STARR AIDE CHALLENGES McDOUGAL TESTIMONY  
 (bl)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ A prosecutor for Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr sought Wednesday to undermine Susan McDougal's testimony
about President Clinton's knowledge of decades-old financial
dealings in Arkansas, portraying her as someone who has never
accepted the reality of her own criminal conviction and who tailors
her accounts to fit the drama of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, testifying in her own defense on the second day
of her trial here for obstruction of justice and criminal contempt
for refusing to answer questions before a grand jury, had testified
Tuesday that she had no knowledge of any wrongdoing by Clinton, the
governor then, in connection with the Whitewater real estate
venture. She and her husband, James McDougal, were partners in the
company with Clinton and his wife, Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. McDougal had refused to answer the same questions
from the grand jury, choosing instead to serve 18 months in jail,
she declared Tuesday that she was confident that Clinton had
testified truthfully in 1996 at her criminal trial for bank fraud,
in which she was convicted of four felony charges. The president
said then that he had no knowledge of an improper $300,000 loan
made to Mrs. McDougal, although the man who made the loan testified
that he had been pressed to do so by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal told the jury on Tuesday that if Clinton had not
told the truth in 1996, she would have registered her objection.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Barrett, an associate counsel in Starr's office,
Wednesday showed a videotape of Mrs. McDougal being interviewed in
prison in May 1998, in which she said she had no idea if the
president had testified truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal is heard on the tape telling Tim Russert, the host
of the NBC News program ``Meet the Press,'' that she could not
confirm her lawyer's statement that Clinton had testified
truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to check the transcript,'' she said. ``I would
have to have his testimony before me and go through it line by
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett also sought to remind the jury Wednesday that Mrs.
McDougal is a convicted felon by asking her to confirm that she had
been found guilty of bank fraud in the very same courtroom. Mrs.
McDougal tried to turn the question into an opportunity to inveigh
against Starr, saying that she was the victim of ``a ruthless
prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett and Mrs. McDougal then reached a verbal standoff until
Judge George Howard ordered Mrs. McDougal to respond that she had
indeed been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mrs. McDougal portrayed her decision not to
testify about the Clintons before a grand jury as an almost
religious experience, an act of personal redemption, because she
was defying a prosecutor she believed was pursuing the Clintons
with what she described as Nazi-like determination.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning earlier in the day by her lawyer, Mrs.
McDougal told the jury that she had often made ethical mistakes in
her life and was given to ``cutting corners.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, she had decided that she could not abide living
with herself if she accommodated prosecutors whom she said wanted
her to lie about the Clintons and even hoped she would testify that
she had had a sexual affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Mrs. McDougal labored to justify her decision
not to talk to the grand jury even though she made clear Tuesday
that she believed she had no information of value to impart. To
make her case, she tried to depict Starr's prosecutors as predators
who offered to relieve her of unrelated criminal charges in
California if she provided damaging information about the Clintons.
She said that one prosecutor, Ray Jahn, told her that if she did
not cooperate she would be subjected to an income tax
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal said that her late former husband, James, had
urged her to cooperate with Starr's prosecutors even if it meant
lying. She said that McDougal had also told her that one of the
prosecutors, W. Hickman Ewing, would be satisfied if she testified
that she had had an affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this fellow, Hickman Ewing, in the Office of
Independent Counsel. He believes he can get Clinton on a sex charge
before the election,'' she quoted McDougal as having told her in
1996 when she was considering making a deal with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who has been in charge of the Arkansas phase of the
Whitewater investigation and who was sitting in the gallery as Mrs.
McDougal gave her testimony, later denounced her comments as
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal on Wednesday also answered the final question
prosecutors had put to her before the grand jury: What is the
explanation for the notation ``Payoff Clinton'' in her handwriting
that appeared on a 1983 check for $5,081 from the Arkansas savings
and loan she owned wth her husband.
</P>
<P>
   She said the notation referred to a land deal in Clinton, Ark.,
and not to Clinton.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton invoked the specter of Adolf
Hitler's massacres across Europe Wednesday night to dramatize his
plea for public support for the U.S.-led air campaign against
Yugoslav forces to stem murderous attacks on civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered his 13-minute appeal from the Oval Office just
six hours after ordering the fourth U.S. military attack on a
sovereign nation in seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States and 18 allies in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization had to halt the rampage of Yugoslav
forces across the Maryland-sized province of Kosovo before the
conflict and its refugees spilled into neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the ingredients for a major war are there _ ancient
grievances, struggling democracies and in the center of it all, a
dictator in Serbia who has done nothing since the Cold WAr ended
but start new wars and pour gasoline on the flames of ethnic and
religious division,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav crackdown on ethnic Albanians' quest for autonomy in
Kosovo has spawned 60,000 refugees in the last five weeks to join
200,000 others. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, one of two states
that make up the Balkan nation of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 Yugoslav troops and police officers have ``started
moving from village to village, shelling civilians and torching
their houses,'' Clinton explained. ``We've seen innocent people
taken from their homes, forced to kneel in the dirt and sprayed
with bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   After making elliptical references to Nazi atrocities in World
War II, Clinton declared: ``Just imagine if leaders back then had
acted wisely and early enough, how many lives could have been
saved. How many Americans would not have had to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used two maps and likened distances in the region to the
mileage between Washington and New York in a bid to drive home the
scale of the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative,'' Clinton declared,
adding: ``Inaction invites more brutality _ but firmness can save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was taking military action now ``in the interest
of avoiding an even crueler and costlier war'' later ``so that
future generations of Americans do not have to cross the Atlantic
to fight another war.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's address followed earlier remarks as the allied
offensive began to fall across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   British and American forces led the initial attacks that
included aircraft from 11 nations.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was the first attack staged against a sovereign
nation by NATO forces since the Cold War-era alliance was formed in
1949 to combat threatened Soviet-bloc aggression against Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Six 1950s-era B-52 bombers based in Britain launched more than
three dozen precision-guided cruise missiles against targets in and
near Kosovo. Two U.S. B-2 stealth bombers based at Whiteman Air
Force Base in Missouri dropped laser-guided 2,000 pound
bunker-buster bombs in the first combat use of the billion dollar
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Warplanes based at Aviano, in northern Italy, swept across the
Adriatic Sea to strike targets in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warships also fired cruise missiles against targets in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said allies resorted to armed force after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic rejected diplomatic persuasion to end
his year-old military crackdown against an independence movement in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants Milosevic to permit an allied
peacekeeping force of 28,000 troops _ including 4,000 Americans _
to enter Kosovo to enforce a yet-to-be negotiated cease-fire and
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who drew parallels on Tuesday between the Yugoslav
attacks and Nazi exterminations of civilians in World War II, said
``tens of thousands'' of ethnic Albanian civilians could be driven
from their homes in Kosovo into neighboring Albania and Macedonia,
unless the Yugoslav offensive is halted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the allied onslaught a ``stand against ethnic
violence and atrocity,'' adding: ``It will clearly be much more
costly and dangerous to stop it later than this effort to prevent
it from going further now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the operation was designed to demonstrate the
``seriousness'' of allied opposition to Yugoslav aggression;
dissuade attacks on civilians; and damage Yugoslavia's capacity to
wage war.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, Clinton has ordered U.S. forces to attack Iraq,
Sudan, Afghanistan and now Yugoslavia.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton canceled a planned three-day trip to Ohio, Nevada and
California that included political fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   With the military operation underway, Clinton garnered reluctant
rally-round-the-flag support from some wary Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who had a long-planned
lunch with Clinton at the White House, issued a statement
afterwards that expressed support for troops involved in ``a
complex and delicate situation that involves European stability and
our own nation's security.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert added that he has questions about the long-term strategy
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who has questioned
Clinton's penchant for launching military operations overseas,
offered support for troops in the operation _ if not for Clinton's
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever our reservations about the president's actions in the
Balkans, let no one doubt that the Congress and the American people
stand united behind our men and women who are bravely heeding the
call of duty there,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a likely GOP presidential candidate,
said he supported the air strikes but said ``everyone wants to know
what Plan B is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said he would support the president's
decision for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look _ the planes are flying,'' Kasich told reporters, adding
that he hoped the White House was mapping ``what the next step
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said the United States ``diminishes itself'' by becoming
entangled in ``civil wars and ethnic conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said a ``great power has to not only know when to go, but
when not to go'' to war.

</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to brace Americans for the possibility that U.S.
pilots could be shot down and killed or captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action is not risk-free,'' the president said. ``It
carries risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said he had ordered additional
search and rescue teams into the region to retrieve any downed
pilots. A Marine Corps team rescued Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady
in June 1995 after O'Grady evaded capture for six days after his
F-16 fighter was shot down by Bosnian Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-led operation threatened to chill U.S.-Russia
relations. Clinton spoke by telephone with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin about five hours before the attack began but failed to
persuade the Kremlin leader to support the aerial attacks against a
traditional Russian ally in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov abandoned
a planned visit to Washington and turned his U.S.-bound aircraft
around over the North Atlantic to return to Moscow after receiving
a telephone call from Vice President Al Gore that NATO was
preparing to attack targets in Yugoslavia.

 &HT;    They're in the money: Georgians worth $100,000-plus on the rise
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia has about 40,000 more households with incomes
greater than $100,000 a year than at the beginning of the 1990s,
according to a study by a company that analyzes such information.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Georgia households with six-figure incomes or
beyond has ballooned by 52 percent since the start of the decade,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   About 114,145 of the 2.1 million households in Georgia have
passed the $100,000 threshold, and most of them _ 82,450 _ are in
metro Atlanta, according to John Karevoll of Acxiom Corp., which
specializes in database analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of the six-figure set is a sign of the state's rapid
economic expansion, as well as the influx of outsiders moving here
for professional jobs, he said. ``This has been a top-down
recovery. Those who had higher income were the first to benefit
from the growth of the economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study relied on figures compiled through the fall of 1998
from federal and private sector sources.
</P>
<P>
   In one ZIP code _ 30327 in Buckhead _ 44 percent of households
had more than $100,000 in income. The average annual household
income in the United States is still shy of $40,000, according to
the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Economists warn against seeing the numbers as proof that Georgia
has surged into affluence.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation alone since 1990 has amounted to 25 percent, said Jeff
Humphreys, director of economic forecasting at the University of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Jared Bernstein, economist at the Economic Policy Institute in
Washington, D.C., questioned the study's conclusion. ``That is a
very big change, and I am suspicious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Wayne Gantt, economist and president of the Ansley Group, a
consulting firm in Atlanta, said the $100,000 benchmark itself is
misleading. ``I'd say $100,000 isn't what it used to be,'' he said.

AIR SAFETY BOARD URGES RUDDER CHANGES IN BOEING 737 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Va. _ The National Transportation Safety Board said
Wednesday that changes should be made in thousands of Boeing 737s
to assure that no more crashes occur because of a single mechanical
failure in the plane's rudder control mechanism. The recommendation
for the world's most popular airliner, which is based on
investigation of two crashes and several smaller mishaps, could be
among the most far-reaching the NTSB has ever made.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing Co. responded that it knew of no problems that would
not be solved by changes already under way, and the Federal
Aviation Administration said it did not understand what the NTSB
meant when it recommended making the system the pilots use for
moving the rudder ``reliably redundant.''
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said it was up to the FAA to determine how that should
be accomplished. In aviation, redundancy means having a second
piece of equipment to perform a crucial job if the first one fails.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation came as part of a finding issued Wednesday in
the case of USAir 427, a 737 that crashed on approach to Pittsburgh
in September 1994, killing all 132 people on board. The finding was
unusual because its conclusion _ that the crash was caused by a
hydraulic jam that swung the rudder opposite the direction the
pilot wanted _ was not based on any physical evidence. This was a
crash solved by computer simulation, with the NTSB's staff saying
that such a rudder malfunction was the only way the plane could
have fallen the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB declined to specify what would modifications should be
made in the control system, although Boeing and the FAA said they
might involve adding a second hydraulic valve, or installing a
rudder split horizontally, the upper half and lower half being
controlled by separate systems.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Boeing executives responded by saying that the rudder was
already being made fully redundant because fixes have been ordered
and are now being made to to hundreds of planes a month as a result
of the Pittsburgh crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything in the hearings that leads me to
believe anyone has data about a problem that needs to be fixed,''
said the chief of aircraft safety at the FAA, Thomas McSweeny. He
did, however, acknowledge that there is at least one recent
incident of a rudder malfunction that experts cannot explain. In
that mishap, in which there were no deaths or injuries, the 737s
rudder had already been modified.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is an independent agency and has advisory powers only,
although the FAA follows the great majority of its recommendations.
NTSB members complained bitterly Wednesday that if the FAA had
acted promptly on their recommendations for better flight data
recorders, two recent non-fatal rudder malfunctions in 737s might
have been recorded in greater detail, reducing the mystery behind
Flight 427.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA and Boeing said they agreed with another NTSB
recommendation, for intensive additional study of the rudder
mechanism, which the NTSB also blamed for the crash of United
flight 585 as it attempted a landing at Colorado Springs, Colo., in
March, 1991. In that sense the investigation of the Pittsburgh
crash, the longest in the NTSB's history, will continue.
</P>
<P>
   In voting to approve a finding that rudder malfunction be cited
as the probable cause of both crashes, the board's four members
held no public debate. Their conclusion, after extensive private
discussion, was unanimous but not without misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there's much evidence in these investigations, the vast
majority of it is not things you can lay your hands on,'' said
George Black, one of the four members. He and others expressed
frustration about the failure to find scars, cracks or other
evidence of a jam on the hydraulic valve or other parts of the
system.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also stressed the lack of evidence, maintaining that
either mechanical failure or pilot error was possible in the
Pittsburgh crash, but it said it would not argue the point with the
NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB, Boeing and the FAA on Wednesday all praised the 737, a
plane that has accumulated 91 million flight hours of service,
moving more passengers than there are people on earth.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would gladly participate in a joint study, with
safety board engineers and others, to find other ways that the
rudder could fail.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 of the planes are in service worldwide, although
the NTSB's recommendation covers only those registered in this
country, about 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   Various changes, some requiring substantial effort, have been
made voluntarily by some airlines and have now been made mandatory
by the FAA. These include changing a valve to prevent the kind of
jam that the NTSB said occurred in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   When rudder controls malfunction, pilots can fly using controls
on the wings called ailerons and spoilers, but at low speeds the
rudder overpowers these other flight controls.
</P>
<P>
   In investigating the Pittsburgh crash, engineers determined that
the 737 is unusual in that it is often flown at speeds slow enough
for the rudder, if it malfunctioned, to be more powerful than the
other controls. One of the NTSB's recommendations Wednesday was
that pilots be taught that if a rudder malfunctions, they should
push the nose of the plane down into a dive, and pick up enough
speed to let them overcome the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB also said that 737s should routinely fly faster on
approach to airports, to keep the speed above the level where a bad
rudder could overpower other controls. A spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association, John Cox, who is a captain with USAir, said
that his airline responded to the problem by lowering the wing
flaps earlier; that, too, increases a pilot's control of the plane.

<P>
   The Global One telecommunications consortium of Sprint, France
Telecom and Germany's Deutsche Telekom is close to collapse, and an
agreement to dissolve the venture could come within as few as six
weeks, executives close to Global One said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dissolution would set the stage for Sprint to be acquired by
another communications giant and for Deutsche Telekom to seek
international acquisitions of its own.
</P>
<P>
   William T. Esrey, Sprint's chairman, sent a letter three weeks
ago to Ron Sommer and Michel Bon, the chairmen of Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom, respectively, saying essentially that Global
One was failing in its current form and that the companies should
move decisively to resolve the partnership, said the executives
close to the venture.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies founded Global One in 1996 mainly to offer
large multinational corporations complete, integrated
telecommunications services worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey appeared to refrain from calling for the venture's
termination outright, the executives said, because the agreement
among the three companies specifies large financial penalties for
any one company that initiates a break-up of Global One, the
executives said. They added, however, that the German and French
companies, which together own 20 percent of Sprint, interpreted the
letter as a sign that Sprint would like to end its role in the
partnership, which has been troubled from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Since the letter was sent, representatives of the three
companies have been locked in negotiations that appear destined to
lead to the venture's end, the executives said. They added,
however, that there was still a small chance that Global One could
be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Global One has become a problem for Sprint in two main ways,
executives close to the venture said.
</P>
<P>
   First, the consortium never ran smoothly. From the beginning,
Sprint was frustrated by the German and French companies' shuffling
of executives in and out of the venture, and the companies never
quite agreed on which companies should assume which
responsibilities in operating the venture. Also, the companies
never fully integrated their networks, the executives said,
increasing the difficulty of offering seamless services around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has said that Global One's performance has picked up
since Gary Forsee, formerly head of Sprint's long-distance
division, took over as Global One's chief executive. But the member
companies still have remained far apart on how best to position the
venture and on details of its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important as Global One's operational problems, however,
has been the realization at Sprint that Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom are not likely to acquire the 80 percent of Sprint they do
not already own, according to executives close to Global One.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear for some time that Sprint believes that its
long-term survival will depend on combining with at least one other
major telecommunications carrier.The pace of consolidation in the
phone industry has become so brisk that otherwise Sprint risks
becoming relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   From Sprint's perspective, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom
would be ideal partners, but the European companies have all but
decided not to acquire Sprint, executives close to Global One said.
The first hurdle is the sheer amount of capital required; Sprint's
common stock (which is separate from the stock the European
companies own) has a market value of $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom wants to focus its international investments in
Europe, so there is no appeal in spending that kind of money for a
U. S. company. Deutsche Telekom has additional concerns, ranging
from questions about the technical details of Sprint's network to
doubts about its own ability to retain valuable Sprint executives
after an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   So, according to executives close to Global One, the thinking at
Sprint seems to be: What is the point of remaining locked in with
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom in this so-so partnership if
they are never going to step up and marry us for real? Why not
clear the decks so we can pursue a merger with someone else (like
the BellSouth Corp., perhaps, though a deal like that might founder
before regulators)?
</P>
<P>
   The main complication is that even if Global One is dissolved,
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom still would together own 20
percent of Sprint, a stake they agreed to buy in 1994 for more than
$3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Global One, there would be little reason for
the French and German companies to hold on to their Sprint stock.
But getting rid of it would not be simple. They could sell it to
the public, but it is unlikely that Sprint would agree to a
secondary offering that would depress its stock price. In all
likelihood, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom would end up
keeping their Sprint stakes with the understanding that they would
sell them to a company that made a friendly deal to acquire the
rest of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   As for Deutsche Telekom, it has been considering a host of
options for expanding its presence outside Germany and around the
world, either alone or in continued partnership with France
Telecom, the executives said. Among the companies that would seem
to make sense for Deutsche Telekom to acquire are Qwest
Communications International Inc.; the recent combination of Global
Telesystems Group Inc. and Esprit Telecom Group of Britain; RSL
Communications of Bermuda; Global Crossing of Bermuda, and the
communications unit of the Williams Companies Inc.

 &HT;    `Good chemistry and an excellent coach' reminiscent of '68
Buckeye team
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They are still close friends, 31 years later.
Except for family and war, no bonds are stronger than those forged
in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hosket and Denny Meadors were two kids who came out of
Dayton in the '60s and helped restore Ohio State basketball. They
went to the Final Four together in 1968 and now the memories rush
back as they see the similarities between their situation and the
one the present Buckeyes face.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams shocked the state after several mediocre seasons. The
'68 bunch followed Buckeye teams that went 12-12, 11-13 and 13-11.
This year's team followed five straight losers.
</P>
<P>
   Both went to the Final Four as ``That Other Team.'' In '68, the
three anointed teams were Houston, UCLA and North Carolina, ranked
1-2-3. This year, the three are Duke, Michigan State and UConn,
ranked 1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Hosket, who is close to this team as an analyst on Buckeye TV
games, noted another, deeper similarity. ``I see exactly what we
had,'' he said, ``good chemistry and an excellent coach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And no egos,'' said Meadors. ``These kids really like each
other. Just like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosket went to Columbus first after playing on Belmont's state
championship team of 1964. Meadors followed a year later after a
terrific career at Stebbins.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1967-68 season, sick of losing, they were ready for, as
Hosket said, ``a magical season.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, only the league champions went to the NCAA
Tournament, and on the final day of the season, the Buckeyes were
one game behind Iowa, needing a miracle _ last-place Michigan had
to beat Iowa to get OSU into a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Rudy Tomjanovich?'' Meadors said of the present
Houston Rockets coach. ``He was on that Michigan team. He's the
reason they beat Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   So you're a Rockets fan now?
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet I am,'' Meadors said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks beat Iowa 85-81 in the playoff, took down East
Tennessee State in the first round of the Midwest Regional, but
then had to play No. 4 Kentucky in Lexington, where the Wildcats
hadn't lost all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their pep band kept playing, California, Here We Come,''
Meadors said. ``But we hung with them.''
</P>
<P>
   With three seconds left, Hosket in-bounded to Dave Sorenson and
Sorenson banked one in to beat the 'Cats, 82-81.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is from Kentucky,'' Meadors said. ``And they were
all there. They wanted me to do well, but they wanted Kentucky to
win. Afterward, my grandfather wouldn't speak to me. I'm serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sports bonds.
</P>
<P>
   So the Buckeyes went to Los Angeles as That Other Team, and
Carolina took 'em apart in the semifinal, 80-66.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like the JV game,'' Hosket said. ``The only game
anyone talked about was the rematch between UCLA and Houston.
Houston was unbeaten and had given UCLA its only loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Their versions of that semifinal differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always say if Meadors could have gotten the ball up the
floor, we would have won,'' said Hosket.
</P>
<P>
   ``My memory is that if Hosket could have guarded someone, we
would have won,'' said Meadors.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is serious. Thirty-one years later, they needle each
other like brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, Carolina was a great team,'' Meadors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had Charlie Scott, Larry Miller, Rusty Clark,'' Hosket
said. ``They also had the commissioner of the Big Ten, Jim Delany,
as a reserve guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in foul trouble early and got behind and never caught
up,'' Meadors said. ``We always laughed that we were four centers
and a guard. I was the only guy on the floor who could handle the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, early in the season the Buckeyes did start four kids
who played center in high school _ Hosket, Sorenson, Steve Howell
and Mike Swain _ with Meadors. Later, coach Fred Taylor put guard
Jody Finney in place of Swain, but Finney was mostly known for his
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always kidded coach Taylor that we're the team that got him
in the Hall of Fame,'' Hosket said. ``Anybody could have coached
the Lucas-Havlicek team to the Final Four. But only a genius could
have gotten us there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes came back, in those days of consolation games, and
beat Houston in the third-place game. As usual, the Daytonians'
memories diverge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston had Elvin Hayes and he scored like 34,'' Hosket said.
``We were mostly in a zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hosket was assigned to Hayes,'' Meadors said, laughing because
he knew Hosket would eventually read this and fume.
</P>
<P>
   The two men's lives have paralleled each other in many ways
since they graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Hosket is a vice-president at Millcraft Paper and lives in
Columbus with his wife and three sons, two of them named Brett and
Brad.
</P>
<P>
   Meadors is a vice-president at Raymond James and Associates and
lives in Columbus with his wife and three sons, two of them named
Brett and Brad.
</P>
<P>
   The mark of how respected they are came last February in the
ceremonies before the final game in St. John Arena. Fred Taylor's
wife and children chose Hosket and Meadors to push Taylor's
wheelchair to the center circle in the most heart-rending moment of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great honor,'' Meadors said. ``Everybody was crying.
Me and Hoss couldn't look at each other. The ovation lasted five
minutes. It was staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Both will be in St. Pete this weekend and both like OSU's
chances against UConn in Saturday's semifinal. Both like the
matchups and believe this is an OSU team a cut above.
</P>
<P>
   Just as were they, 31 years ago.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and its NATO allies slammed
Yugoslavia Wednesday night with scores of cruise missiles and
guided bombs , striking power plants, anti-aircraft sites, army
barracks and other military targets from the country's southern
plains to the outskirts of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As a massive U.S.-led armada of warplanes -- including a pair of
B-2 long-range stealth bombers -- pressed Operation: Allied Force'
deep into Yugoslavia, President Clinton said the world had lost
patience with Serb military aggression against ethnic Albanians in
Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative,'' Clinton said in
an address to the nation from the Oval Office, hoping to build on
the thin national support for a high-risk mission the White House
has threatened for weeks to launch. ``Our firmness is the only hope
the people of Kosovo have to be able to live in their own country
without having to fear for their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Pentagon vowed to continue the air campaign, Clinton
pledged that ``we will deliver a forceful response,'' if Serb
forces counterattack U.S. positions in the region. Several thousand
U.S. troops remain in neighboring Bosnia, helping to police a
fragile peace based on an edgy partition of Serb and non-Serb
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also promised that no U.S. ground troops would go to
Kosovo, except as part of a larger NATO peacekeeping force that, as
of yet, remains part of a contingency plan so far rejected by
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war,''
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As he has several times in recent days, Clinton braced the
nation for the possibility of U.S. casualties and, for the first
time, warned of the risk of civilian casualties in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are risks in this military action,'' Clinton said,
``risks to our pilots and to people on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Clinton, those threats are outweighed by the dangers
of allowing Serb aggression to continue and risking the spread of
the conflict in the volatile Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conflict with no natural national boundaries,''
warned Clinton. ``Let a fire burn in this area, and the flames will
spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to the difficulty of explaining the U.S. interests in
what's unfolding in a remote province in the troubled Balkans,
Clinton twice referred to color maps of the region to try to
convince heartland Americans of the dangers of continued violence
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the ingredients for a major war are there,'' Clinton said,
pointing out the centuries-old ethnic and religious tensions in a
region that triggered World War I, saw some of the most savage
fighting of World War II and was a crucible of East-West tensions
throughout the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   A year of Serb military attacks on villages and civilians has
left more than 2,000 dead and another quarter of a million homeless
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks of intensive diplomatic efforts to end the fighting
collapsed on Tuesday with the rejection of a U.S.-backed peace plan
by Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic. The plan has been agreed to by
the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is the president of Yugoslavia, which takes in Serbia
and neighboring Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Explosions ripped the perimeters of Kosovo's provincial capital,
Pristina, and the suburbs of Belgrade beginning just before 8 p.m.,
(2 p.m. EST), as air raid sirens blared through the cities for the
first time since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks near those cities and more than a dozen other sites
continued for roughly four hours, as successive waves of
ship-launched cruise missiles, jet fighters and bombers raked the
small Balkan country in the largest combat attack in the 50-year
history of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles were launched from U.S. and British ships and
submarines in the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas and from U.S.
B-52 bombers flying high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Guided bombs weighing up to 2,000 pounds each were dropped from
U.S. F-16 and F-15 warplanes, and a pair of the B-2 Spirit stealth
bombers. It was the first mission ever for the 11-year-old Spirits,
which cost $2.1 billion each and were designed in the waning years
of the Cold War for deep penetration into Soviet airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials wouldn't publicly confirm speculation that
the Spirits formed the spearhead of attacks near a heavily-defended
military air base outside of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the strikes began, Milosevic went on state-run
television in Belgrade to assail the long-advertised attack,
portraying it as a criminal assault on a sovereign nation and
urging his countrymen to employ ''all means,'' to defend their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at stake here is the freedom of the entire country,''
Milosevic said. ``Kosovo was only the door intended to allow
foreign troops to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan Milosevic rejected called for 28,000 NATO
peacekeepers, including 4,000 Americans, to occupy Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon would say little about the attacks, citing security
concerns. News reports from Yugoslavia, however, suggested that
more than 20 targets were hit in the initial phase of what could be
a long-term assault aimed at ''seriously diminishing,'' in
Clinton's words, Serb military capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The target list is extensive,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen told reporters at a Pentagon briefing, insisting that the
duration of the campaign would be determined by the extent of
damage air strikes do to Serb military capability, not by any
predetermined schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen confirmed that NATO pilots had engaged in air-to-air
combat, amid reports of the downing of at least one Soviet made
Serb MiG fighter.
</P>
<P>
   With Wednesday's operations nearly complete, Cohen said he knew
of no NATO losses, saying ``our aircraft have safely returned,'' to
their bases in Italy, Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the joint chiefs, said NATO would
press its attacks on Serb air defenses -- in hopes of reducing the
risk to NATO pilots -- as well as power plants and other support
systems, Serb troops, and the hundreds of tanks backing those
troops in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laid out three objectives for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The first, Clinton said, is to demonstrate to Milosevic that
NATO will no tolerate further Serb military attacks on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, where a year of repression has left more than
2,000 dead and another quarter of a million homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second,'' Clinton said, is ``to deter President Milosevic from
continuing and escalating his attacks on helpless civilians, by
imposing a price for those attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   And third, Clinton said, ``if necessary, to damage Serbia's
capacity to wage war against Kosovo in the future, by seriously
diminishing its military capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as NATO moved ahead with air strikes, the Clinton
administration insisted the diplomatic option remains open to
Milosevic, should he agree to the international peace plan and the
NATO implementation force it would mandate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, who spent two fruitless
days in Belgrade earlier this week trying to persuade Milosevic to
sign onto the agreement, remained in the region, in nearby
Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to get in touch with each other,'' said State
Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to fill a diplomatic breach, Clinton had a 45-minute
telephone conversation Wednesday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, who went on television in Moscow to decry the NATO attacks
on Russia's traditional Serb allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue as an area where we and the Russians must agree to
disagree,'' said Rubin. ``Russia should not let our relationship be
stymied by the activities of a petty dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed by China, which also opposes the strikes, Russia called
an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to
discuss the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan criticized NATO for not
consulting with the Security Council before launching the strikes,
a move NATO avoided due to the certainty of a veto by Russia and
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council has primary responsibility for
maintaining international peace and security,'' Annan told
reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York. ``Therefore, the
Council should be involved in any decision to resort to force.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's rebuke was a mild one, however, and he laid the blame
for the strikes clearly at the feet of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply regret that in spite of all the efforts made by the
international community, the
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities have persisted in their rejection of a
political settlement which would have halted the bloodshed in
Kosovo and secured an equitable peace for the population,'' said
Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed,'' said Annan.
``But there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in
the pursuit of peace.''

RUSSIA BREAKS TIES TO NATO AS PROTEST OF BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In an outburst reminiscent of the Cold War, Russia
broke ties with NATO Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night and threatened further action
to protest the US-led alliance's bombing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin, saying he was ``deeply shocked''
after his last-minute phone call with President Clinton failed to
avert the airstrikes, said in a statement that Russia was ``ready
to take adequate steps, including of a military nature, to ensure
its own security and that of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Promptly after the bombing began, Russia demanded an emergency
session of the UN Security Council. Russian officials said Moscow
at such a session might call for lifting the UN arms embargo
against Yugoslavia. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia was
considering withdrawing from the embargo unilaterally, which could
allow Moscow to begin supplying Serb forces with arms.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting rising tensions between Russia and the West over
Kosovo, Yeltsin recalled Russia's envoy to NATO headquarters in
Brussels and suspended Russia's membership in Partnership for
Peace. The NATO program, which Russia joined in 1994, was designed
to bring former East and West enemies closer by encouraging
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's response to the bombing also highlighted the
frustration of a snubbed former superpower that found itself foiled
once again in its efforts to stop Washington from bombing an ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US and its European allies . . . have wiped their feet on
us,'' said Vladimir Lukin, Russia's former ambassador to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   NATO launched the raids after Yugoslavia would not agree to a
peace settlement in Kosovo. Serb troops are battling ethnic
Albanian guerrillas in the province, where hundreds have been
killed and 60,000 have been forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which considers its fellow Orthodox Slavs the Serbs
historical allies, has argued against a military solution, much as
it tried to halt US and British airstrikes against Iraq in 1991.
Failing in this effort not only damages ambitions to restore
superpower status to Russia. Wary of their own separatist conflict
with Chechnya, Russian politicians worry about the precedent set by
NATO's decision to bomb without UN approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to the whole world . . . to all politicians, while
there are still a few minutes left, let us convince Clinton not to
take this tragic, dramatic step,'' Yeltsin, who made his first trip
to the Kremlin after a month recovering from a bleeding ulcer, said
in a televised address. ``This is a war in Europe, and maybe even
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's comments also showed signs of Moscow's growing
frustration with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, (Milosevic) is a difficult negotiator. Sometimes you have
to speak to him two, three, five, 10, or 20 times,'' growled the
Russian leader. ``But we shouldn't regret talking to him those 10,
20 times for the sake of the hundreds and hundreds of people who
will die in a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who returned home Wednesday
after canceling his planned trip to Washington in midflight on
Tuesday, said he had admonished Vice President Al Gore to ``think
it over once more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think that the strikes will help stabilize the
situation in Kosovo,'' Primakov said on arrival in Moscow. ``On the
contrary, they will be destabilizing, and our relations with the
United States as well as stability in Europe will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov had been hoping to secure billions of dollars in new
loans for Russia's sagging economy, which has been sapped by
corruption, poor tax collection, and the low price of oil, the
country's main export.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's decision to cancel his trip was applauded by
Communists and nationalists in parliament, but others criticized
the move as evidence of the fundamental flaw in Russia's policy of
tacitly supporting Milosevic while asking the West for loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A weakened Russia should not bet its fate on the moods of
President Slobodan Milosevic,'' said Sergei Karaganov, head of a
Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Others were more emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of friends of Russia are these, who make us look
like complete idiots to the rest of the world?'' asked centrist
legislator Nikolai Goncharov.
</P>
<P>
   With talks with the International Monetary Fund temporarily on
hold, the Russian currency tumbled nearly 2 points to 26 to the
dollar, a new lowpoint for the ruble since it was devalued in
August. Some analysts predicted a further drop. Others said
Primakov's cancellation would not hurt Russia's chances for IMF
money.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Communist and ultranationalist leaders, who often
play up Russia's kinship with Serbs to express their anti-Western
sentiments, called on Russians to volunteer to fight alongside
Yugoslav forces. The extremist Russian Party said it had already
gathered 150 men; the party also warned American citizens to leave
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov compared the NATO attack to
Hitler's expansionist moves that started World War II, and called
for massive military aide to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Another Communist legislator, Viktor Ilyukhin, notorious in the
West for his anti-Semitic comments, advocated moving nuclear
weapons back into Belarus. The former Soviet republic, wedged
between Russia and new NATO member Poland, had dismantled its
strategic arsenal after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the West think about it,'' said Ilyukhin. ``Should they
become targets for our heavy rockets, including the new countries
of NATO?''

 &HT;    Offensive load lifted, Langdon thriving
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ During his four seasons at Duke, guard
Trajan Langdon has been considered a money player, a guy who always
comes through when a clutch shot is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Always, that is, until the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 and 1998 NCAA Tournaments, the senior from
Anchorage, Alaska, was less than clutch, hitting only 19 of 68
shots from the field, 28 percent, including 11-for-38 on
3-pointers. Duke was eliminated in the second round by Providence
in 1997 and lost to Kentucky in the South Regional Final in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon's postseason woes have ended this season. In Sunday's
85-64 victory against Temple in the East Regional championship
game, Langdon hit 5 of 6 from 3-point range and needed only seven
shots from the field to score 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out Duke's first NCAA Tournament game against
Florida A&AMP;M, Langdon has hit 19 of 30 from the field and 11 of 18
from 3-point range. He is the hottest shooter in the country coming
into Saturday's Final Four game with Michigan State at Tropicana
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trajan is not one who would ever succumb to pressure, but he
is a human being, and he can get worn down,'' coach Mike Krzyzewski
said. ``He got worn down because he carried us _ further probably
than we should have advanced a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Langdon said his improved shooting in this tournament has come
from playing on a team with a lot of offensive options, including
Elton Brand, Duke's All-American center and leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different mindset,'' Langdon said. ``I put too much
pressure on myself in the postseason these last couple of years. We
have such a talented team, they really don't need my shot, or if I
don't shoot well, we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly family and friends
</P>
<P>
   When teams make it to the Final Four, the players suddenly hear
from friends and relatives they didn't know they had. Just ask
UConn's Kevin Freeman, who had dozens of messages awaiting him when
the Huskies returned home from the West Regional in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of people who really don't know you or were
your friend in the past,'' Freeman said. ``Then you've got
relatives that want to fly in from everywhere. They can make it to
Florida, but they couldn't make it to Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Freeman said, is simple: Turn off the phone and let
your parents distribute the six tickets each player is allotted.
</P>
<P>
   Naismith awards
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski and Brand were chosen the winners of the Naismith
Coach and Player of the Year awards presented by the Atlanta Tipoff
Club. The women's award winners were Purdue coach Carolyn Peck,
whose team will face Louisiana Tech in the Friday's national
semifinal, and Tennessee senior Chamique Holdsclaw. The awards will
be presented at the Naismith banquet April 3 at the Cobb Galleria
Center in Atlanta.

SOME LAWMAKERS CRITICAL OF U.S. ROLE IN AIRSTRIKES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the U.S. House of Representatives voted
overwhelmingly to lend moral support for armed forces fighting in
Kosovo, some members of Congress continued to rail against American
involvement in NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 424-1 for a resolution supporting armed forces
sent to Kosovo, with Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., opposing the
measure. Unlike the Senate's 58-41 vote Tuesday authorizing the
president to go ahead with the airstrikes, the House's resolution
was not a referendum on the decision to take military action.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who voted against the airstrikes, is
continuing to wage one of the most vocal protests, saying he cannot
support military action where there is no vital national interest
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that President Clinton views American pilots,
soldiers and sailors as world social workers,'' said Gramm, who
voted Tuesday with 40 other senators to oppose the airstrikes. ``He
scours the globe for opportunities to do good in hostile lands, and
when he finds a problem, his inclination is to dispatch our troops
to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm criticized the president's plan in Kosovo and warned about
sending in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, agreed the strikes are a mistake,
stressing that ``a mission like this should not be initiated
without a clear exit strategy in place.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, and Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, also questioned Clinton's long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, attempted to pin the
president to a timetable by blocking funding for the airstrikes
unless a detailed mission plan was submitted to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Her amendments were shelved, however, after fellow Republicans,
including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain, a Vietnam veteran who was a prisoner of war for
six years, acknowledged the risk of casualties inherent in military
involvement, he voted Tuesday with 16 other Republicans and 42
Democrats to support the airstrikes. He continued to be a backer of
the initiative Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the president. We support our men and women, and
(Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic) has made a very big mistake,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, also agrees with the decision to take
military action, stating that Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing''
policies are destabilizing the region and setting up circumstances
similar to those that sparked World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not act now, the slaughter would intensify, the
violence could spread, and the credibility of the United States and
its NATO allies would be shattered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen's words echoed those of the Democratic leadership,
including Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., who both said NATO had ``no choice'' but to act.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, expressed caution, stating he was
worried about NATO taking the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said, ``Whatever our
reservations about the president's actions in the Balkans, let no
one doubt that the Congress and the American people stand united
behind our men and women who are bravely heeding the call of duty
there,'' he said.

DISASTER RELIEF APPROVED IN FACE OF CLINTON VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Against the backdrop of a veto threat by President
Clinton, the House on Wednesday night approved a $1.3 billion
emergency spending bill that included nearly $1 billion in relief
to Central American countries ravaged by hurricanes and scaled back
an array of government programs to pay for the expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The final minutes of the vote, during which several Republicans
who had voted against the bill changed their positions to ensure
its passage by a narrow margin, underscored the slightness of the
Republican advantage in the House and the difficulty that party
leaders may face in passing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally was 220-211. Only 10 Democrats joined
Republicans to support the bill, while only 11 Republicans joined
Democrats to oppose it. On Tuesday, the Senate also approved a
disaster bill that has drawn White House opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The hours of debate over the bill, the first spending measure
taken up by the House this year, foreshadowed what are certain to
be even more bitter disputes when the House turns its full
attention toward the budget for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed the cuts in the bill as unnecessary and
dangerous _ particularly a $648 million reduction in ``callable
capital,'' money set aside to guarantee loans by international
development banks, and a $150 million decrease in money for the
disposal of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said that finding trims was the only way to pay
for the emergency spending while both keeping lawmakers' fingers
out of the federal surplus and staying within budget caps mandated
by Congress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone thinks they have heartburn over this small number of
offsets, just wait until we bring the fiscal year 2000 budget to
the floor,'' said Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee, toward the start of what turned
into a six-hour debate over the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in callable capital in particular drew protest
from the Clinton administration. In a letter to Young made public
Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that the measure
``could have negative consequences beyond the current budgetary
horizon for the developing world and our economy'' and would
probably ensure a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a similar
emergency spending bill that authorized $500 million more than the
House bill called for. The two bills, which concern supplemental
spending for the current fiscal year, will now proceed to
conference, where lawmakers will try to iron out differences
between the measures.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has said that the president may
veto the result. Administration officials object to a number of
provisions in the bills, including cuts in money to beef up
security around U.S. embassies and to dispose of uranium and
plutonium in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats expressed particular alarm about the latter
proposal, saying that it jeopardized the security of the United
States. Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the
House Appropriations Committee, called it ``the most egregious and
reckless of the recommendations,'' but an amendment he offered that
nullified this and three other cuts in the Republican bill was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $956 million in hurricane relief, the House bill
includes $100 million in economic and military assistance to Jordan
and nearly $106 million to support loan guarantees to farmers.
Several Democrats, including Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
complained that the aid to farmers was too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill did not include one item that senators added to
their version, a provision that would allocate $40 million to
families of the victims of last year's accident in which a Marine
jet sliced the cable of a ski gondola in Aviano, Italy, and killed
20.
</P>
<P>
   When the time for voting on the House bill had initially
expired, it did not have enough votes to pass. But the time was
then extended, and in the next few hectic minutes, enough lawmakers
voted or changed their votes to tilt the tally.

 AOL Plans To Slash Workforce
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
America Online Inc. said yesterday it will lay off up to 1,000
people in the wake of its $10 billion acquisition of Netscape
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The online giant announced yesterday it is cutting between 350
to 500 jobs from Netscape's workforce of 2,500 employees and a
similar number from its own 9,500-person staff. In addition, AOL is
reorganizing its operations and will take an undisclosed
third-quarter charge to cover restructuring costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at this as a companywide reorganization _ not about
grafting Netscape on and then gutting it,'' said Barry Schuler, AOL
executive in charge of the Netscape transition. ``It was important
to streamline all of our operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Netscape layoffs will come from its Mountain View
headquarters. Overlapping administrative and marketing positions
will be hit hardest, leaving largely unscathed Netscape's coveted
core of 550 software developers and managers. Details of severance
packages were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus (in cuts) was on administration,'' Schuler said.
``We wanted to keep our engineering talent.''
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to employees, AOL CEO Steve Case and AOL Chief
Operating Officer Bob Pittman said, ``We are creating a new
organization that will bring together the best of our cultures and
maximize the strengths of each company.''
</P>
<P>
   While briefly acknowledging the ``painful'' process of layoffs,
the message concludes: ``Together, we can make history building a
new medium we can all be proud of and a company that we hope will
become the most valuable and respected anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   However, AOL officials privately expressed concerns that job
cuts will damage employee morale and spur defections of more
Netscape software designers. In fact, a number of former employees,
dubbed Net-escapees, are already leading Internet startups.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs, which take place over the next few weeks, were
announced yesterday morning during a 90-minute ``all-hands''
meeting in a huge tent erected in the Netscape parking lot. More
than 2,000 people packed into the tent, eager to learn their fate
after reports surfaced last Thursday that up to 700 people would
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On hand to address the crowd under overcast skies were former
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale, Sun Microsystems Chief Operating
Officer Ed Zander, Pittman and Schuler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The reaction was very upbeat considering it was not-so-good
news,'' said Schuler, who will run Netscape out of Mountain View
the next few months before commuting from AOL's headquarters in
Dulles, Va. ``Clearly, employees wanted us to be direct.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hint of tension came when one employee asked if
Netscape's signs would be replaced by AOL's triangular logo. AOL
officials said no.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  One Netscape employee who attended the meeting said he
``appreciated the fact that management was straight up'' about the
cuts. ``Two large companies merged; layoffs are a consequence of
that action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape employees have been bracing for layoffs since AOL
announced its intention to buy Netscape last November.
</P>
<P>
   The two Internet behemoths completed their merger last week. AOL
is the world's largest online service. Netscape created the first
widely used Web browser for retrieving information off the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; AOL's acquisition of Netscape is steeped in irony.
</P>
<P>
   Derided for years by the digital elite as the ``McDonalds'' of
cyberspace, AOL has survived self-inflicted wounds and stiff
competition to establish itself as the leading brand.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, conversely, was a darling of the digerati because of
its freewheeling personality and leading-edge technology. But it
was badly damaged by Microsoft in a brutal marketing war and was
forced to find a buyer to bail it out of financial straits.
</P>
<P>
   However, AOL intends to continue highlighting Microsoft's
Internet Explorer browser as part of its online service. In
exchange, Microsoft has agreed to give AOL a prominent link on the
Windows operating system, which runs 90 percent of the world's
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's telling that the company perceived to be the Internet
brand has been consumed and digested by a company that many at one
time had written off,'' said analyst Ron Rappaport, of Zona
Research Inc. in Redwood City. ``In the future, many will look at
Netscape as a history lesson rather than as a browser company.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its restructuring, AOL will break into four product
groups:
</P>
<P>
   _Interactive Services, a division overseeing AOL, Netscape and
CompuServe, will be headed by Schuler.
</P>
<P>
   _Netscape Enterprise, an e-commerce and software development
venture with Sun, will be led by former Netscape executives Barry
Ariko and Steve Savignano.
</P>
<P>
   _International operations will continue to be run by veteran AOL
executive Jack Davies.
</P>
<P>
   _Interactive Properties, the division in charge of
instant-messaging and online content, will be headed by &UR;  &LR; another
AOL executive, Ted Leonsis.
</P>
<P>
   Many laid-off Netscape employees should be able to quickly find
new jobs. Some are expected to end up at Sun, which announced a new
e-commerce and corporate software division yesterday that will be
staffed in part by Netscape and Sun employees.
</P>
<P>
   The division is part of a complex three-way deal signed as part
of the AOL-Netscape merger. Sun is paying AOL $1.25 billion over
three years for rights to co-develop and sell software for the
online giant.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tolliver, currently president of the consumer and embedded
unit at Sun Microsystems, will be president and general manager of
strategic alliances between AOL and Sun.
</P>
<P>
   AOL stock fell $3.88 to $117.13 yesterday.

 BofA Reveals Post-Merger Layoff Figures
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
BankAmerica Corp. laid off 1,800 employees in the final three
months of last year following the September 30 merger of San
Francisco's Bank of America and NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The information, contained in the annual financial report filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week, shows that
the combined bank is well on its way to meeting its target of
cutting 5,000 to 8,000 positions over two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, now headquartered in Charlotte, said the 1,800 cut
jobs were throughout the coast-to-coast franchise. It declined to
disclose whether employees of the old BofA got hit the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, bank sources say BankAmerica has added
more than 600 positions in North Carolina while shedding ``a few
hundred'' jobs in California. However, BankAmerica employees in
California outnumber those in North Carolina by more than a 3-to-1
ratio, or about 50,000 to 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bank reported that by the end of last year, it had spent
$483 million of the $1.325 billion reserve it set aside to cover
merger-related expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chunk _ $740 million _ went to severance and other
employee-related costs. Of this amount, $253 million was used in
the fourth quarter to pay severance to the 1,800 laid-off employees
and to the more than 200 BofA executives who had employment
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The NationsBank-BofA deal triggered change-in-control provisions
of the employment contracts of 1,134 executives of the old BofA.
The combined bank offered jobs to 918, or 81 percent, of these
managers, and the vast majority agreed to stay. But some, including
many of BofA's top executives, joined the 216 who were not offered
jobs and cashed in their ``golden parachute'' severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,800 lost jobs represent about 1 percent of the bank's
total of 171,000. In addition to the anticipated 3,200 to 6,200
additional layoffs this year and next, BankAmerica expects to
eliminate another 10,000 positions over three to four years through
attrition and employees taking new jobs within the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The task of merging the two banks is far from complete. For
example, by the end of 1998, BankAmerica had spent only $7 million
of the $150 million it allocated to convert computer and other
systems, and spent only $106 million of the $300 it budgeted to get
out of certain businesses and contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the major conversions are not going to happen until
later this year and next year, in part to avoid Y2K problems,''
said Joseph Morford, a bank analyst with First Security Van Kasper.
However, he believes that ``the integration is proceeding on track,
and some cost savings should begin to emerge in the first-quarter
results.''

 New Microsoft Browser Laden With Features
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The latest version of the Internet Explorer Web browsing package is
quintessentially Microsoft. It's a huge program laden with features
and designed to beat its competition senseless.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Bill Gates and Co. are taking the same approach
with their browser that they've used to dominate the market for
word processors, spreadsheets, databases, presentation programs,
online encyclopedias _ basically the entire software industry.
</P>
<P>
   And it's working. Microsoft browsers _ including an earlier
version that comes with America Online, now control more than 40
percent of the market. Meanwhile, Netscape Communications, which
once owned 80 percent of the market, has fallen below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With Internet Explorer 5, Microsoft continues its policy of
giving the software away over the Internet (something Netscape also
does). You can get IE 5 at &LR;  www.microsoft.com/ie. &LR;  It's available
for Windows computers but not yet for the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   If the browser battle were a prize fight, the referee would stop
it and award Microsoft a victory by technical knockout. IE 5 has
just too many features that Netscape can't match with the current
version of Communicator _ especially when it comes to customizing
the program for individual tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Netscape, which is now owned by America Online, has
given up on the notion of beating Microsoft by competing
feature-for-feature and is now concentrating on developing
slimmed-down browsers that can be used in small computing devices
as well as PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy new stuff that gives Microsoft IE 5 an advantage over
Netscape Communicator 4.5 includes:
</P>
<P>
   _A customizable toolbar that lets you add and remove buttons for
various functions such as copy, paste and font size.
</P>
<P>
   _A Search Assistant that gives you the option of using multiple
search engines when looking for Web pages, mail and e-mail
addresses and maps.
</P>
<P>
   _Autosearch, a feature that lets you conduct a Web search simply
by typing a phrase or question in the Internet address bar and
hitting Enter.
</P>
<P>
   _An improved History bar that provides quick access to sites
you've previously visited and lets you arrange them in a number of
ways, including by date or by how often you visit them.
</P>
<P>
   _Error messages in plain English. Instead of an HTTP 404, you'll
get an explanation of reasons why a page can't be accessed and
suggestions for getting around the problem.
</P>
<P>
   _A Radio toolbar that lets you listen to and change
Internet-based radio programs while you browse.
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft's credit, IE 5 doesn't commandeer your desktop like
the previous version did by modifying the look of Windows and
imposing an Internet channel bar on the screen. Those incursions
were not well received by those who have an ingrained suspicion of
Microsoft's motives.
</P>
<P>
   IE 5 isn't superior in every way. Netscape's browser has a few
unique talents of its own, including excellent one-on-one chat
software and the ability to display the current price of any stock
by simply typing ``quote'' and the stock symbol in the address
space and hitting Enter.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and Netscape claim their browsers are the
fastest, but real-life tests are inconclusive, and besides, a lot
of the performance of a browser depends on the speed of the
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Although IE 5 boasts more features than Communicator, it does
have one big drawback. Like most Microsoft programs and operating
systems, it's the biggest bully on the block. A standard install of
the package, which includes Outlook Express e-mail, takes up 55
megabytes on your hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Netscape's Communicator uses less than half that
much, and the company is developing a new browser-only program
called Gecko which  &LR; that will be less than 2 megs.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape wants to promote Gecko as an ideal browser for
Internet-only devices and other small computers that can't
accommodate a leviathan-like IE 5. The company also is
collaborating with Sun Microsystems, which bought Netscape's
software business, to develop a new kind of browser. Based on Sun's
Java programming language, it would work nicely with Java-enabled
appliances such as smart phones.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a very small browser on the market. Called
Opera, this software out of Norway takes up less than 2 megabytes
and works well on pre-Pentium computers. It does have a few
drawbacks, however. It doesn't support some of the latest Internet
technology, which means multimedia pages may lose some of their
zing. It doesn't have a complete e-mail system like you get with IE
and Communicator.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike its bigger rivals, it's sold, not given away. You
can download it at &LR;  www.operasoftware.com  &LR; and give it a try, but
if you decide to keep it, you'll have to pay $35.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Microsoft still rules the roost. The new IE 5 is a
worthy successor to IE 4 and a solid addition to any desktop. And,
hey, it's free. You can't beat that.

 Column: Eyeing an All-In-One Printer
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I've been thinking of getting an all-in-one machine that
serves as a printer, scanner, copier and fax. But two intelligent
friends of mine advise against it. They claim multifunction
machines don't perform as well as those dedicated to a single
function. What's your opinion?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  In most ways, your friends are right. All-in-one
office machines generally are pretty good printers, but in other
ways they fall short. Copies, for instance, are generated using the
printer, a process that can take a long time and may not give
results comparable to a stand-alone copy machine. Scanning also can
be a problem because the machines use a sheet-feed mechanism that
precludes scanning irregularly shaped pages and doesn't give the
precision control of a flat-bed scanner. And the fax component of a
multifunction machine usually is slower than a regular fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue with all-in-ones is reliability. With so much
going on inside the machine, the chances of a breakdown are greater
than for single-function devices. And a malfunction could reduce
your multifunction to a no-function.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of an all-in-one is that it takes up a lot less space
than four separate machines, and it also costs a lot less. In fact,
prices of multifunctions have never been lower. The Canon MultiPass
C5500, capable of printing, copying and scanning in color, has a
street price of under $400. And the Hewlett-Packard OfficeJet 710
color-everything is $499.
</P>
<P>
   Contact List Conversion
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am running Windows 98 and am unable to convert my ACT 4.0
contact list to Microsoft Outlook 98. When I try to import the ACT
contacts into Outlook I receive a fatal error message. What's the
problem, and is there a solution?
</P>
<P>
   A: A fatal error? Maybe one of your contacts dropped dead (just
kidding). It's hard to say what's causing the message, but Outlook
98 doesn't list ACT 4.0 as a program from which it can import data
directly. Don't despair, however, because there is a way around
this nasty little problem. You should be able to export your
contacts from ACT in a text-only file, which you can then import
into Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   To export from ACT, go to that program's File menu and choose
Data Exchange, then Export. An Export Wizard will appear that will
guide you through the process of creating a text file for
exporting. After you finish, open Outlook, go to the File menu and
choose Import and Export. This will display Outlook's Import and
Export Wizard, which will show how to import the contacts. By the
way, text files can be imported into most personal information
managers as well as spreadsheets and databases.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting Memory
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an HP Pavilion PC that came with a 16-megabyte SDRAM
memory chip. I want to replace that with a chip that holds 64 MB.
My question is, if you replace a memory chip, do you lose
everything in the memory? If so, is there any way to transfer it
from the old chip to the new one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Relax. You don't lose anything because there's nothing to
lose. The main memory chips in a PC only hold information when the
computer is turned on. When it's turned off, they're empty.
Incidentally, if your PC has more than one SDRAM slot, you can add
the new chip without removing the old one. That way, you'll have a
total of 80 megs of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia Notebooks
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am planning to buy a notebook computer to use in producing
multimedia presentations for real estate listings. I'd like to get
the fastest possible computer, but I'm finding that even though one
can buy a desktop PC with a 500 MHz Pentium III chip, the fastest
notebooks only come with 366 MHz Pentium IIs. When will notebooks
with Pentium IIIs be introduced, and do you think it's worth
waiting for them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Intel tells me that Pentium III-based notebooks should start
appearing in the second half of this year. But why wait? A 366 MHz
processor is plenty fast for your presentations. The real key to
your success will be the video system in your new notebook. It's
got to be fast enough to display multimedia images and full-motion
video smoothly. If I were buying a 366 Pentium II notebook I'd look
for one with a 3D-capable system from ATI or NeoMagic.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Don't settle for the frightfully small text that Windows by
default uses for icons, menus and other system elements. You can
change fonts and sizes easily in the Appearance section of the
Display Properties dialog box. To access it, right-click any empty
area of the desktop and choose Properties from the menu that
appears.

ON TELEVISION, A WAR WITH NO PICTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Critic's Notebook) 
(wg) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first images of the destruction done by NATO missiles did
not arrive until late afternoon, and they came prefaced with the
warning that they were from Serbian State Television. The American
commentators on cable who picked up these scenes could not verify
or identify the dramatic scenes of fiery buildings and rubbled
streets. But everyone seemed greatly relieved to have any images at
all.
</P>
<P>
   For much of Wednesday, after the Yugoslav authorities shut down
the facility that Western news organizations had used to transmit
their stories, viewers were tossed back to a pre-satellite era of
television. It was immensely frustrating for both reporters and
viewers: a televised war with no pictures.
</P>
<P>
   What the networks and cable channels called, with slight
variations, ``Crisis in Kosovo,'' had always been a story so
complicated it demanded primer-style features on the order of:
Where is Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing worse for television was a complicated foreign
story with no live action.
</P>
<P>
   When the networks broke into their regular programs just before
2 p.m. to announce that the attacks had begun, they were forced
into the same approach the cable channels had been using for hours.
Reporters in Belgrade and Pristina (the more dangerous of the two
cities, where journalists had been threatened the day before),
talked on the phone while the television screen showed a still
photograph of that correspondent alongside a map marked with his or
her location. The reporters made it clear they were inside
buildings, looking out and using their ears as much as their eyes
to gauge what was happening. ``From our vantage point,'' and ``as
far as we can tell'' became their cautious catchphrases.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Sadler, speaking on CNN from Pristina, reported hearing
``at least three heavy explosions in the last few minutes.'' He
explained that gathering information would be difficult because,
``We have limited access to going out on the streets.'' From
Belgrade, his colleague Christiane Amanpour reported ``two orange
flashes'' outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Though this was disorienting to viewers, so accustomed to
instant images, the reports were also harrowing because the
situation was obviously precarious. On CBS, Allen Pizzey was
reporting by phone from Pristina and saying, ``The lights have just
_ '' when he was cut off mid-sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden silence may have been more heart-stopping than
watching missiles land. ``Allen Pizzey, are you there?'' Dan Rather
asked. He wasn't. The problem turned out to be nothing worse than a
power failure, but it provided a jumpy moment that was
characteristic of the day's tone.
</P>
<P>
   CNN managed to send a brief live nightscope photo of missiles
landing, a shaky video image sent by satellite phone. The
pixillated image turned up on screen looking like a cubist
painting, of geometric shapes in various shades of green with round
balls of light dropping through it.
</P>
<P>
   Then two hours after the attacks had begun, an eternity in
television time, the Serbian images arrived. They were used
immediately, with various degrees of warning.
</P>
<P>
   The network evening news broadcasts used the images, too. The
CBS Evening News was most direct about the limitations on
reporters. Mark Phillips' phone report from Belgrade noted that one
target ``seemed to be the special state security headquarters.''
When Rather led into Pizzey's report he noted it was ``by phone and
with the limited pictures available from Yugoslav government
television.''
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' James Wooten reported from
Belgrade by phone (though that wasn't mentioned). He then appeared
on camera and said the television transmission facility was shut
down, and the only way to get pictures out was by using the
official government facility. He didn't explain how his pictures
were being sent. (An ABC spokesperson explained Wooten had been
sending a story just when the facility was shut earlier in the day;
his was the last American report sent.)
</P>
<P>
   When the networks returned to carry President Clinton's address
in the evening, he was surrounded by symbols associating him with
the image of a fatherly leader: conspicuous behind him were flags,
a bust of Abraham Lincoln, a photo of his daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   But the president explained the Kosovo crisis in more lucid and
human terms than the military analysts had. Like them, he had maps.
Unlike them, he did not merely say that the Serbs had attacked the
ethnic Albanians; he said the Serbs had been ``shelling civilians
and torching their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, he took control of the language and the iconography of
the Kosovo crisis, using television more effectively than it had
been used all day.

 &HT;    Spartans' fire getting its spark from Flint
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apparently, as soon as a child is born in Flint,
Mich., the obstetrician is replaced y the tattooist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Mayor Woodrow Stanley confirmed, newborns ``All get the
tattoo and a basketball along with the name tag.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint's good mayor, of course, was joking. Many of his
constituents wait all the way until puberty before getting their
address inked into their bodies. On Saturday, four of Flint's
finest will lead Michigan State to its first Final Four appearance
in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   They are recognizable in a couple of ways. They will be the ones
making or breaking the Spartans _ Mateen Cleaves, the point man;
Antonio Smith, the leading rebounder; Morris Peterson, the leading
scorer; and Charlie Bell, the starting off-guard. And they all bear
a ``Flint'' tattoo, having turned their biceps into a
chamber-of-commerce billboard.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from that hard-edged town 60 miles north of Detroit, it
is not enough to wear your allegiance on your sleeve. You must wear
it beneath your sleeve as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just our way of representing them,'' said Smith, the
senior forward most responsible for opening the pipeline from Flint
to East Lansing. When he committed to Michigan State, the others
fell in line and followed him. ``A lot of people helped us there,
and it's a way of being thankful for what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tattoo is letting people know we're from Flint and we're
proud of it,'' Cleaves said. ``A lot of people, all they know about
Flint is violence or the plants closing. We want people to know
that there are some positive things about Flint.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of other cities, Flint has its blights. It has ridden
the crests and troughs of the U.S. auto industry, starring in
Michael Moore's biting movie ``Roger &AMP; Me.'' Its streets are
dangerous, its gangs pervasive. As much as anyone among the Flint
Four, Cleaves has experienced the dark side of the place. He used
to wear the initials of a slain friend, a minor drug dealer killed
by police, on the back of his basketball shoes. He has been
confronted by a gun-waving group seeking someone to kill. A stray
bullet is still lodged in the wall of his mother's house, hidden by
a little spackle and paint.
</P>
<P>
   Lest their story gets bogged down in a recital of America's
urban ills, the mayor is quick to remind any audience, ``This is a
feel-good'' story for Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any city would be proud of the positive kind of attention we
are experiencing because of the `Flintstones,''' Stanley said. So
proud is this one that it is planning a city-wide celebration for
the fellas sometime in May.
</P>
<P>
   Folks have taken to the remarkable story of this many young men
coming from the same city of 140,000 who have lifted the Spartans
to their first Final Four since Magic Johnson was a sophomore.
Sparty, the overstuffed Michigan State mascot, has taken to wearing
a faux ``Flint'' tattoo on his terrycloth arm. The pep band
regularly plays ``The Flintstones'' theme song, with new lyrics
applied by students: ``Flintstones. We're the Flintstones. We're
the best ballplayers in his-tor-ee.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint has produced more than its share of notable athletes. The
city brought you Andre Rison. And Roy Marble, ever so briefly a
Hawk. When Bell set the city high school scoring record, he bumped
Glen Rice into second. Antonio Smith's brother, Fernando, is a
defensive lineman with the Jacksonville Jaguars, and cousin Tawana
McDonald is the starting center for the Georgia women's team, which
plays Duke on Friday in the women's Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Its athletic tradition is well known and heavily mined. ``I'm
trying to get (Spartans basketball coach) Tom Izzo voting
privileges.'' Stanley said. ``And to get him to start paying taxes.
He's here enough, looking at players.'' Mayor Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes a group of athletes that grew up together, competed
against each other and arose as one on a resurgent college program.
It has fostered pride in a place where that feeling is heavily
rationed. And bred a closeness that otherwise would be impossible.
The theme of unity runs all through this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a family within a family,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this woman _ she's my sister,'' Peterson's mother,
Valerie, shrieked in the aftermath of Michigan State's regional
final victory against Kentucky. She was embracing Frances Cleaves
at the time. The four mothers travel and room together on the road.
And, for the record, none of the Flintstones' moms are named Betty
or Wilma.
</P>
<P>
   Their children are to basketball what Flint is to the urban
landscape. They are not flashy; even the talented Cleaves is best
at getting others involved. They do the dirty work of defense and
rebounding without complaint. They persevere.
</P>
<P>
   Haughty, powerful Duke might well end the Michigan State run
come Saturday's semis. But the Blue Devils are on notice that Flint
is not impressed. ``The guys at Michigan State have a level of
resiliency similar to that of the people in the community,'' the
mayor said. ``We've been counted out before, and we're still
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke beats a lot of people before the game even starts,'' he
said. ``People give in to the Duke mystique. But if (the Blue
Devils) are waiting on a concession, they're not going to get it
here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Upon further review, coming from Flint might have some
advantages. Certainly, when it was time to burn birthplaces into
skin, four guys from a five-letter Michigan town were grateful they
didn't come from Bloomfield Hills or Sault Ste. Marie.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said on Wednesday night that his
decision to authorize military strikes against Yugoslavia derived
from a single calculation: that acting now would be less risky and
costly than further delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the dangers of acting are far outweighed
by the dangers of not acting,'' Clinton said in a televised address
from the Oval Office on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had been reluctant to commit U.S. forces to the
Balkan conflict and that he acted only when he was certain that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia would respond to nothing
less than a forceful military action that struck at the heart of
his machinery of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a 13-minute address, said that the NATO attacks on
Yugoslav targets were designed both to avert a humanitarian
disaster and to serve American geopolitical interests. He conjured
up images of Balkan concentration camps and killing fields that
offend American moral sensibilities and threaten American values
and interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we and our allies allow this war to continue without
response, President Milosevic would read our hesitation as a
license to kill,'' Clinton said. But he added that American and
NATO credibility were at stake, and even alluded to an American
economic interest in a stable and prosperous Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave the American people a selective lesson in history
and geography, using colorful maps to locate Kosovo and to
dramatize its historical role as the powderkeg of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, will not be contained
within its borders, Clinton warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let a fire burn here in this area,'' the president said, ``and
the flames will spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reviewed the tragic history of Yugoslavia after the
country spun apart in 1989. He said that the West should not repeat
the mistakes it made in Bosnia from 1992-95, allowing a
bloodthirsty campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' to rage for almost
three years without outside intervention. Clinton, as a
presidential candidate in 1992, criticized President George Bush
for failing to act in Bosnia. But once in office, Clinton did not
approve a military response to Serbian slaughter of Bosnian Muslims
until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic only sat down at the peace table after American-led
NATO forces delivered punishing attacks on his forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must apply the same lessons in Kosovo before what happens
in Bosnia happens there, too,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the ingredients for a major war are there: Ancient
grievances, struggling democracies, and in the center of it all, a
dictator in Serbia who has done nothing since the Cold War ended
but start new wars and pour gasoline on the flames of ethnic and
religious division,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   The president glossed over important differences between Bosnia
and Kosovo. Bosnia was an independent republic with a mixed Muslim
and Serbian population that invited Western intervention to halt
Milosevic's effort to drive the Muslims out.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which along with the republic of
Montenegro, are all that remain of the Yugoslav nation that existed
before 1989. Although Kosovo has a large ethnic Albanian majority
and was stripped of its autonomy, it has remained a part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic _ and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who angrily
denounced Wednesday's air strikes _ contend that the United States
and its allies are intervening in a civil war against the wishes of
a sovereign state, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said on Wednesday
evening that Clinton had been presented with a range of unpalatable
choices, from doing nothing to introducing American ground troops
into Kosovo. The alternative he chose _ a limited air campaign _
carries significant risks and only modest prospects of success, but
was better than all the other choices, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been very clear that this is the only choice
among a series of imperfect choices,'' Berger said. ``We came to an
end-state that is not perfect, but compare it to an end-state of
not acting. There would be chaos and catastrophe of both a human
and a strategic kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Berger nor the president directly addressed the question
of what guideposts they had set for measuring the success of the
operation or what NATO and the United States would do if the air
raids did not halt Milosevic's campaign against ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said that Clinton was compelled
to act because American and NATO threats had begun to ring hollow
after months of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you threaten,'' Lieberman said in an interview, ``and the
person you're threatening repeatedly does exactly what you've told
him not to do, then you better act on your threat or you will have
dissipated your own strength. Nobody, not just in the Balkans, but
around the world, will take you seriously. That's the situation we
were in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken at length on Kosovo several times in the past
five days. In addition to the strategic and humanitarian arguments
he made on Wednesday night, he suggested that America has a number
of other interests in peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In a Tuesday address to the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal employees, Clinton asserted that American jobs were
at stake. Instability in central Europe, the president said, could
spread and threaten Europe's prosperity and its large market for
American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if we have learned anything after the Cold War, and our
memories of World War II,'' Clinton said, ``it is that if our
country is going to be prosperous and secure, we need a Europe that
is safe, secure, free, united, a good partner with us for trading,
wealthy enough to buy our products, and someone who will share the
burdens of taking care of the problems of the world.''

   CHICAGO _ William Rupich, a Serbian-American veteran of World
War II who won a Bronze Star, fought back tears Wednesday. The land
of his forebears had been made the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts,'' said Rupich, barely able to speak for a moment, as
he stood in a Serbian-American hall in northwest Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rupich and many Serbian-Americans, some of them recent
immigrants, gathered in anger and sorrow as U.S. jets bombed
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are only fighting for their own land,'' Rupich said,
as he trembled with anger. ``People in America should remember _
during World War II, the Serbs were there for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As a radio, turned up loud, carried accounts of the air strikes,
people came looking for solace and for a chance to express their
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has one of the largest centers of Serbian immigration,
and people here expressed shock over the actions ordered by
President Clinton, even though they had anticipated them fearfully
for days. The telephones rang ceaselessly in the Serbian hall here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threatened, but I never expected this to happen,'' said
Michael Stankovich, a 74-year-old retired accountant who came to
the United States in 1959. ``People are calling and saying they are
so upset.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States had no right to meddle in affairs
halfway around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Ohio or Indiana revolted against the union?'' he said,
saying Serbian leaders were simply trying to keep order in their
land.
</P>
<P>
   People of Serbian descent said bitterly that Clinton's actions
would harm innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Maja Lausevic, 38, who came to Chicago from Yugoslavia just four
months ago, said she was no admirer of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. But she said the hostilities had a much more complex
history than most Americans understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as black and white as they make it sound,'' said Ms.
Lausevic, who sat near a telephone, and waited to call her mother
and brother in Montenegro, which, with Serbia, makes up what
remains of Yugoslavia. ``Kosovo is the land that was sacred to our
country. It's the cradle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pergovich, a lanky 84-year-old who came to the United
States in 1950, said he had only two words to share. ``America _
shame,'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian people turned out for lenten prayer services, some of
them too shaken to talk.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of the world, some people said, the Serbs were being
made to look like monsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the Serbs who are at fault _ why?'' said
Pergovich. ``You must remember, we took the Albanians as
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   The hall here was decorated with posters, some of them nearly a
century old, that hailed the struggle of their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Battle of Kosovo _ June 23, 1916,'' read one poster.
</P>
<P>
   To Pergovich, a retired crane operator, the view of Albanians as
victims was distorted. ``The Albanians chased our people out of
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the hall, a flier was posted advertising a talk by a priest
about reconciling with old foes. ``Love your enemies,'' it read.

FOR ETHICAL LAPSES, VETERANS   HOSPITAL TOLD TO HALT ALL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md.) (rk) 
 By   PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs has for the first time
suspended all research in one of its health care centers, saying
center failed to meet ethical guidelines in human experiments.
</P>
<P>
   After six years of investigations and temporary suspensions, the
hospitals and clinics of the Veterans Affairs of Greater Los
Angeles Health Care System _ including the West Los Angeles
Veterans Affairs Medical Center, one of the nation's largest
research hospitals _ were ordered on Monday to halt all of their
animal and human experiments. The order will go into effect on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The problems mainly involve experiments carried out on veterans
who are mental patients. In some experiments, advocates for the
patients say, subjects in the experiments were deliberately taken
off their medicines and allowed to suffer relapses so that
researchers could study the course of their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In other experiments, the subjects were given drugs that
intentionally made the symptoms worse so that doctors could observe
them as they occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Dean C. Norman, acting chief of staff at the Los Angeles
veterans hospitals, said in a telephone interview that several
managers of research projects would be removed from their jobs and
an interim team would be put in place to correct the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Norman added that ``no patients or animals have been harmed''
and that the failures were breakdowns of administration, not of
patient care.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 researchers are conducting 500 experiments there,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown was ordered by Kenneth W. Kizer, under secretary
for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, who noted that
the hospitals had already been put on probation and that the
management had repeatedly failed to correct the problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Department of Health and Human Services
office in charge of overseeing human experiments officially cut off
all federal funds to the Los Angeles hospitals. Kizer's order also
halted all private funds for the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-page letter on Monday, the Department of Health and
Human Services' Office for the Protection from Research Risks
charged the hospitals with multiple violations, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Failure to include at least one representative to speak for
the experimental subjects on the board that gives ethical approval
for the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Failure over five years to establish a ``data safety
monitoring board'' to oversee events during experimental treatments
as they were going on to assure the safety of particularly
sensitive subjects like those with severe psychiatric disorders.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hospital ethical review board, despite warnings, continued
to approve human experiments when few members of the board were
present and even though insufficient information to decide on the
ethics of the experiments was given to the board members.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the Los Angeles hospitals began in 1993
when federal officials found, among other violations, that proper
informed consent was not obtained from patients in the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   To protect against such problems, hospitals are charged with
establishing review boards that monitor proposed experiments for
abuses, said John F. Feussner, the chief research and development
officer at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is the failure of the Los Angeles hospitals to properly
monitor and report on the sensitive experiments, he said, rather
than any specific abuses of patients, that led to the government's
order to suspend the research this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Adil Shamoo of the University of Maryland, an expert on ethical
issues in psychiatric experiments, said Wednesday that the action
against the Los Angeles hospitals showed that ``levels of concern
on these kinds of experiments have been rising,'' and added,
``People are now seeing some potential harm to patients if these
issues are not taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Feussner, describing the research system as ``an honor system,''
said: ``It requires that responsible officials assure us that their
human and animal studies meet federal policies and my expectations.
In this case, the processes in place do not provide us with that
assurance. I don't have any evidence that harm is taking place, but
I don't have the proper assurance that it isn't, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Feussner added, ``I am unwilling to assume things are fine,
because the costs of being wrong are too high for the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Feussner said it would take 30 to 90 days to correct the
problems initially, but that the Department of Veterans Affairs
expects to monitor the Los Angeles hospitals for at least a year
after new rules and new managers are put in place.

WOMEN SHINE IN `WALK ON THE MOON'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 26 by  NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ Though slight, ``A Walk on the Moon'' is a nicely
detailed family drama disguised as an overheated sexual fling. It's
erotic enough, especially in that female-self-discovery way that
movies like to give meaning to sex with. But the film is much
better whenever people who are stuck with each other are forced to
exhibit mutual respect and understanding.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Directed by actor Tony Goldwyn, inspired by some of writer
Pamela Gray's childhood memories and produced by Dustin Hoffman's
company, this observant, straightforward film is also blessed with
excellent performances and a strong sense of setting.
</P>
<P>
   It's the summer of '69. Men _ as the title indicates _ are on
the moon for the first time. Woodstock's about to erupt a couple of
valleys over. But at Dr. Fogler's Bungalows in the Catskills,
working-class Jewish families from New York City are enjoying
summer vacations in the same way they have for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Kantrowitzes have set up house in one of the semi-rustic
cabins. Youthful Pearl (Diane Lane), her insistently pubescent
daughter Alison (Anna Paquin), her younger son Daniel (Bobby
Boriello) and her slightly psychic mother-in-law Lilian (Tovah
Feldshuh) stay in the woodsy encampment for weeks on end; Pearl's
husband Marty (Liev Schreiber), a TV repairman, tries to make it up
from the city on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl and Marty married in their teens when she got pregnant.
Both gave up pursuing dreams in order to raise their family. Now
Pearl feels like she's really missed out on something, especially
with this space exploration/sex/drugs/rock 'n' roll stuff going on
all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Blouse Man shows up. Dr. Fogler's isolated
lakeside resort is serviced by an assortment of traveling salesmen,
and the guy with the step van full of women's clothing just happens
to be a cute, soft-spoken, hippie-haired free spirit who looks like
Viggo Mortensen. He gently but insistently expresses his interest
in Pearl. With lots of time and not much Marty on her hands, she
lets her imagination wander into territory she's never dared think
about before.
</P>
<P>
   Full moon, rock festival ... you know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   From our sadder-but-wised-up vantage point of the '90s, Pearl's
fling is easy to judge as selfish and irresponsible. Indeed, she
has very little to say in her defense whenever somebody busts her
on it, which reinforces the perception that she just didn't think
things through very well. Yet Lane is such an empathetically
sensuous actress that she invests Pearl with an undeniable
emotional wisdom. This was something she needed to do, no simpler
or more complicated than that.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it, it was the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the plot's main concern is with what the affair is
going to do to Pearl and the squarely upstanding (emphasis on the
square) Marty. And while some of the couple's encounters are
compelling, the really memorable moments are intergenerational,
between mothers, daughters and granddaughters. Feldshuh, Lane and
Paquin play three cussedly determined women, all defined very
differently by their ages and the times they lived through, yet all
equipped with marvelous depths of compassion and forgiveness for
one another.
</P>
<P>
   All you need is love, indeed. ``A Walk on the Moon''
acknowledges that the '60s mantra was a lot easier to chant than it
was to live. But without at least trying to, what's the point of
living?

SERBS CRACK DOWN ON FOREIGN JOURNALISTS COVERING AIR ATTACKS

<P>
   Serbian military authorities on Wednesday cracked down on
foreign journalists who were reporting news of the NATO air strikes
from Yugoslavia, shutting down all television transmission
complexes, threatening a CNN correspondent and his crew in Pristina
and detaining 20 reporters and technicians, including at least six
Americans, in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Milligan of The Boston Globe and William Glauber of The
Baltimore Sun were among those detained by the police on the roof
of a hotel in Belgrade, but were released Wednesday night,
according to their editors. Four CNN crew members were also rounded
up, some television equipment was confiscated, and at least one
local television employee was beaten by police.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, capital of Kosovo province, two American television
correspondents remained Wednesday, Allen Pizzey of CBS News and
Brent Sadler of CNN. Sadler said armed Serbian officials had
slashed the tires of his vehicle and had threatened him and his
crew by holding out two bullets and saying, ``These are for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among American newspapers, The New York Times has a reporter in
Kosovo. The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Knight-Ridder
newspapers and The Baltimore Sun do not. The Associated Press moved
some reporters out of Pristina, but continued to have a half-dozen
there, according to a spokeswoman, Tori Smith.
</P>
<P>
   After the satellite transmission complexes that belong to the
European Broadcasting Union and are used by all six major American
commercial networks were shut down in Belgrade, American television
reports were restricted to footage from the Serbian state network
and correspondents' telephoned reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs shut off all the satellites,'' said the vice
president for news at the Fox News Channel, John Moody. ``Why they
would want do that today is beyond me, because it's the only way
they'd get their side of the story out. But the Serbs are not known
for their PR skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after the bombing began, CNN managed to transmit what it
called ``nightscope'' pictures from Kosovo, using a technology that
allows video to be transmitted over a satellite telephone, but the
greenish, blurred pictures showed little.
</P>
<P>
   The three American broadcast networks and three cable news
networks all had correspondents in Belgrade and in Sokpje,
Macedonia, where refugees were fleeing. NBC News said it had moved
a correspondent, Ron Allen, from Pristina to Belgrade for safety
reasons. Earlier this week, Jim Wooten and Mike Lee of ABC News
also left Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Burns of CNN left Yugoslavia altogether, moving to
Skopje, after Serbian authorities had broadcast a photograph of him
on Yugoslav television with a report that called CNN ``a factory of
lies.'' CNN, unlike most other foreign networks, can be seen in
Yugoslavia on its international service.
</P>
<P>
   With no access to independent information about the air strikes,
many Serbian university students flocked to the most reliable news
source available, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As bombs were exploding near the Belgrade airport, younger Serbs
spent hours on line Wednesday scrolling through Internet-based news
groups and the Web sites of American news media. Late into the
night, many Belgrade University students spent hours holed up in
their homes connecting to friends abroad through e-mail, as well.

ADVERTISING: GROWING IMPORTANCE OF INTERACTIVE OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sign of the growing importance of operations
outside the realm of traditional advertising, three giant agency
companies are expanding in interactive marketing and media
services.
</P>
<P>
   Two, Interpublic Group of Cos. in New York and Grey Advertising
in New York, are adding to their interactive operations with an
alliance and an acquisition. The third, Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago,
is proceeding with the uniting of virtually all its global media
operations at a stand-alone agency, Starcom Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic, the world's No. 3 agency company with estimated
billings of $30 billion, is hooking up with Icon Medialab
International AB in Stockholm, Sweden, the largest independent
Internet services and consulting company in Europe. The alliance,
subject to approval by Icon shareholders at a meeting on April 27,
includes a $20 million investment by Interpublic in exchange for an
initial equity stake in Icon of just under 20 percent. That would
be one of the biggest single investments ever made in cyberspace by
an agency company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for ways to bring more resources to bear on
behalf of clients to craft broad business strategies,'' said Barry
Linsky, senior vice president for planning and development at
Interpublic. ``This is an alignment with the hope of benefits both
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also ``reflects our continued commitment in and
optimism about the importance of this Internet and e-business area
going forward,'' he added. ``We've been active in this going back
to our initial investment in CKS.'' He was referring to a stake
that Interpublic took in 1995 in the company now known as USWeb/CKS
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic has ``become increasingly enamored of alliances of
this sort,'' said Linsky, citing other investments in Internet
specialty agencies like Nicholson New York and Zentropy in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic's investment in Icon, the world's No. 18 interactive
agency according to the trade weekly Adweek's IQ Interactive
Report, would make Interpublic the largest shareholder in Icon, and
Interpublic has a right to increase its stake. Icon was the only
overseas-based agency on the IQ list of the top 50 interactive
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Icon has more than 400 employees at offices in Sweden and nine
other countries, including the United States. It handles accounts
with estimated revenue of $16 million from clients including
Amnesty International, Compaq Computer, Netscape Communications,
Charles Schwab, the Swedish Post Office and Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will make Icon a so-called preferred provider of
interactive services to Interpublic agencies. The first tangible
results of the agreement will come in Norway, where the Icon
operations, recently bolstered by acquisitions, will be merged with
Thunder House, the interactive division of Interpublic's JBR-McCann
unit in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   News of the alliance sent Icon shares climbing almost 5 percent
Wednesday in Stockholm, where they closed at $22.96. Interpublic
shares rose $2.3125 on the New York Stock Exchange to close at
$72.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The Interpublic interactive alliances are in addition to
Internet operations at the worldwide agencies owned by Interpublic,
including Ammirati Puris Lintas and McCann-Erickson World Group.
One, however, is being rocked by defections of top personnel.
</P>
<P>
   APL Digital, the interactive division of Ammirati Puris in New
York, has lost six senior employees just days after the departure
of Brian Cauley, who had been president since the division was
formed in July. Cauley, 39, attributed his resignation to what he
described as differences with top agency managers over the
direction APL Digital should take.
</P>
<P>
   The other executives handed in their resignations on Monday, 10
days after Cauley's departure. They included Mark Avnet, 43,
production and technology director, and Lynn Bolger, 45, media
director, who had been named to head APL Digital on an interim
basis while a successor to Cauley was sought. Also resigning were:
Grant Collier and Evan Lewis, creative directors; Vicky Evans,
executive producer, and Dawn Winchester, vice president and
management supervisor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday if they were joining him in a new interactive
agency venture, Cauley replied that it was ``a good bet.'' Mike
Cargill, a spokesman for Ammirati Puris, said that the agency was
``committed to the digital business,'' adding that ``searches are
under way'' for replacement personnel. APL Digital's clients
include Iridium, Lego Systems and the United Parcel Service of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the other Internet expansion, the Grey Interactive
unit of Grey, the world's No. 9 agency company with estimated
billings of $7.9 billion, acquired majority ownership of Module
Communications Ltd. in London, which specializes in
business-to-business new-media accounts. Financial terms were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Orin Wechsberg, managing director at Grey Interactive, the
fourth-largest Internet agency on the IQ list, said that Grey
Interactive planned to acquire the rest of Module in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive advertising is a combination of ``global strategy
and local execution,'' Wechsberg said. ``You want to plant a stake
in the ground in countries where you have your clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Module will become the third division of Grey Interactive
Services Ltd. in London. The others are Grey Interactive UK and
Grey Interactive TV. Grey Interactive Services will have combined
billings estimated at more than $12 million, out of the Grey
Interactive total of more than $50 million. Clients include
Autobytel.com, Guinness, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Reebok and Shell.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Marks, 33, chairman at Module, will be chairman at Grey
Interactive Services, and Brian Lee, 33, managing director at Grey
Interactive UK, will be chief executive at Grey Interactive
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the media services front, Burnett, the world's No.
13 agency company with estimated billings of $6.6 billion, is
joining competitors like Grey, Interpublic and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.
by consolidating planning and buying operations for television,
radio, print, outdoor, Internet and other media at an autonomous
unit.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of Starcom, expected to be completed by July 31,
comes after Burnett has operated stand-alone media agencies under
the Starcom banner in Australia, Mexico, Thailand and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll admit we're not the first at this,'' said Jack Klues,
44, executive vice president and worldwide media director at
Burnett, who becomes chief executive at Starcom. ``But we're very
confident we'll be highly competitive and ultimately be the best at
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of Starcom as a separate entity was something we
started talking about in fall 1997,'' he added, but it was put
aside to pursue talks with MacManus Group in New York about
combining media operations. When those negotiations ended abruptly
in November, Burnett resumed plans for forming Starcom.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 8,500 Burnett employees worldwide, 1,500 in about 75
countries will become Starcom staff members, said Bob Brennan, 40,
U.S. media director at Burnett, who becomes chief operating officer
at Starcom.
</P>
<P>
   Starcom will handle media services for accounts with billings
estimated at $7.3 billion; the goal is to reach $10 billion in two
years, Brennan said. Current clients include Canon, Coca-Cola,
Kellogg, McDonald's, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Starcom will operate alongside _ and sometimes
compete against _ Motive, the media services unit of Bartle Bogle
Hegarty in London, the creative shop in which Burnett holds a 49
percent stake. Motive will operate as an independent brand; Mark
Cramner, chief executive, will be one of eight members of the
Starcom board.

ELIZABETH HUCKABY, VICE PRINCIPAL DURING ARKANSAS INTEGRATATION, 
 DIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Ark.)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Huckaby, who as a vice principal shepherded nine black
students through the tumultuous integration of Central High School
in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957, died on March 18 in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Huckaby, whose memoir, ``Crisis at Central High,'' inspired
a 1981 television movie recounting the landmark civil rights
confrontation, was 93.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1957, Mrs. Huckaby was about to enter her 28th year
at Central High. A native of Hamburg, Ark., the daughter of a
Presbyterian minister and a graduate of the University of Arkansas,
she was accustomed to the ways of the South. As she remembered it,
``I had never known any black well, except those in household
employ.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she would be trying to shield the first black students at
Central High from intimidation by white students.
</P>
<P>
   As an outgrowth of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation
decision, the Little Rock school board admitted nine blacks to
Central High for the 1957-58 school year. But Gov. Orval E. Faubus
called out the National Guard to prevent their entry. President
Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little
Rock and placed the Arkansas guardsmen under federal control to
insure the black students' admission in the face of mob action.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, 50 boys gathered atop the stairs at the
school's entrance when no troops were in sight and shouted racial
epithets at the blacks as they approached.
</P>
<P>
   Melba Pattillo Beals, in her memoir, ``Warriors Don't Cry''
(Pocket Books, 1994), recalled what happened as she and other black
students were about to retreat:
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice principal Huckaby made her presence known at the bottom
of the stairs. Tiny, erect, and determined, she stood there all
alone between us and our attackers, demanding they leave us alone.
One by one she challenged the leaders, calling them by name,
telling them to get to class or there would be hell to pay. Whether
or not she favored integration, she had a heck of a lot of guts.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-remembered image of the Little Rock events is a
photograph showing a white girl, her face contorted in rage,
screaming at Elizabeth Eckford, a black girl entering the school.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Huckaby, the vice principal for girls and an English
teacher, took the white student to her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, hatred destroys the people who hate,'' Mrs.
Huckaby recalled. ``She shrugged. Well, that was the way she felt,
she said. Wasted breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Huckaby later persuaded Miss Eckford to remain in school
after she came to her office in tears over continuing harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions took their toll on Mrs. Huckaby, who testified at a
June 1958 court hearing: ``I would lie awake at night wondering
what I could do. I had no social life at all because on weekends I
was too tired. I would go out to the country and just sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the nine black students remained through the school
year, and at commencement ceremonies on May 27, 1958, Ernest Green
became the first black graduate of Central High. Mrs. Huckaby
stayed at the school until retiring in 1969. ``Crisis at Central
High'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1980), based on journals
she had kept during the confrontation, was made into a CBS movie
that brought Joanne Woodward an Emmy nomination for her portrayal
of Mrs. Huckaby.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Huckaby is survived by a sister, Clara Doyle, of Danville,
Calif., and a brother, Clifton Paisley, of Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Huckaby, who did not consider herself a social crusader,
would recall having told Daisy Bates of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People in Arkansas that ``since my
field was education, my immediate goal was having the black
children in school as just ordinary children.''
</P>
<P>
   She supported school integration, believing, she said, that ``no
public school system segregated by law on the basis of race is
consistent with democracy.''

 UNDATED: Microsoft proposal.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New York on Wednesday, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft,
said he was eager to settle his company's antitrust case, but he
also heaped scorn on the government's suit.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments on the prospect of a settlement,
Gates said, ``We'd like nothing more than to have this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates then quickly reiterated Microsoft's long-held position
that the government suit seeks to hobble his company's freedom to
innovate _ signaling that he is enthusiastic about a settlement,
only if it can be done on Microsoft's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is engaged in ``ongoing discussions'' with the Justice
Department and the 19 states suing the big software maker, Gates
said. Yet despite the Microsoft proposal, lawyers involved in the
case say, the two sides have not begun negotiations, though they
are expected to talk soon.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are expected to be briefed on Microsoft's offer
in Washington Thursday by the Iowa attorney general, Thomas Miller,
who received the proposal along with the Justice Department. Miller
held a conference call on Tuesday to read the Microsoft proposal to
the 18 other attorneys general involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   When the antitrust trial broke for a lengthy recess on Feb. 26,
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson called both sides into his quarters
and urged them to see if they could find some common ground. Since
then, the issue of whether Microsoft and the government would talk
about settling the case has not been in doubt. To ignore the
judge's advice, legal experts say, would risk antagonizing the
court.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is whether Microsoft and the government will
pursue substantive settlement negotiations, given how far apart the
two sides seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's antitrust division, suggested on Monday that
Microsoft would have to make significant concessions for him to
approve a settlement. ``The Justice Department,'' he said, ``has
always been and remains open to a settlement that fully protects
consumers and assures that similar antitrust violations do not
occur in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates made his comments about settlement talks during an
interview conducted by Sir David Frost before an audience at an
investor conference. Gates said the key principles for Microsoft
were its ``right to innovate'' by adding anything it wants to into
its Windows operating system. ``As long as we can keep those
intact, we'd like to settle this thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials remain skeptical of Gates and his
company's opening salvo in the settlement process. The Microsoft
proposal, they say, contains scant sign of genuine movement on the
company's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what they've given us,'' one official said,
``Microsoft still seems to have a very different sense of this case
than we do.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ All Wednesday morning, Albanian men crowded into
their Bronx clubhouse, chain-smoking and grimly focusing on CNN.
When President Clinton appeared on television to announce that the
NATO bombing of Serbia had begun, they were utterly silent,
seemingly too tense to allow themselves to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``They listened to every word,'' said Isuf Hajrizi, editor of
Illyria, the Albanian-American newspaper. ``When he finished, there
was an outburst. They were shaking each other's hands. They were
throwing cigarettes to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Perlleshi, in nearby Pelham Parkway, had been watching the
president with five or six friends in his real-estate office. When
the bombing was announced, he ran onto the street and began
joyously buttonholing Albanian passersby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `We start bombing!''' he said. ``This makes all
Albanians very very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the New York metropolitan area, Albanians _ recent
immigrants and longtime U.S. residents, mostly from Kosovo _
rejoiced. But their joy and relief is mixed with fear for their
relatives and American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to explain to the rest of the world,'' said Dervish
Ukehaxhaj, a manager of a Belmont bakery, who had a brother and
cousins killed. Referring to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
he added: ``Negotiations is a big joke to him. He massacres women
and children. Now it is time to punish him.''
</P>
<P>
   Subduing Milosevic and his army is crucial to prevent
hostilities from spreading throughout Europe, said Joseph
DioGuardia, a former congressman who now lobbies in Washinghton for
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. ``We are right in the nick of time _ I
hope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Milosevic revoked the autonomy of Kosovo in 1989,
expatriates in Europe and America have supported their countrymen.
but in the last year, as the violence flared, donations have
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian immigrants in New York have been behaving like people
in mourning. The parties and big weddings with traditional music
and dancing have been canceled. There were traditional wakes to
mourn slain relatives every weekend throughout the summer and fall
at various Albanian clubhouses _ so many that finally even they
were stopped.
</P>
<P>
   When there is peace, there is time to grieve for the dead
properly, said Ismer Mjeku, 38, who started a small business in the
Bronx. But in war there are too many deaths to mourn individually.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Mjeku was among the men in the Belmont
clubhouse focused on the television. ``I hoped,'' he said. ``But
actually it was only hope. I did not believe it. There has been so
much talk but no action. We needed to see action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he continued, ``it is a reality. We can breathe now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hajrizi, the editor, said he had steeled himself for
disappointment. ``There has been so much suffering and complaining
and horror and pain in this community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now in a way, it's wonderful,'' he said. On Wednesday
afternoon, he warned a freelance journalist in Kosovo to be
careful. ``Let them hit us,'' he said, repeating the words of the
journalist. ```If we're killed by friendly NATO fire, at least
we'll die happy.'''

HINGIS BLOWS PAST SCHETT TO MAKE SEMIFINALS OF LIPTON
CHAMPIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Alternately buffeted and bolstered by a
capricious summer breeze on the stadium court Wednesday, top-seeded
Martina Hingis hit her way into the semifinals of the Lipton
Championships with a brisk 6-1, 6-1 dissection of Barbara Schett of
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   While the 20th-ranked Schett, who reached the quarterfinals by
ousting last year's runner-up, Anna Kournikova, did more missing
than hitting in the shifting conditions, Hingis coped like a
chameleon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel from one side like a weight lifter, and from the
other, so easy and loose,'' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, a Swiss teen-ager, used a canny combination of sharply
angled ground strokes and intermittent net rushes to make short
work of Schett. The Lipton's champion in 1997, Hingis was doubly
ambushed here last year by the Williams sisters.
</P>
<P>
   After being worn to a frazzle and needing to save match points
against Serena Williams in the quarterfinals, she was pummeled by
Venus Williams in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Hingis said she would relish the opportunity to test
herself in the semifinals against Serena Williams, who rode a
tour-best 14-match unbeaten streak into her quarterfinal Wednesday
night against Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has won both previous matches against Serena, the younger
Williams sister. But both confrontations happened before Williams
commenced the current tear that has brought her back-to-back
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't fear anyone; I fear God only,'' Serena Williams
said of the prospect of a semifinal against the top-ranked Hingis
and a final against her own sister.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Schett said she didn't fear Hingis either. And she
lived to regret her impertinence. Schett's misplaced confidence
came from a match in Sydney, Australia, in January when she nearly
upended Hingis. But Wednesday afternoon, Hingis allowed her only
two games in 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the problem: I really stepped out on the court and
thought I'm going to beat her,'' Schett said. ``I'll never do that
again, I think, to go out on the court and be sure that I'll beat
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 6-0 against Schett, Hingis took a more respectful approach.
``I took her much more serious than I did in Sydney,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The decidedly one-sided quarterfinal was hustled along by
Schett's six double faults and six dropped service games. ``She
didn't have to do too much today; I think I missed a lot of
shots,'' said Schett, reflecting on 30 unforced errors.
``Especially my serve was really bad, and without a serve, you
can't beat the No. 1, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's draw, 74th-ranked Sebastien Grosjean of France not
only beat the top-seeded player, Carlos Moya of Spain, in the
fourth round, but also cost Moya his new No. 1 ranking. Wednesday,
Grosjean, at 20 the youngest and lowest-ranked player left in the
star-deprived men's field, advanced to his first Lipton semifinal
and first semifinal of 1999 with another, though milder, upset.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing two match points in the 10th game of the second
set, Grosjean dismissed 40th-ranked Dominik Hrbaty, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Frenchman faces the winner of Wednesday night's quarterfinal
between 22nd-ranked Francisco Clavet of Spain and 30th-ranked
Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. In Thursday's other semifinal,
seventh-seeded Richard Krajicek, who drilled Pete Sampras into a
premature exit, will face 14th-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO gave unusual written assurances on
Wednesday to five countries neighboring Serbia that the alliance
would consider any military strikes against them by Belgrade
``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said they had given the assurances after
Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Slovenia and Romania expressed
concern about threats to their safety once NATO warplanes began
bombing Yugoslavia for its refusal to accept a peace settlement in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hungary, which also borders Yugoslavia, had continued to
raise concerns although it formally became a member of the alliance
on March 12, one diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The membership of Hungary means that the allies are bound by
treaty to consider an armed Serbian attack against it as an attack
against them all, and react accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official said Secretary-General Javier Solana wrote to
the other five countries on Wednesday that the allies would also
view any Serbian attack against them ``with the utmost
seriousness.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Solana wrote to the leader of Macedonia, where
10,000 allied soldiers are gathered as the advance guard of a
possible international peacekeeping force for Kosovo, that the
alliance would meet any Serbian attack on those forces with ``an
appropriate response.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Solana's letters had gone out before Yugoslavia
warned Romania, Albania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Macedonia on Tuesday
night not to support NATO bombing raids or the ethnic Albanian
rebels in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Romania's foreign ministry said Romanian and
other diplomats from countries neighboring Yugoslavia were summoned
into the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry in Belgrade on Tuesday night.
Belgrade told the diplomats that it ``expected neighbors to refrain
from taking any direct or indirect part in any action against
Yugoslavia,'' according to Simona Miculescu, the Romanian
spokeswoman, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Belgrade have previously warned both Albania
and Macedonia not to support hostile operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country won't allow its territory to be used in an attack
on any neighboring country, including Yugoslavia, and I think NATO
will accept this,'' Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have given formal assurances that peacekeepers would
go into Kosovo only if the Serbian authorities under Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agree to accept them. Negotiators for
the rebels signed an accord in Paris last week providing for
political autonomy for the province and 28,000 peacekeepers to
enforce it, but Milosevic refused, telling the U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke in Belgrade Tuesday that the peacekeepers would
be one-sided and anti-Serb.
</P>
<P>
   The two million people of Kosovo, which the accord would leave
under Serbian sovereignty for a three-year transition period, are
90 percent of ethnic Albanian origin. Serbia and Montenegro are the
constituent parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia headed by
Milosevic, who abolished political autonomy for Kosovo when he was
president of Serbia 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The five countries Solana wrote to on Wednesday are among the 24
members of the alliance's Partnership for Peace program,
established after the end of the Cold War to promote stability in
relations between Western nations and formerly Communist nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance has repeatedly made clear that the security of
all NATO member states is inseparably linked to that of the partner
countries,'' Solana wrote. ``Your security is of a direct and
material concern to the alliance.''

MICROSOFT MAKES PROPOSAL TO SETTLE ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (This is now a New York Times A1 story.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. made an opening step toward trying to settle its
antitrust battle with the government in a four-page proposal sent
to the Justice Department on Monday, lawyers close to the case said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, described as a ``framework'' by one person close
to the case, suggests easing Microsoft contract restrictions on
personal computer makers, Internet service providers and others in
the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions _ some of which Microsoft has already
loosened under pressure from the industry and the government _
limit manufacturers somewhat in what appears on the first desktop
screen when users turn on their machines or restrict Internet
service providers in the distribution of competing browser
software.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft proposal, according to people who have seen
the document, does not mention any of the broader remedies to
curbing the big software maker's market power that the company's
critics insist are necessary to restore competition in the
industry. Those suggested remedies have included breaking up
Microsoft into separate companies or forcing it to license the
programming code for its industry-standard Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor the Justice Department would comment on
the Microsoft proposal. But Microsoft is likely to contend that it
represents a serious overture that could fundamentally alter its
relationship with personal computer makers, who are the key
distributors of Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal apparently falls well short of the expectations of
both the Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The California attorney general, Bill Lockyer, called the
Microsoft proposal ``a minimalist opening offer that is far from
what anyone in our group would expect to be adequate,'' adding,
``It was a very small offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's antitrust suit accuses Microsoft of repeatedly
using its monopoly in the operating system market to stifle
competition and innovation. During the trial, which began last
October and recessed for a lengthy break in February, the
government alleged that Microsoft thwarted competition by, among
other things, restrictive contracts, giving favored pricing deals
to manufacturers who favor Microsoft software and rewarding them
with marketing funds.
</P>
<P>
   The remedies in any settlement, the government says, must insure
greater openness, or ``transparency,'' and be enforceable. That is
why Microsoft pricing pacts with personal computer makers and its
marketing development agreements have been a focus of the trial,
and why forcing Microsoft to publish its price lists and open up
its marketing contracts to scrutiny have been among the remedies
they have sought.
</P>
<P>
   In its document, Microsoft has not offered to publish price
lists or open its marketing agreements to third-party monitoring,
said a person who has seen the Microsoft proposal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Wednesday, Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft,
said he was eager to settle his company's antitrust case, but he
also heaped scorn on the government's suit.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments on the prospect of a settlement,
Gates said, ``We'd like nothing more than to have this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates then quickly reiterated Microsoft's long-held position
that the government suit seeks to hobble his company's freedom to
innovate _ signaling that he is enthusiastic about a settlement,
only if it can be done on Microsoft's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is engaged in ``ongoing discussions'' with the Justice
Department and the 19 states suing the big software maker, Gates
said. Yet despite the Microsoft proposal, lawyers involved in the
case say, the two sides have not begun negotiations, though they
are expected to talk soon.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are expected to be briefed on Microsoft's offer
in Washington Thursday by the Iowa attorney general, Thomas Miller,
who received the proposal along with the Justice Department. Miller
held a conference call on Tuesday to read the Microsoft proposal to
the 18 other attorneys general involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   When the antitrust trial broke for a lengthy recess on Feb. 26,
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson called both sides into his quarters
and urged them to see if they could find some common ground. Since
then, the issue of whether Microsoft and the government would talk
about settling the case has not been in doubt. To ignore the
judge's advice, legal experts say, would risk antagonizing the
court.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is whether Microsoft and the government will
pursue substantive settlement negotiations, given how far apart the
two sides seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the
Justice Department's antitrust division, suggested on Monday that
Microsoft would have to make significant concessions for him to
approve a settlement. ``The Justice Department,'' he said, ``has
always been and remains open to a settlement that fully protects
consumers and assures that similar antitrust violations do not
occur in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates made his comments about settlement talks during an
interview conducted by Sir David Frost before an audience at an
investor conference. Gates said the key principles for Microsoft
were its ``right to innovate'' by adding anything it wants to into
its Windows operating system. ``As long as we can keep those
intact, we'd like to settle this thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials remain skeptical of Gates and his
company's opening salvo in the settlement process. The Microsoft
proposal, they say, contains scant sign of genuine movement on the
company's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what they've given us,'' one official said,
``Microsoft still seems to have a very different sense of this case
than we do.''

 ECONOMIC SCENE: REGULATOR TRIUMPHANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story of triumph by a government regulator, a triumph
so unusual that every side praises the agency _ the New York State
Public Service Commission _ and points to its procedures as an
enviable model for states nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 promised consumers the
benefit of competition. Subject to rules that would be written by
the Federal Communications Commission and negotiations with state
regulators, the legislation would require local Bell companies to
rent their wires, switches and phone services to competitors like
AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom and Sprint so that they could enter the market
for local service. In return, the Bell companies would be permitted
to offer long-distance service. The FCC issued rules, but many were
set aside by the courts, leaving the states to negotiate in a legal
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, negotiations bogged down as Bell Atlantic declared
its systems ready to accommodate competition and rivals disagreed.
But in the last 18 months, the commission has broken the logjam. It
has won praise for putting politics on hold, overseeing a
technically sophisticated staff and, most novel, sending squabbling
lawyers to the sideline while the engineers and other technicians
took over the task of solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's basic challenge was to set rules by which
customers could switch their local service from Bell Atlantic to,
say, AT&AMP;T purely by having AT&AMP;T's computers talk to Bell
Atlantic's. The goal was to cut as many people as possible out of
the process to reduce mistakes and eliminate opportunities for Bell
Atlantic to sabotage efforts by competitors to lure away customers.
</P>
<P>
   The first key decision the commission took was to set up a
``collaborative'' process in the fall of 1997 for resolving
technical disputes. Technicians from all sides were called to
testify before administrative law judges. The lawyers were pushed
aside. The process worked because technicians, confronted by claims
that their systems did not work, wrote better software rather than
engage in legal histrionics.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the commission struck a clever deal in April with Bell
Atlantic that guaranteed the company would relinquish its choke
hold over local service no matter how the Supreme Court settled
challenges to the Telecommunications Act. The commission in turn
agreed to support Bell Atlantic's Federal application to enter
long-distance service if Bell Atlantic could meet its commitments,
including passing a test of its support systems. The test would be
designed and evaluated by a third party, KPMG Peat Marwick.
</P>
<P>
   Under the test, Bell Atlantic's computer systems had to perform
hundreds of tasks involved in switching customers to another phone
company. For example, competitors would need to tap Bell Atlantic
records to find out what services a customer used. Until the test
began, Bell Atlantic contended that its software was up to the
task. But now, seven months into a test that was supposed to take
only about six weeks, Bell Atlantic's systems have failed more than
40 times. The problem, Stephen Minnig, a senior manager at KPMG,
said, ``reflects the complexity of the task _ a complexity that no
one anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides identifying glitches, the test has also ``eliminated the
finger-pointing, basing decisions on evidence and not paper
debates,'' said Harry Davidow of AT&AMP;T. Davidow, chief regulatory
counsel for AT&AMP;T in New York, said the test also turned Bell
Atlantic's incentives upside down. ``It no longer made sense for
them to try to win by papering over their system deficiencies in
reports to the commission. Now their only recourse was to fix their
systems to the satisfaction of KPMG.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending $15 million so far on the test, Bell Atlantic
has not yet fixed dozens of glitches KPMG identified. Some rivals
worry that the commission will declare victory for Bell Atlantic
before every one is resolved or before Bell Atlantic has satisfied
other conditions set out in the Telecommunications Act that are not
included in the KPMG test.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bell Atlantic and its competitors remain deeply
suspicious of each other, none has criticized the commission. MCI
Worldcom cited the commission's record as one reason it has
announced plans for aggressive marketing of local phone service in
the state. And Minnig said KPMG had been under ``no pressure except
to do the test right.'' John Rubino of the commission staff
dismisses fears that the agency will change course, vowing that the
KPMG test will not be over until all the glitches are
``appropriately resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Bell Atlantic will pass the test not because it pressured
the commission, its staff or KPMG, but because it will have
painstakingly repaired every glitch. That may not happen this month
or next. But approval will almost certainly come soon, making Bell
Atlantic the first Bell company into the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Crotty, regional president of Bell Atlantic, said the ``end
result will be customers who know that there has been an exhaustive
process that will lead to a bulletproof conclusion that the market
is irreversibly open to competition.''

 &HT;    Man who pointed pistol at coach given high bail
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A North Palm Beach attorney accused of
pointing a gun at a Little League coach remained in jail after a
court hearing Wednesday to establish his bail.
</P>
<P>
   John Skrandel was arrested Sunday on charges that he attacked
the coach in an argument over the use of a batting cage at Osborne
Park. The coach, Mike Adams, told police he asked Skrandel to move
to another batting cage so his Little League team could use a
larger one. Skrandel refused, court records say, and attacked Adams
with a baseball bat. Adams fended off the blow and stripped the bat
from Skrandel's hands, so Skrandel grabbed a Glock 40 handgun from
a duffel bag and held the gun to Adams' face for about five
minutes, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A county judge Monday ordered Skrandel held without bail until
he could undergo psychiatric evaluation. Wednesday, Judge Paul O.
Moyle reviewed and sealed the evaluation and heard arguments from
attorneys before setting Skrandel's bail at $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The aggravated assault charge Skrandel faces generally carries a
bail of $3,000, Moyle said. Assistant State Attorney Rick Penalta
successfully argued for a higher bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts themselves warrant that he's a danger to the
community,'' Penalta said.
</P>
<P>
   Skrandel is represented by the public defender's office because
he proved that he could not afford his own lawyer, Moyle said.
Skrandel, 28, has been a lawyer for about two years.

 &HT;    Bahamian officials dismiss rumors of another sunken ship of
refugees
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Radio waves crackled again Wednesday
with gruesome news from Haiti: A sailboat loaded with hundreds of
refugees had sunk last week, casting its human cargo into Bahamian
waters.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, relief followed as Bahamian officials denied the
initial report.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamians confirmed they rescued 119 people from a sailboat
Saturday, but said none was injured and no passengers were missing.
The boat was discovered beached on Castle Island on the southern
tip of the Acklins, not drifting in open seas, they said.
</P>
<P>
   If another boat had gone down, carrying 300 as reported by a
radio station on Haiti's north coast, surely some evidence _
debris, clothes, a body _ would have washed ashore, Bahamian
officials speculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have it mixed up,'' said Samuel Moss, head of
enforcement for the Bahamas Department of Immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Etincelle reported Wednesday that a 40-foot boat set sail
from Port-de-Paix and went down Saturday when it began taking on
water. The station said a survivor claimed that panicked passengers
jumped overboard and eventually two passing Bahamian boats rescued
100 off Cat Island, just south of Eleuthera, and returned them to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   But Haitian and Bahamian officials doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Island, fenced on the east by a chain of small cays and
Exuma Sound, is far from the usual refugee route, Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   The 119 refugees discovered Saturday were also aboard a 40-foot
wooden sloop. Defense forces discovered it after receiving a tip
from the U.S. Coast Guard office in Nassau, and turned its
passengers over to immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, as was reported to us, there were no
casualties,'' said Sub-Lt. Darrin Hensfield. ``We have no knowledge
of the other incident.''
</P>
<P>
   When word reached the United States, Daniella Henry, director of
the Haitian Community Center in Delray Beach, called the Haitian
Consul in Miami to verify the report. Lesly Jacques, station
manager for Radio Haiti Amerique Internationale, tried contacting
sources in Port-Au-Prince. Neither was able to confirm the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus far, it's rumors,'' said Jean-Gabriel Augustin, Haiti's
consul in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report _ coupled with a March 6 rescue of three men
30 miles off Palm Beach that remains clouded by contradictions _
shows the difficulty in pinning down information about people
fleeing in secrecy, on uncharted courses across hundreds of miles
of open water. While U.S. Border Patrol and Bahamian immigration
officials can estimate the number they catch, no one is able to say
how many slip through or perish trying. The Associated Press
contributed to this story.

NTSB: RUDDER SYSTEM, NOT PILOT ERROR, CAUSED 737 CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Va. _ Rejecting Boeing's claims of pilot error, the
National Transportation Safety Board Wednesday blamed the rudder
system of the Boeing 737 for the Sept. 8, 1994, crash near
Pittsburgh that killed 132 people.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted 4-0 that the probable cause of the crash was a
stuck valve that caused the rudder of the Renton, Wash.-built plane
to turn in a direction opposite that commanded by the pilot,
rolling the jetliner over and slamming it into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the board also pointed to a rudder reversal as the
probable cause of the crash of United Flight Flight 585 in 1991.
That Boeing 737 rolled over and dived into the ground while on its
final approach to the Colorado Springs airport. All 25 people on
board the jet were killed. The safety board had ruled in 1992 that
there was insufficient evidence to determine if a rudder
malfunction caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Though it blamed the Boeing jet for both crashes, the safety
board accepted Boeing's contention that improvements already under
way on most of the older 737s still flying, or the new design in
the latest generation of the world's most popular commercial jet,
would prevent a repeat of the ``rudder reversal'' problem that
caused the Pittsburgh crash.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the board asked the company and the Federal Aviation
Administration for further design review of the rudder system,
saying it could malfunction in other ways that might jeopardize the
flying public.
</P>
<P>
   The board recommended that the FAA order 10 safety changes, and
study more modifications than those that have already begun on the
737 rudder system, as well as immediate improvements to pilot
training and flight data recorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of improvements that have been made to the
rudder system that are in the process now of being installed on the
737 fleet, both in this country and worldwide, and I think those
are obviously important improvements and will provide a safer
system,'' said NTSB Chairman Jim Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, (because of) the long history of the type of flight
control problems with the rudder ... the government, and Boeing as
well, owe it to the flying public to take a comprehensive look
again to satisfy themselves that this system is entirely safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials until Wednesday had tried to blame the USAir
crash on pilot error. But after the close of the hearing, a Boeing
vice president said the company accepted the NTSB's finding that
the crash was likely caused by a mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30-year history of the Boeing 737, there are five
recorded cases in which planes have experienced rudder reversal,
according to the NTSB. Board investigators blamed rudder reversal
for the United and USAir crashes, as well as a non-fatal incident
involving Eastwind Flight 517 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The rudder reversal phenomenon also is suspected in two other
incidents, the board said. In 1992, a United Airlines pilot
performing a preflight control check on a 737 in Chicago found the
rudder pedal jammed and returned the plane to the gate. And the
NTSB suspects rudder reversal may have caused the 1994 crash of a
Sahara India 737 in New Delhi, in which eight people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the safety agencies believe further rudder reversals
will be prevented by a change in the hydraulic valve system that
controls the rudder. As of March 1, that change had been made in
484 of the 1,025 older-model 737s flying in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have completely eliminated any possibility of a reversal,''
said Charles Higgins, Boeing vice president of airplane safety and
airworthiness. ``There is no mode that we're aware of today that
could possibly lead the rudder to reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said Boeing would now ``do everything we can to look at
the 737 rudder system and see if there's any additional improvement
that can be made.'' He said Boeing would cooperate with a new
government investigation of the rudder, and he said Boeing accepts
the safety board's recommendations and findings.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board did not call for specific changes to the design
of the trouble-plagued rudder system, instead opting to call for
the creation of a new board to study potential failures of the
rudder.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board urged the FAA to ``require that all existing
and future 737s have a reliably redundant rudder actuation
system,'' and noted pointedly that it believes, contrary to the
position of Boeing and the FAA, that the current rudder system ``is
not reliably redundant.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the NTSB wants Boeing's 737 fleet to contain a
backup method for pilots to control the rudder should the power
control unit fail. Boeing and the FAA have insisted that the
current system includes backups and have resisted a costly redesign
of the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   A top FAA official was noncommittal about whether the agency
will follow the NTSB's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   FAA Associate Administrator Thomas McSweeny said ``reliably
redundant'' needs further definition. Backup systems already are
included in Boeing's redesigned rudder control system, he said, and
pilots have the option of switching to a standby rudder should the
primary control fail.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, McSweeny said, the FAA needs more data on the
rudder problem before ordering a fix. The agency recently
established a review board to take another look at the Boeing 737.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA now has to sit down with the National Transportation
Safety Board and determine ``what data, what evidence do they have
that says more changes have to be made,'' McSweeny said. ``Without
the data telling you where you're going, you won't know if you ever
got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rudder concerns, the safety board, the FAA and
Boeing all insisted that they believe the 737 is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This airplane has a long and enviable and admirable record,
both of reliability and safety,'' said safety board member George
Black Jr. ``I fly on them, my family flies on them, and I don't
have any hesitancy in that. ... We've been focusing on failures
here, (but) there's an awful lot of successful flights out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other key recommendations by the NTSB to the FAA:
</P>
<P>
   _ Improve training to ensure that pilots practice how to regain
control of an airplane if the rudder jams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require that certain plane maneuvers be conducted at higher
speeds to prevent a rare situation in which, at low speeds, pilots
can't use the wheel to control the plane.
</P>
<P>
   _ Install better flight data recorder systems on all 737s to
provide more kinds of information and more frequent information
that would help investigators understand not only what goes wrong
during crashes, but how airplanes respond to normal conditions.
Among the data recorded by the new devices would be information
about how pilots use rudder pedals.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the crash victims praised both the NTSB findings
and its recommendations. They broke into applause when the board
called for more sophisticated flight data recorders that would make
it easier for investigators to determine crash causes, and spare
others years of emotional turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hanley, 35, of Chesapeake, Va., wept after the board
announced its finding. Hanley, whose wife, Sarah, was a USAir
flight attendant, embraced Ernest Germano, brother of the pilot of
USAir Flight 427.
</P>
<P>
   Germano said the findings, which rejected pilot error as a
cause, vindicated his brother, Peter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to us,'' said Germano, 47, of Elmira, N.Y. ``We
knew all along how he trained himself, how he prepared himself. We
knew he ... was doing the job that needed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley said the safety board and its investigators had done
their job, too, although he expressed skepticism at whether the FAA
would follow the safety board's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley also spoke bitterly of Boeing and its refusal to accept
blame for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope their stock goes down,'' he said. ``I hope it drops as
fast as (USAir) 427.'' (It closed up 3/16 at 34 5/16 Wednesday.)
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' union also praised the safety board's actions. Capt.
John Cox, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, said the
investigation was an example ``of the system as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the board's right on track,'' he said. ``We're able
to fly the plane safely today, and in the future there's design
improvements that can be made, and should be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox stressed that pilots believe in the underlying safety of the
737, the most widely used commercial plane in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew (737s) for 15 years,'' Cox said. ``I flew in here on a
737 and I'm going to fly out of here on a 737. I have absolute
confidence in the safety of the airplane.''

 &HT;    Bush hopes brisk campaign fund-raising will be enough to skip
taxpayer funds
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush, charting a White House course
nobody has successfully navigated, is trying to amass a campaign
war chest large enough to let him forgo taxpayer funds _ and
spending limits _ in his bid for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Since the public financing system began in 1976, standard
operating procedure for major presidential candidates has been to
take the matching money and run.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strategy, dependent on being able to raise money at a
brisk pace, is sparked largely by Steve Forbes, the only major
contender in recent years to eschew the government matching funds
while seeking nomination. But Forbes, a billionaire businessman,
did it by digging into his own deep pockets in 1996, not by raising
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush _ wealthy, but not in Forbes' league _ will try to raise
the more than $45 million in campaign contributions it would take
to be able to skip the federal funds. Forbes again will skip the
government money next year and not have to abide by the spending
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of facing an aggressive, well-funded opponent
unrestrained by spending limits concerns the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and his team, for fear of setting goals that could
prove tough to hit, do not talk publicly about a fund-raising
target. But it is discussed in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a goal that we are all actively working toward,''
Connecticut GOP Chairman Chris DePino, who met with Bush last month
and is now raising money for the presidential campaign, said of the
effort to avoid federal funds. ``He talked about the restraints of
taking federal money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to sit back like Bob Dole unfortunately had
to do and watch Al Gore and the spinmasters decimate our
candidate,'' DePino said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, philosophically opposed to public financing of political
campaigns and rich enough to put his money where his philosophy is,
ran on his own dimes, $37 million worth of them in 1996. By doing
so, he avoided the strings that come with the federal money,
including state-by-state and overall spending limits that can
hamstring a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who raised $31.2 million for the 1996 primaries, ran into
a fiscal brick wall in the months after he clinched the GOP
presidential nomination. He was tapped out after being forced to
reply to Forbes' high-dollar, aggressive ad campaigns in Iowa and
New Hampshire. In Iowa, Forbes spent nearly $10 million.
Republicans in the field who took federal money were limited to
about 10 percent of that.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Forbes spent over $5 million. His opponents
were capped at $600,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bush has left open the possibility of skipping the
federal funds, but dismissed the question by saying ``it's too
early to make any of those tactical decisions.'' The decision
probably has to be made by mid-October so the federal money could
flow shortly after New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, spokeswoman for Bush's presidential exploratory
committee, said Wednesday that avoiding spending limits is the best
reason to pass on the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee has discussed the possibility of not taking
matching funds,'' she said. ``It will be some time before we see
how the fund-raising numbers look so we can begin to seriously
consider that option.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to escaping spending limits, a candidate who does
not take the government funds is free from federal audits that
scrutinize spending, and a $50,000 limit on contributions to his or
her own campaign. Bush has given no hint of planning to pump a
sizeable sum of personal money into the race.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether to take the matching money is limited to
the primaries. Once nominated, all candidates take the money for
the general election, though Forbes might not if he gets the nod.
</P>
<P>
   The federal money, estimated at up to $16 million for qualified
primary candidates next year, matches up to 25 percent of
individual donations, which are limited to $1,000. There is no
match for contributions from political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   The money comes from taxpayers who sign the $3 checkoff box on
their income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown University government Professor Clyde Wilcox, a
campaign finance expert, said Bush should be eager to avoid
repeating the Dole scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he buys is avoiding the spending limit,'' Wilcox said of
forgoing federal funds. ``Dole got pounded by Forbes in October and
November before the campaign started and he had to spend a lot of
money answering those ads. By the time he clinched the nomination
in April, he had pretty much spent all the money he was allowed to
spend.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilcox said there could be a political cost to not taking
the money if an opponent tries to make the case that Bush ``has
chosen to disregard the normal procedure and wants to raise
unlimited money from wealthy donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Tony Fabrizio, Dole's 1996 pollster, said
it's an easy call, assuming a candidate can do without the
taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would absolutely forgo the matching money,'' Fabrizio told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   That means aggressive fund raising, a task Bush has proven equal
to. Two gubernatorial campaigns (he raised almost $18 million for
last year's re-election victory) and well-heeled family ties
combine to make him a fund-raiser of impressive proportion.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is temporarily handicapped by his promise not to stage
fund-raising events until after the legislative session ends May
31. Though fund raising is underway, there is nothing quite like a
big event, featuring the candidate, to bring in big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Bush is expected to immediately go on the road
after the legislative session to begin appearing at fund-raisers
across the country. The personal appearances are so important that
Bush is likely to schedule some events even in the crucial 20 days
after the session in which bills reach his desk to be signed or
vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a treasure trove of political money, the
anticipation is palpable, according to Rep. Rod Pacheco, the state
Assembly's GOP leader and a Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks that have been supportive of me ask me, `When is
Governor Bush coming to California? ...We want to attend his
fund-raisers,'' Pacheco said after meeting with Bush on Wednesday
at the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is working toward skipping the federal money, other
candidates _ namely Republican Gary Bauer and Democrat Bill Bradley
_ use qualifying for it as a landmark moment. Though it's a
relatively low hurdle to clear _ at least $5,000 raised (with no
more than $250 from any single donor) from each of at least 20
states _ candidates try to use it as a measure of viability.
Bradley and Bauer trumpeted the news when they passed the
qualification standard this month.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous Texas presidential candidates skipped the federal
matching money. In 1980, convinced the spending limits would make
it difficult for him to derail Ronald Reagan, former Texas Gov.
John Connally didn't take federal funds. He wound up spending $12
million and garnering a single delegate to the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Ross Perot poured $60 million of his own money into his
third-party presidential race and skipped the federal funds. In
1996, Perot took $29 million in federal funds and, like in 1992,
failed to get a single electoral vote.

 &HT;    Results of referendum on campaign advertising questioned
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Henrietta lawyer Frank Douthitt never alleged
ballot-box stuffing in his complaints against a Texas State Bar
referendum. But what he alleged in a hearing Wednesday before a
special judge appointed by the Texas Supreme Court was that the
State Bar didn't count all the voters it should have in a
referendum last fall and, in the process, counted more votes than
it should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to make the rules,'' Douthitt said during a
break, ``then we ought to follow them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the devil played Hades with the details.
</P>
<P>
   State Bar President Richard Pena of Austin said Douthitt opposed
referendum proposals that the state's lawyers approved handily.
</P>
<P>
   In the referendum, lawyers approved changes in disciplinary
rules and voted to do away with the ``Not Board Certified''
disclaimer in advertising for attorneys practicing in certain areas
subject to specialty examination and certification.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in the contest over the referendum was whether enough
votes were cast to make the election proper. State law requires at
least 51 percent of the bar's active membership to vote in a
referendum to make it valid. By the state bar's calculation, the
vote drew only a few more than 51 percent of eligible Texas
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Douthitt questioned whether ballots that came in a day after the
declared voting cutoff should have been counted and the integrity
of replacement ballots faxed to lawyers in mass just before the
deadline. The bar's executive director, Tony Alvarado, said a
one-day delay in mailing the ballots triggered the day-later vote
count and that a New York company hired to conduct the voting had
procedures that assured its reliability.

 &HT;    Austin representative targets aging industrial plants
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A coalition of lawmakers, environmentalists and
consumer advocates expressed support Wednesday for proposed state
legislation that would require so-called grandfathered industrial
plants to comply with current limitations on air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would crack down on hundreds of power plants,
chemical factories, refineries and other industrial plants that
have been exempted from anti-pollution laws for nearly 30 years.
The state Legislature exempted existing plants from new pollution
rules when the Texas Clean Air Act became law in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``These facilities could have great-grandchildren by now,'' Rep.
Glen Maxey (D-Austin), the sponsor of the proposal, said at a
Capitol news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The grandfathered plants collectively emit 900,000 tons of air
pollutants, 36 percent of all industrial air pollution in the
state, according to a review of state records by the Environmental
Defense Fund, a nonprofit group. About 1,000 of the state's 2,500
industrial plants are grandfathered. The environmental group found
that a voluntary emissions-reduction program launched by Gov.
George W. Bush had achieved little improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey's bill and a Senate version sponsored by Sen. Gonzalo
Barrientos, D-Austin, face an uphill battle. Competing legislation
has been filed by Rep. Ray Allen, R-Grand Prairie, and Sen. J.E.
``Buster'' Brown, R-Lake Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Allen and Brown measures build on Bush's voluntary approach
and are supported by the governor. Allen's bill, for example, would
encourage cleanup but it stops short of mandating new permits. The
measure would allow companies to establish wildlife preserves or
environmental-education programs instead of trimming emissions, and
it would restrict the public's opportunity to participate in
regulatory proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, said the governor's
approach is already working. More than 50 companies have agreed to
obtain permits for 120 grandfathered plants, for an expected
pollution reduction of 100,000 tons a year, McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   An electric-utility deregulation bill also includes incentives
to reduce power plant emissions. The measure, sponsored by Sen.
David Sibley, R-Waco, would allow utilities to recover their
anti-pollution expenses from ratepayers. The bill has been passed
by the Senate and is awaiting action in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxey-Barrientos legislation is far more comprehensive than
the Allen-Brown or Sibley measures. It would require all
grandfathered plants to obtain new permits under current rules. The
plants would have to install what pollution laws refer to as the
``best available control technology'' to reduce emissions, and the
public would retain full rights to participate in quasi-judicial
proceedings known as contested-case hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Maxey and several co-sponsors said emissions from grandfathered
plants are a particular concern for children, and especially for
minority children. Minority students make up 49 percent of the
school-age population, according to a study by the Sustainable
Energy and Economic Development Coalition and other environmental
groups. But in seven Texas counties violating federal air-quality
standards, 225,000 students attend schools within two miles of
grandfathered plants, and 69 percent of those students are members
of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The grandfathered plants include four in Travis County: the City
of Austin's Decker and Holly power plants; the University of Texas'
power plant; and the Austin White Lime Co.

 &HT;    Texas conservatives oppose to voucher bill, passed
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Peggy Borchert, a Fort Worth mother, paid little
attention two years ago when lawmakers were debating a pilot
voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Borchert made her third trip to the Capitol in as
many months to tell lawmakers why using public money to send
children to private schools _ even as part of a small program _
would be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the government funds, it must regulate,'' said
Borchert, whose daughter attends a private school in Fort Worth.
``This is the first step in government regulation of private
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the voices in the debate over vouchers have
not changed in the four legislative sessions that the issue has
come up. They are the voices of special interests groups. School
groups and teachers organizations have adamantly opposed vouchers,
which they say would drain public schools of money and bright
students. Conservative think tanks and other groups vigorously have
pushed for a voucher pilot, which they say would provide parents
more choices in their children's education and generate competition
for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when the Senate Education Committee passed a bill
to create Texas' first voucher pilot, new voices joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Like Borchert, many newcomers were conservative and Republican.
They were mothers with children in private or home schools. And
like Borchert, they were there to oppose the voucher bill sponsored
by Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, chairman of the Senate Education
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is full of regulation,'' said Michele Quinones, a
Halton City homemaker who accompanied Borchert. ``There will be a
tremendous cost to private schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of two whom she homeschools added: ``They will have
to teach the (public school curriculum), pay for transportation,
offer bilingual and special education. Public schools will lose
money. Private schools will lose their freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bivins' Senate Bill 10 low-income, low-performing students
enrolled in schools in the state's six largest districts would be
eligible for a voucher. Not all students who meet that criteria
would get a voucher, however. Bivins amended the bill so that no
more than 5 percent of a district's enrollment could participate.
Before the cap, about 148,000 students would have been eligible.
Bivins did not know how many would qualify with the 5 percent cap.
</P>
<P>
   The voucher would be worth 80 percent of the state and local
money a school district spends per pupil, or about $4,257 in
Austin. That could be higher or lower, depending on how much a
district spends per student. The remaining 20 percent of tax
dollars would remain behind in the student's public school.
</P>
<P>
   Schools participating in the state-voucher pilot would be
required to enroll all-comers. If a school had more applicants than
spaces, it would conduct a lottery to determine admission.
</P>
<P>
   Private schools _ called ``free schools'' in the bill _ would be
required to test voucher students, using the state achievement
exam, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, and provide free
transportation to some students. The schools would have to accept
the voucher as full payment, even if it did not cover the total
tuition and fees.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bill cleared its first hurdle Wednesday, it faces an
uphill battle in the House, where Democrats opposed to vouchers
control the House Public Education Committee. Its chances also are
uncertain in the full Senate, where Democrats in 1997 blocked a
similar measure from coming to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Other new voices at the hearing came from advocates for students
with disabilities, the Arc of Texas, which for the first time are
opposing vouchers. And some parents and educators of children with
special needs, who were there to support vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son spent six years in the public school system. As of
September of this year, he could not read,'' said Jenni Contreras,
choking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras, of Hurst, told the Senate committee that her son has
a learning disability school officials were not prepared to deal
with. She now pays $4,500 a year to send him to the Phoenix Special
Needs Education school. ``I drove for three hours from Hurst to
tell them about my son. '' I believe in choice,'' Contreras said.
``If the Hurst-Euless-Bedford district did not want to educate my
son, then I should be able to take that money and use it to give my
son the education he deserves.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last December, NFL scouts believed that Akili Smith of Oregon
would be selected near the bottom of the second round, perhaps
60th, in the April 17 draft.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of January, he was projected near the 40th spot.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of February, the projection was near the 15th spot in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing, climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Today? Smith is in Cleveland. The Browns are talking with him,
testing him, peering into his mind and into his eyes, wondering if
they will find a champion. The Browns own the No. 1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to this: Tim Couch of Kentucky and Smith. One of
these two quarterbacks will be the first pick in the draft. Couch
is no surprise. He has been poked and prodded and monitored
throughout his illustrious career. First, in a high school and then
at the state's biggest university in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   But Akili Smith? Oregon? Who?
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the mold. On the rise. Out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has been breaking the mold for a while. He was a minor
league first baseman and outfielder in the Pittsburgh Pirates chain
before he was a college quarterback, a guy who found trouble in
college before peace, who had a hard head before a wise one, who
stammered before becoming loquacious and who tripped over his feet
at quarterback before displaying artistic footwork and a
dart-throwing arm, a 23-year-old who is climbing a personal
mountain in a magical way.
</P>
<P>
   What else from a guy who grew up on Peter Pan Street?
</P>
<P>
   There is a touch about him, an unmistakable charisma, and
something that speaks strength and winner. He grew up in San Diego
and played football in San Diego at the same Lincoln High School as
Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Smith started at quarterback for Oregon for only a season and a
half, including last season, a record-shattering year in which he
threw for 456 yards, and threw two touchdowns and ran for another
against Colorado in the Aloha Bowl. By the time he left Oregon,
whispers abounded _ Akili Smith might be a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing to me those scouts who look at a guy play
and then look at film and then see the competition and still do not
recognize his talent,'' Smith said. ``I got a late start in
college, but, really, and I don't mean it as bragging, but how
could you not look at me and believe that I can't play football?
That my best years are ahead of me?''
</P>
<P>
   That at 6 foot 3 and 225 pounds, he shows moxie at the position
and the nifty footwork, the great arm strength, the touch when he
needs it, the quick release, the long ball and the short ball, the
mobility? The package.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some quarterbacks in this draft who I think can play
a lot of football for a very long time,'' said Tony Dungy, the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers' head coach. ``I see five quarterbacks that
look like first-round picks and five more that are second round and
maybe high third round. The positioning of these quarterbacks could
go up, and so could the dollar figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I had the first pick in this draft, I'd lean toward
Akili Smith,'' Dungy said. ``I like his ball. He throws the ball
like Warren Moon. It's a beautiful ball with more revolution on his
passes than any quarterback I've ever seen. He's a little older
than the regular college quarterback, and I like that experience in
his life, if not at his position. He throws a tight, accurate ball.
He's done a lot of the things against big-time competition in the
Pac-10 that you like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Norv Turner, the Washington Redskins' head coach, said: ``He had
a very good combine and more people paid attention to him after
that. They got in there and did the film work and study and saw
that the film did not lie. You could easily pick him No. 1. It all
comes down to personal preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   For Akili Smith, it all came down to personal choices. And then
rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   Low test scores out of high school in 1993 helped him choose pro
baseball over college football. The Pirates signed him and he spent
a year in the minors in Bradenton, Fla., and then another year in
Erie, Pa. ``I struggled with hitting the off-speed pitch and in the
outfield,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he missed football. So, in 1995, he played football for one
season at Grossmont Junior College near San Diego. ``I was the
No.-1 rated player coming out of junior college,'' Smith said. And
Oregon swiped him.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first few months at Oregon he was arrested in an
assault case _ ``a group of guys followed me and a friend outside
and started a confrontation,'' he said _ and on a DWI. charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was hanging out too much in a new environment,
trying to fit in and learn, and what I needed to do was stay in and
study and concentrate on my football,'' Smith said. ``Those
incidents, those things woke me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that his father, Ray Sr., is one of his best friends.
His father spent 2{ years in a penitentiary for attempted armed
robbery. Now, his father works as a counselor in San Diego, dealing
with troubled youth and gangs. His father also is a minister who
has long shared his life with his son and has long challenged him
to make wiser decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me about things, but some things I had to see for
myself,'' Smith said. ``I had to grow. And I have. The scouts now
and the teams, they ask me about these incidents and I tell them
truthfully about them. I talk openly about them, because I'm not
ashamed about having learned some lessons the hard way. I'm more
proud that I learned them completely and that they changed me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed helpful coaching at Oregon, made good friends,
settled in and then blossomed. In 1997, he played 11 games and made
seven starts. Last season, he started all 12 games, leading the
Ducks to an 8-3 record overall and a third-place tie with Southern
California in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   His game grew and grew. Out of the woods. From near complete
obscurity. Smith finished with 3,763 passing yards. He threw 32
touchdown passes and only eight interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkable: 19 starts at Oregon and he could be pro football's
No. 1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm the one-year wonder,'' Smith said, chuckling. ``I
want to go to the NFL and take care of my family and win Super
Bowls and Pro Bowls and then retire and spend time with my family.
Just come and then go.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of obscurity. And then one day, he hopes, after a bright
career, right back into it.

METHODIST MINISTER ACCUSED OF BLESSING SAME-SEX UNION GOES ON
TRIAL

 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For the second time in a year, a United Methodist
Church minister will face an ecclesiastical trial on a charge that
he violated a church law against ministers' officiating at same-sex
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, the Rev. Greg Dell, 53, has been formally charged
with disobedience to Methodism's ``order and discipline'' for
having blessed the union of two men in his church, Broadway United
Methodist Church, here in Chicago last September.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will begin on Thursday, with 13 ministers acting as a
jury and a retired bishop as judge, in a church sanctuary in
suburban Downers Grove. A verdict could come on Saturday.
Conviction could lead to loss of his ministerial credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In its largest sense, the trial illustrates a national
controversy, in both religious and secular spheres, over same-sex
unions. Even while gay men and lesbians have filed lawsuits in
states like Hawaii and Vermont seeking legal recognition of their
unions, the federal government and a majority of states have passed
laws against recognizing the legality of such bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Many religious groups have been wrestling with questions of how
to relate to the gay men and lesbians in their midst. But while
much of the controversy in Protestant denominations has turned on
whether to ordain noncelibate homosexuals as clergy members,
controversy over same-sex unions has become acute lately among the
country's 8.5 million United Methodists, who constitute the
nation's second-largest Protestant denomination, after the Southern
Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this is because the church, whose members include
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Sen.
Bob Dole, is theologically diverse, including liberal and
conservative wings, as well as a broad center. It also lacks a
single, central authority, like the pope, but at the same time does
not permit its congregations the sort of autonomy found within
Jewish synagogue organizations and some other Protestant
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the church's top policy-making body, the General
Conference, voted to place the following sentence in the church's
rule book: ``Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions shall not
be conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted in our
churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the sentence was not inserted among the book's specific
regulations, but in a section detailing advisory stands on issues
like the use of tobacco and alcohol, some questioned whether it was
binding.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, who had blessed the union
of two women at his church in Omaha, was narrowly acquitted in a
church trial after his lawyers argued that the sentence was
advisory. (Creech's bishop did not reappoint him to his pulpit,
however.) In August, the denomination's highest court, the Judicial
Council, ruled that the sentence had the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Dell blessed the union of Karl Reinhardt, 33, a
high school English teacher, and Keith Eccarius, 41, a computer
systems analyst, at a service attended by about 150 people at
Broadway Church. Eccarius had been a member there for eight years.
He and Reinhardt, who met at a Christmas party in 1996, had asked
Dell to officiate at their union a year before the ceremony was
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Within Dell's case some would discern an additional ethical
question. Can a clergy member violate a denominational law if he or
she believes the pastoral care of an individual requires it? Or
does such law-breaking, especially in a highly contentious issue
like this one, threaten the integrity of the institution to which
that clergy member belongs?
</P>
<P>
   Dell, who is married with an adult son, says about 30 percent of
the people in his urban, 181-member congregation are gay men and
lesbians, and it would be discriminatory not to offer them the
ministerial services he provides to heterosexual members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense will be, the only way I can obey the order and
discipline of the denomination is to violate this rule in this
context,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Stephen C. Williams, who has agreed to prosecute
the case for the church's Northern Illinois Conference, said the
issue was one of a minister's being accountable to the vows he took
to uphold church rules. ``He's free to try to change church law,''
Williams said of Dell. ``He's not free to break it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell, who attended Duke University Divinity School with Creech
in the 1960s and remains a friend of his, said he had officiated at
33 same-sex unions since 1981. He does not call them weddings,
because such ceremonies lack legal sanction. Among other clergy
members here, Dell has a reputation as a supporter of liberal
social causes, an inclination he traces to the influence of his
childhood pastor, a Methodist minister in suburban Chicago who
spoke out against racism in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   After the Judicial Council ruled that the pronouncement on
homosexual union had the force of church law, Reinhardt and
Eccarius asked Dell if he still felt he could officiate. Reinhardt
said they would have ``fully understood'' had Dell decided they
needed to find another minister. ``I did it as an act of pastoral
ministry,'' Dell said in the interview. ``I didn't do it to raise
attention to this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Bishop C. Joseph Sprague, head of the Northern
Illinois Conference, filed a complaint against Dell, saying he was
bound as bishop to uphold church law, but also saying he personally
disagreed with the stand against same-sex unions. Sprague has said
he will make no further comment until after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said he saw the trial as a test of ``the nature of
ministry,'' the latitude a clergy member is allowed in working with
a particular congregation.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dell's critics offered a somewhat similar appraisal of
what is involved in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about issues of conscience, both on Greg's side
and the side of others,'' said that critic, the Rev. Scott Field, a
Methodist minister in nearby Naperville, Ill., who also serves on
the board of Good News, an evangelical caucus within the United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Field said he saw a ``collision between moral visions'' in the
case. For Methodists on both sides of the issue, he asked, ``can we
still walk together?''

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: BACK TO BUDGET ROOT CANAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, March 25:
</P>
<P>
   The new era of federal surpluses was supposed to change the
tired dynamics of budget battles in Washington. That was because
there really is enough money to enact some tax cuts, some new
spending and some help for Social Security and Medicare. For now,
however, the Republican congressional leadership appears to prefer
radical tax and spending cuts to reasoned accommodation on the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate budget committees are pushing similar plans
that call for excessive tax cuts and spending reductions while
leaving Medicare's problems unaddressed. Even many Republicans fear
that the party's budget schemes are unwise and unrealistic. They
and like-minded Democrats should reject the budget plans when they
come to a vote on the House and Senate floors this week.
</P>
<P>
   The most positive feature of the Republican proposal is that the
surplus revenue generated by the Social Security payroll tax,
estimated at $1.8 billion in the next 10 years, would be used to
strengthen the retirement system itself. Ideally, this money should
be used to shore up the solvency of the program rather than to
create new individual retirement accounts. In general, however, the
Republican proposal shows a willingness to follow President
Clinton's lead and ``save Social Security first.''
</P>
<P>
   The major problem with the GOP budget is that it takes nearly
all the remaining $800 billion projected budget surplus in the next
decade to finance a whopping tax cut. There would be little if any
money left over for Medicare or for saving myriad other federal
programs from being chopped severely. Moreover, if those budget
forecasts prove optimistic, tax cuts passed this year could lock
the government into more deficits down the line.
</P>
<P>
   It is of course customary for the White House and the Democrats
to cry foul and come up with a list of budget ``horribles'' at this
time of year. But projections presented by Sen. Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, show that so-called discretionary spending would have to
be cut by tens of billions of dollars in order to pay for the tax
cuts and targeted spending increases that Republicans favor for the
military, some school aid and veterans' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are not required to specify where the cuts might
come from at this early stage in the budget process. But if the
last few years are any guide, it is clear what some of these cuts
will have to be. The budget cannot be cut by the amounts that the
Republicans want without Congress going after child and maternal
nutrition programs, aid to farmers and environmental and job safety
enforcement. Administration budget experts say that even the number
of drug enforcement, border patrol and FBI agents will have to be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The job of actually making these cuts will fall to various
appropriations committees later in the year. Right now, these
lawmakers are saying privately that there is no way they will be
able to get such cuts through the Senate, or a House only barely
controlled by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see what is being gained by the Republican
approach. Maybe the leaders figure that an eventual confrontation
with Clinton will lead to a budget accommodation at the end of the
year, saving Republicans from the root-canal instincts of their
budget hawks. Maybe the lawmakers are listening to Republican
presidential candidates like Gov. George Bush of Texas proclaiming
their belief in less government, and they just want to show the
public what that might mean.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion here, however, is that if it means less help for
the poor, the sick and the disabled and less enforcement of labor
and environmental laws, Republicans might find that the public is
less interested than they suppose. The Republican strategy might
end up looking like what it seems to be, a triumph of ideology over
common sense.

NATO FORCES HAMMER MILITARY TARGETS IN YUGOSLAVIA

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S.-led forces pummeled Yugoslav military targets
from the air Wednesday as NATO, launching the first attack in its
50-year history against a sovereign nation, attempted to halt the
fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the initial wave of cruise missiles slammed into
the Balkan nation, including sites near the capital Belgrade,
President Clinton said the raids were required to stop a brutal
assault by the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
against Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo's crisis now is full blown,'' Clinton said in a
statement he read in the White House briefing room. ``And if we do
not act, clearly it will get even worse. Only firmness now can
prevent greater catastrophe later. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the aim of NATO's attack, which was condemned by
Russia as a violation of international law, was to ``seriously
diminish'' Milosevic's military capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In a longer address to the nation Wednesday night from the White
House, Clinton sought anew to convince Americans of the need for
the military operation, including use of a map to illustrate his
view that Kosovo is central to European security.
</P>
<P>
   The military operation was one of the most unorthodox ever
undertaken by NATO, which was established in 1949 as a military
shield for western Europe against the Soviet Union and has been
struggling to demonstrate its relevance in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   The assault came after the Clinton administration and its major
European allies had failed for weeks to get Milosevic to agree to a
cease-fire in Kosovo and the stationing of NATO troops in the
southern Yugoslav province to police the deal. Kosovar Albanians
accepted the proposal during recent talks in France, but Milosevic
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised address before the airstrikes began,
Milosevic said ``the only right decision was to reject foreign
troops on our territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The strikes by dozens of cruise missiles were followed quickly
by bombing raids, including the first use in combat of the $2
billion B-2 stealth bomber. U.S. military sources refused to offer
an initial damage assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military officials said a NATO plane was downed, but
the alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, denied the report.
Western sources said at least one Yugoslav jet, almost certainly a
Soviet-built MiG, was fired on and hit after engaging NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
   The assault included targets in both halves of Yugoslavia _
Serbia and Montenegro _ as well as in Kosovo, the scene of bitter
ethnic fighting for more than a year. Ninety percent of Kosovars
are ethnic Albanians and many seek independence from Yugoslavia, a
move opposed by Milosevic, most of his Serb opposition and even the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin condemned the attacks on fellow
Slavs as ``outright aggression'' and called for an emergency
meeting of the U.N. Security Council, which began late Wednesday
afternoon. Russia withdrew the leader of its mission to NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Russian television shortly before the airstrikes
began, Yeltsin said the attacks will lead to ``a war in Europe, if
not worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian presidents spoke by telephone earlier
Wednesday, and National Security Spokesman David Leavy said Clinton
``reviewed ... the situation on the ground (in Yugoslavia), how
fighting has intensified, how the Serbs are burning villages and
driving people up into the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   China also voiced its objection.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faced heated domestic opposition to the assault, with
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying the president ``views American
pilots, soldiers and sailors as world social workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 58-41 Tuesday to back the airstrikes. On
Wednesday, after raids began, the House voted 424-1 on the narrower
issue of supporting U.S. forces in the military operation.
</P>
<P>
   As the raids continued through the night, officials at Yugoslav
army headquarters said ``more than 20 sites'' had been hit in the
first hour of bombardment. The official Tanjug news agency said the
targets included military housing where the victims included wives
and children of former Yugoslav soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the forces of 11 of the
19 NATO member nations took part in the initial assault. The
alliance earlier this month admitted Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, the first additions from the old Soviet bloc. NATO plans
a 50th anniversary summit next month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our NATO allies unanimously support this action,''Clinton
said. ``The United States must stand with them, and stand against
ethnic violence and atrocity.''
</P>
<P>
   European Union leaders, meeting in Berlin, adopted a statement
that said, ``President Milosevic is fully responsible for what is
going on now.'' The EU leaders said Milosevic could ``stop the
military action by immediately halting his violent action in
Kosovo'' and by accepting the cease-fire and NATO enforcement
troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO mounted airstrikes in 1995 against Serb positions in
Bosnia-Herzegovina that forced Milosevic to the bargaining table
and resulted in the peace deal known as the Dayton accords. U.S.
troops make up part of a NATO force policing the agreement in
Bosnia, another former piece of the old Yugoslavia that began
breaking up on the death of Marshal Tito and the dissolution of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the afternoon statement he read in the White House
press briefing room, acknowledged the risks faced by NATO
personnel, but ``I have concluded that the dangers of acting now
are clearly outweighed by the risks of failing to act _ the risks
that many more innocent people will die or be driven from their
homes by the tens of thousands. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The president outlined U.S. aims:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strikes have three objectives. First, to demonstrate the
seriousness of NATO's opposition to aggression and its support for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, to deter President Milosevic from continuing and
escalating his attacks on helpless civilians by imposing a price
for those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And third, if necessary, to damage Serbia's capacity to wage
war against Kosovo in the future by seriously diminishing its
military capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the alliance had a
``moral duty'' to seek an end to the violence and ``humanitarian
catastrophe'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic to the south of Kosovo,
reopened its border to thousand of fleeing refugees Wednesday after
a one-day closure.

EDITORIAL: DR. KEVORKIAN'S CLIENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, March 25:
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian is learning the hard way that a court of law
is not always a congenial forum for airing a political or moral
position. His blundering attempts to present his own case at his
murder trial are looking more pathetic than crusading. The doctor
is charged with deliberately killing a man by lethal injection in a
macabre case where the key piece of evidence is his own videotape
of the death, broadcast on CBS's ``60 Minutes'' last November.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian has wanted to use his trial to move the public debate
from doctor-assisted suicide, where doctors supply desperately ill
patients with the means to kill themselves, to euthanasia, where
the doctors do the ``mercy killing.'' He taped the death to goad
prosecutors into charging him with it. Now that the case is in
court, allowing his lawyers to speak for him would deprive him of
center stage. But Kevorkian is probably beginning to realize that
the courtroom, bound by the law and rules of evidence, is not very
hospitable to attempts to initiate a moral debate.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, who says he has helped more than 130 people commit
suicide, is charged with first-degree murder for injecting Thomas
Youk, a man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, with a fatal dose
of drugs. The doctor has been tried four times before on
assisted-suicide charges, with three acquittals and one mistrial.
In the earlier cases he rigged up a ``suicide machine'' that
allowed the individuals to administer the drugs themselves, whereas
this time it was he who did the injection.
</P>
<P>
   The outcomes were the same. The people all died through means
provided by the doctor. Yet the legal difference between
Kevorkian's injecting the drugs and an individual's pulling a
string on a Kevorkian-created device is great. In an
assisted-suicide case, for example, Michigan law allows evidence
concerning the patient's suffering to be presented in court,
exerting a powerful impact on jurors reluctant to convict a doctor
for relieving suffering. That is why prosecutors dropped the lesser
charge of assisted suicide this time and stuck with murder alone.
The trial judge has ruled that evidence of suffering is irrelevant
in a murder case and that consent to be killed is not a defense to
murder. That position seems to shut down much of Kevorkian's legal
argument.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor has never appeared particularly concerned about his
lack of legal skills. He seems to yearn for martyrdom. He says he
simply wants to do his duty as a physician. As he argued on ``60
Minutes,'' ``This could never be a crime in any society that deems
itself enlightened.''
</P>
<P>
   He may never be allowed to make that argument directly to the
jury. Faced with this odd case, the jury members could decide that
what Kevorkian did to Youk, however reckless and misguided it was,
still does not feel like murder. Or, given the doctor's bumbling
presentation and the letter of the law, they could convict him.

DODGERS' DECISIONS MAY WAIT UNTIL L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ One lefty or two in the bullpen? Dave Hansen
or Scott Livingstone? Trenidad Hubbard or Jacob Brumfield as the
fifth outfielder?
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point the cuts the Los Angeles Dodgers made in spring
training could have been predicted two months ago _ with the
exception of 21-year-old left-hander Onan Masaoka. Now it's
nitty-gritty time.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process intensifies. The veterans vying for
backup jobs have little leeway. They must perform well to win jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, don't expect much to get resolved before the Dodgers
break camp next Wednesday and head to Los Angeles. Manager Davey
Johnson said the aforementioned questions may not get answered
until late Easter Sunday, after the Dodgers and New York Yankees
conclude the exhibition schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably be a lot of decisions that we take to the
last day,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question is in the bullpen. If the Dodgers remain
status quo with their starting pitchers, lefties Greg Cadaret (0-1,
4.66 ERA), Chris Haney (1-0, 4.09), Pedro Borbon (0-0, 3.00) and
Masaoka (0-0, 1.00) will spend the next 11 days battling for one or
two spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be guessing if I told you who I thought it would be,''
pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``Generally, this club has taken
three or four extra pitchers west for the Angels series, and this
year it's very important to have guys ready because there is no
off-day between (the last exhibition game) and the start of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson said he favors Tripp Cromer and Jose Vizcaino as
middle infielders, Hansen (.216, 1 HR, 4 RBI) and Livingstone
(.414, 2 HR, 7 RBI) are fighting for the backup corner position.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hubbard (.111) returned Wednesday after missing 15
days with a shoulder and thumb injury, the result of an outfield
collision with Hiram Bocachica. During that absence the Dodgers
brought Brumfield up from minor-league camp to play with the
big-league club.
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield, who played for Johnson in Cincinnati, has hit .276
with two homers and three RBI. He also offers speed and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about that,'' Hubbard said. ``You have to be a
surgeon of the situation. All I can control is my playing time. All
I'm doing is planning on getting ready so when (Johnson) calls on
me, I'm ready to hit the lefties.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy does it, big fella: Raul Mondesi got his foot caught under
the fence chasing down a double in the right-field corner in the
fifth inning Wednesday. Mondesi, who saw the ball frequently during
the afternoon, wanted to continue. But Johnson saw enough, getting
his right fielder out of the game before anything else could go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were running him ragged,'' Johnson said. ``I wanted to
get him out of there before they killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster cuts: Four more players were cut from the major-league
roster, including catcher Tim Laker (Simi Valley High). He and
pitcher Jamie Arnold were reassigned to the Dodgers' minor-league
camp. Infielder Adam Riggs and outfielder Kevin Gibbs were optioned
to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Johnson said Todd Hundley is expected to
catch his first Grapefruit League game Friday against Baltimore....
Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, bothered by shin splints, played for
the first time in six days.... Jack Zduriencik, the Dodgers'
special assistant to the general manager/director of international
relations, will be the Dodgers' representative who travels to Cuba
for Sunday's exhibition game with the Baltimore Orioles.

SOME RETURN TO FAMILIES IN HOMELAND UNDER ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE MS ALBA, in the Adriatic Sea _ As NATO fighter jets
streaked overhead on their way to drop the first bombs on
Yugoslavia, a rusted cargo ship slowly slipped anchor in the
Italian port of Bari Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night and headed home.
</P>
<P>
   The Alba's few passengers and much of its crew, most of them
from the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, gathered in a tiny
captain's galley as the ship creaked and swayed in the swells of
the Adriatic. Listening to shortwave radio, they sat stunned at the
news and consumed with worry over family and friends at home, where
bombs and cruise missiles were falling. They were desperate to get
home, and the Alba, a 30-year old freighter, was the only way to
get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us know what we're going home to,'' said the ship's
cook, Borjedar Antonovic, 39. ``All of us are afraid. I just can't
believe this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the galley was a cross-section of Yugoslavia. There
were three high-ranking government officials rushing home to a
homeland under attack, a married couple nervous about the fate of
their three children, a playwright, and a businessman. There was
the ship's mechanic and its first mate.
</P>
<P>
   There were long silences, and some shook their heads in
disbelief that for the first time in 50 years, US and allied forces
had actually attacked another country within Europe. The long
diplomatic game of brinksmanship between the United States and NATO
on one side, and the defiant Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
on the other, had finally come to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe it. I can't believe they bombed us,''
echoed Voin Dukonovic, Yugoslavia's former vice president and now a
trade minister in the Republic of Montenegro who had left a
conference to rush home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people will suffer and Milosevic will get stronger for the
short term,'' he said. ``The Serbs will rally around him, but then
we can only hope people will see the destruction and the
devastation and turn on him. We can only hope this will be the end
of his days.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reports of the bombing crackling over the radio were grim.
The heard that their native Montenegro had been hit hard. The
airport had been bombed. While Slovenia, Bosnia, Macedonia, and
Croatia have deserted the Yugoslav Federation, Montenegro remains
with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   They heard that military installations near the port of Bar, the
ship's destination, had been slammed by cruise missiles fired from
the US Navy's 6th Fleet, which cruised unseen in the same waters as
the slowly chugging freighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they do that? They promised that Montenegro would be
spared,'' said Marian Sekulic, who was traveling with her husband
and had been trying without success all night with a mobile phone
to reach her three children and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has no understanding of this situation,'' she went on.
``They have no understanding of how the Montenegrins have tried to
preserve democracy to improve the economy despite Milosevic. And
still they bomb us as if we are no different than him.''
</P>
<P>
   They were the people lucky enough to get on the ship. With
airports closed and roads the long way around to the north blocked
by troops, dozens of Yugoslavs in the Italian port of Bari had
begged the captain of the ship, which sails under the flag of
Montenegro, to give them passage. But he couldn't take them all.
</P>
<P>
   Marko Taylor, a 38-year old construction worker from Texas, was
one of those who was turned down. He is married to a Yugoslav
woman, and he said he feared for his wife and son. Their home is on
the coast near a Yugoslav army military installation that was
believed to have been hit by NATO. ``I have a wife and kid. They
won't let me on. I have no idea what I'm going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bozo Machailovic, a professor of economics at Montenegro
University, said he had two sons, and he feared they would be
called up for military service in the escalating conflict. He also
feared for a homeland that was in a state of ``economic collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Budimir Dubak, a playwright who is also Yugoslavia's minister of
culture, lit another cigarette and sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad, very sad to see what has happened,'' he said.
``Yugoslavia was a proud, confident place. In the 1970s and 1980s
we held a very important place in European culture. We were
Socialist, but open and free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As artists we have lost so much through the isolation under
Milosevic . . . Now we will go home to the ruins of the bombings,''
he said. ``You have no way of knowing how that makes us feel.''

HIGHER EARNINGS FORSEEN ON COUNTRYWIDE SHARES

   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Countrywide Credit Industries is expected
to report higher earnings for the fourth quarter and year-end than
last year, thanks to 1998's record real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among 16 analysts polled by First Call is that the
earnings report, expected today, will show 85 cents for the quarter
and $3.28 for the year. In the prior year, the nation's largest
independent mortgage lender reported a 74 cents-a-share profit for
the fourth quarter and $2.78 for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   While expectations are optimistic, it's anyone's guess what the
stock will do after the report comes out.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the company reported an 84 cents-per-share profit
for the third quarter, up 22 percent from the year before. It beat
analysts' estimates of 82 cents a share. In the following 12 days,
the stock rose by about $2 to hover in the $50 range. But it has
dropped back to the mid-$30s since then. For the year, Countrywide
is down 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All of which irks Angelo Mozilo, Countrywide's chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he told analysts that the stock is ``horribly
undervalued by any measure'' and should be trading in the $70s.

EDITORIAL: AIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, March 25:
</P>
<P>
   With the start of NATO air and missile attacks on Yugoslavia
Wednesday, the long-running crisis over Kosovo has entered a new,
uncertain and decidedly more dangerous phase. More broadly, the
attacks mark an important watershed for the Atlantic alliance.
While NATO planes attacked Serbian militias in Bosnia a few years
ago, the alliance had never before unleashed its military power
against a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   The air attacks are warranted. Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, has rejected all efforts at meaningful diplomacy and, in
violation of his own previous commitments, has ratcheted up his
military campaign against the innocent civilians of Kosovo. NATO's
aim is to protect those civilians by hobbling the Yugoslav
military, and beyond that, to force Milosevic to accept the
compromise peace plan that already has been accepted by
representatives of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some countries, notably Russia, are uncomfortable with the
idea of NATO action in support of these goals. Washington must
manage the diplomatic side of the conflict carefully, seeking to
minimize strains with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who addressed the American people twice on
Kosovo Wednesday, framed the issues well. While acknowledging the
risks of acting, he pointed to the dangers of not acting, noting
the region's history as a ``powderkeg at the heart of Europe''
whose conflicts previously have exploded into wider war. He rightly
stressed the moral imperative of protecting innocent people against
killings and the destruction of their homes and cited NATO's need
for resolve in halting these atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   In making its stand against Milosevic and his armed forces, NATO
brought formidable air power into play. The alliance has nearly 400
warplanes, half of them American, based within easy flying distance
of Yugoslavia. Destroyers, cruisers and submarines armed with
cruise missiles patrol nearby Mediterranean waters. Many additional
planes and missiles could be made available should a prolonged
bombing campaign prove necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there can be no guarantee that air strikes alone will force
Milosevic to compromise, and no clear consensus on what military or
diplomatic steps to take if air power proves insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the use of cruise missiles and stealth aircraft, there
is a significant risk of NATO planes being shot down by Yugoslav
defenders. Yugoslavia's army is one the largest and toughest in
Europe, equipped with mobile anti-aircraft guns that can be
silenced only by low-flying planes.
</P>
<P>
   These factors point up the need for a steadiness, persistence
and unity from the NATO allies now that the attack has been made.
In theory, the complex ethnic and religious conflicts of Yugoslavia
could have put the unity of the 19-member NATO alliance to a severe
test. In reality, faced with Milosevic's intransigence and
brutality, NATO has found it relatively easy to reach a united
stand. That is encouraging, since it is a reasonable bet that NATO
may again be called on to act against ethnic conflict in Europe in
the years ahead.

CUBA TRIP IS OPPOSED BY CUBANS IN MAJOR LEAGUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's presence in Castro's Cuba could have
become a regular event had world political and military events not
intervened nearly a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Baltimore Orioles' game Sunday against the Cuban
national team will be the first for a major league team in Cuba
since 1959, Bowie Kuhn, then the baseball commissioner, was
prepared to send an all-star team to Havana in 1976. The game could
conceivably have led to a regular series.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Gomez, a Cuban native and former major league manager,
recently recalled the planning for the game, including a meeting
with Cuban officials in Mexico City in 1975 after the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was arranged,'' he said. ``We were going to go
there and play in March of '76. Henry Kissinger approved it. Bowie
Kuhn was going to take a player from each team. Some owners and
general managers were going on the trip. We were going to fly out
of Orlando. There was going to be a big dinner with Castro. Then in
January they found out there were Cuban soldiers in Angola.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years later, the State Department again has
sanctioned a game that could lead to expanded relations between the
two countries, at least in sports. But the Orioles' trip is by no
means popular among Cubans who play or coach in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it; I don't think it's right,'' said Cookie
Rojas, the New York Mets' third-base coach, who was born in Havana
in 1939. ``He's never given anything back. It's just take, take,
take. Where are the human rights, the freedom of the Cuban people?
I haven't been back since 1961. Now I'm 60 years old and I haven't
been able to go to my land. I'd rather die without seeing it and
remember it the way it was when it was free.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Mets players who defected from Cuba, Rey Ordonez and Jorge
Toca, agreed with Rojas. Livan Hernandez of the Florida Marlins
also has spoken out against the game. His half-brother, Orlando, of
the New York Yankees, declined to comment, as did Jose Canseco and
Rolando Arrojo of Tampa Bay and Jose Cardenal, the Yankees'
first-base coach.
</P>
<P>
   The game has disrupted the Orioles' pitching rotation. Juan
Guzman, whose turn it would have been to start Sunday, has opted
not to go to Cuba. He is Dominican, but he lives in Miami among
Cuban Americans and said he did not wan to offend his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Americans have staged protests at Fort Lauderdale Stadium,
where the Orioles play their spring training games. Some members of
Congress have also urged the Orioles not to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, however, eagerly awaited the game. Speaking of the
opposition to it, he said, ``I understand their feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   The game has not aroused any opposition in Cuba. ``If they had
200,000 seats, they would fill the stadium,'' said Gomez, a special
assistant to the Anaheim Angels' general manager, who in 1959
managed the Havana Sugar Kings of the International League. If the
Cuban team should win, he added, ``Cuba will be in an uproar.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban national team has long been the best team in
international tournaments, but it has played amateur teams from
other countries and has never played a team that is considered the
caliber of a U.S. major league team. The Cuban government, whose
leader is the country's No. 1 baseball fan, takes the sport so
seriously that a rare loss, either of a tournament game or a game
to the United States, has triggered a change of managers and sports
officials.
</P>
<P>
   For this game, the Cubans could be at a disadvantage because
they will be using wood bats instead of the aluminum bats they use
during their season. They have used wood bats in their playoffs,
which have reached the championship series, and one U.S. baseball
official said he heard the games have been littered with broken
bats.

AMERICA WEST FLIGHT ATTENDANTS' DEAL FIRST CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The five-year, $80 million contract negotiated by America West
Airlines flight attendants is first class compared with the coach
contract of $53.5 million offered by the carrier nearly 18 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an upgrade from the $68.7 million the company offered
before an impasse was declared by federal mediators in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants released details Wednesday
of the tentative contract, which was settled early Saturday, about
90 minutes after the union was free to strike. Now the rank and
file will vote on whether the latest contract is an improvement
over the deal reached on Halloween 1997 that was rejected by 88
percent of the union members.
</P>
<P>
   AFA Council 66 negotiators have been meeting with America West
in Washington D.C. since Saturday to finalize contract language and
implementation schedules for sections of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming home with an agreement in hand,'' said Scott
Ramsey, AFA Council 66 vice president. ``It's a contract our
members will be proud of because we took on the company, got the
best deal possible and didn't have to risk a single flight
attendant job in a CHAOS strike action.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West will not comment on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want to give an opportunity to the union to review
the contract with its membership,'' company spokeswoman Patty
Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 2,300 flight attendants. The AFA has lowered its
official membership figure from 2,400.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the new annual wage scale will range from $14,400 to
$32,200. Currently, pay ranges from about $12,000 to $22,000. After
42 months, pay will range from $15,200 to $33,800.
</P>
<P>
   The union said it got close to achieving a pay scale that is 90
percent of what Southwest Airlines pays its flight attendants.
Southwest's pay scale ranges from $14,500 to $41,200, according to
the AFA.
</P>
<P>
   The union had initially sought a deal worth $129 million, but
reduced its demands to $85.3 million. It got close to that, but
made concessions on travel expenses or per diem. Flight attendants
wanted $1.80 per hour in per diem, on par with pilots, but settled
for $1.30 per hour. That will increase to $1.50 after 2{ years and
to $1.75 on the final day of the contract, April 30, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants had been earning the equivalent of 89 cents
per hour in per diem under a different system of pay for travel
expenses that will be scrapped if the contract is ratified.
</P>
<P>
   Pay will increase initially from $14.18 per hour to start, to
$16.13, and to $16.93 at the end of the contract. Upon
ratification, top pay will jump from $24.41 per hour to $35.80, and
$37.59 in the fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants are paid only for their flight time, which
they say makes their hourly wages misleading when compared with
most 9-to-5 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to achieve bigger gains on the pay scale, the union
made concessions on the scheduled vs. actual pay. Currently, flight
attendants are paid for the scheduled flight time and aren't
compensated if a flight is late unless it's more than 30 minutes
late. Under the new contract, America West will pay them for the
extra time if the delay exceeds 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a flight is due in at 10 a.m. but arrives at
10:13 a.m., the flight attendants won't get any extra pay. But if
it arrives at 10:18 a.m., they would be paid for 18 extra minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, America West will pay for the extra time on
delays starting at the first minute beyond the scheduled time.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative contract also settles a bonus-pay lawsuit filed by
the union that goes back to 1994 when flight attendants voted to
unionize.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, flight attendants will receive a
signing bonus of $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Further details of the contract will be explained to flight
attendants at road shows in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio,
starting the week of April 5. America West has agreed to print
copies of the contract for each flight attendant and those should
be delivered by April 2, according to the AFA.
</P>
<P>
   It's anybody's guess whether flight attendants will get on board
to support this contract. Initial reactions were favorable, but
union members haven't seen contract details. Still, some Wall
Street analysts predict that flight attendants will ratify the
deal, which has improved the outlook for America West.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel raised his estimate of the
carrier's first quarter earnings per share from 40 cents to 60
cents and the full year from $1.80 per share to $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   The strike threat will cost America West 5 to 10 cents per
share, but increased business from a sickout by American Airlines
pilots boosted earnings an estimated 15 to 20 cents per share,
Engel said in a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he warned that America West could be hurt ``by the
growing industry oversupply and any slowdown in consumer
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the contract will be voted on in a secret mail
ballot. Ballots will be counted April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McGlashen, AFA Council 66 president, said the contract
improves salary and per diem, and gives flight attendants greater
flexibility in their work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   That echoes statements made in 1997 by then-AFA President
Deborah Volpe about the previous tentative contract.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen and his team of negotiators were scheduled to return
to Phoenix at 9 p.m. Wednesday. AFA members were encouraged to meet
the flight wearing their full uniforms, not the bright green CHAOS
strike T-shirts. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A picture frame, usually the final fillip, the last deft
gesture, is many things to many people.
</P>
<P>
   Degas called the frame the reward for the artist. Picasso and
Matisse shopped flea markets for frames, paid the equivalent of $5
for 17th- and 18th-century gilded frames, then made paintings to
fit the frames. Monet, too, liked to see his paintings in
18th-century French frames. ``It meant that people could afford the
frames,'' said Laurence Kanter, curator of the Robert Lehman
Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 20th century, Marsden Hartley and John Marin, who
had little money, bought simple wood frames and painted them to
match their paintings, said Eli Wilner, a custom framer in New
York. In the mid 1950s, some Abstract Expressionists chose a
no-frame look, and in the '70s, thin frames, either metal or wood,
were popular.
</P>
<P>
   Framing a picture can be daunting. There is the wealth of
materials _ the rosy warmth of gilt, the gleam of silver, the charm
of carved wood. Colors are infinite, too, as are prices. But
choosing a frame for an Old Master, a vintage family photo, a quilt
or a snapshot taken yesterday, is really an exercise in visual
thinking. And although framers and curators insist that there are
no rules, the experts can suggest ways to think about framing an
object.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of a frame,'' wrote Nicholas Penny, Clore curator
of Renaissance painting at the National Gallery in London and
author of ``Frames'' (National Gallery Publications, 1997), is to
make a proper impression even when the picture is not looked at
``but simply `taken in' with the silk of a lampshade, the rosewood
of a piano and the porcelain of a teacup.'' A frame has its own
presence _ opulent or unadorned, showy or subtle. Think of it as
the bridge between the art and the interior of the home.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a frame was not a subject for discussion:
it was part and parcel of a painting. Until the 15th century,
artists painted on plaster, stone or wood, where the frame was
integral to the work. When an artist painted on a wood panel, the
frame was attached to the panel, and the entire panel was given to
the artist. In the 15th century, artists began to paint on canvas,
and the frame became detached.
</P>
<P>
   Because frames are so often a matter of fashion, it is a fallacy
to assume that a painting should be matched to a frame of the same
era. Listen to Kanter describe an imagined journey of a Titian
across three centuries: ``If King Philip IV of Spain had it, he put
it in a Spanish frame. If 50 years later, it went to England, it
went into an English frame, and if the Englishman had to sell it to
pay off his debts and sold it to an American millionaire, he'd put
it into a 18th-century French frame.'' Matching a painting with a
period frame is strictly a modern idea, he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes an artist offers framing clues. ``If an artist wants a
particular look _ a steel frame or a width of mat _ you go with
it,'' said Peter Perez, the conservation framer at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York. For a 1997 show at the Staley-Wise Gallery
in New York, David LaChapelle exhibited color photographs of models
in intricately designed, fantastical sets. The narrow wood frames,
painted brilliant shades of pink, red and green, were equally high
voltage. For a show at the gallery in November, his sets will be
simpler, and he has chosen understated chrome frames.
</P>
<P>
   When the artist's intent is unknown or impossible (or too
expensive) to realize, the art, by itself, will begin to speak to
the framer. Consider posters, for example. Perez often uses
aluminum frames, cool and minimal, for new posters, and wood frames
for 19th-century ones. For older posters, welded aluminum is too
shiny, too stark a contrast to paper that has darkened over a
century. For architectural renderings, he would use aluminum for
the drawings of Mies van der Rohe, matching modernism to modernism,
but for Frank Lloyd Wright, whose houses were designed to merge
with nature, he would choose wood.
</P>
<P>
   At J. Pocker &AMP; Son, a New York frame shop whose clients include
interior designers like Keith Irvine and Thomas Fleming, the issue
isn't necessarily the art. ``We talk furniture, furniture,
furniture,'' said firm president Robyn Pocker. ``Empire, Colonial,
Biedermeier.''
</P>
<P>
   If asked to frame a botanical print of a hydrangea for a room
filled with Biedermeier furniture, Ms. Pocker might use bird's-eye
maple veneer with black trim. If the house was Colonial, she might
suggest a blond wood frame.
</P>
<P>
   Once a frame is chosen, there is the question of selecting a
mat, the spacer that separates the art from the frame and from the
glass. ``If moisture gets in under the glass,'' Perez explained,
``art will stick to the glazing, and if the glazing breaks, the
photo is gone.'' A spacer can be nearly invisible, like
1/8-of-an-inch-thick strip of plastic, or it can be prominent, like
a thick, 6-inch-wide paper border. Framers recommend mats of 100
percent rag board made from natural fibers. Acids in chemically
treated paper can leach into artwork and leave brown spots, Ms.
Pocker said.
</P>
<P>
   A mat also gives the art breathing space. Art that goes to the
edge of the frame can look tight and cramped. When a 6-by-6-inch
photograph is surrounded by a 6-inch-wide mat, the photograph
appears to ``float in its own space,'' Ms. Pocker said. If the same
photo was framed with a narrower mat, it might get lost on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But not every picture needs a mat _ and sometimes barely a
frame. At the Museum of Modern Art, Perez stood in front of Roy
Lichtenstein's 10-by-14-foot painting ``Interior With Mobile.'' A
1/2-inch-wide, 3-inch deep, maple L-frame unobtrusively surrounds
it and protects the edges. ``This painting is so big that a strong
frame is superfluous,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about art without the capital A? The gently faded
photograph of grandma and grandpa at their wedding in 1928, the
background sepia toned, the picture frayed at the edges. A baby's
first birthday, the dimpled face smeared with vanilla ice cream and
crumbs of chocolate cake. A three-dimensional object like great
grandma's rosary. A small hand-hooked rug of a horse cavorting in a
meadow.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Malce and Jolie Kelter, antiques dealers who work out of
their house in New York's Greenwich Village, know when an object
needs framing and whether or not to do it professionally (spend
some money) or whimsically (spend a little bit of money). They are
reluctant framers of textiles like rugs and quilts. ``I like quilts
on beds, and I like rugs on floors,'' Malce said. Only when they
are ``very tender,'' as he says _ when it is a matter of wear and
tear _ does he suggest putting textiles on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If a textile is fragile, it should be given to a professional
framer, who also does restoration. The framer will stitch it onto a
piece of fabric, stretch it on a wood frame, and sometimes insert
it in an acrylic vitrine or box designed to filter ultra-violet
rays and protect the textile from dust. A box gives a
three-dimensional object more presence than if it's just hung
against the wall, Ms. Kelter said.
</P>
<P>
   When a collection is family photographs, scattered across
decades and ranging from sepia-toned pictures to Polaroids, Ms.
Kelter likes to connect them by texture. On her mantelpiece, she
has family photos in antique velvet frames, souvenirs of flea
markets. The velvet is slightly worn, purples fading to lavender,

SERBIAN ARMY IS SOPHISTICATED FIGHTING FORCE WITH HIGH MORALE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Iraq, the bombing in December lasted four days.
In Bosnia in 1994, airstrikes took a little more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   But this is neither Iraq nor Bosnia. And in the coming days of
Operation Allied Force, military officials said Wednesday, NATO
should not expect a hasty retreat by the Yugoslav Army, which is
fiercely determined to win and better equipped to shoot down planes
than any force the United States has faced in years.
</P>
<P>
   Intense midair sparring took place almost immediately after the
airstrikes began Wednesday, as NATO jets shot down three Serb
planes, according to a US defense official. Two US planes and a
Dutch F-16 fighter jet were responsible for the scores, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that success, military officials noted the unique
dangers of the Balkan terrain and sought to prepare the public for
the worst. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen stressed at a
briefing that the Serb military has an ``extensive air defense
system.'' Army General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, reiterated, ``There is no such thing as a
risk-free military operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although at this point we have no casualties to US or NATO
forces, we continue to take all measures to reduce the risk to our
pilots and air crews,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the term ``airstrike'' has come to imply
relatively low potential for loss of life, particularly after
repeated successful air raids in Iraq. But in Yugoslavia, where the
defenses against air attacks include more than 150 surface-to-air
missiles and a frequent shield of clouds and fog, air attacks might
face challenges never seen in the deserts around Baghdad. Even
without sending in ground troops, which NATO has insisted it will
not do, this mission could be the most dangerous the organization
has faced, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian ``air defense system is both more mobile and more
practiced than anything the Iraqis have been able to mount,'' said
retired Army Colonel Dan Smith, now an analyst in Washington. ``For
low-flying aircraft, there is a much greater possibility of being
brought down. So it's a very difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, NATO forces are devoting the first part of the
mission to destroying Serbian antiaircraft equipment, clearing the
way for lower-flying planes to follow up in the days to come. Their
targets are formidable, say military officials: at least two dozen
SA-6 surface-to-air missile systems scattered over Yugoslavia, as
well as another three dozen less sophisticated SA-2 and SA-3
antiaircraft batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The antiaircraft batteries, produced in the former Soviet Union
and East Germany, are more capable than anything Air Force fighters
faced in Iraq, analysts said. Each can hold between 15 and 30
missiles, and many of them are mobile, creating a sea of movable
targets that NATO planes could have a difficult time dodging or
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Serb soldiers are also equipped with hundreds of
shoulder-launched air defense missiles. In the air, analysts said,
the Yugoslav military has about 15,000 troops prepared to fly about
780 planes, although analysts say only a dozen of those jets are as
sophisticated as the US jets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yugoslav troops, despite a steady state of war in
the Balkans, have not seen their equipment decimated as Saddam
Hussein has in Iraq. Any comparison to Operation Desert Fox in 1998
is ``completely erroneous,'' said one military analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pfaltzgraff, a professor of international security at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, agreed
and said this is ``different in a number of ways from Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Desert Fox, we were mounting attacks against fixed
facilities, military bases, headquarters for Republican guards.
They were targets you could find,'' he said. ``The Serbs have far
more advanced systems. They are more capable of shooting down
aircraft. They have a capability _ in terms of interception, radar,
target identification _ far superior to anything Saddam had. This
will be a more difficult task.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With an important reservation, Secretary
General Kofi Annan effectively endorsed the NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia on Wednesday, blaming Yugoslavia's persistent rejection
of a political settlement for the resort to force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply regret that, in spite of all the efforts made by the
international community, the Yugoslav authorities have persisted in
their rejection of a political settlement, which would have halted
the bloodshed in Kosovo and secured an equitable peace for the
population there,'' Annan said two hours after NATO began striking
targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are
times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Annan implicitly reprimanded NATO for having
acted without Security Council authorization, reiterating his view
that while the United Nations charter gives ``an important role to
regional organizations,'' such as NATO, the council ``should be
involved in any decision to resort to the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   But Annan's reiteration of this principle of international world
governance came only after his criticism of Yugoslavia and his
resigned conclusion that force is sometimes necessary in restoring
or preserving peace. The order of his statements alone was
interpreted both by his aides and fellow diplomats here as a
cautious blessing of NATO's decision to use force and Washington's
insistence that the force was legal and legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Security Council debate, which lasted more than two
hours, reflected what has become an increasingly persistent
division among the five permanent members of the 15-member council
_ with the United States, Britain, and France, all NATO members,
defending military action as essential to prevent an even broader
catastrophe, and Russia and China condemning it as illegal and
destabilizing to world security.
</P>
<P>
   Given the division within the council, no resolution was
expected to be adopted, and none was.
</P>
<P>
   In demanding an immediate halt to the military strikes, Sergey
Lavrov, Russia's representative to the United Nations, said that
Russia would recall its military representative to NATO, suspend
its participation in the Partnership for Peace, the program linking
NATO and Russia, and postpone talks on the opening of a NATO
military liaison office in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov called the military strikes ``an attempt by NATO to enter
the 21st century in a uniform of global policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the American representative, argued that force
was needed to prevent ``a humanitarian catastrophe of immense
proportions,'' and that NATO had been forced to act, ``with the
greatest reluctance,'' by the failure of months of peaceful
mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat and seasoned veteran of U.N. debates said that
Russia's attack on the United States and NATO on Wednesday marked
the effective end of an era on the Security Council _ the 11 years
in which the five permanent council members managed to resolve some
pressing threats to international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   David Malone, the president of the International Peace Academy,
a private, independent group that studies the United Nations,
called Annan's statement ``sober and responsible,'' but also a
``justified departure'' from tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant that he signaled that the use of force can
sometimes be necessary with, or, by implication, in extreme
circumstances, without the authorization of the Security Council,''
Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   But Vladislav Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's envoy to the United
Nations, was obviously displeased. Speaking to reporters before the
council debate, he lashed out at both the Security Council and
Annan for failing to criticize NATO's ``aggressive'' attack on his
country.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at NATO headquarters last January, Annan signaled
his growing frustration with Serbia's violations of human rights in
Kosovo and its staunch rejection of mediation efforts. Warning that
human rights in Kosovo were being callously violated, Annan warned
that ``we may be reaching the limit, once again, in the former
Yugoslavia'' of diplomacy and political mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's delegate, called the debate on
Wednesday ``predictable'' given the council's division, but added
that a majority of member states appeared to support the NATO
action. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would be able to take
``little comfort'' from Wednesday's session, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US-led NATO forces Wednesday unleashed a battery of
cruise missiles and bombs aimed at Serbian military targets in
Yugoslavia, plunging America into a military conflict that
President Clinton said was necessary to stop ethnic cleansing and
bring stability to Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have acted with resolve,'' Clinton said Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night in
a 13-minute televised address. ``By acting, we are upholding our
values, protecting our interests, and advancing the cause of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the Oval Office and using a map of the region to
make his point, Clinton asked, ``Do our interests in Kosovo justify
the dangers to our armed forces? I thought long and hard about that
question. I am convinced that the dangers of acting are far
outweighed by the dangers of not acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Using dozens of cruise missiles, an array of fighter-bombers and
for the first time ever, two Air Force B-2 Stealth bombers, the
strikes were aimed at Yugoslavia's air defense network. They were
designed to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt a
Serb offensive in Kosovo and to accept a peace deal for the
southern Yugoslav province, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
their independence.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO attack followed months of diplomacy that failed to end
a year of fighting between Yugoslav forces and the separatists.
More than 2,000 people have been killed and over 400,000 left
homeless in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are resisting Kosovar Albanian demands for
independence because they consider Kosovo part of their religious
and historical homeland.
</P>
<P>
   At a late afternoon briefing Wednesday, Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen said all NATO planes returned safely to their
bases after the intitial wave of strikes. Other Pentagon sources
said two Yugoslav planes were hit, including a MIG-29 jet.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman in Naples denied a Yugoslav media report that a
NATO plane had been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the attacks had three objectives: to demonstrate
the seriousness of NATO's opposition to Serb aggression; to deter
``an even bloodier offensive against innocent'' ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo; and ``seriously damage'' Serbia's military capacity. The
Yugoslavia government issued a declaration of war after NATO
attacked targets from Belgrade to Pristina. The declaration from
the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug did not specify who had
made it or what its consequences would be.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which opposes the airstrikes, responded by pulling out
of the NATO Partnership for Peace, an informal alliance between
Russia and the West, and recalled its representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The successive waves of strikes pummeled army barracks, power
plants, and air defense batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Army General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said NATO'S objectives were clear: ``Our actions are
designed to reduce the ability of the Serbian military forces to
continue their offensive operations against the people of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Clinton said that the Serbian leader's
hard-line stance violated his commitment last fall to stop the
repression of the Kosovars, and that Milosevic also had spurned
repeated efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   He said Milosevic was a ``dictator'' continuing his aggression
against the Kosovars, ``moving from village to village, shelling
civilians and torching their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``In short, if President Milosevic will not make peace,
we will limit his ability to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, explosions rocked Pristina, Kosovo's capital,
as well as a big Serb military base and airport at Batajnica, the
largest military installation near the Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade. Air raid sirens filled the air in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon dismissed rumors that American troops in Bosnia had
received threats from Serbian authorities in Belgrade. ``I haven't
heard anything about that,'' said Lieutenant Colonel Steven
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   US officials promised that the bombing campaign would be heavy
and severe. ``This is not a pinprick,'' one top Clinton
administration official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Once strikes were launched, support from congressional leaders
came quickly, even if there were some reservations. A few hours
later, the House voted 424-1 to voice its support for US troops
without expressly embracing Clinton's decision to send them.
</P>
<P>
   Senate majority leader Trent Lott said, ``Whatever reservations
about the president's actions in the Balkans, let no one doubt that
the Congress and the American people stand united behind our men
and women who are bravely heeding the call of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Charles Bass, Republican of New Hampshire, said,
``I remain concerned about the Clinton administration's policy in
Kosovo, especially if the president still intends to deploy US
ground troops in any future peacekeeping mission.'' Bass also
faulted the president for failing to explain how to successfully
conclude the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   House minority leader Richard Gephardt, however, was
unequivocal. ``In the face of a Serbian military offensive against
the people of Kosovo, NATO had no choice but to deter this
aggression and prevent the slaughter of innocent civilians,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton spent 35 minutes in a ``frank and
honest exchange of views'' with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin,
according to a White House official. Clinton once again laid out
the case for NATO strikes in the face of Milosevic's refusal to
sign the peace accords, while Yeltsin expressed Russia's long-held
opposition to any use of force against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton also made
clear to Yeltsin that the United States and Russia should not allow
Milosevic ``to drive a wedge'' between them.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to shore up faltering US-Russian relations, however,
failed. After the strikes were launched, Yeltsin said he was
``deeply shocked,'' and he rejected the military action as
``outright aggression against Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia reserves the right to take adequate measures including
those of a military character to ensure Russia's safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in a dramatic show of disapproval, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov turned his plane around in midair over
the Atlantic, postponing his Washington visit indefinitely. Russia
severed links with NATO Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the United Nations Security Council met behind closed
doors for an emergency meeting called by Russia, Secretary General
Kofi Annan stated his support for NATO's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed. But there are
times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of
peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spent the day calling
her international counterparts, making the case that ``a
humanitarian crisis of staggering dimensions'' was unfolding, said
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said NATO forces were preparing for the possiblity that
Milosevic would retaliate beyond the borders or Kosovo _ or
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, he said, was ``formulating detailed plans for reacting''
to possible scenarios for Serbian aggression in the face of
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to concerns that the war could spill over Kosovo's
borders and that NATO troops in Macedonia were vulnerable, Rubin
said, ``The authorities in Belgrade should be aware that we will
not tolerate attacks on Americans in Serbia, Yugoslavia, or
neighboring countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton canceled a three-day swing to Ohio, Nevada and
California that was to begin Thursday to raise money for the
Democrats. Instead, he will remain in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After the first wave of bombing started, Clinton made a hastily
arranged appearance in the White House briefing room to make the
announcement. The president said he had consulted with world
leaders and key members of Congress about the military action and
acknowledged it ``is not risk free.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, with the map as a backdrop, he warned, ``Let a
fire burn in this area and the flame will spread.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the Kosovo situation to the two world wars, saying,
``Europe was slow to recognize the dangers, and the United States
waited even longer'' to enter. In Bosnia, Clinton said, ``The world
did not act early enough to stop that war, either.''

GIULIANI RESERVES JUDGMENT ON POLICE COMMISSIONER'S TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that he
expected Police Commissioner Howard Safir to keep his job, but that
he would await the outcome of an ethics investigation into Safir's
trip last weekend to the Academy Awards ceremony, as a guest of a
Revlon executive, before passing judgment on it.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor said the commissioner ``is doing an excellent
job,'' he would not comment on whether the trip was appropriate,
and skipped the opportunity to offer detailed or enthusiastic
praise of Safir's leadership, as he did just days ago in response
to a call for the commissioner's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, people who have been informed of the plans for the
commissioner's trip said that he originally planned to return on
Revlon's corporate jet on Monday, which would have made him miss a
City Council hearing spawned by last month's fatal police shooting
of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir returned instead on Sunday night, paying his own fare
for a red-eye flight and turning up at the City Hall hearing on
Monday. Safir's spokeswoman said he came back sooner because of
progress in negotiations with the City Council over the scope of
his testimony, and not _ as his critics had speculated _ because
Channel 2 news in New York ran footage of him at the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the free flight, $700-a-night hotel suite and tickets
to the Oscars does not appear to violate the city's ethics rules
because Revlon does not have pending business with the city. But
the trip, coming amid the biggest crisis of Safir's tenure, has
raised questions about his political judgment. A similar
controversy over gifts of expensive travel was part of what ended
the reign of his predecessor, William Bratton.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Edward Koch, who has criticized the
administration's response to the shooting, called the
commissioner's trip ``just plain stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's looking at them because of the Diallo case,'' said
Koch. ``It's certainly one of the most foolish things I've seen a
commissioner do, because it's so obviously wrong, it's so obviously
public, and it's so obviously going to come back to haunt him.''
</P>
<P>
   The stickiest point for Safir may turn out to be not who paid
for his weekend out west, but how it affected his appearance Monday
at the City Council hearing, and whether his aides were honest in
discussing it.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 12 letter to the mayor indicating he would be out of
town, Safir said he would not return until 6 p.m. Monday, long
after the 10 a.m. hearing. Marilyn Mode, Safir's spokeswoman, said
Wednesday that the commissioner did not plan, at that point, to
testify because he and the Council could not agree on ground rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mode said Wednesday that Safir decided on Saturday that
``there was hope that an agreement would be reached,'' and bought
an airline ticket to get him back in time to attend the hearing.
But that conflicts with a statement made on Sunday by First Deputy
Commissioner Patrick Kelleher that Safir would not attend the
hearing because of ``several important, long-scheduled meetings,''
as well as with accounts by both people involved in the trip and
the City Council hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Several City Council aides involved in the negotiations over the
commissioner's attendance said they did not hear of his change of
heart until 8 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would go to the Oscars, with parties after the Oscars, and
still plan to be in New York City at 9 o'clock?'' said Councilman
Sheldon Leffler, who presided over the hearing. ``It defied logic
to believe he really tried to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leffler noted that Safir declared in 1997 that members of the
Police Department would be dismissed for making false official
statements. ``This is inappropriate leadership,'' he said. ``Other
officers who are going to be in tight spots are going to say to
themselves, `You can make false statements, Safir himself did
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davies, executive director of the city's Conflicts of
Interest Board, would not comment directly on Safir's trip, but he
said there were three broad prohibitions on public officials'
accepting gifts. City employees cannot take anything worth more
than $50 from a person or firm doing business with the city, even
routine matters like applying for building permits or zoning
variances. Employees are also barred from using their jobs for
public gain, and thus should not accept gifts that are only offered
because of their job, Davies said. Finally, there is a ``catchall
prohibition'' outlawing ``any action that's in conflict with your
official duties,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would also apply to accepting something when it looks
bad,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir maintained that there was nothing improper about his
cross-country jaunt with his wife, Carol, because it was paid for
by George Fellows, Revlon's chief executive, whom he described as a
friend who ``doesn't have any dealings with the city.'' Safir did
not ask the ethics board to approve the trip before he went, but
requested the investigation by the corporation counsel after
criticism was raised in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the corporation counsel, said he would conduct a
broad review of all ethical issues raised by the trip, and was
unsure how long it would take. While officials said Revlon had no
pending city business, the company has a close relationship with
the Police Department; its security chief is Safir's former top
deputy.

SPORTS COLUMN: FROM PALMER TO TORRE, BE PATIENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the New York Yankees' dugout last season, Joe Torre was
talking about his daughter, Andrea Rae, then 2{ years old, who
earlier that day had been acting like, well, a 2{-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali,'' the Yankee manager said, referring to his wife, ``kept
telling her: `Andrea, I've lost my patience with you. I've lost my
patience with you.' About five minutes later, Andrea walked over to
her and said, `Mommy, I've found your patience.'''
</P>
<P>
   From the mouths of babes. Because now, a week after Torre's
prostate cancer surgery, even if the 58-year-old Yankee manager
should lose his patience during his estimated 6 to 12 weeks of
recuperation, he knows Andrea Rae will find it.
</P>
<P>
   And according to someone who would know, Arnold Palmer, the
golfer who is perhaps the world's most famous prostate cancer
patient, Torre needs to be a patient patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's different,'' Palmer said Wednesday from his office
at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge in Orlando, Fla., ``but I think the
major advice anybody who's had this would give Joe is, just take it
easy and do what the doctors prescribe. That's all I tried to do.
Keep up with what they tell you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer learned he had prostate cancer in January 1997. Within
days, he had surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctors told me to rest, to not do anything,'' he recalled.
``Give your body a chance to heal. When you feel like you're strong
enough, start walking as much as you can. We have a three-mile
track around the golf course here that I walked. I was out walking
and putting golf balls in about two weeks, but nothing strenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing as strenuous as swinging his driver, as only he can
swing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do that for eight weeks,'' Palmer said, laughing.
``For me, everything was based on eight weeks because I wanted to
play in my tournament here at Bay Hill that March, eight weeks
after my surgery, and I was able to.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, then 67, also played in that year's Masters and in 13
events on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could say anyone is going to recover in any
specific period of time,'' he said, ``but for me everything was
based on eight weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Did that mean Joe Torre could be back in the Yankee dugout in
eight weeks?
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be able to do it prior to that actually,'' Palmer
said. ``As long as he doesn't have to strain or get himself in a
dither.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for George Steinbrenner, it was suggested, every Yankee
manager has often been in a dither. Palmer laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Yankees are playing good, Joe would probably have no
problems,'' he said. ``If the Yankees are having problems, he might
have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre is recuperating at his spring training home near the
Yankee complex in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me there was still some pain a week later,'' Palmer said,
``but you're given medication to take care of that. The thing you
notice most is the inconvenience of the operation. Getting the
stitches out, the other things involved.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two years after his surgery, Palmer shot 78-74 last
week in the Bay Hill Invitational and will tee off in the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very fortunate; I feel very good,'' he said. ``About a
year and a half after the surgery, my doctor decided I should have
radiation, which I have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, whose wife, Winnie, is dealing with breast cancer,
completed his radiation treatments in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in radiation, you stay away from too many fruits
and vegetables, but I'm past that,'' Palmer said. ``The radiation
sets you back a little, but its effect is mostly inconvenience,
that's all. I'm not on any medication. I'm exercising every day. I
stretch. I do leg work and arm-and-shoulder work with weights. I
feel very close to back to normal, or at least I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   And at Bay Hill he is playing golf virtually every day, as he
always has except for those weeks after his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing the doctors tell you was give yourself a
chance to get your strength back,'' Palmer said. ``Don't try to
overdo it. Don't try to go too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Joe Torre needs to be a patient patient.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankee manager knows that if he does happen to lose his
patience, little Andrea Rae will know where to find it. &QL;

THE COMPLETE RICHARD HAMILTON: FAST FEET, DEEP THOUGHTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Hamilton was a steel worker who knew how to handle a pool
stick. His grandson Richard knew how to handle a basketball.
Neither would talk about his gifts much, especially last summer
when the two would sit together in front of the television
wondering what the fall would bring.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton was worried about the foot he had broken in
July at the USA Basketball tryouts for the World Championships. The
broken foot, in which a screw was implanted, kept him from
traveling on a tour with his Connecticut teammates. It put him in
the TV room of his grandfather's house on the hill in Coatesville,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Edward was worried, too. He was battling lung cancer _ and
losing, as a series of scars from surgery attested.
</P>
<P>
   Neither wanted to talk basketball. Both ignored the clippings
and the photographs taped to the walls that chronicled Richard's
climb from skinny, junior high school player to Big East Player of
the Year, an honor he had earned a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   They just talked. About their surgeries. About what they wanted
for lunch. About how nothing they did before or would do in the
future mattered, unless they had fun doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about what was said,'' Hamilton said recently. ``It
was just being together. It taught me to not always take things for
granted. It was a messed-up time, and being with him is the best
thing that could have happened for both of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned was when I got back to school I wanted to make
the year an experience of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an experience of a lifetime for Hamilton, one that
has been emotional and far from storybook. Edward Hamilton died in
October. And Richard cried.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday in Phoenix, he scored 21 points to lead
Connecticut over Gonzaga in the West Regional final and to the
school's first Final Four appearance. He cried there, too.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he tentatively came back from the foot injury and
pushed UConn to the No. 1 ranking, which it held for 10 weeks. He
then sustained a thigh injury that his coach, Jim Calhoun,
challenged him to fight through.
</P>
<P>
   He did _ well enough to be named an all-American and conference
co-player of the year and to carry the Huskies to their fifth Big
East title in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people mistake how laid back he is for a lack of
strength,'' said his father, also named Richard. ``My father _ his
grandfather _ was like that. He was a great pool player, but even
my mother didn't know it because he never talked about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run and lift weights with him in the summer,'' the older
Hamilton said about his son. ``I see how dedicated and tough he is.
He just doesn't need to talk about it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NCAA tournament, the son has averaged 23.5 points a game
and has demonstrated a willingness to play defense that few knew he
had. He has also renewed a two-part debate: Will he enter the NBA
draft after this, his junior year? And, at 6 feet 6 inches and 185
pounds, can his greyhoundlike frame and sensitive soul make an
impact in the wide-bodied, cold-hearted NBA.?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rip has shown me something that I knew but needed to have
reaffirmed,'' Calhoun said, referring to Hamilton by his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a greater appreciation for him being one of the best
players in college basketball. You think he can't go by you because
he's not that quick. You think he can't get nine rebounds, but he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   During Hamilton's three years at Connecticut, Calhoun has
alternately boasted about him and browbeaten him. He has been
dazzled and, a few times, discouraged by him. Before the season,
Calhoun told Hamilton that the Huskies were the forward's team,
that he was special in a way only a few of his former players have
been _ players like Connecticut's Ray Allen and the late Reggie
Lewis, whom he coached at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hamilton suffered a thigh contusion in late January
against St. John's and missed the next two games, Calhoun directed
his blunt talk at his star. Without Hamilton, the Huskies lost
their first game, to Syracuse. The coach sounded exasperated when
he repeatedly had to announce that Hamilton's condition was day to
day.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun now says that ``coddling and loving'' Hamilton was as
much a part as pushing him to return. But Calhoun challenged his
star's toughness because the Huskies needed him back if they wanted
to reach the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun admits to having an easier rapport with Khalid El-Amin,
the brassy, bowling-ball shaped point guard who, like the coach
himself, leads with his lip. El-Amin has felt Calhoun's wrath on
the floor, exchanged good-natured barbs off it and has sat in
Calhoun's office to talk about subjects far afield from basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khalid is like talking to a 30-year-old,'' Calhoun said,
explaining how he has related differently to Hamilton. ``Rip is
different. He's 100 percent in tune with the world but at the same
time has this ability to be insulated from it, and that, I believe,
comes from his parents. He comes from a very strong family that has
put all its effort into raising a good kid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Rip was born, his father claims, he was 31 inches long _
about a foot longer than most babies. His father put tiny
basketballs in his crib. When he saw his son go through three
defenders in a seventh-grade game, he bought a video camera the
next day. He has since amassed a tape collection of the more than
400 games his son has played.
</P>
<P>
   But both parents have also taken an intense interest in
Hamilton's education. There were plenty of books around, and Pam
Long, Rip's mother, currently lives in Hartford and is pursuing a
master's degree at Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Both parents counseled him to stay in school last year when he
was projected as a top 15 NBA pick. Richard Hamilton the father
says they probably will vote the same way when it's time to make a
decision about the draft in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always wanted to put him in the right situations, to
make sure that he is a student of all things,'' said the older
Hamilton, who is in the trucking business in Coatesville.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Freeman, Hamilton's roommate, said the toughest part of
the game is the mental part, and Rip works hardest at that. Freeman
said Hamilton watches film of his own performances, trying to
maximize his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 24-hour thing with him,'' Freeman said of Hamilton.
``He has a game like he did against Gonzaga, where he shut down
their best shooter and still got 21, and he can still find plays
where he missed an open man or something. If he doesn't shoot well,
he'll have trouble sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he cried after the Gonzaga game because he was
overjoyed that after months of working so hard he had earned an
opportunity to play in a Final Four tournament that he had dreamed
about as a little boy. He was sure Edward Hamilton would have
appreciated that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows I'm having fun,'' he said, smiling. ``Like we talked
about.'' &QL;

WE'RE TALKIN' TURKEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBEC, Calif. _ Dozens of tough-looking guys _ and gals _ in
camouflage. Camo everywhere, from special suspenders designed to
hold binoculars to ``safari stalkers'' _ bizarre boots with fuzzy
fur bottoms to silence the hunter's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   You're not much of a turkey shooter without camo, and the 100 or
so in attendance during Saturday's turkey-hunting seminar at Tejon
Ranch knew it. Gobblers have powerful peepers _ eyesight 10 times
greater than a human's _ and they'll quickly spot the shooter whose
calling them if the hunter isn't carefully disguised.
</P>
<P>
   The audience at the National Wild Turkey Federation event had
come to hear Garden Grove turkey shooter Jimmie Rizzo speak. The
Mississippi transplant is revered for his hunting skills. Though a
Southland resident for 12 years, his thick drawl is hard to miss.
What he had to say should help beginners and veterans alike bag a
bird _ and come home to tell about it. &QL; 
X X X
</P>
<P>
   A word on scouting: Scout before you hunt to find where turkeys
are or have been by scouring for tracks, scratchings, feathers and
droppings _ and pick more than one site. If not, don't be
disappointed come opening morning, when six other cars are sitting
in front of the perfect little turkey hole you found.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are out looking around, take into consideration the
vegetation. If it's green, match your camo to it; if it's brown,
match your camo to it.'' Sometimes the locales will have dead
leaves on the ground and green foliage higher up, so wear brown
camo pants and a green-camo jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Pattern your shotgun: Once you've found your hunting spot, get
the tightest choke for your shotgun and shells with shot size No.
4, 5 or 6 and make sure your gun's aim is true. ``It's real
important that you understand that your shotgun is not necessarily
shooting where that bead (sight) is.'' Adjustments can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Next, determine your maximum effective distance, that is the
length at which you can shoot accurately at a turkey's head or neck
area _ the kill zones of the tough birds. Rizzo doesn't recommend
anybody shooting more than 40 yards at a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Try some calling: There are numerous friction calls _ namely
wooden box calls or calls made of slate, aluminum and Plexiglas _
and air-operated options called mouth diaphragm calls. All can be
perfected _ with practice, ``preferably in your car, if you're
married.'' But only use the call of a hen in the spring mating
season, when most hunters are gunning for a gobbler, or tom _ the
dominant male. Hen calls bring gobblers in; gobbler calls bring
hunters in.
</P>
<P>
   Problems in the field: More hunters get shot during turkey
season than in any other game season. A big reason is that hunters
track turkeys by what they think is their call, but what turns out
to be a hunter making a call. ``Don't go to the call; let the call
come to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't yell: ``In the event a turkey hunter does come to your
call, do not jump up and down, wave your arms or shout real loud.''
That turkey hunter could swing his gun on you thinking you're the
turkey whose call he is tracking. ``Instead, call out of name _
Bill, John, Dave, anything _ just so that person knows immediately
when he hears that that's coming from another person.''
</P>
<P>
   About colors: ``Do not go out (in the field) with red, white,
blue or black on. This is the color of the turkey; you'll get
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, pack an orange hat and vest and a white game bag. Use them
if you shoot a bird; do not carry the bird out on your back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us know that there are not very many 6-foot-tall
turkeys walking along in our local mountains. But that doesn't mean
that you aren't going to get shot at with a turkey on your back,
even though the bird is upside-down and six feet off the ground.
Everybody wants to show off their trophy turkey; just make sure
it's you showing it off, not one of your next of kin.'' &QL; 
X X X
</P>
<P>
   Other turkey news: While 63 wild turkeys were released last
month in the San Bernardino Mountains _ augmenting a state program
to ensure a healthy permanent population of the birds there _
hunters won't be bagging any of the newcomers this spring.
</P>
<P>
   All the transplanted turkeys with beards had them removed before
the birds were introduced to the mountain chain by the Department
of Fish and Game. Only birds with beards are legal to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give the new birds a chance to orient to their new
surroundings and provide a generation of offspring before they
reach the dinner table,'' said DFG wildlife biologist Jim Davis.
The beards will regrow in time for the spring 2000 hunting season,
and those birds will be fair game.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 Merriam's-strain wild turkeys have been translocated to
several sites along the mountains' north slope since 1987, when the
DFG began this program in the San Bernardino National Forest. The
last plant _ 28 Merriam's _ took place in early 1996 at Crab Flats.
The most recent birds were imported from South Dakota, with the
National Wild Turkey Federation _ an Edgefield, S.C.-based
education and conservation group _ footing the entire bill.

CLINTON APPEALS FOR SUPPORT IN EXPLAINING REASONS FOR ATTACK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See also: KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-MILITARY, KOSOVO-POLITICS and
KOSOVO-CONGRESS.) 
 
(Eds.: the Continent is cq in third graf) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton appealed to the American people
Wednesday for support of NATO airstrikes against Serbian military
forces, insisting that the ethnic killing in Kosovo could erupt
into a wider European war if the United States and its allies fail
to act.
</P>
<P>
   Casting the Kosovo conflict as a repeat of the brutal aggression
that preceded the first two world wars, Clinton said NATO's
post-Cold War defensive role in the world must evolve into an
offensive one to ensure that Europe remains stable and undivided.
</P>
<P>
   If it were unwilling to stop massacres of innocent people ``on
NATO's doorstep,'' he said the Western alliance would be of little
use in combating future threats to the stability of the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both wars Europe was slow to recognize the dangers and the
United States waited even longer to enter the conflict,'' the
president said in an address to the nation in which he sought to
lay out his rationale for NATO's first attack on a sovereign
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Taking military action now in the face of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's mounting offensive against Kosovo's
predominantly Albanian population would ``defuse a powder keg at
the heart of Europe that has exploded twice before in this century
with catastrophic results,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By acting now, we are upholding our values, protecting our
interests and advancing the cause of peace,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took pains to help Americans understand the strategic
significance of Kosovo, noting that it lies just 160 miles east of
Italy and only 70 miles north of Greece. Using maps to pinpoint the
Serbian province, Clinton stressed that the Serbian offensive in
Kosovo threatens to engulf NATO allies such as Macedonia and other
smaller countries on its border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually,'' he said, ``key U.S. allies could be drawn into a
wider conflict _ a war we would be forced to confront later, only
at a far greater risk and greater cost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let a fire burn in this area and the flame will spread,''
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   The president also made the case for NATO airstrikes by painting
in graphic terms the human tragedy of Kosovo. Clinton said
Milosevic's forces had shelled villages and torched homes as
thousands of ethnic Albanians were forced to flee into the
mountains or leave the country entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen innocent people taken from their home, forced to
kneel in the dirt and sprayed with bullets,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a war in the traditional sense. It is an attack by
tanks and artillery on a largely defenseless people, whose leaders
have already agreed to peace. Ending this tragedy is a moral
imperative,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also drew similarities to the war in Bosnia. NATO
intervened there too, but not until after an estimated 250,000
people died at the hands of Milosevic-backed Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world did not act early enough to stop that war either,''
Clinton said, recalling the Serb concentration camps where Bosnian
Muslims and Croats were imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quarter-of-a-million people killed, not because of anything
they had done but because of who they were. ... This was genocide
in the heart of Europe, not in 1945 but in 1995,'' he said, adding
that Milosevic must be stopped in Kosovo ``before what happened in
Bosnia happens there too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia was an independent nation when NATO intervened to stop
Serb rebels there from trying to reunite the country with
Milosevic's government in Belgrade. The NATO airstrikes were
directed against Serb rebel targets and drew little criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's assault Wednesday on Yugoslavian forces was roundly
criticized by many in Congress as ``an act of war'' against a
sovereign power that would inevitably lead to protracted U.S.
involvement in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech six hours after the air attacks began, Clinton did
not mention that the NATO operation was the first time in the
alliance's 50-year history that it had attacked a sovereign
country. Instead, he focused on portraying Milosevic as
cold-blooded dictator interested only in expanding his territorial
hold in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic will not make peace, we will limit his
ability to make war,'' Clinton said. Administration officials
conceded that is the primary goal of the NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, Mr. Milosevic will realize that his present course
is self-destructive and unsustainable,'' Clinton said, adding that
if Milosevic accepts the Washington-brokered peace agreement signed
by the Albanians, NATO would help implement it with a peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   But while noting that U.S. troops would take part in a
peacekeeping effort, Clinton stressed that American military
personnel would not become involved in a conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the NATO strikes would likely
continue for several weeks unless Milosevic agrees to return to the
negotiating table. In order to deal with the crisis, Clinton
canceled a scheduled three-day domestic trip, including several
Democratic fund-raisers, to remain in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, Clinton said he was hopeful that by acting now NATO
would bring some measure of stability to the Balkans, and Europe as
a whole, so that Americans do not in the future have to ``cross the
Atlantic to fight another terrible war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've learned anything from the century drawing to a close,
it is that if America is going to be prosperous and secure, we need
a Europe that is prosperous, secure, undivided and free,'' Clinton
said.

PROTESTS IN POLICE SHOOTING GROW LARGER, AND MORE DIVERSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Sidney Socolar, 75, a retired
biophysics professor, got himself arrested was in the mid-1980s,
when he sat outside Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato's office to protest
America's involvement in El Salvador's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, he stood with his 82-year-old wife in a crush of
demonstrators outside One Police Plaza, awaiting the handcuffs. ``I
am enraged about our mayor's attitude toward civil liberties,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking the door was a group of 17 elderly white women,
including Carolyn Goodman, 83, whose son's murder in Mississippi
was a touchstone for the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Ms.
Goodman was escorted into Police Headquarters to be handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   She was part of the largest and most diverse group to be
arrested in the 12 days of protests against the police shooting of
Amadou Diallo. Among the 212 people taken into custody Wednesday
were 126 members of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, including
several rabbis, and representatives of three labor unions.
Wednesday's arrests brought the total to 574 for the daily rallies.
</P>
<P>
   So many people were arrested that the police had to book the
protesters in station houses in three different precincts in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters had to wait behind police barricades and be
shepherded inside, 30 at a time. Police officers told them through
megaphones that they would be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd chanted, sang psalms in Hebrew and held up signs that
read ``Stop the Death Squads'' and ``Arrest Giuliani.'' Before
being led inside, Socolar described the day as a ``welcome
resumption'' of the unity between blacks and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose political advocacy group National
Action Network has been organizing the daily protests since March
9, proudly noted the diversity of the rally as he stood in the
midst of supporters. ``It robs the mayor of his argument that we're
being divisive,'' he said. ``We've got a lot more diversity here
than the Police Department has.''
</P>
<P>
   He renewed his call for the arrest of the four police officers
from the Street Crime Unit who killed Diallo, an immigrant from
Guinea, on Feb. 4. Diallo was unarmed. A grand jury in the Bronx
finished hearing testimony in the case Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another demonstrator, Dennis Rivera, the president of Local
1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees Union, which
has 150,000 members, said that he came to protest the fact that the
Police Department does not reflect the city's racial mix.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he agreed with the city's public advocate,
Mark Green, that Police Commissioner Howard Safir should resign,
Rivera said, ``I think he demonstrated an awesome lack of
sensitivity, and most likely we need a change of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   He was led inside and arrested along with several other labor
leaders, including Lee Saunders, the trustee in charge of District
Council 37, an umbrella group representing 120,000 city workers;
James H. Butler, the president of Local 420 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and Charles
Ensley, the president of Local 371, which represents 15,000 social
workers.
</P>
<P>
   During the protest, Safir was in the auditorium at One Police
Plaza conducting a ceremony to announce the promotion of 64 police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the need to communicate effectively and be
courteous, even when making arrests, he said: ``There's also
nothing wrong occasionally saying, `I am sorry for inconveniencing
you.' That's a decent thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Police Department are planning to hold their
own rally Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a flier posted around police headquarters, James Higgins, a
police union official who is to lead the rally, said that it was
necessary because ``a number of political opportunists have
surfaced to prejudge and crucify cops, all cops.''

SPORTS COLUMN: STRAWBERRY SHOULD TAKE LONGER VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees were so catatonic they could barely
muster enough energy to toss a ball. Rarely will you ever witness a
more demoralized group of athletes, as well as a very ashen young
general manager named Brian Cashman.
</P>
<P>
   This was the muggy afternoon in Texas last fall when the Yankees
officially learned that their pal Darryl Strawberry had colon
cancer. The tears and the raspy voices were a tribute to the man _
the flawed, comic, multi-journeyed Straw Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say that the Yankees' prayers, and their intense
get-well greeting in front of every camera, did not help Strawberry
get through his fears, the surgery and the wrenching chemotherapy?
</P>
<P>
   Once Strawberry was revealed to have a somewhat advanced case of
cancer, it is a safe bet that he and every member of the Yankees
would have settled to see him back in uniform, rock-solid, able to
swing a bat, full of Straw-Dog bluster once again.
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, George Steinbrenner committed $2.5 million to
Strawberry for this season. It is reasonable to ask if George would
have been so generous if Darryl were not threatened by cancer, and
if Darryl did not need the money.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is time for Darryl Strawberry to give back a little bit
of the love he was tendered last fall. From his sessions in
battling his addictions, Strawberry knows all about the concept of
gratefulness _ there is a point where you give thanks just for
being here. It's time for Darryl to spread a little of that
gratefulness around.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a distraction this spring, grumbling about minor
details of batting practice, grumbling about his status on opening
day, grumbling about the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for Darryl to cut it out. He has come too far from
being the man who had major problems with alcohol and drugs and
taxes and money and family. He has been a mensch ever since George
Steinbrenner took a huge chance on him three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   George warned him that he would be Darryl's worst nightmare if
Strawberry should slip, the right threat to the right man at the
right time. Strawberry has been a mature bench player, an example
to young people until this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl showed signs of straightening out Tuesday night when he
approached Cashman and said he would not act out again. On
Wednesday he hit a home run and had three runs batted in. Thursday
night he is expected to play left field, to show if he can get
around on his 37-year-old legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to prove he can do everything to make the club, and
obviously speaking for him it's a frustrating situation, not
knowing what's going on and competing for a job,'' Cashman said
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He questioned me on what the possibilities are, and I said,
`Right now, I don't know,''' Cashman reported. ``He also asked the
possibilities if he didn't make the club, and I said, `I don't know
that, either.' I said, `You've got to answer one question before
you answer the other.' I said, we need time to basically look and
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   That is reasonable. The Yankees are not paying Strawberry $2.5
million to fail. There may be one frugal corner of George
Steinbrenner's heart that notes it will save him $833,000 in luxury
tax if Strawberry does not play for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But all of us have watched George over the years. He talks
cheap, he bullies, he wheedles _ and then he spends the money for
what he wants, or needs (not always the same, but so what?). If
Darryl can help the Yankees at all, he'll be on the roster, and it
will not be charity.
</P>
<P>
   The nasty incursion of cancer was a cruel blow to Strawberry,
but he could not miss the outpouring of love when he was able to
make an appearance in the World Series celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Straw is also picking the wrong time to act out, while Joe Torre
is recovering from his own surgery for prostate cancer. Torre has
not turned his back on Strawberry, the way some managers do when a
player is not able to perform at his peak. Torre has his own
problems. Strawberry needs to recognize that and not take it out on
Don Zimmer, an older man who is nowhere near the tolerant father
figure and innate psychologist that Torre is.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite possible that Strawberry _ who has his morbid side
and probably always will _ has been suffering through some form of
depression after the latest turn in his life. He's entitled.
</P>
<P>
   It seems rather clear that George Steinbrenner, with all his
flaws, is fairly aching to make Darryl a Yankee for life, in some
capacity or other. Darryl need not grovel, but he needs to remember
the Yankees are not his enemy.

PLAYERS AT PURDUE AS FOCUSED AS THEIR COACH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ZACK BURGESS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Off the court, the Purdue players and coaches had been guarded
and almost bland whenever they spoke during the Midwest Regional
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, with Tennessee and Connecticut no longer around,
someone had to live up to the expectations of a No. 1 seeded team,
and Purdue finally had, rallying to defeat Rutgers Monday night to
reach the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Purdue players had finished cutting down the nets,
and during coach Carolyn Peck's post-game interview, it became
clear that a change _ however subtle _ had occurred. Their
collective sigh of relief was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Peck raised her voice a little and her eyes became larger as she
spoke. She was talking with an emotion in her voice rarely heard.
</P>
<P>
   But her animation just added to the mystery of Purdue and
especially its 33-year-old coach. Who is the person inside the
coach? Is she the woman who always answered with a smile, the one
who gave away no secrets, the one who knew exactly what to say?
</P>
<P>
   Her closed-mouth approach is a reflection of her corporate
background, when she worked as a pharmaceutical sales
representative. She was an assistant under Tennessee's Pat Summitt
for two years before going to Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   She became the Boilermakers' head coach last season when she was
promoted to replace Neil Fortner, who had been named coach of the
USA Basketball women's national team.
</P>
<P>
   Peck will gladly talk about Purdue basketball. She will not
answer questions about her migration this summer to the WNBA, where
she will be the general manager of the expansion Orlando Miracle.
The praise has always gone to her players. For now, Purdue
basketball is her personality.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the personality of her players. When any of Purdue's
outstanding guard combination of Ukari Figgs, Stephanie
White-McCarty and Katie Douglas talks, they also follow the company
line. They will only talk about ``the team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing unusual,'' Stephanie White-McCarty said. ``It's
what she has instilled in us as a coach. We know that we wouldn't
be in this position if it didn't take a team effort. It took
everyone to get here. It would be unfair for one or two people to
take the credit. That's what we've learned from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Peck was asked about how she felt about making it to
the Final Four, she responded: ``I want to play our last ball game
the very best that we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers this weekend will take on Louisiana Tech, a
quick and extremely athletic team that has the ability to shoot the
jump shot as well as score in the low post. With forward Monica
Maxwell and junior college transfer Betty Lennox leading the way
for Louisiana Tech , they will be looking to avenge a 71-65 loss to
Purdue in late December. It was the last time the Lady Techsters
(30-2) lost this season.
</P>
<P>
   While Louisiana Tech (30-2) has been a staple in the women's
Final Four, this is only Purdue's second visit, with its first
coming in 1994. This time, it is ranked No. 1 and riding a 30-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Making this trip even more special is that Peck, Figgs and
White-McCarty will be moving on once their quest for the title is
finished. ``I think the whole season has been special,''
White-McCarty said. ``It's not that just coach Peck is not going to
be here. Were not going to have this team ever again. We realize
that. We want to make the most of the opportunities we have with
this team.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For most of the year, Figgs and White-McCarty have been the two
players who have led this well-balanced Purdue team. White-McCarty
has averaged 18 points a game in the tournament while Figgs has
contributed 16.5.
</P>
<P>
   But Purdue's role players _ 6-foot-4 center Camille Cooper, who
scored 20 points against Rutgers, guard Katie Douglas and forward
Michelle Duhart _ are major contributors to a Purdue team that has
won its tournament games by an average score of 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at Stephanie White-McCarty _ she breathes life
into death,'' Rutgers coach C.Vivian Stringer said. ``By that I
mean that a shot could be dead and you think she has stopped.
Everything seems to be stuck. And somehow she's able to pull the
ball through and see light. The offense is not done until the ball
actually is out of her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then it's on to the next person. It doesn't matter whether
you're in a zone or man defense, this team is complete. They can do
a lot of damage.''

RUSSIANS WIN GOLD IN PAIRS, AILING KWAN LEADS QUALIFYING AT WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS

   HELSINKI, Finland _ If the crowd in Hartwell arena had been
scoring the pairs competition at the world figure skating
championships Wednesday night, there is no doubt who would have had
the highest marks: Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo of China.
</P>
<P>
   The nine judges in Hartwell took a different view, awarding the
gold to the defending world champions, Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the final results flashed on the scoreboard, there
were whistles and boos from spectators who had watched Berezhnaya
tumble after misjudging a double axel and had seen the Chinese
skate a clean and technically superior program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, we tried to skate easy and beautiful and patient, and
I think we did it,'' Sikharulidze said
</P>
<P>
   The judges agreed, and though eight of the nine gave the Chinese
higher marks for technical merit, eight of the nine gave the
Russians higher marks for presentation. (They received 5.9s across
the board.) Because the presentation mark is the tie breaker,
China's first world championship medal in pairs turned out to be a
silver, not a gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to win the championship, but also wanted to
perform our best,'' Zhao said through a translator. ``We think we
succeeded in the second case.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland also won its first medal in pairs at a world
championships when Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek took the
bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The new American team of Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman finished
ninth. The brother and sister team of Danielle and Steve Hartsell
placed 10th. Laura Handy and Paul Binnebose, the third American
team, withdrew because Binnebose has been unable to shake the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Kwan, the favorite in the women's event, has also been
ill this week and is being treated with antibiotics for a severe
head cold. Asked to rate her level of fitness, Kwan said ``85
percent.'' But the reigning world champion won her group easily in
Wednesday's qualifying round, which for the first time counts for
20 percent of the final score.
</P>
<P>
   She was not at her sharpest or most confident, downgrading a
triple lutz to a double, but she landed six other triples. Though
she received one 5.5 for technical merit from the Slovak judge and
a 5.6 for presentation from the Finnish judge, she was still a
great deal more impressive than her rival Maria Butyrskaya of
Russia, who won the other qualifying group despite a painful fall
on a triple salchow and several other errors.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Hughes, the 13-year-old from Great Neck, New York, in her
first world championships, placed fourth in Kwan's group despite
falling on a triple flip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different than what I thought it would be,'' said Hughes,
who will now skate in the second-to-last group in Friday's short
program. ``I just went out there and when I was taking my position,
I said to myself that this might be my only chance to be at worlds.
I definitely had my four minutes of enjoyment.'' &QL;

B-2s MAKE COMBAT DEBUT DURING YUGOSLAV ATTACK 
 
(See also: KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-POLITICS, KOSOVO-RATIONALE andBy JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The B-2 stealth bomber made its combat debut
Wednesday as part of an 11-nation armada of air and missile power
that lit up the night skies over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs from two B-2s and cruise missiles from a half-dozen B-52
bombers and several U.S. and British warships began hitting
Yugoslav military barracks, air defense units and power plants
shortly after sunset in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials reported no U.S. casualties and no loss of
aircraft by any of the NATO-member nations. Officials denied a
Yugoslav media report that a NATO aircraft had been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said two Yugoslav MiG-29 fighters had been knocked from
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said NATO planes had
encountered aircraft from the Yugoslav Air Force, but he gave no
details. ``There was some air-to-air engagement that has taken
place. But I think we need more information before we can confirm
what the result of that was,'' he said. ``Our aircraft have safely
returned _ those that were in the region to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cohen and other U.S. officials said it was too early to
provide an accurate assessment of damage from the satellite-guided
bombs and missiles, a Yugoslav military leader told reporters that
more than 40 targets were hit in the first wave of attacks. Lt.
Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, commander of Yugoslav troops in Kosovo,
claimed that damage was ``minimal.'' Televised reports from Serbia
showed buildings engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to say how many of the 400 NATO aircraft in
the region participated in the attack. At the same time, U.S.
officials stressed that no ground troops were being deployed except
to rescue downed NATO fliers if their aircraft crash in enemy
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of explosions were heard near the Kosovo capital of
Pristina, which was plunged into darkness when a power plant was
hit, and near Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. The official Tanjug
news agency reported Pristina's airport had been hit by bombs or
missiles and an army barracks in Danilovgrad had been set ablaze
during the initial attack. The agency reported that civilians,
including the families of military personnel, had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Except to say the B-2s had acquitted themselves well on their
first combat sorties, Pentagon officials provided few details of
their flights from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, across
parts of two continents and an ocean to drop a total of 32
satellite-guided bombs, each 2,000 pounds, before returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft performed according to its capabilities,'' said
Cohen, who as a Republican senator from Maine in the 1980s likened
using the $2 billion, bat-winged B-2 in battle to sending a
Rolls-Royce on a grocery-run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stealthy aircraft that can fly in all weather with
considerable ordnance aboard,'' Cohen told reporters Wednesday at a
Pentagon briefing. ``So we are satisfied it was able to conduct
itself and carry out its mission accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   First seen by the public in November 1988, the B-2 has been
plagued by a radar system that has trouble distinguishing mountain
ranges from clouds, radar-absorbent paint that wears off too
quickly, wing skins that developed holes, and ejection seats that
did not work properly. The aircraft did not become operational
until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A senior defense official said the B-2 was picked for
Wednesday's mission, which involved several midair refuelings,
because it carries 16 bombs, each weighing a ton, and can attack
several targets.
</P>
<P>
   The two B-2s were only a fraction of the firepower thrown
against Serbian military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said about 100 Tomahawk cruise missiles were
launched from U.S. ships based in the Mediterranean and Adriatic
seas. Six U.S. warships, a cruiser, three destroyers and two
submarines, all armed with Tomahawks, are cruising within range of
Yugoslavia. Also in the fleet is a British submarine equipped with
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate count of the missiles launched from the
six B-52 bombers flying from an air base in England. Each B-52 can
carry 20 cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   As the air campaign progresses, 12 of the Air Force's F-117
fighters, armed with two laser-guided bombs each, are likely to be
used when skies are clear over Yugoslavia. The accuracy of the
F-117's weapons are hampered in cloudy weather.
</P>
<P>
   Once satisfied that Yugoslav air defenses have been sufficiently
damaged, NATO is expected to dispatch a variety of aircraft,
including U.S. and allied F-16s and American F-15s, to attack
weapons depots and Serb troop concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the military Joint Chiefs
of Staff, cautioned that NATO casualties are likely as the attacks
continue.
</P>
<P>
   A cornerstone of the Serbian military, Europe's ninth-largest,
is the air defense system, which Shelton described as well-equipped
and well-coordinated. He said that once low-level attacks begin,
the air defenses pose their greatest threat. Allied pilots must fly
low when late winter clouds obscure targets, many of them in
mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although at this point we have no casualties to U.S. or NATO
forces, we continue to take all measures to reduce the risk to our
pilots and air crews,'' Shelton said. ``But there is no such thing
as a risk-free military operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs most effective air defense weapon, which officials say
was not used extensively Wednesday, is the Soviet-made SA-6
anti-aircraft missiles. They are highly mobile. Less mobile
components include the Soviet-made SA-2s and SA-3 anti-aircraft
missiles. The Serbs also have dozens of shoulder-fired missiles
similar to U.S. Stingers, a weapon most useful against low-flying
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Air Force, consisting mainly of old Soviet planes
and about 15 newer MiG-29s, is not considered a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   Administrations officials took great pains Wednesday to say that
no troops would be put on the ground in Serbia except as a
peacekeeping force accepted by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about ground forces in anything but a
permissive environment,'' said Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. ``We have no plans to have American ground forces in a
non-permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen gave a similar answer when pressed about the possible use
of soldiers from the United States or other NATO countries. ``What
we have indicted to the Congress and to the country is that this
is an air operation campaign,'' Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cohen acknowledged, elite Air Force teams have
been assigned to the region to rescue any U.S. fliers downed in the
combat zone. However, he stressed, no U.S. ground troops would be
used in offensive action against the Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will be drawn from 150 air commandos, parachutists and
other personnel from the 16th Special Operations Group in Florida
assembled at a military base in southern Italy, about 200 miles
from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue teams reach their targets aboard all-weather MH-53J
Pave Low III helicopters and MH-60K Blackhawks.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The forces of NATO opened an assault on Serbia with
cruise missiles and bombs Wednesday as President Clinton denounced
the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, for feeding the
``flames of ethnic and religious division'' in Kosovo and
endangering neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles began striking Serbian targets within minutes of
Clinton's midday announcement that the long-threatened attack was
under way. It was expected to be a broad, sustained barrage
intended to stun the Yugoslav leader and punish the military for
its yearlong onslaught against the ethnic Albanian separatists of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative,'' Clinton declared
in an address to the nation Wednesday night from the Oval Office.
``It is also important to America's national interests.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke several hours after the first explosions of incoming
missiles erupted in the night skies of Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said the city's main commercial and
military airport had been hit.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest allied military assault in Europe since World War II
occurred after a day in which Serbian forces maintained their
military pressure against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo.
Steady streams of alarmed residents fled toward Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Sirens sounded, and the flash and thunder of explosions cut
through the night sky of Belgrade and other scattered targets,
including the northern Serbian town of Novi Sad and the main
airport in the Yugoslav coastal republic of Montenegro. One
explosion was reported near Batajnica, the main Serbian airport and
military base near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As he explained the NATO attack _ an initiative against a
problem Serbia considers purely internal, not international in
scope _ Clinton sought to reassure the United States against a
commitment to any large-scale ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war,''
he emphasized in reviewing the explosive history of the Balkans. He
denounced Milosevic as a dictator ``who has done nothing since the
Cold War ended but start new wars and pour gasoline on the flames
of ethnic and religious division.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We act to prevent a wider war, to defuse a powder keg at the
heart of Europe that has exploded twice before in this century with
catastrophic results,'' the president said gravely of the military
attack by the 19-member NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In his afternoon announcement of the military attack, Clinton
said: ``President Milosevic, who over the past decade started the
terrible wars against Croatia and Bosnia, has again chosen
aggression over peace. He has violated the commitments that he
himself made last fall to stop the brutal repression in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, a defiant Milosevic called for defense of his
nation ``by all means possible,'' terming Kosovo ``only the door
intended to allow foreign troops to come in and steal away our
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade government, denouncing ``neo-Nazism,'' called for
the U.N. Security Council to condemn ``NATO's criminal, terrorist,
underhanded and cowardly attack.''
</P>
<P>
   American defense officials said the targets in the initial wave
of attacks by warships and bombers included missile batteries,
radar installations and military communication sites in Kosovo,
Belgrade and other key areas. Some air-to-air combat was reported
by Pentagon officials, who said all NATO planes had returned
safely.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, which has longstanding ties
to the Serbs, angrily denounced the American-led raids as ``open
aggression'' and ``a blow to the whole world community.'' Clinton
had tried to justify the military action Wednesday in a 35-minute
phone call with Yeltsin. But the Russian leader recalled his chief
military envoy to NATO and reserved the right to take ``adequate
measures,' including military ones to insure security.
</P>
<P>
   After months of threats, NATO finally resorted to military
action as Milosevic, far from heeding peace overtures, stepped up
his latest offensive against ethnic Albanian villages and rebels of
the Kosovo Liberation Army. Since violence began escalating a year
ago, more than 400,000 ethnic Albanians have fled their homes as
Serbian forces have torched and bombarded villages, massacring
civilians in some raids. In recent decades ethnic Albanians have
come to outnumber Serbs by 9-1 in Kosovo, which Serbs long have
revered as the birthplace of Serbian nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate fear about the mounting violence in Kosovo, the
southernmost province of Serbia, which is Milosevic's Yugoslav
power base, is that it might reignite the ethnic and religious wars
in the Balkans that NATO earlier worked to resolve in Bosnia with
the commitment of troops.
</P>
<P>
   Critics who until now accused the Clinton administration of
equivocating in facing Milosevic's assault on Kosovo fear that
Albania and Macedonia could be drawn into a larger war or even
break up if the Serbs are not prevented from an ``ethnic
cleansing'' of the Albanian majority in Kosovo. Even beyond that,
it is feared that Turkey and Greece, two NATO members, might take
opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader, voiced
qualified support for the NATO attack. ``Whatever reservations
about the president's actions in the Balkans,'' he said, ``let no
one doubt that the Congress and the American people stand united
behind our men and women who are bravely heeding the call of
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the first uninvited offensive against a sovereign
nation by NATO, the alliance founded 50 years ago as the European
bulwark against the Cold War military power of the Soviet Union.
NATO's 17 days of air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia in
1995 were conducted at the request of the embattled Bosnian
government against military targets of the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   No detailed casualty reports were immediately available. But
scores of Serbian military bases and depots, aircraft and munitions
factories were expected to be targeted by NATO forces equipped with
more than 400 bomber aircraft from European bases, and missile
weaponry aboard a half dozen warships in the Adriatic region.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The operation marked the first combat use of the B-2 ``stealth''
bomber designed to elude radar, according to Pentagon officials who
said two B-2s had journeyed from Whiteman Air Force Base in
Missouri on a mission to drop dropped satellite-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear responsibility for the air strikes lies with President
Milosevic, who has refused to stop his violent action in Kosovo and
has refused to negotiate in good faith,'' said NATO'S
secretary-general, Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO attack began after Milosevic rebuffed a final peace
plea from the United States intended to restore the autonomy that
Milosevic had stripped from Kosovo and its ethnic Albanian majority
10 years ago. Under diplomatic prodding, he signed a peace
agreement in October but then reneged. The proposed peace plan
would end his repression of the Kosovars and include the deployment
of thousands of NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing Milosevic for ethnic violence and atrocity, Clinton
conceded that NATO forces risked casualties against Milosevic's
modernized military. But he warned: ``The dangers of acting now are
clearly outweighed by the risks of failing to act: the risks that
many more innocent people will die or be driven from their homes by
the tens of thousands; the risks that the conflict will involve and
destabilize neighboring nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO attack was authorized after Clinton's envoy, Richard
Holbrooke, paid an 11th-hour visit to Milosevic and failed to
persuade him to join the peace proposal accepted by the ethnic
Albanians. The military task then was placed in the hands of NATO's
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, with
orders to deal with Milosevic's authoritarian assault on the Kosovo
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right decision, and we have to see it through all the
way,'' said Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the NATO action had three objectives: ``to
demonstrate the seriousness of NATO's opposition to aggression;''
to deter Milosevic from ``continuing and escalating his attacks on
helpless civilians by imposing a price for those attacks,'' and
``if necessary, to damage Serbia's capacity to wage war against
Kosovo in the future by seriously diminishing its military
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   While congressional Republican leaders' support of the NATO
attack was qualified, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., declared, ``The
danger of inaction in Kosovo _ of doing nothing _ greatly exceeds
the dangers of the action begun today.''

TEXAS SPEEDWAY GM DENIES WATER PROBLEMS AT TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Eddie Gossage says there are no problems
with water ``weeping'' through the pavement anywhere at Texas Motor
Speedway, a rumor that surfaced in the garage area at Darlington
(S.C.) Raceway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no weeping in Turn 3. There's no real exciting story
here,'' said Gossage, executive vice president and general manager
of TMS. ``All I've got to say is: `Ask me Sunday evening.' It's
frustrating, but we'll go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage was referring to a published report in which NASCAR
Winston Cup driver Ken Schrader and Winston Cup crew chief Jeff
Hammond cited possible drainage problems at TMS. The track had a
new drainage system installed last April and May as part of a $3
million reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he spoke with longtime friend Hammond yesterday,
the eve of qualifying for the NASCAR Busch Grand National Coca-Cola
300 on Saturday. Qualifying for Sunday's NASCAR Winston Cup
Primestar 500 is scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Jeff and said, `Where did this come from?''' Gossage
said. ``He told me he was repeating a rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond, crew chief for Chad Little at Roush Racing, said the
rumor was circulating through the garage area at Darlington Raceway
during the TranSouth Financial 400. The rumor apparently picked up
momentum during a 2-hour, 47-minute rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it was somebody trying to get something started,''
Hammond said from Charlotte, N.C. ``But it had gotten to three or
four different people. I didn't say it was a fact. I said, `Rumor
has it.' From what I understand now, there is no rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie told me, `We've got no problem with anything. There is
no weeping or crying.' I'm glad I got set straight. I like the
track, and I want it to turn out to be something the people of
Texas, and especially Fort Worth, can be proud of. I hope
everything goes well this weekend. I wouldn't want to do anything
to create any more controversy at that place \RTMS\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage confirmed that additional drainage has been installed in
Turn 3 to accommodate the placement of 7,500 temporary grandstand
seats. Another 2,500 temporary seats have been set up in Turn 4 and
2,199 in Turn 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We graded some of the berm up there \Rin Turn 3\S, so it has
positive drainage away from the racetrack. Nothing special there,''
Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   TMS was subject to similar rumors last year in the week leading
up to the NASCAR races. Cup qualifying subsequently was postponed
on Friday evening and moved to Saturday morning after water seeped
through Turn 1 as the sun began to set.
</P>
<P>
   A NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race and two Pep Boys Indy
Racing League events have been run at the reconfigured track
without incident since last spring's water problems. And several
Cup teams have tested at the 1.5-mile quadoval, also without
incident, since December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating to have held two races without any
issues and to have testing all winter long _ with the media in
attendance _ without any issues,'' Gossage said. ``And a week
before \Rthe racing\S, people start spreading rumors.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ To fully appreciate the Astros' dilemma regarding
righthanded reliever Dean Crow, it is necessary to understand the
complicated options process.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The short version: Once a player is placed on the 40-man roster,
he receives three options. That player can be optioned to the minor
leagues any number of times in a given year, but it counts as just
one option. Once all three options have been used, the player must
clear waivers before he can be assigned to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Crow. He's out of options, and his poor
spring showing has the Astros exploring other possibilities for the
bullpen job that has been his to lose. Crow, a Houstonian whom the
Astros acquired in an offseason trade with Detroit, has been
perhaps the biggest disappointment of the spring for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   He has allowed 15 runs on 17 hits and eight walks in just 8
innings. There are instances when players perform better than their
statistics might indicate, but this isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may actually be pitching worse than my numbers reflect,''
said Crow, a product of Stratford High School. ``I've pitched
poorly, and I have no one to blame but myself. Maybe pressure could
be part of it. It's a new organization for me, plus I'm from
Houston. Maybe I'm putting a little too much pressure on myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what to say about it. I've just pitched
poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy solution would be to remove Crow from consideration and
focus on another reliever _ perhaps Brian Williams, who ran his
scoreless-innings streak to 10 Wednesday with two perfect frames
against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But because Crow is out of options, the Astros run the risk of
losing him to another team _ a scary thought considering he was one
of the key players the club received in exchange for Brad Ausmus
and C.J. Nitkowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he ends up being the 11th pitcher (on an 11-man staff)
because he's out of options, so be it,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said. ``He could win by default. But I certainly don't
think that's the way he wants it or the way we want it. But it
could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Astros commit themselves to breaking camp with the
six relievers who appear to be the best at present. In that
scenario, it would be almost impossible to overlook Williams, whom
the club signed to a minor-league contract and invited to camp as a
non-roster player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen is unsettled, and it's time for someone to step up
and take a job,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We're not
just going to carry someone because they're out of options. If
anyone has stepped up and caused us to notice him, it's Brian
Williams. He's thrown the ball really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Dierker and Hunsicker are cautious about reading too much
into spring performances. As Hunsicker said: ``If you just went by
spring training, (Craig) Biggio might be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But the brass has seen a change in Williams, who struggled with
his control during his first stint with the Astros but has thrown
strikes consistently this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to know the people making the decisions are saying
good things about me, but that doesn't mean I'll make the team,''
Williams said. ``That's why I can't worry about that. I feel like
I've shown that I still have good enough stuff to pitch in the big
leagues and help this team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner, Jay Powell and Doug Henry are the only sure things
in the Astros' bullpen. If Xavier Hernandez remains healthy, he'll
join them. Trever Miller also is a good bet, but his spot could be
in jeopardy if Williams makes the team and Scott Elarton is placed
in the bullpen _ a possibility that seems to be gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Working in Miller's favor is the fact he's one of two
lefthanders in the bullpen, the other being Wagner. Nevertheless,
nothing seems as certain as it did when camp opened, and a lot of
it has to do with Crow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a terrible spring,'' Hunsicker said of Crow, who
posted a 3.94 ERA in 45 innings with the Tigers last season.
``There's no way to sugarcoat that. He's a better pitcher than what
he's shown us. The bullpen is just very much up in the air right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And it likely will stay that way until the final cuts are
announced.

NEWELL'S SPIN ON OLOWOKANDI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While several media sharpies were eager to slap
the ``buster'' tag on center Michael Olowokandi before the middle
of his rookie season, Pete Newell, the Yoda of low-post play, is
keeping the faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only seen him on TV a few times,'' Newell, who coached
the Cal Bears to a national championship in 1959 and now runs his
Big Man Camp in Hawaii, said when contacted at his home north of
San Diego. ``But, given the circumstances, he seems to be adjusting
well.''
</P>
<P>
   In 19 games this season, the 7-footer from Pacific is averaging
8 points and 7 rebounds per game, but shooting only 41 percent from
the field. His adjustment has included figuring out which low-post
moves many of those picked up while attending Newell's camp will
pass muster with NBA refs. In particular, the baseline spin move
has been a favorite target of NBA traffic cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfectly legal move,'' Newell said. ``I taught
Shaquille O'Neal the same move and they allow it; I guess Michael
hasn't been in the league long enough or something. It's pretty sad
that some 5-6 guy who never played the game can take away moves
some of these kids have worked many hours to perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   After missing five games with an injured ankle and returning in
less-than-spectacular fashion, Olowokandi had a solid road trip. In
addition to reaching double digits for points in three of the five
games, he grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds in Sunday's victory at
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's going to be a very good player,'' Newell said of his
former pupil. ``It takes time, though. But he doesn't have any ego
that gets in the way of his progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Final Four-cast: Forward Maurice Taylor, a three-year starter at
Michigan, is rooting for Big Ten rival Ohio State to do well in
this weekend's Final Four. Ken Johnson, the Buckeyes' center, was
Taylor's teammate at Detroit's Henry Ford High.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor has no warm feelings for the hated Michigan State
Spartans, who meet top-ranked Duke on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Duke to kick their butts,'' Taylor said of Michigan's
bitter in-state rival.
</P>
<P>
   Point wants to click: Backup point guard Troy Hudson, signed
Tuesday to a 10-day contract, decided to exhaust out any pre-game
jitters with a 45 minutes of shooting drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just gotta be ready,'' said the former Southern Illinois
University star, who played eight games for the Utah Jazz at the
start of last season. ``I have a couple of the plays down now, but
after a bit more practice, I know I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson was summoned back to the big (OK, medium) time because
two Clipper point guards _ Sherman Douglas and Pooh Richardson _
are on the injured list.

METS SEND NOMO TO MINORS, MAY LOOK TOWARD HERSHISER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ After clearing waivers, the
once-celebrated Japanese right-hander Hideo Nomo was sent outright
by the Mets to Triple-A Norfolk Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As a player with three-plus years in the major leagues, Nomo can
decline to accept the demotion and become a free agent. The Mets
expect his decision by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to delete Nomo from the Mets' 40-man roster was a
matter of control _ or lack of it. Last season, he walked 56 in 89
2/3 innings after being traded from the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had not shown the improvement and command of his fastball
that we would have liked to see,'' said general manager Steve
Phillips, who made the announcement Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Occurring less than two weeks to go before the season opener,
Nomo's departure leaves a gap in the Mets' starting pitching
rotation. He filled the No. 4 slot last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several possibilities,'' Phillips said. ``I'm not sure
we can point to any one guy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility may be Orel Hershiser, which would be exchanging
one former Dodger for another. The Mets have made inquiries with
the agent of the 40-year-old right-hander, to gauge what it would
take to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   As a sinkerball pitcher who works rapidly, Hershiser could be a
perfect fit with the Mets' infield, which in the off-season added
the slick-fielding third baseman Robin Ventura to the double-play
combination in shortstop Rey Ordonez and second baseman Edgardo
Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's pitching style is just the opposite of Hershiser's. It
does not take advantage of the Mets' infield.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo walked 186 and struck out 300 over the last two seasons _ a
style that often left his infielders standing around waiting for
something to happen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets seem to be ignoring any financial incentive they have
to dump Nomo outright. If they waive him by next Wednesday, they
can save more than $2 million of his one-year, $2.975 million
nonguaranteed contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the typical approach, but if you want to win,
sometimes you do what you need to do,'' said Phillips, who noted
that the Mets' owners were aware of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hershiser appeared a viable option. He signed a minor
league contract this spring with Cleveland but is a free agent now.
He exercised an option that if the Indians did not put him in their
starting rotation by last Sunday, and they did not, he would be
eligible to sign with whatever team he chooses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hershiser, who has averaged 14 victories over the last four
seasons (although he was 11-10 with a 4.41 earned run average in
San Francisco last season), says he wants to sign with a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage of my career, my priority is winning,'' he said
from his home in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' main competition for Hershiser's services appears to
be the Atlanta Braves. Manager Bobby Cox recently expressed concern
about his No. 5 starter, Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, a former Los Angeles Dodgers standout, is intent on
winning at least 10 more major league games, which would give him
200 career victories and a shot at induction into the Baseball Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins have also been pursuing Hershiser. They are
believed to have raised their one-year offer to about $2.5 million
from $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ends up that I'm a player-coach for a younger team, so
be it,'' Hershiser said. ``But that's not my priority right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he had no comment about Hershiser, after he exited
a closed-door session this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was a no-comment by Phillips on Tuesday that foreshadowed
Nomo's exit. Asked if he had the same sentiment about the pitcher
as the week before, when he said it was highly unlikely he would be
put on waivers, Phillips went through a pained pause before passing
up the chance to give his pitcher some sign of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones and Yoshii, Valentine said spring results can be
deceiving. He is comfortable entering the season with them as
starters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pretty consistent last year,'' Valentine said.
``They gave us a chance to win pretty much every time they went out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, knocked around early in the spring, looked better on
Tuesday, allowing three hits and two runs in five innings in the
Mets' 10-inning, 3-2 victory over Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched in this league a long time and has done a very
good job every year that he's pitched,'' Valentine said. ``Last
year he didn't have as many wins as he usually does, but he
finished stronger. He was stronger in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who was 6-8 last season with a 3.93 ERA pitched
Wednesday night against the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine likened Hershiser's pitching style to that of
Yoshii's, ``as far as pitch selection and competitiveness.'' The
main difference is that Hershiser's asking price has gone up. Way
up.
</P>
<P>
   That is because he has pitched well in spring training, and
injury and uncertainty have had an impact on numerous teams, the
Mets included.
</P>
<P>
   If something happens to improve the Mets' pennant chances,
Valentine will gladly accept it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Mets had passed on Hershiser last winter, and
also let such candidates as Willie Blair and Armando Reynoso
depart.

POVERTY WAS GIRL'S FATAL ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The death of 13-year-old Gricelda Zamora was unspeakably
gruesome and painful, but it was not complicated.
</P>
<P>
   We're about to make it ``appear'' complicated, but it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   We can't stop ourselves, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   Well-meaning people have demanded an investigation into the
needless suffering of the sixth-grade cheerleader, and soon the
newspapers and television stations and radio programs will be
filled with idiot attempts by lawyers and doctors and PR
specialists to ``clarify,'' ``elucidate,'' ``account for,''
``justify'' or otherwise explain the many possible reasons a girl
like Gricelda could enter a hospital with a stomach ache and wind
up dead.
</P>
<P>
   No investigation is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   We know exactly why it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Gricelda Zamora died because she was poor.
</P>
<P>
   We'll try to come up with some other excuse, to provide some
other kind of explanation, because even though most of us are happy
with a health care system that leaves the working poor with little
or no coverage, we don't like to believe the system could kill a
pretty young girl in otherwise good health. &QL; 
A series of tests
</P>
<P>
   So, we play a little game of ``let's pretend.''
</P>
<P>
   We investigate the possibility of mistakes being made at Mesa
Lutheran Hospital, where Gricelda's parents brought their daughter
last week, doubled over in pain and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was run through a series of tests and X-rays, and kept
overnight. But she was sent home in the morning, her parents told
it was a case of stomach inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Gricelda's mother and father don't speak English. Her father
told ``The Republic,'' ``When we left the hospital, she was crying.
She was still in pain and she wouldn't stop vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Would this happen to you?
</P>
<P>
   Could you imagine going along with doctors who want to discharge
a girl who's that sick?
</P>
<P>
   Could you imagine your doctor allowing it to happen?
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe, we decide to pin blame on Dr. Stewart Agren, the Mesa
physician to whom the Zamoras were referred. &QL; 
The doctor's office &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few days after going to the emergency room, the family went to
Agren's office. They had to bring a 14-year-old friend of
Gricelda's with them to serve as interpreter. Antonia Zamora is a
legal resident and has a job, but, still, a man who can't speak
English is looked upon, and treated, differently than the rest of
us.
</P>
<P>
   The family says they were kept waiting and waiting at the
doctor's office, with receptionists seemingly more concerned about
the proper insurance information than the symptoms displayed by the
girl. The doctor's attorney denies this, saying the doctor's staff
offered to treat the girl but the family chose to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gricelda was taken again to the emergency room. This
time, she was airlifted to Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center,
where doctors discovered her burst appendix.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late to save her.
</P>
<P>
   In the days and weeks to come there most likely will be comments
from medical professionals about a ``system breakdown'' and
``errors in judgment,'' when the sad fact is that Gricelda Zamora
got exactly the kind of medical treatment most poor people receive.
</P>
<P>
   The majority are lucky enough to survive it. Some are not.
</P>
<P>
   No investigation by the police or the medical community is going
to change that. And all the hand-wringing and soul-searching in the
world isn't going to alter the fact that those of us lucky enough
to have good health insurance have no interest in setting up a
system that would provide the same care for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   It would bankrupt us, we say.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``socialized medicine,'' we say.
</P>
<P>
   We extend our sympathies. We say it's too bad. But that's the
way it is, and if that costs a family a girl now and again, so be
it.
</P>
<P>
   As long as she's not one of ours. &QL;

IN ABRUPT REVERSAL, FAA GROUNDS KIWI AIRLINES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J. P.R.)  (rk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A day after Kiwi International Airlines thought it had won a
reprieve from a government-imposed death sentence, the Federal
Aviation Administration Wednesday grounded the struggling carrier,
saying that it was unsafe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The agency ordered Kiwi to suspend its entire six-city schedule
immediately, forcing the airline to cancel its daily flights,
beginning Wednesday afternoon and continuing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three flights from Newark International Airport in New Jersey ,
where Kiwi is based, to San Juan, P.R., Orlando, Fla., and Miami
had already taken off Wednesday morning when the order was issued.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the government had shut down a scheduled
carrier since Valujet was grounded in 1996 after one of its DC-9s
crashed in the Everglades, killing 110 people.
</P>
<P>
   The action forced hundreds of Kiwi passengers with return
tickets to make alternate plans and left 80,000 others who paid for
advance reservations on the airline over the next 11 months holding
potentially worthless tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Kulat, a Kiwi spokesman, said that the airline planned
to meet with the FAA Wednesday and was not sure how long it would
be grounded. ``We don't know what's going to happen,'' he said.
``We stand by our safety record. We have flown over 8 million
people without incident.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Kiwi filed for bankruptcy for the second time since
its founding in 1992 and simultaneously announced that it was
receiving a $3 million bailout from Pan American Airlines, the once
world-renowned carrier that itself has risen from the dead twice
since first going under in 1991 and is now a charter carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Kiwi hastily concluded the deal with Pan Am after the Department
of Transportation in Washington threatened to revoke its operating
license because it said that Kiwi did not have competent management
and was not adequately financed. Kiwi lost $20.6 million last year
and owes various airports $750,000 in fees.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the government gave Kiwi 14 days to respond but did
not prevent the carrier from continuing to fly. Indeed, it
specifically stated in a news release issued on Tuesday that the
FAA, which is part of the Transportation Department, had determined
that Kiwi was operating safely.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's complete reversal of that position created confusion
that added to the inconvenience suffered by many Kiwi passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The airline had no representatives at its check-in counter at
Newark Airport in the afternoon, even though scores of passengers
had arrived to find that their evening flights had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Kulat said the Kiwi employees had been sent home. A handful of
airport employees, who work for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, tried in vain to help the stranded passengers make
other plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just chaos all over the place,'' said Jinine Richiusa,
one of the Port Authority workers. ``Most airlines are not honoring
any Kiwi tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what had changed overnight that caused the government to
reverse itself, Eliot Brenner, the FAA's spokesman in Washington,
said that the agency had been examining Kiwi for months and only
reached its final decision to ground the carrier Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said that that the apparent flip-flop was the result of
miscommunication and the Transportation Department's attempt to
draw a distinction between its job of determining an airline's
financial and managerial fitness and the FAA's role of overseeing
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's order cited a series of maintenance and safety
violations that it said resulted in Kiwi flying airplanes that were
``in an unairworthy condition.'' In one case, Kiwi flew one of its
four jets for two days in late February without fixing an oil leak
in one of its two engines, the agency said.

TEMPERS FLARE IN TEMPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ A sure sign players are on edge, itching to leave
camp and get the season started came at the end of Wednesday's game
between the Anaheim Angels and Seattle Mariners at Tempe Diablo
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' Phil Nevin and Mariners pitcher Jose Paniagua had to
be separated twice following the game, which ended when Paniagua
got Nevin to pop out to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, upset that Orlando Palmeiro stole second with two out
and the Angels trailing 9-3, threw a 2-0 pitch just under Nevin's
chin. Nevin said he had no problem with it at the time, figuring
the pitch got away from Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   But after Nevin popped out and began walking toward the dugout,
Paniagua began screaming at Nevin, causing players from both teams
to gather behind the plate. Order was restored, but only
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   As many of the Angels did wind sprints in shallow right field,
the Mariners had to walk past the Angels to get to their bus. When
Paniagua walked by, more words were exchanged. After Paniagua
yelled obscenities and grabbed his crotch, Nevin went after
Paniagua but was restrained by manager Terry Collins and bench
coach Joe Maddon.
</P>
<P>
   After Nevin reached the clubhouse, he told reporters the
incident won't be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm walking to the dugout and he's yelling at me,'' Nevin
said. ``I said `What are you talking about?' He was yelling about
Orlando stealing. He just doesn't know the game. He's telling me
`I've got your number.' I told him I'll give him my phone number
and he can come over to my house. Or I'll go to his house. He's a
disgrace to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Another cast: The results of X-rays on shortstop Gary
DiSarcina's left forearm showed the bone is healing properly, but
because it has not healed completely, he was fitted with another
cast that he'll wear for at least another week.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina was placed on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday,
meaning the earliest he can play is the third game of the season
April 8. DiSarcina will aim to be ready by then, though that would
only give him about a week to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   Also placed on the disabled list effective Wednesday were Justin
Baughman (15-day), Jack McDowell (15-day), Pep Harris (15-day) and
Mike James (60-day).
</P>
<P>
   More injury news: Pitcher Jason Dickson, who has a torn labrum
in his right shoulder, will have arthroscopic surgery today at UCI
Medical Center in Irvine. Dr. Lewis Yocum, who will perform the
surgery, said Dickson's recovery time will depend on the extent of
damage found during today's procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Rough day: Angels starter Steve Sparks got bombed Wednesday in
the Mariners' 9-3 victory. Sparks gave up seven runs (four earned)
and nine hits in six innings. All seven runs scored on home runs _
two by Ken Griffey Jr. and one each by Jay Buhner and Russ Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon hit his team-leading fourth homer for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-pitching performance: WBC welterweight champion Oscar De
La Hoya will throw out the ceremonial first pitch Saturday, April
3, when the Angels play host to the Aguascalientes Railroadman of
the Mexican League at Edison Field.

MARK MARTIN IS HUMBLE ABOUT HIS TEXAS SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Martin was the first driver to turn a hot lap at Texas
Motor Speedway, when he conducted a Goodyear tire test in
September, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first driver to win a race at TMS, taking the
checkered flag at the Busch Grand National Coca-Cola 300 two years
ago in the No. 60 Winn-Dixie Ford.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the second driver to win a Winston Cup race at TMS,
finishing first at the Texas 500 last year in the No. 6 Valvoline
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin owns TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect him to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a special track,'' Martin said of the facility that
plays host to the BGN Coca-Cola 300 and the Winston Cup Primestar
500 this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Martin doesn't like coming to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous facility,'' Martin said. ``You watch
futuristic movies when you're younger and you see all this stuff
that's beyond reality. Well, that's sort of what it's like to me to
walk into that place. I never thought I'd see the day that there
would be facilities like that and that I'd be racing them. I'm
still that same guy who raced dirt tracks in Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it would be out of character for Martin to crow about
his accomplishments at TMS, or anywhere. The 40-year-old driver
from Batesville, Ark., is a walking definition of humble.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had one of the greatest seasons in NASCAR history last
year, winning a career-best seven races. He had 22 top-five and 26
top-10 finishes in 33 starts and finished with 4,964 points, the
most since Cale Yarborough earned 5,000 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an accomplishment,'' he said. ``We were proud of what
we did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, he did not win the Winston Cup championship. That went to
some guy named Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won 13 races, tying the modern-era record. He had 26
top-five finishes and 28 top-10s in 33 races. He earned 5,328
points, the most since NASCAR began using the current system in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was Sammy Sosa, whose 66 homers were the most in the
majors since 1961. Gordon was Mark McGwire, whose 70 homers were a
record.
</P>
<P>
   But just as he isn't the type to boast about things that go
right, Martin also isn't the type to bemoan his luck when they
don't. He doesn't dwell on the fact that a 4,964-point season would
have been good enough to win a championship ever year except for
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not where my focus is,'' he said. ``My focus is
performance. There's a lot of things that you can't control that
have a bearing on that. I'm not going to lose any sleep over the
stuff I can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has won 30 Cup races in his career, including the North
Carolina 400 at Rockingham on Feb. 21. He's won a series-best 33
BGN races, including the Sam's Town 300 at Las Vegas on March 6. He
has won four International Race of Champions titles, including the
past three, beating the best drivers in the world in identically
prepared cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the best driver in Winston Cup racing because he
understands cars and he goes fast,'' said Roush Racing teammate
Jeff Burton. ``Whatever he sits in goes fast. There's no denying
that.''
</P>
<P>
   His resume lacks a Winston Cup championship, but he has finished
second three times. He is the only driver to finish in the top six
in points every year since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow drivers know Martin is a threat to win when the green
flag drops every week. They know he will race hard, but clean. It's
hard to find anyone in the garage area with anything bad to say
about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a lot of respect, and that's very important to me,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin earns that respect not only with his performance on the
track but his demeanor off it. The past two years he refused to
join the chorus of voices criticizing TMS for its litany of
problems from the tight, one-groove layout to the seepage problems
that plagued last year's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I shut it down was because there was a
sensationalized bandwagon slamming the track,'' he said. ``There
was nothing you could do about it that day. You had to race. So
whether they wanted to fix it or not, cared or not, it didn't
matter. We had to race. I've raced on race tracks where the asphalt
has gone up, where chunks have come out of it, where the lights
didn't work right. Everything under the sun in my career. The
circumstances weren't nearly as tough as some I've been caught in.
They've done our racing series a great service by building that
facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Only now, after the reconfiguration that has drivers who have
tested at TMS calling it a much improved track, is Martin willing
to express his displeasure with the way it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' he said. ``I was very disappointed. But
you know what? They fixed it. In the meantime, I got a couple of
wins there.''

MAYOR, IN REVERSAL, AGREES TO MEETINGS WITH BLACK LEADERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Also see NY-POLICE-SAFIR, NY-POLICE-PROTEST)   By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After an hourlong meeting with C. Virginia Fields,
the Manhattan borough president, whom he had shunned for more than
a year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said on Wednesday night that he
would meet again with her and with other leading black officials at
a time when the aftershocks of the Amadou Diallo shooting continue
to rumble through the city.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office also announced that he finally would meet
with the state's highest-ranking black elected official, State
Comptroller H. Carl McCall. The two men last met in November 1994;
since then, the mayor has refused several requests from McCall for
another meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden decision to open his door marked a stark turnaround
for the mayor, who had previously dismissed Ms. Fields and McCall
as being more interested in publicity than in substantive
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor has come under increasing pressure to appear more
conciliatory, as the outcry continues over the death of Diallo, an
unarmed black man killed in a hail of 41 bullets fired by four
white officers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said Wednesday that he expected Police
Commissioner Howard Safir to keep his job, though he declined to
comment on whether it was appropriate for Safir to have accepted a
free trip to Los Angeles for the Academy Awards ceremony from a
cosmetics executive. Safir has been under fire for the trip and for
the conduct of his officers in the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan drew the
largest and most diverse crowd of protesters there since Diallo's
killing on Feb. 4. More than 200 people were arrested and charged
with disorderly conduct, including rabbis, labor leaders and the
elderly, as they gathered for the 12th day of civil disobedience to
protest the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornness for which he is so well known seemed to melt a
bit in the mist that fell outside Gracie Mansion, where the mayor
met with Ms. Fields Wednesday night. Giuliani stood alongside his
former nemesis as Ms. Fields told an assembly of reporters that
during their meeting she had pointed out ``ways in which I felt
that he has not shown the level of sensitivity and understanding
andit has not served to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the mayor offered a defense: ``And I think what I
did is try to explain why I have, as best as I can, tried to
express my sensitivity, my concern, my regret over this situation _
and at the same time not allow a Police Department to be defamed in
the way in which it was being defamed, which could be enormously
destructive to the effort to save lives in African-American and
other communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, who had
brokered the detente, stepped forward. ``This is a beginning,'' he
said, ``a beginning of dialogue, and it's an important, a major
step, in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In another context, a meeting between the mayor and the
Manhattan Borough president would not be newsworthy enough to
persuade reporters to stand in an evening drizzle. But the Diallo
shooting has brought to light the deep fissure that divides
Giuliani and most of the city's top elected black officials.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has dismissed many of the city's black leaders as
``highly partisan'' Democrats who resent his Republican
administration. He and his aides have maintained that they have
been meeting with other black officials, including ministers and
representatives of an African group from Brooklyn. But critics have
argued that the mayor has been selective in choosing those he
deigns to meet; by and large, they say, his meeting are with people
who have city contracts, or are not elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mayor's office has determined that it is time for
``building bridges,'' as Cristyne F. Lategano, the mayor's
communications director, put it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mayor held a press conference that was free of
the dismissive tone that he has sometimes used when discussing the
reaction to the Diallo shooting, particularly the protests.
Although he continued to defend the Police Department, which he
described as one of the best in the country, the mayor also said
that ``there is a reality'' to the feeling ``in the minority
community that police officers are unfair to them.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday night that his
decision to authorize military strikes against Yugoslavia was
derived from moral revulsion at the killing in Kosovo and a
calculated assessment of American interests in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   He said that despite the risks to American and allied forces, he
was compelled to act now because the costs would only increase if
he failed to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the dangers of acting are far outweighed
by the dangers of not acting, dangers to defenseless people and to
our national interests,'' Clinton said in his televised address
from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had been reluctant to commit U.S. forces to the
Balkan conflict and that he had acted only when he was certain that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia would respond to nothing
less than a forceful military action that struck at the heart of
his machinery of oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a didactic 13-minute address, said the NATO attacks
on Yugoslav targets were intended to avert a humanitarian disaster
and to serve American geopolitical interests. He conjured images of
Balkan concentration camps and ``genocide in the heart of Europe''
that offend American moral sensibilities and threaten American
values and interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we and our allies were to allow this war to continue with
no response, President Milosevic would read our hesitation as a
license to kill,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that American and NATO credibility were at stake and
even alluded to an American economic interest in a stable and
prosperous Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave the American people a selective lesson in history
and geography, using colorful maps to locate Kosovo and to
dramatize its historical role as the powder keg of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, will not be contained
in its borders, Clinton warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let a fire burn here in this area,'' the president said, ``and
the flames will spread. Eventually key U.S. allies could be drawn
into a wider conflict, or we would be forced to confront later,
only at far greater risk and greater cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reviewed the tragic history of the former Yugoslavia
after the country spun apart in 1989. He said the West should not
repeat the mistakes that it made in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995,
allowing a bloodthirsty campaign of ``ethnic cleansing'' to rage
for almost three years without outside intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, as a presidential candidate in 1992, criticized
President Bush for failing to act in Bosnia. But once in office,
Clinton did not approve a military response to Serbian slaughter of
Bosnian Muslims until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic only sat down at the peace table after American-led
NATO forces had delivered punishing attacks on his forces in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must apply the same lessons in Kosovo before what happens
in Bosnia happens there, too,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the ingredients for a major war are there, ancient
grievances, struggling democracies and, in the center of it all, a
dictator in Serbia who has done nothing since the Cold War ended
but start new wars and pour gasoline on the flames of ethnic and
religious division,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   The president glossed over important differences between Bosnia
and Kosovo. Bosnia was an independent republic with a mixed Muslim
and Serbian population that invited Western intervention to halt
Milosevic's effort to drive out the Muslims. Kosovo, with a large
ethnic Albanian majority, was stripped of its autonomy but has
remained a part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports autonomy, but not independence, for
Kosovo. But Clinton sowed confusion when he said, ``Right now our
firmness is the only hope the people of Kosovo have to be able to
live in their own country without having to fear for their own
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House official explained that Clinton was referring not
to an independent Kosovo, but to the right of Kosovars of Albanian
descent to live without fear as citizens of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic _ and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who angrily
denounced the air strikes _ contend that the United States and its
allies are intervening in a civil war against the wishes of a
sovereign state, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said Wednesday
evening that Clinton had been presented with a group of unpalatable
choices like doing nothing and introducing American ground troops
into Kosovo. The alternative that he chose, a limited air campaign,
carries significant risks and only modest prospects of success, but
is better than all the other choices, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has been very clear that this is the only choice
among a series of imperfect choices,'' he added. ``We came to an
end-state that is not perfect. But compare it to an end-state of
not acting. There would be chaos and catastrophe of both a human
and a strategic kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Berger nor the president directly addressed the question
of what guideposts they had set for measuring the success of the
operation or what NATO and the United States would do if the air
raids did not halt Milosevic's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said Clinton had been compelled
to act because American and NATO threats had begun to ring hollow
after months of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you threaten,'' Lieberman said in an interview, ``and the
person you're threatening repeatedly does exactly what you've told
him not to do, then you'd better act on your threat or you will
have dissipated your own strength. Nobody, not just in the Balkans,
but around the world, will take you seriously. That's the situation
we were in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken at length on Kosovo several times in the last
five days. In addition to the strategic and humanitarian arguments
that he made Wednesday night, he suggested that America had a
number of other interests in peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Wednesday night in an interview
that he supported Clinton's decision for the air assault. But he
tempered his support with harsh criticism of the president's record
on the Balkans and said Clinton's failure to back up previous
threats with action had undermined the credibility of the United
States and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard a president do what he did a couple weeks
ago,'' McCain said. ``He allowed two deadlines to pass when he said
there would be action, unless deadlines were met. There is a
problem with credibility there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that it was difficult to predict Milosevic's
behavior, but that he did not believe that Milosevic would
capitulate after the initial barrage of air and missile strikes.
McCain complained that the administration had yet spelled out how
it would respond if Milosevic dug in his heels.

 &HT;    Houston man wanted in million dollar insurance scam
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Arrest warrants were issued for six people
Wednesday in an insurance scam that netted millions of dollars in
settlements for staged car accidents and phony injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The scam involved law offices and chiropractor clinics in
Austin, El Paso and Houston and was uncovered by a yearlong
investigation by the Travis County district attorney's office and
other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   According to a search warrant affidavit, the scheme was
organized by a Houston man named Alex Ferdman, 40, who used
businesses across Texas, including the Uptown Austin Rehabilitation
Center in Austin off North Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests warrants were issued for Ferdman and five other people,
four of whom are from Austin. Tuesday, officials also searched the
office of Austin attorney Donna McCarty and law offices in Houston
and El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Ferdman paid others to gather car accident
reports from the police and then call accident victims who would be
referred to a law office involved in the scam. The lawyers in turn
would refer the accident victims to chiropractors who would
prescribe lengthy treatments, regardless of whether the accident
victims needed them, according to court records. The lawyers would
then press the insurance companies for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Ferdman would have ``runners,'' or people he paid
to contact accident victims, stage fake accidents or cause real
accidents in order to generate business, according to court
records.
</P>
<P>
   Ferdman and the five people named in the arrests warrants face
charges of insurance fraud and money laundering. According to the
affidavit, the group laundered millions of dollars through a small
furniture store in Houston. Investigators estimate that about
$200,000 from insurance scams went through the store every month
since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to the affidavit, Ferdman carried a briefcase full of
cash that he would use to pay runners at the Uptown Austin
Rehabilitation Center. In some cases, he would ask his contacts to
pose as lawyers to press insurance companies for legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud schemes like this are common and cost insurance companies
$14 billion annually, said Dennis Pompa, chief fraud investigator
at the Texas Department of Insurance, which also helped in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies may ask for investigations when the same
attorneys show up on claim forms or when the same accident victims
show up again and again.
</P>
<P>
   This particular scheme allegedly involved more than 30 people
across the state. It was thwarted by a yearlong investigation by
the Public Integrity Unit of the Travis County district attorney's
office and 16 other agencies, authorities said. The Public
Integrity Unit receives state money to police ethics in state
government. Its investigations involve a wide range of violations,
including crimes committed by private citizens who deal with the
state or offenses committed by state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Five people wanted by authorities include two employees of
Uptown Austin Rehabilitation Center: manager Victor Hugo Cuevas,
31, and clinic driver Juan Del Toro, 32. The others are Eric
Arriola and Raul Cucvas of Austin, and Armando Casillas of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the district attorney's office searched McCarty's
offices in Austin and Houston, and the offices of attorneys Mickey
Altman and Lloyd Dunn in Houston and El Paso. They also searched
Interstate Rehab, a chiropractic clinic in Houston.

 &HT;    Redd staying, Penn unsure
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Like with any great player whose team
makes it into the glaring spotlight of the Final Four, Scoonie Penn
and teammate Michael Redd already have been asked about their
intentions for next season. Will they stay at Ohio State or turn
pro?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely staying regardless of if we win,'' Redd said.
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference call on Tuesday afternoon, Penn skirted the
question, saying ``right now my main focus is UConn.'' However, he
was quoted in an Associated Press story later in the day saying,
``I'm thinking next year about coming back here and playing at Ohio
State. The NBA has been a dream of mine. But right now, I have no
thoughts about leaving college basketball at all.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Still escaping: Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien has worried all
season about his team's poor foul shooting (61 percent). Each time
he was asked about it, he warned that if it didn't improve soon, it
would cost the Buckeyes a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Well, somehow, OSU has managed to keep winning despite shooting
60 percent from the foul line in NCAA tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we've needed to make free throws at the end, we've done
that,'' O'Brien said. ``But I've been telling kids one of these
games our free throw shooting is going to do us in.''

NEW YORK STATE SENATE AGAIN PASSES BAN ON TYPE OF ABORTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For the third time, the state Senate Wednesday
passed a bill outlawing a form of abortion, continuing a national
debate over the procedure, which opponents call partial-birth
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Assembly is deeply divided over the issue, people
close to Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said it was
likely that he would prevent the bill from coming to a vote in that
house, as he has in years past. Advocates of the ban believe it
would win passage in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, has said he would sign the
bill if it came to his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight states have enacted some version of the measure.
The law has been challenged in court in 20 of the 28 states, and in
18 it has been struck down completely or in part. Alabama's ban is
partly in force as it awaits a court ruling. Only in Virginia has
the law been upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has passed bans, but two times has narrowly failed to
override President Clinton's vetoes. In referendums in Washington
and Colorado last year, voters rejected the ban.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Republican-controlled Senate voted 41-19 Wednesday
for the ban, which it passed in different form in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is akin to infanticide,'' said Sen. Serphin
Maltese, the Queens Republican who sponsored the bill. ``I think
this is a reprehensible, absolutely barbaric practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Dollinger, D-Rochester, his voice rising to a
shout, replied to Maltese, ``Don't you dare be in the maternity
room with me, my daughter, my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure at issue, a fetus is extracted from the uterus,
all except the head, and a doctor then punctures the skull to
remove the brain, before pulling the head out. Anti-abortion groups
call that partial-birth abortion; doctors use the term intact
dilation and extraction.
</P>
<P>
   Most versions of the ban are written so vaguely, opponents say,
that they could apply to any abortion procedure. Courts have
generally agreed, finding the laws unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents often describe the procedure as a form of
late-term abortion, but medical groups say it is used any time
after 16 weeks of pregnancy, less than halfway through a normal
40-week pregnancy. Abortion in the final trimester of pregnancy is
already illegal around the country, except when the life and health
of the mother are in jeopardy.

NEED A REASON TO BOO GORDON? HE'S GOING TO WIN SUNDAY 
COMMENTARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beyond driver introductions, the boo-birds who typically
serenade Jeff Gordon at racetrack after racetrack during the NASCAR
Winston Cup season have had little chance to exercise their vocal
cords at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Gordon has won three of the past four Cup championships, a
record-tying 13 races in 1998 and two of five events this season.
</P>
<P>
   At TMS, however, the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet
has been just another banged-up hunk of sheet metal. Swept up in
wrecks during the inaugural Interstate Batteries 500 and the Texas
500 last year, Gordon has posted respective finishes of 30th and
31st.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Gordon's most ardent detractors _ and TMS security
has you on videotape _ who could work up a good ``boo'' about
results like that?
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Gordon finished 87 laps behind winner Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gordon finished 82 laps behind winner Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 668 total Cup laps run in Fort Worth, Gordon has led 69,
all in the early stages of the first race.
</P>
<P>
   That said, remember we are talking about racing on the ``old''
TMS. Which is why it makes perfect sense to me that Gordon is going
to win the Primestar 500 on the ``new'' TMS this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham did not have a lot of holes
in their race-day resumes entering the 1999 season, but three
venues historically and admittedly have given them fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Las Vegas, Atlanta and Texas _ those are the tracks that we
have at the top of our list to have better finishes at,'' Gordon
said last weekend at Darlington, S.C. ``We've done pretty well at
the other two \Rthis month\S, and hopefully we can keep it going in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   All three tracks on Gordon's short list are 1.5-mile triovals,
although AMS and TMS have been reclassified as ``quadovals'' since
their recent reconfigurations and repavings.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finished third at Vegas behind the Burton brothers, Jeff
and Ward, on a track that is banked at 12 degrees. AMS and TMS, of
course, are banked at 24 degrees, so without a sneak peek into
Evernham's notebook we have to assume that whatever chassis setups,
etc., clicked at Vegas would not get it done around AMS or TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, however, what worked at AMS should
transfer to the ``new'' TMS. And in case you have been too busy
booing to take note, Gordon has won the past two races at Atlanta
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   More so, Gordon said after the Cracker Barrel 500 on March 14
that he finally has a combination with which he feels comfortable
at NASCAR's fastest non-restrictor-plate racetrack. Very timely,
because open testing at TMS has indicated the track _ with its
wider, driver-friendly entrance into Turn 1 and exit out of Turn 4
and new pavement _ should be a couple of miles per hour faster than
last year.
</P>
<P>
   And forget about one lap of qualifying for a moment and think
about the 334-lap race _ and what Gordon and Evernham and the
Rainbow Warriors are capable of orchestrating once they get
dialed-in with a setup. Think about how they plot strategy, down to
their patented two-tires only (and fuel) pit stops in the waning
laps. It all worked to perfection at Hampton, Ga., and there is no
reason to believe it will not fall into place again in Fort Worth
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot of comments about how the Texas track now is
very similar to, and it drives very similar to, Atlanta,'' Gordon
said. ``So, that's certainly promising.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreboding, actually, might be a better description. And let us
not forget that unlike the previous two years at TMS, Gordon will
be running in the Coca-Cola 300 NASCAR Busch Grand National race on
Saturday. Gordon debuted his No. 24 Pepsi Monte Carlo, the car he
is driving in a limited five-race schedule, at Vegas with a nice
fourth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he racked up laps at one of NASCAR's newest
venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I have not had many laps at Texas, so I definitely want
to get more,'' Gordon said. ``Doing it in the Busch car is one of
the reasons why we picked that track. And from what I learned in
Vegas on Saturday, I think it will definitely help me out in Texas
on Saturday for Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   At least I'm buying it. So boo-birds, better get your vocal
cords ready.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
Martin the team owner?
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kenseth was a protege of NASCAR Winston Cup star Mark
Martin longbefore Kenseth pulled off a 10th-place finish Sunday in
relief of the injured Bobby Labonte at Darlington Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin is interested in establishing a formal owner/driver
relationship with Kenseth, the NASCAR Busch Grand National points
leader heading into the Coca-Cola 300 at Texas Motor Speedway on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jack Roush, who owns Martin's No. 6 Valvoline Ford
Taurus, said he is willing to get involved with Kenseth, the
27-year-old Wisconsin native who is planning to run five Cup races
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's come forward and said he would like to be an owner in
the team and would enjoy seeing the team operating under Mark
Martin Racing, or something like that,'' Roush said. ``It's in the
developmental stages.''
D.W. must crank it up
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Cup champion Darrell Waltrip heads into the Primestar
500 at TMS without the safety net of a provisional start for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, who is in his initial season of driving the No. 66 Big
Kmart Ford Taurus owned by Carl Haas and Travis Carter, has used
his allotment of four provisionals in the first four races. The
team slid to 30th in car-owner points _ 25th is the cutoff _ after
last weekend's uncompetitive 41st-place finish at Darlington
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip is ineligible for a non-chargeable points provisional
under NASCAR's complicated system.
</P>
<P>
   That means he must qualify among the top 36 on speed at TMS, or
sit out.
</P>
<P>
   D.W. now has gone 200 consecutive races since his last victory,
at Darlington, on Sept. 6, 1992.
Last laps
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one NASCAR Winston Cup regulars will attempt to qualify
for the Busch Grand National Coca-Cola 300 at Texas Motor Speedway
today. In all, 62 drivers are entered for 43 starting spots.
</P>
<P>
   Only four drivers have finished in the top 10 in both Winston
Cup races at TMS _ native Texans Terry and Bobby Labonte, Steve
Grissom and Michael Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Waltrip, driver of the No. 7 Philips Ford Taurus, will
attempt to qualify for his 400th career Cup race at TMS. He never
has won a Cup race. Last words ``Anybody that puts a whupping on me
gets my respect.''

ISMAIL'S AGENT HAS RUN OUT OF TOMORROWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Mula is my new agent.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to read an immediate quote from Mula that tomorrow I will
announce a peace settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Also tomorrow, according to my man Mula, I will reveal how
traffic congestion has been eliminated for Sunday in north Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned tomorrow, when I solve the mystery of the Rangers'
rotation. By tomorrow, I will have also filed a missing persons
report on Dirk Nowitzki.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss tomorrow, Mula will tell you, when Mayor Barr and
myself officially declare Love Field closed to air traffic. Then be
sure to catch tomorrow's political bombshell when I break the story
on George W. Bush's tabbing Molly Ivins as his presidential running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger yet, however, will be Mula's announcement that receiver
Rocket Ismail has signed with the Cowboys. That will be tomorrow,
of course. And if not then, by the weekend, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Jack Mula? And why doesn't he simply keep his mouth shut
until there is something to say?
</P>
<P>
   Based on what's been observed over the past three weeks, it
would be a decade of tomorrows before I'd consider hiring Mula for
anything, including yard work. But he's Ismail's agent, along with
Doug Flutie's, so if they are happy, I'm happy.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past three weeks, Mula has appeared in local print
four times saying Ismail is ready to reveal where he will make a
free- agent landing. Tomorrow is the day, so sayeth Mula.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday, Ismail was still a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be this hard. Only two teams _ the Cowboys and the
Carolina Panthers _ are in the running for Ismail's services.
Ismail has played for Carolina the past three seasons. He is
building a new home in Charlotte, N.C. But all indications are he
will sign with the Cowboys. Tomorrow. Which means it will probably
be Carolina. Tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   If Ismail is this indecisive running his routes, who would want
him anyway? But is it Ismail, who has never uttered a public word
throughout the process, or is it an agent making his client look
goofy? Mula keeps setting deadlines that are never met.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys don't seem particularly concerned one way or the
other, but the $5 million signing bonus they've offered Ismail
suggests they are dead serious. The way to bet is that Dallas will
be Rocket's new home. The fact the Panthers want him back at a much
higher salary also speaks to perceived value.
</P>
<P>
   But the lines of communication between Mula and Ismail are
apparently flawed. Why don't you try to fix that, Jack. Like,
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   There are those in the NFL who wonder if Ismail is worth this
wait. And basically, his career performance chart backs up that
theory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rocket is just that, and The Cowboys are desperate for a
speed receiver after the offensive shutdown in the second half of
last season. Ismail can provide fast feet. Until 1998, however, he
had never provided any reason to be considered a free-agent plum.
</P>
<P>
   For three seasons with the Raiders, and two in Carolina, Ismail
carried a ``bust'' label. But 69 catches and 1,024 yards in 1998
almost doubled his best from any previous year. He had 11 career TD
catches in five seasons, then eight last year.
</P>
<P>
   To begin '98, the Panthers had no plans to start Rocket. But an
injury to Rae Carruth provided an opening, and ...
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys suddenly became very interested in Ismail's
free-agent status. A career year in a free-agency season is
normally tagged with red warning flags, but Valley Ranch has a
different view.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail has spent his NFL career catching passes from Kerry
Collins, Steve Beuerlein, Jeff Hostetler and Vince Evans. When a
heady quarterback like Beuerlein took over last season for Collins,
the Rocket took off.
</P>
<P>
   So what would he do with Troy Aikman whistling balls his way?
</P>
<P>
   Everything considered, Ismail is in the right place at the right
time to provide exactly what the Cowboys need. In other words, he
runs fast and at least for one season _ last season _ he showed the
stuff of a first-class receiver.
</P>
<P>
   That the Cowboys are after Ismail makes sense. That their
financial offer to Ismail is said to be larger than Carolina's also
makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   But what no one can decipher is why Jack Mula keeps babbling.
When the decision is made, tell us then. And not tomorrow.

HICKS SITS IN JUDGMENT OF RANGERS' STAFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ In the circus-like atmosphere that
followed the Yankees to Charlotte County Stadium yesterday, Rangers
owner Tom Hicks, standing to chat with visitors just before game
time, found fans pushing their way between him and his seat
adjacent to the home team dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' Hicks said with an easy smile, ``I'll get it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good. Rangers fans should feel very comfortable with the
fiercely competitive and well-heeled Hicks in the organization's
prime seat.
</P>
<P>
   How comfortable everyone else should be remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the one small problem I have with the Rangers' new
owner.
</P>
<P>
   The question that lingers, as the Rangers prepare to launch
their first full season under Hicks' ownership, is whether jobs are
on the line. So let's get that one out of the way immediately.
</P>
<P>
   You bet they are.
</P>
<P>
   If jobs were hanging in the balance in late September last
season _ and they were _ while Hicks waited to see whether the
Rangers were going to win the AL West, why wouldn't the same
scenario hold this year?
</P>
<P>
   No, Hicks didn't say that. There are too many unanswered
variables at this point for him to hazard a guess as to whether
Doug Melvin, or Johnny Oates, or his coaching staff might find
themselves in trouble at some point this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an unfair question,'' Hicks said, ``and it's an
impossible question to answer in a vacuum. How bad are we? What
injuries did we have? What were the extenuating circumstances?''
</P>
<P>
   Without being able to fill in those blanks and overflowing with
the usual optimism of spring, the furthest thing from Hicks' mind
is a scenario in which somebody's job could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, it is an unfair question. Yet, it has lingered through
the winter like the smell of mildew on an old gym towel, a leftover
from those frantic last weeks of September, when the Rangers were
fighting to pull away from the Angels and the future of Oates and
his coaching staff was hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it clear how I felt last year,'' Hicks said. ``I wanted
to wait to see if we won the West before extending contracts. That
was just good business.''
</P>
<P>
   Good business in the corporate world, maybe, but it was highly
unusual in baseball for a contending team's coaches to be left
hanging that late in the season. At the same time that they were
trying to win a pennant, Oates and his coaches were forced to
discreetly make calls to their friends in baseball to see what jobs
might be available, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has proven himself as an excellent manager. He has won
division titles in Texas two of the past three seasons. He has
beaten a 25-year history of losing and of teams that were deemed
better by most baseball experts. No one can say he should have done
more with the talent at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   His players respect him and play for him. He is not only a good
baseball man, but a good man, period.
</P>
<P>
   He and his coaches should not be approaching a season wondering
whether their jobs will be forfeited if, heaven forbid, John
Wetteland can't pitch, or Rafael Palmeiro's knee doesn't come
around, or Juan Gonzalez's back starts to act up.
</P>
<P>
   Or what if it's not injuries? What if it's simply that the
pitching staff stinks, a distinct possibility? Or three or four key
hitters have off-years?
</P>
<P>
   Those, presumably, are the variables and extenuating
circumstances that Hicks was talking about. All indications are
that he is a just and fair man and will take all those things into
account.
</P>
<P>
   Last September's hesitation, however, continues to nag.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal right now is just to win the AL West,'' Hicks said.
``I don't think that's going to be easy, because the Angels are
improved and they're going to be tough, and I think Seattle will
probably be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also think that if we can get into the playoffs, we'll
do better than we did last year \Rwhen the Rangers were swept in
three games by the Yankees\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Rangers are stronger with Hicks as the owner.
He's straightforward, accessible to his people, quick to understand
problems and creative at getting them resolved. When Melvin
suggested the Rangers should try to sign Randy Johnson this
off-season, Hicks was ready with his checkbook. Ditto for Melvin's
efforts to trade for Roger Clemens, who wanted his contract
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks is also a quick study. His seat comes with built-in heat
and tough decisions, but he's earned it.
</P>
<P>
   He's smart enough to know that Oates has earned his, too.

BILL WOULD GIVE PRISON GUARDS TAX-FREE DISABILITY FOR HEART
AILMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York state Legislature plans to pass a
bill giving 25,000 state correction and security officers the
coveted and controversial right to retire with a tax-free
disability pension of three-quarters pay if they suffer any kind of
heart ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers conferred that benefit, which classifies all heart
trouble as job-related, to police officers and firefighters more
than 20 years ago, stirring a long-running dispute over whether the
policy is easily abused.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the policy assert that it allows some workers to
collect generous disability pensions for illnesses unrelated to
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both the Republican-dominated state Senate and the
Democratic-led Assembly are moving to approve a ``heart bill'' for
correction officers, whose union has sharply stepped up its
lobbying and political donations in Albany in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the legislation would represent only the second
expansion of the policy, which is among the most generous in the
country, officials said. Last year, with little notice and over the
opposition of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Legislature approved a
similar bill for 10,000 correction officers in the New York City
jails, and Gov. George Pataki signed it.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has not said whether he would sign the new bill,
which also applies to security officers at state mental
institutions. But a veto appears unlikely, considering that he
supported the earlier legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much the bill would cost the state. The state
comptroller's office, which manages the state pension fund, said it
had not yet analyzed its impact. The Giuliani administration
estimated last year that the legislation affecting New York City
would add at least $3.5 million annually in pension costs, and
probably more.
</P>
<P>
   The unions representing state and city correction officers have
pushed for the benefit for years, saying that their members face
the same kinds of dangers as police officers and firefighters and
thus deserve similar protections. They say jails and prisons are so
stressful that it is indisputable that officers' heart ailments are
job-related.
</P>
<P>
   The state union, Council 82, has become one of the most generous
campaign contributors in Albany, giving more than $600,000 to state
candidates in the last two years alone, including $85,000 to the
Republicans who control the State Senate and $90,000 to the
Democratic majority in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Curran, a spokesman for Council 82, attributed the
union's success on the legislation to its improved lobbying office
in Albany, saying that the contributions were not a factor. He said
union members had repeatedly called lawmakers around the state to
muster support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opposing this would be like saying that mom doesn't deserve
flowers on Mother's Day,'' Curran said. ``Our guys walk the
toughest beats, deal with the people that are not fit to walk our
streets. Enactment of this legislation is completely and totally
justified.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Lorenzo Romar, who just finished his third season
as head coach at Pepperdine, reportedly interviewed for the vacant
position at Saint Louis University on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Romar would be the fourth candidate to interview at SLU,
according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Illinois State's Kevin
Stallings, Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson and Southern
Illinois-Carbondale's Bruce Weber, all head coaches, have
interviewed for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The Billikens were 15-16 this past season under Charlie
Spoonhour, and 8-8 in Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a secretary in the Pepperdine athletic department
said Romar is scheduled to be out of his office the rest of this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine is 42-44 under Romar. The Waves have improved their
won-loss record each season, though, from 6-21 to 17-10 to 19-13
and an NIT appearance this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Romar, 40, was an assistant at UCLA from 1992-96 prior to coming
to Pepperdine. He said in a February interview that he would not
actively seek a job elsewhere and a school would have to make first
contact for him to be interested.

critic for The Wall Street Journal and writes frequently about the
arts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   About five years ago, the actor Tony Goldwyn started getting
restless. ``I'd gotten to the point in my career where I knew I
would get work _ I knew the mortgage would get paid,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His performance in the 1990 off-Broadway play ``The Sum of Us''
had put him on the New York theater map. The same year, his
portrayal of the yuppie villain in ``Ghost'' had done the same in
Hollywood. But he wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor,'' he says, ``your involvement in the filmmaking
process is limited: you show up, you make your contribution and you
leave. I felt, `Is this what I want from my life, just to be
providing services?'''
</P>
<P>
   His response was perhaps inevitable for the son of the movie
producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and the grandson of the Hollywood
legend Sam Goldwyn. He would find a script he wanted to act in and
produce himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, if I'm in a big hit movie, and become financeable,'' he
recalls thinking, ``I'll say, `Here's a script I've always wanted
to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   He saw it as something that might happen 10 years down the road.
But it didn't turn out the way he expected because of a script
called ``The Blouse Man,'' by a poet and playwright named Pamela
Gray. Seizing on the screenplay, Goldwyn filmed it as ``A Walk on
the Moon,'' which opened on Friday. And although Goldwyn does not
act in it, he is indeed one of the producers and, more important,
its director.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray, who grew up in Brooklyn, based ``The Blouse Man'' on
her memories of the Catskills, where she spent summer vacations
with her family. A California boy, Goldwyn knew nothing of the
annual summer exodus that brought working-class Jewish families
from New York City to ``the mountains'' during the 1940s, 50s and
60s. And he was only 9 years old during the summer of 1969, when
Neil Armstrong planted his boots on the lunar surface and some
400,000 hippies turned a concert in upstate New York into a
cultural watershed.
</P>
<P>
   But he fell in love with Ms. Gray's story of Pearl Kantrowitz, a
young Brooklyn mother, who is drawn into an affair when the spirit
of Woodstock invades her Catskills bungalow colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really identified with that moment that usually happens to
people in their early 30s,'' says Goldwyn, now 38. ``You suddenly
see your life laid out in front of you. And you say, `Is this the
life I dreamed of having? Am I the person I wanted to become?' If
the answer's no, that's a very scary moment. And sometimes what it
takes to deal with that is very risky: it requires shattering the
status quo. And I thought the setting for Pearl's love affair, in
1969, was the perfect metaphor, because that's exactly what was
happening to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Walk on the Moon,'' recreates the summer ritual of cars
overflowing with bedding, suitcases and kitchenware heading north
toward the low-rent cousins of fancy resorts like Kutsher's and the
Nevele; loudspeakers announcing the arrival on the premises of the
ice cream truck or the knish truck or the blouse truck; al fresco
mahjong games during the day, third-rate comedians or old movies in
the ``casino'' at night.
</P>
<P>
   It's the man who sells the blouses, played by Viggo Mortensen,
who disturbs the equilibrium of the Kantrowitz family: Diane Lane
as Pearl, dimly aware that she's missed something; Liev Schreiber
as her decent but dullish husband; Anna Paquin as their pubescent
daughter, and Tovah Feldshuh as Pearl's shrewd mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always watched directors on all the films I've worked on
and thought, `I'm so glad that's not me,''' Goldwyn says, sitting
barefoot in the airy living room of the rambling Connecticut house
he shares with his wife, Jane Musky, who is a movie production
designer, their two daughters and their two dogs and two cats. ``I
had tremendous admiration for directors, and I didn't know if I
possessed the skills required. But it didn't seem like a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   His plan was to produce the film and let someone else take on
the ``anxieties'' of directing. He'd been helping Ms. Gray refine
the script. It was ``never black and white'' she says, ``but he
helped me put in more shades of gray.'' And he was wondering how on
earth he would find a director who shared his passion for the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Then one spring day _ he remembers the moment vividly _ while
getting a massage in the Hoboken, N.J., neighborhood where he and
his wife had renovated three brownstones before moving to
Connecticut, it hit him: if he wanted ``A Walk on the Moon'' to
reflect his vision, he would have to direct it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him order around the household pets _ ``Sit!'' he says
sternly to the dogs, who blithely ignore him _ is perhaps not the
best introduction to his directing abilities. But when the
4-year-old, Tess, who's been in bed with a nasty reaction to a
vaccine, awakens flushed and feverish, Goldwyn coolly takes charge,
quiets the wailing child and brushes off the suggestion of a call
to the doctor. You get the idea that his unflappable assurance
could come in handy on a movie set.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray confirms the impression. ``He was a calm, steady center
in the midst of chaos,'' recalls Ms. Gray, who was around for the
entire 36-day shoot last summer in the Laurentian Mountains of
eastern Canada. ``He was doing damage control every minute, but he
was always the most focused person there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I decided to direct it,'' Goldwyn says, ``I thought, `OK,
this is going to be a war, and I'm just going to tough my way
through it.''' One of its producers, Dustin Hoffman, also resorts
to military imagery: making a movie, he says by telephone, is like
being in a foxhole. ``And you want a director who makes you feel
it's OK to get up and charge, but who helps you stay relaxed _
`don't worry, you won't get killed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Goldwyn ended up directing a film he had wanted to
produce, Hoffman ended up producing a film he had wanted to direct.
He had read the screenplay and thought he might like to try his
hand at directing it. When he found that Goldwyn had got there
first, Hoffman and his production company joined the project as
producers. ``It was the next-best thing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The two actors had never met. But, Hoffman says: ``We hit it off
right away. After a couple of conversations, we knew we were
responding to the same things in the script. It's like a first
date: you know pretty quickly if there's going to be a second.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Hoffman's Punch Productions involved, the movie could
actually be made. Ms. Lane gives Goldwyn high marks for his
``tenacity and follow-through.'' Speaking by phone from California,
she says: ``They ought to give Oscars to the people who get to the
green light. That's a pure labor of love, because you never know if
it's actually going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's participation did more than just insure that ``A Walk
on the Moon'' would happen, Goldwyn says. ``What's so brilliant
about Dustin,'' he says, ``is that he's always looking for the
possibilities, never saying, `It's done.' And having a creative
voice telling me that made us a really good combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn also got advice from his father, who had been
encouraging him to direct. `` `You can do more than act,' he would
tell me,'' Goldwyn says. ``And I'd go, `Yeah, Pop, leave me alone.'
But I think one of the things that led me to say, `Yes, I should do
this,' was that I'd heard it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn's father admired Ms. Gray's script, but though he was
encouraging, he couldn't quite understand why his son was so driven
to make the film.
</P>
<P>
   When the elder Goldwyn saw a rough cut of ``A Walk on the
Moon,'' ``He got it,'' his son recalls; ``He said, `I understand.
You made a movie about love.' And then he gave me lots of notes. I
involved him a fair bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a new element in their relationship, he says. ``We've
kept our careers separate _ deliberately. When I was starting out
as an actor, we sort of had a rule: it was my thing. I didn't want
his help, nor did he want to give it; nor (italics)could(end
italics) he have, really.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may be a little hard to swallow for struggling actors
without two generations of movie contacts in the family, Goldwyn
makes a plausible case, recalling how his brother John, now
president of Paramount Motion Picture Group, would sometimes
suggest to a director that Tony read for a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get the appointment,'' Goldwyn says, ``but the directors
were just doing it as a favor to my brother. They would glaze
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn, whose parents divorced when he was 5, is descended from
show business royalty on both sides of his family. His maternal
grandfather was the playwright Sidney Howard, and his mother,
Jennifer Howard, and her mother, Claire Eames, were both stage
actresses.
</P>
<P>
   His lineage, Goldwyn says, ``is a tremendously important thing
to me; it's the fabric of who I am, and I'm very grateful and proud
to be part of that.'' On the other hand, he continues, ``starting a
career in show business with a famous last name is a total drag.
Because when you have a legacy of success of that caliber, it's a
pretty high standard to hold yourself to. You can't just do OK It
took a while to develop the confidence to say: `I think I'm doing
the right thing. This is what I was meant to do.' Then, on the
other side, there is the perception of you as this Hollywood kid,
and people assume you're a dilettante trading on the family name.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn says his interest in acting came from his mother's
introducing him to the theater. ``The movie business held no
romance for me,'' he says. ``But the theater did. And theater
actors did. There was something magical about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he began acting in plays at his Colorado prep school. There
was no doubt that he would go east for college (he attended
Hamilton College in upstate New York and Brandeis University in
Massachusetts): from the age of 10, when his father took him along
on a trip to New York, he had been mad for the city. ``Somehow the
East Coast always felt like home to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He won his Equity card working as an apprentice at the
Williamstown Theater Festival for three summers. It was there that,
at 21, he met his future wife, then a 27-year-old assistant set
designer. ``She's a very decisive person, and it was like, `You're
it; I know.''' He went on: ``We didn't get married for six years.
But I knew early on that I'd gotten it right. It ties into why I
was interested in this movie: like Pearl, I was in a marriage that
I had entered into very young. I understood the impulse to want to
break out.''
</P>
<P>
   His marriage, he says, has withstood that impulse. But he
(italics)has(end italics) broken out of the acting career that was
giving him pause five years ago. He had to drop out of two movies
during the two years it took him to bring ``A Walk on the Moon'' to
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are two more screenplays he has fallen in love with, and
he and Hoffman are planning to work together again, with Goldwyn
directing Hoffman as a Las Vegas chiropractor. Directing doesn't
scare him any more. ``It was fun,'' he says.

HAVING INVOKED THE POWER OF FATE, AN OPERA FEELS IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>

Journal, The Atlantic Monthly and other publications.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Last month, after an absence of 20 years, ``La
Forza del Destino'' returned to La Scala, where in 1869 Verdi
introduced the opera in its significantly revised, definitive form.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century _ from the late 20s to the mid-60s _
audiences in Milan could count on two revivals per decade; in the
40s alone, there were four. But even as the consensus of informed
opinion has been advancing the reputation of the composer's lesser
as well as his greatest works, the challenge of realizing some of
them in performance has grown all but insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   Riccardo Muti, the music director of La Scala, is not one to
capitulate. Several seasons back, he lifted the curse on ``La
Traviata,'' unfazed by memories of Maria Callas, whose specter was
thought to condemn all future Violettas in Milan to public
disgrace. With ``Forza'' _ a title more clearly and less lazily
Englished as ``The Power of Fate'' than as the more familiar
``Force of Destiny'' _ the malignancy is harder to name.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Macbeth'' in the playhouse, the opera exists in its own
microclimate of unease. The blood chills at the chronicle of
Leonard Warren, a stalwart of the Metropolitan Opera, who launched
Don Carlo's scena with the words ``Morir! Tremenda cosa!'' (``To
die! A dreadful thing!''), collapsed and expired, his aria unsung.
</P>
<P>
   One night in late February, the premiere of the new ``Forza''
safely past, warning bells began sounding virtually with the rise
of the curtain. The overture, a Muti specialty, had set the house
ablaze with the tempestuous passion and soul-sick melancholy that
toss and churn at the opera's core.
</P>
<P>
   But with Leonora's opening aria, all that was lost. Of the
Spanish noblewoman's anxiety on the threshold of elopement, the
soprano Ines Salazar conveyed little, and what mainly registered
was an incapacity to project any but her high notes past the
footlights.
</P>
<P>
   Then Alvaro, the half-breed Inca royal, came bounding in, in the
person of Jose Cura, looking like a million bucks, and choked on
some airborne foreign particle. Instead of conjuring up the dazzle
of the rising sun (``god of the Indies''), he covered a coughing
fit as best he could, with his back to the house. The trilling
flute, at least, dazzled right on cue.
</P>
<P>
   In the next scene the vivacious mezzo-soprano Luciana d'Intino,
telling fortunes as the Gypsy wench Preziosilla, added a memory
lapse to the blotter, but this was minor, and she never looked
back. As for the prima donna, her later and more demanding scenes
failed to improve on the initial impression.
</P>
<P>
   Cura, on the other hand, returned after a cryptic announcement
to give a shattering portrayal of his strange character, so
honor-bound, so prone to self-abasement, so fierce of temper.
</P>
<P>
   He probed especially deep in the haunting battlefield duet
``Solenne in quest' ora.'' Here, the wounded Alvaro, expecting to
die, exacts his only friend's promise to consign to oblivion the
secret that gnaws at his heart. Neither brother officer suspects
that under their noms de guerre they are hunter and quarry:
Leonora's brother, Don Carlo, is out to avenge the death of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Cura gave the gloomy opening phrases an unearthly lightness, as
if his soul were already hovering at the mystic threshold, but in
the serene melody that follows, he let the light go out, steeping
in solemnity a moment more conventionally played for the false
comforts of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   The tapestry of ``La Forza del Destino'' is woven from precisely
such tangled threads, which to some minds condemns it as an absurd
mass of confusions. The action, drawn with liberties from a messy
Spanish original, stretches credulity, certainly, but only for
those whose experience of life is so narrow that they suppose
coincidence to be the invention of the likes of Shakespeare and
Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   Alvaro's gun fires accidentally in Act I, and Leonora's father
takes the bullet. How far-fetched is this? More questionably, the
lovers _ separated in flight, tragically mistaken about each
other's fortunes _ meet again years later. Unsuspecting, they have
retreated to the same monastery, she as a hermit in disguise, he
having taken vows and a new alias.
</P>
<P>
   A likely story, some sniff. But again, how far-fetched is this?
The ``coincidence'' reflects the properties of character that have
brought them to this pass, and character is destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The literal-minded balk, too, at the way unrelated characters
major and minor keep bumping into one another across the maps of
Spain and Italy. Those who prize consistency of tone object to the
all but plotless Shakespearean episodes of camp and tavern life,
which interrupt the arc of high romantic tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It all seems so lumbering and ``Russian,'' in the manner of
``Boris Godunov.'' In point of fact, Mussorgsky's procedures mimic
those of Verdi, who wrote ``La Forza del Destino'' for St.
Petersburg and unveiled it there in 1862, six years ahead of that
most Russian opera of them all.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the flaws of ``Forza'' are more apparent than real.
Emotional states create their own geography, as the split focus on
two nonintersecting planes of action defines its own genre: an
opera ``a intenzioni,'' Verdi called it, an opera of ideas. (``Bad
ideas if you like,'' he added parenthetically.)
</P>
<P>
   As the title suggests, the work carries a framework of
philosophical speculation that most operas do without; it promises
to reveal not only what happens to the actors but also the story's
hidden causes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the common run of humanity _ Preziosilla, the
soldiers, even the irascible lay brother Melitone, who answers
Leonora's knock at the monastery gates and works the soup kitchen
with an ill grace _ is the unconsidered life, a constant rushing
hither and yon to little consequence.
</P>
<P>
   For exceptional, tragic souls _ Leonora, Alvaro, Don Carlo, the
Padre Guardiano who hears Leonora's confession and admits her to
the hermitage _ fate is manifest at a flash point or two or three.
Only then, and suddenly, does life take on meaning. The drama of
such people as this consists of moments of passage. In between,
empty years of contemplation stretch like the desert.
</P>
<P>
   One great moment of passage occurs when Leonora arrives at the
monastery. The slate is empty. The high tremolo of violins sheds a
single ray of hope, undercut by an enigmatic pulse of plucked
cellos and double basses. In this void, with the soprano line
discreetly doubled by flute, oboe and clarinet, the outcast senses
that her father's cursing shade has ceased its pursuit. She is on
hallowed ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pace, pace,'' her aria in the final scene, captures the
intensity of the still intervals, and the panic as a new crisis
approaches like a whirlwind. For an act and a half (a fictional
span of many years), since closing the door of her cell behind her,
Leonora has been lost to view. This was as it had to be. In the
meantime, her life has been consumed in private thought.
</P>
<P>
   Divas capable of sustaining the theatrical illusion while doing
justice to the music do not come along every day, as Verdi knew.
``I can't imagine without laughing the idea of la Lotti with her
crinoline and her fichu dressed as a man and as a monk,'' Verdi
wrote his publisher when that lady's name was floated for Naples.
``Anyway, you need different blood in your veins to do that part.''
</P>
<P>
   In living memory (as documented in available recordings),
Callas, Renata Tebaldi and Leontyne Price all mustered the proper
cell count. So did Galina Gorchakova in a concert performance of
the St. Petersburg version at the Kirov Opera under the baton of
Valery Gergiev in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, Gergiev fielded a bewitching Preziosilla in
Olga Borodina, a casting choice that in itself went far to
vindicate the opera's unconventional balance. (The presence at the
work's Italian premiere, in Rome, of the glamorous Marchisio
sisters, Carlotta and Barbara, may have achieved the same effect.)
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev's Alvaro was the robust Armenian tenor Gegam Grigorian,
who strove manfully with a far more daunting challenge than that of
the standard score. Here, too, Verdi knew how much he was asking
for. He accepted the commission from St. Petersburg largely at the
urging of the renowned tenor Enrico Tamberlik and tailored Alvaro
to his exceptional prowess.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Il Trovatore,'' Tamberlik had Verdi's blessing for an
unwritten high C from the chest to cap ``Di quella pira''; with
``La Forza del Destino,'' the concession worked the other way.
Contrary to his usual practice, Verdi instantly transposed from the
key of C to the key of B flat a bravura cabaletta for the tenor
aria that in the Milan score disappeared altogether. ``No one,''
Verdi wrote his publisher, ``will be able to perform what was
written for Tamberlik.'' ( Grigorian did sing the cabaletta, in C.)
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Gergiev recorded the St. Petersburg ``Forza'' for
Philips and took the work back to the stage in the original decor
(``very opulent,'' according to the composer). It argues artistic
conscience in Gergiev to have revived ``Forza'' for his home
company in its native form.
</P>
<P>
   For all other stages, the right choice is the Milan revision,
which boasts a superior overture, irons out some wrinkles in
continuity, gives tenors less feisty than Grigorian a fighting
chance and substitutes for an abrupt ending of blasphemy and
violence a more mature finale of conditional acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Outside St. Petersburg, even the most important houses come to
grief casting the opera these days. To Muti's credit, the recent
travails did not invalidate the epic breadth and vivid novelistic
detail he achieved through La Scala's chorus and orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   His predicament resembled James Levine's when the Met took its
last shot at ``La Forza del Destino,'' in 1996. On that occasion,
Placido Domingo revisited Alvaro after 20 seasons, to noble effect.
For the rest, the conductor, orchestra, chorus and maybe a
secondary singer or two valiantly set the stage for principals who
were not there.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a revival the next season, starring Luciano
Pavarotti in what would have been a preposterously late debut as
Alvaro, went unkept. (In a Met first, all scheduled performances of
one opera were replaced by another, ``Un Ballo in Maschera,'' an
assignment Pavarotti could still manage.) This from the company
that first presented ``Forza'' with a cast led by Enrico Caruso,
Giuseppe de Luca, Jose Mardones, and the 22-year-old phenomenon
Rosa Ponselle, fresh from vaudeville.
</P>
<P>
   Like St. Petersburg and Milan, New York has bragging rights
where this singular masterpiece is concerned. But staking a new
claim is proving tough.

   WASHINGTON _ Waves of NATO strikes Wednesday opened what
officials said would be a protracted assault on the Yugoslav
military, but one that would do little immediately to end the
deadly crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The first barrage of several dozen cruise missiles started
falling on air defenses across Yugoslavia, Pentagon and NATO
officials said. They were fired from six B-52 bombers and four
American ships, two American submarines and a British submarine.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief lull, American warships fired another burst of
cruise missiles at a target, not long before dawn in Yugoslavia.
That strike _ involving only a handful of missiles _ was not part
of the original plan but rather came after NATO commanders saw an
opportunity to hit Yugoslav aircraft that had returned to one of
their bases, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes also pressed new attacks, the officials said,
describing rolling waves of strikes. ``It's a fairly continuous
attack,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive entailed scores of fighter jets and bombers from
the United States and seven other NATO members, including Britain,
Germany and the Netherlands, the officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's strikes were not aimed at the Serbian troops and
tanks that have been systematically destroying village after
village in Kosovo with renewed fury since peace talks collapsed
last week. The battering focused largely, though not entirely, on
the air defenses and command network that pose the greatest threat
to allied pilots crisscrossing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a few days of this,'' a NATO official said, ``before
you can put in a larger number of the aircraft you need to go after
the forces involved in the repression.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks Wednesday included strikes by F-117 ``stealth''
fighters, as well as the combat debut of the B-2 ``stealth''
bomber, which at $2.1 billion apiece is the the most expensive
warplane ever built. Two of the B-2 bombers, flying from Whiteman
Air Force Base in Missouri, each dropped 16 one-ton bombs.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Yugoslavia mounted a fierce defense, though not
precisely the one expected, American and NATO officials said. The
Yugoslav air force, which is made up largely of Soviet-era MiG
fighters, joined the battle against NATO's warplanes, in what
officials said was the most serious air-to-air combat since the
Persian Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The MiG's provided the bulk of the Yugoslav resistance
Wednesday, the officials said. The Yugoslav ground forces evidently
did not fire their surface-to-air missiles, perhaps because their
own planes were in the skies, making it harder to distinguish enemy
jets.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said all American and allied
aircraft had returned safely to their bases after their raids,
despite assertions by Yugoslav officials to have downed a NATO
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported Wednesday night that NATO pilots were
confident that they had shot down at least three MiGs. Two of the
pilots reporting shootings were Americans, the other Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, declined to discuss the operation in detail. But they
vowed to press the attack until the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, agreed to end his repression of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians or until his armed forces posed little threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are striking a range of military targets, including
Yugoslavia's extensive air defense system, its command and control
system and the military forces that Yugoslavia is using to suppress
the Albanians in the province of Kosovo,'' Cohen said at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Yugoslavia, including television images showing
buildings in flames, said the sites hit included an air base near
Batajnica, an aircraft plant near Zarkovo and targets around
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of strikes in other Yugoslav cities,
including Krusumlija, Pancevo, Novi Sad, Golubovac, Danilovgrad and
the air base near Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, a city that
during Communist rule was called Titograd.
</P>
<P>
   One NATO official said Wednesday's assault was the first of at
least three nights of strikes. Such attacks enable American and
NATO forces to build on their technological advantage, the official
said. Each night of strikes will be followed by a day of work to
assess damage and prepare for new raids.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said the campaign could last much longer,
depending on factors including weather and the success of
Yugoslavia's defenses. The officials said they had a clear idea of
how much damage NATO hoped to inflict, though they would not say
how it would be measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we want to accomplish,'' a senior Pentagon
official said.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton and the Pentagon have described the
military objective as the degrading of the Yugoslav military's
ability to wage war against insurgents in Kosovo, officials said
they still hoped that the severity of the opening shots would
encourage Milosevic to relent. By day's end, there was no sign of
that, with Yugoslavia declaring a state of war.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military poses a far more formidable threat to
pilots overhead than Iraq's battered air defenses ever could during
four nights of American and British raids in December or during the
skirmishes that have continued since then.
</P>
<P>
   In particular the Pentagon fears that Yugoslav's air defenses
could pose a serious threat. They include 60 sets of Soviet-era
SA-2, SA-3 and SA-6 surface-to-air missiles, as well as hundreds of
antiaircraft batteries and even shoulder-fired missiles that could
down a low-flying jet.
</P>
<P>
   In planning the raids, the Pentagon has predicted that at least
a dozen American and NATO aircraft may be lost if the fighting
continues, a senior Air Force official said. ``Given time, we can
take it all down,'' the official said. ``But that comes with a high
degree of risk, a risk that we as a country have not been used to
in some time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days ahead, the strikes are expected to include new waves
of cruise missiles, including those fired from the British
nuclear-powered submarine Splendid, which last October became the
first non-American ship equipped with American cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen took pains to say that the strikes were aimed at
Milosevic's ``military infrastructure'' alone and that NATO forces
were avoiding civilian casualties.

MAKING PHILADELPHIA MORE FRIENDLY FOR ITS ORCHESTRA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Anne Midgette writes frequently on international art, music and
theater.  
 By ANNE MIDGETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Ask a Philadelphian to name the most beloved
building in the city, and chances are, the answer will be the
Academy of Music. An elegant brick edifice on Broad Street, the
academy opened in 1857 and is the oldest continuously operating
music hall in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It has a passionate following among music lovers, many of whom
regard it as virtually synonymous with its oldest resident company
and landlord, the Philadelphia Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Yet love can be blind, or in this case, deaf. The hall's
acoustics are poor, at least for orchestral music. Built as an
opera house, the academy has a proscenium arch that traps the
sound, which comes across in the auditorium as dry. As a result,
said Peter Dobrin, a music critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer,
``Philadelphians have never really heard the Philadelphia
Orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not the first to notice. An emphatic article in a
newspaper here stated that the Philadelphia Orchestra, the only
major American ensemble to play on a proscenium stage, should have
a proper hall of its own. That was in 1908. Successive generations
have taken up the cry. Plans for a new hall were drawn up during
the music directorships of Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy,
Riccardo Muti and now Wolfgang Sawallisch.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a plan may be realized. Ground was broken last November
for a new Regional Performing Arts Center, with a 2,500-seat
symphony hall and a 650-seat recital theater, scheduled to open in
2001. The current project has also served to spotlight some of the
orchestra's difficulties as it approaches its centenary season and
tries to keep pace with the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the center, in its final form, is not an orchestra
project at all. The Philadelphia Orchestra will move into its new
home as a tenant, not a landlord. And the orchestra was ultimately
glad to be rid of the responsibility. The question remains whether
the center's new administration, will be able to repeat the success
of other performing arts centers, from Lincoln Center in the 1960s
to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center more recently, in
revitalizing the community.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was quite what the orchestra had in mind when it
announced plans for a new hall in 1986. It purchased a site on
Broad Street, a block south of the academy, and commissioned the
Philadelphia-based architect Robert Venturi to design the building,
assuming that Philadelphians would flock to donate the $140 million
needed to realize the project. But fund-raising efforts, marred by
a degree of hubris, soon slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised $25 million and hit a plateau,'' said Joseph H.
Kluger, who has since become the orchestra's president. ``There was
a latent emotional resistance from those attached to the idea of
the academy and the orchestra in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them were the leading philanthropists Walter H. Annenberg
and R. Anderson Pew, who also sat on the orchestra's board. The
Annenberg Foundation refused to give any money to the new hall
project, and the Pew Charitable Trusts offered $1.5 million, which
the orchestra undiplomatically rejected as being too low.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pew and Annenberg did have funds for another project,
proposed in 1994: a thorough overhaul of the academy, at a
projected cost of $44 million. Renovation was certainly overdue.
The building's technical facilities were outdated, and its very
structure proved increasingly unsound. Yet the renovation initially
planned was so high-tech that it would have compromised the
building's architectural integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken goal was to turn the academy into such a modern
hall that the orchestra would have no reason to leave. The Pew
trust chipped in $7.5 million and the Annenberg Foundation $10
million for the project. The renovation is still in progress,
although the plan was ultimately scaled down to focus on restoring,
rather than transforming, the academy, to the tune of $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a new hall, meanwhile, seemed to have ground to a
halt. The orchestra was having problems of its own, culminating in
a debilitating 64-day strike in 1996. The strike ended with both
sides working on constructive changes, like instituting a range of
players' committees to give musicians a more active role in the
orchestra's business life.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Philadelphia's colorful, charismatic mayor,
Edward G. Rendell, assumed a major role. Since taking office in
1991, Rendell has overseen the transformation of a sleepy
Philadelphia, a conservative city that abhorred change, into a more
active place. Center City, as the downtown area is called, is
dotted with construction sites, including 15 new hotels to
accommodate visitors to the five-year-old convention center.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has bolstered the city's morale, and both Rendell
and Willard G. Rouse, the developer responsible for the convention
center and other major buildings, enjoy widespread popularity.
</P>
<P>
   One of Rendell's pet projects is the Avenue of the Arts, which
has basically redefined South Broad Street by developing its
theaters and other arts facilities. Rendell is motivated less by a
great love of the arts _ he prefers sports _ than by his idea of
the changing definition of a city in today's world: no longer a
necessary hub of commerce and industry, in an age of
telecommunications, which have effectively decentralized business
activity, but a ``destination,'' a place for tourism and
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to office, we were desperate to get out of
economic crisis'' Rendell said. ``One way to do that was to build
up Philadelphia's status as a destination. We need to make
Philadelphia attractive for companies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his motivation, Rendell became an energetic champion of
the new hall, and he marshaled a group of community leaders,
including Rouse, to find solutions that would enable it to be
built. It was this group that developed the idea of acquiring both
the Broad Street site and the academy from the orchestra and
managing both facilities for a number of resident companies,
including the opera and the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   And it was this group that ultimately became the board of the
Regional Performing Arts Center in 1997, with Rouse as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Adding other arts companies to the mix afforded further
justification for civic involvement, demonstrating that the new
hall project was about more than just the orchestra's wish for
better acoustics. Philadelphia suffers from a chronic lack of
performance space.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 study analyzing the number of seats in performing-arts
facilities in 15 major American cities, Philadelphia, the
fifth-largest city in the United States, came in last. San
Francisco has about 8,400 seats per million residents; New York,
6,000; Philadelphia, between 600 and 800.
</P>
<P>
   The academy is desperately overcrowded. It has two resident
companies besides the orchestra _ the Pennsylvania Ballet and the
Opera Company of Philadelphia _ both straining to get more time.
The thriving opera company, restricted to 30 evenings a year, has
had to turn away would-be subscribers. The ballet performs ``The
Nutcracker'' as many as three times a day to make the most of its
window of opportunity; when it can't get into the academy, it
wanders from hall to hall, like other arts institutions in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, larger touring ensembles, from orchestras to
Broadway shows, pass Philadelphia by. ``When you think about the
Vienna Philharmonic coming to this country and not coming to
Philadelphia,'' said Stephanie Naidoff, the new center's president,
``it leaves you salivating.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Naidoff, a corporate lawyer, and the center's other
administrators have little experience in the arts, but thanks to
Rouse, they knew about building. They threw out the Venturi plans
and commissioned the architect Rafael Vinoly to design the new
center. His plans, with two individual halls inside a glass barrel
vault, were unveiled last April and became one of those rare things
that Philadelphians agree upon. The enthusiasm generated $50
million in donations by the time of the groundbreaking, six months
later.
</P>
<P>
   But the price tag has gone up considerably over the years, and
the center, despite having received $73 million of state and city
funds, is still $50 million short of its $255 million goal. And the
Annenberg and Pew foundations are still withholding support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain large trusts have yet to recognize their
responsibilities,'' said Sidney Kimmel, the chairman and director
of Jones Apparel Group and, with a pledge of $15 million, the
largest private donor to the center. ``I see it as that, a
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Annenberg, 91, a publishing magnate and former ambassador to
Great Britain, who declines comment to the press, is evidently
simply opposed to the idea of a new hall. In 1992, according to an
article in The Philadelphia Inquirer, he specified that none of his
$20 million donation to the Avenue of the Arts should go toward the
new hall project.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pew trust, the issue is different. Conscious of its
leading role as a patron of the arts in the United States, the
foundation in 1997 introduced new guidelines for the distribution
of funds to Philadelphia organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This Cultural Leadership Program has made waves by cutting off
longtime recipients that fail to meet new criteria, like ``fiscal
stability.'' The orchestra briefly lost its financing in 1997, and
the ballet was turned down in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, they cannot be running a significant deficit,''
said Rebecca W. Rimel, the president of the Pew trust. ``There is
no ambiguity about the rules, and while a lot of people might not
agree with them, I don't think anyone would say we are exercising
our stewardship in an arbitrary or capricious way.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, Ms. Rimel added, has yet to make it over Pew's bar.
``We are supportive of having a new facility in Philadelphia. And
we think it's a beautiful building. Our concerns boil down to,
after it's built, what will it cost to run it? And what is going to
be the impact on these already fragile arts organizations when
their rents go up? If those two questions can be answered, our
board would be very willing to consider the grant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pew trust's questions about finances seem not altogether
unreasonable. The center's administration has so far been long on
rhetoric and short on concrete figures. It is still not clear, for
example, how much companies will have to pay to use the spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for answers,'' said Robert B. Driver, the director
of the opera company, which would like to increase its presence in
the academy to 50 evenings a year. ``They say I'll be paying
approximately what I'm paying now. That's not enough. I'm paying
too much as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But most people believe that prices not only for the academy but
also for the two new halls will have to be considerably higher than
the current norm to keep the center running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know the specifics of scheduling policies and
booking policies, and how we were going to run the box office, and
things like that,'' Ms. Naidoff said. ``We had to get everyone to
recognize that the definite agreements will come somewhere down the
line. I learned early on, don't promise things you're not sure you
can deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although it no longer officially controls the center, the
orchestra is still intimately involved with the project. A players'
committee meets regularly with the center's design team _ Vinoly,
the acoustician Russell Johnson and the theater consultant Richard
Pillbrow _ to outline the orchestra's needs in its new hall, from
rehearsal rooms to door sizes. And the chairman of the orchestra's
board, Peter A. Benoliel, sits on the center's board, as does the
donor Kimmel.
</P>
<P>
   One thing still to be negotiated, evidently, is where the
center's responsibility begins and the orchestra's ends. It is not
even clear when and how the center will take over the academy from
the orchestra, though it is to happen by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The public's identification of the center with the orchestra can
only be strengthened by moments like the intermission of a concert
conducted by Sir Simon Rattle last month. Sir Simon has been cited
as a desirable replacement for the departing music director,
Sawallisch, but was reported in January to have given a clear no to
the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Rouse, the center's chairman, offered a toast to the ``best
conductor in the world,'' informing Sir Simon that ``Philadelphia
is not a town that takes no for an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, any offer to Sir Simon should be the
responsibility of the orchestra rather than the center, though like
any ardent suitor, Kluger, the orchestra's president, is happy for
all the help he can get.
</P>
<P>
   The center needs the orchestra as much as the orchestra needs
it. For the orchestra remains the principal guarantor that once the
new center is built, there will be something to put in it. Resident
chamber and dance companies may occupy the recital theater, but
they will hardly fill the larger auditorium. And while the center's
administration dreams of presenting a range of touring ensembles,
it lacks the experience necessary to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly,'' Ms. Naidoff said, ``if this thing is going to
work up to the world-class standards that we want for it, we're
going to have to bring in professionals who have worked in these
areas before.''
</P>
<P>
   With right of first refusal for dates in the new center, the
orchestra is effectively getting its long-desired new hall without
taking a significant financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   '`There is a difference between renting as tenants and having
your own space, after 40 years of autonomy, even if it makes sense
intellectually,'' Kluger said. ``On the other hand, if there's a
deficit, it's their problem, not our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   For the orchestra musicians, construction of the center, now
that it has started, is not a topic of burning relevance. ``This
orchestra has been hearing for 10 years that it's going to get a
new hall,'' said David Cramer. a flutist. ``O.K., so now they've
dug a hole, but it's down the street. People don't see it every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern are the search for a new music
director and the renegotiation of the players' contract, which
comes up for renewal this year. Management would presumably like to
follow the New York Philharmonic and other orchestras in extending
the traditional three-year contract to five years or more.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra could then negotiate the transition
to the new hall and a new music director without the threat of
labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Regional Performing Arts Center highlights
America's increasing recognition of the arts as an essential part
of a city's makeup. From Los Angeles to Newark to Miami, the arts
are touted for their potential economic benefit, so that community
leaders without a specific interest in the arts, like Rouse and
Rendell, are stepping forward like Renaissance dukes to support
them.
</P>
<P>
   But in order for a center to live up to this economic potential,
there has to be creative excitement as well. And while Philadelphia
administrators focus on fund-raising in their efforts to complete
the new center, it will take quality performances as well as
attractive architecture to insure that Vinoly's cello-shaped hall
and airy atrium join the academy on the list of Philadelphia's
most-beloved buildings.

THE HIDDEN TRACK: ALREADY A WORN TRICK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Scott Sutherland writes about music and culture and lives in
Portland, Me.  
 By SCOTT SUTHERLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The music of Whitney Houston, the Offspring, Robert Earl Keen,
Sheryl Crow, Korn, Beck and Jewel has little in common, but the
musicians do share one thing: they all included hidden tracks on
their most recent CDs.
</P>
<P>
   From hip-hoppers to singer-songwriters to rockers, more pop
artists than ever are adding hidden tracks _ bonus tracks that are
not listed on the song lineup _ in an effort to surprise, delight,
mock or annoy fans. Hidden tracks can last a matter of seconds or
30 minutes or more and range from original songs to uncategorizable
noise.
</P>
<P>
   They can be the best thing on an album, or they can be so
juvenile and gratuitous that they prompt listeners to reconsider
the artist's entire oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually hidden tracks are just the artist trying to be cute,''
said Bob Ludwig, owner of Gateway Mastering in Portland, Maine, who
has mastered thousands of pop albums over the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden track is merely the latest entry in a long list of
pop-music gimmicks, the digital equivalent of the LP track designed
to be played backward. Today's listeners have been inundated with
hidden tracks and other ruses (like albums with successive blank
tracks) for so long that they have come to expect a surprise on
every new CD, just as kids expect a plastic trinket in a box of
Cracker Jack.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of hidden tracks has indeed inspired
musicians to devise new tricks: CD-ROM drives enable musicians to
add still images and video clips to their albums, and the new DVD
disks, with their enhanced video and sound capabilities, will no
doubt prompt artists to invent yet more needless surprises.
</P>
<P>
   But enough already. It's time for musicians and labels to
rethink why they hide what they hide. If most artists have a hard
enough time filling even half the space on a 74-minute CD with
compelling material, why bother hiding something equally
uncompelling? And if a song is good enough to be the best thing on
the disk, why hide it at all?
</P>
<P>
   Call me a killjoy, but I'm not alone. ``I don't see the point of
hidden tracks,'' says Paul Chesik, manager of the pop-music
department at Tower Records in Greenwich Village. ``The whole
shtick is well past the point of being interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidden tracks are largely the product of digital technology;
antecedents from the days of LPs, like the Clash's hit ``Train in
Vain (Stand by Me)'' on the band's 1979 album ``London Calling,''
are rare. Unlike LPs, on which each song was marked by plainly
etched grooves, the smooth surfaces of CDs give nothing away about
the contents. Almost as soon as CDs were introduced in the early
80s, musicians began adding hidden tracks to their albums.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters like Doug Mayo-Wells, who runs a Washington-based Web
site (www.pathetic-caverns.com) that includes a segment called
``The official pathetic scoop on hidden tracks,'' trace the current
rash of hidden tracks to the unlisted song on Nirvana's 1991 album
``Nevermind.'' ``The song is called `Endless Nameless,' and it's
basically just Kurt Cobain screaming at the top of his lungs,''
Mayo-Wells says. ``You'd see hidden tracks once in a while before
`Nevermind,' but after that it seemed like everybody had to have a
hidden track.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those tracks were excellent, like the instrumental at
the end of Pearl Jam's 1992 album ``Ten,'' the Ramones' remake of
the ``Spider-Man'' theme on their 1995 album ``Adios Amigos'' or
the slow-dance number at the end of John Hiatt's 1996 album ``Walk
On.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, had few if any redeeming qualities, like the 15
minutes of gibberish at the end of the Lemonheads' 1993 album
``Come on Feel the Lemonheads.'' Others simply mocked the
convention: Beck's 1996 album ``Odelay'' ended with a minute of
noise that sounded like a harshly industrial cuckoo clock, while
Ash, a chart-topping power-pop group from Ireland, capped off its
fine 1996 album ``1977'' with 30 minutes of muddled conversations,
punctuated with the sound of a person vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the final word in hidden-track mockery appeared at the
end of the 1997 Ben Folds Five album ``Whatever and Ever Amen,''
when an obnoxious, unidentified male voice said, ``Look, man, I got
your hidden track right here, pal _ right here, listen'' and
proceeded to malign the character of Folds.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Verna, reviews editor for Billboard magazine, defines an
ideal hidden track as a song that offers a contrast _ an alternate
take of a song, different instrumentation, a different point of
view in the lyrics _ to the prevailing mood of an album. But he has
a hard time coming up with a good example. When pressed, he names
one that's close: ``Subway,'' the hidden track on Ms. Crow's
Grammy-winning album, ``The Globe Sessions,'' a song in which Ms.
Crow vents her disgust over the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subway'' is just one of a host of recent songs that suggest
musicians may have had enough of nonsensical hidden tracks. Whitney
Houston's latest album, ``My Love Is Your Love,'' includes an
earthy, soulful remake of ``I Was Made to Love Him,'' produced by
Lauryn Hill; Ms. Hill, meanwhile, includes two fine hidden tracks
on ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' which won five Grammys last
month: a cover of ``Can't Take My Eyes Off of You,'' and ``Tell
Him,'' a Hill original that sounds like an homage to Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Offspring include a brief Tex-Mex version of
their hit ``Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)'' on their new album
``Americana.'' Beck makes up for the dreadful hidden track on
``Odelay'' with a nice instrumental on his latest album,
``Mutations,'' and Korn kicks in an amusing version of Cheech and
Chong's ``Earache My Eye'' on its latest, ``Follow the Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But if musicians have begun to realize how self-indulgent the
practice is, record labels, as evidenced by their packaging and
marketing of albums with hidden tracks, still seem perplexed. ``My
Gift to You,'' the final song on Korn's album, clocks in at about
seven minutes, but the liner notes list it at 15 minutes 40 seconds
_ a pretty good indication that there's more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Houston's album bears a sticker on the CD case, helpfully
informing listeners that the album includes a hidden track, a
strategy that seems to be catching on among the major labels. Such
inconsistencies suggest that record companies want it both ways:
they embrace hidden tracks as proof of the musician's boundless
creativity only to trumpet them to the music-buying public in an
attempt to sell more albums in a highly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, gimmicks always succumb to the bottom line, which is
why it's time to retire this threadbare convention and move on. As
Verna puts it: ``A lot of the mystery has gone out of the hidden
tracks thing. To tell you the truth, I always got a much bigger
kick out of spinning records backwards than finding hidden tracks
on CDs.''

MEMO TO HOLLYWOOD, RE TV: IT'S NOT THAT BAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM MCDONALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)You people sit there day after day, night after night,
all ages, colors, creeds. We're all you know. You're beginning to
believe the illusions we're spinning here. You're beginning to
think that the tube is reality and that your own lives are unreal.
You do whatever the tube tells you. You dress like the tube, you
eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube, you even
think like the tube. This is mass madness, you maniacs!(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   _ Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch), addressing his
television audience in the 1976 film ``Network.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O.K., O.K., television is evil. It corrupts the young. It turns
our brains to mush. Americans got the message in 1961, when the
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission looked out upon
the television landscape and saw that it was bad. ``A vast
wasteland,'' he thundered. Everybody nodded in agreement, then
flipped through the TV Guide to see what was on that night.
</P>
<P>
   But the phrase stuck _ became lodged, in fact, in the national
corpus of received wisdom and stock phrases. For a time it was
gravely invoked by critics, scholars and politicians. Finally, worn
out, it was tossed onto the ash heap of cliches, to be retrieved
and reused thereafter only with ironic intent. Television, it
seems, had stopped being the worst thing ever.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say we had learned to stop worrying and love the
tube. People, with good reason, have never stopped beefing about
television: there's too much sex, there's too much violence, there
are too many commercials, there's too much Howard Stern. Tasteless,
mindless television has afforded generations of critics a decent
living, and no one has argued that families don't watch enough TV
together.
</P>
<P>
   But what you seldom hear nowadays is the kind of
monster-in-a-box jeremiad that Paddy Chayevsky delivered in his
bracingly barbed ``Network'' screenplay _ the kind of rant heard
even more regularly in television's early years, when the TV set
was becoming as common as a coffee table in the American home,
giving rise in mandarin circles to dark portrayals of the medium as
an insidious influence that would surely sap the minds of Americans
if not their precious bodily fluids.
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't hear much of that anymore, unless you happen to be
at the movies. Curiously, at a time when the viewing public shows
signs of having withstood television's lobotomizing effects and has
even begun exerting a kind of power of its own over the medium
through remote control, VCRs, CD-Roms, home video, computer
link-ups and all kinds of niche cable choices, the movies have
their dials stuck on a quaint, flickering, black-and-white vision
of the tube.
</P>
<P>
   The settings may differ, so may the plots, but there's a thread
running through them that might be traced back to George Orwell and
the postwar fears of water-tainting, mind-policing totalitarianism.
In this portrayal, television is a nightmarish force _ soulless,
invasive _ even if its theater of operations is something of a
dreamscape.
</P>
<P>
   That's a reference to ``The Truman Show'' and ``Pleasantville,''
both of them television movies, if you will, set in surreal
environments. ``Pleasantville'' is about two 90s teen-agers who
magically wind up in a 50s sitcom; ``Truman'' is about a manchild
who has, unawares, lived his life in Pleasantville _ actually a
fantastic variation on it called Seahaven _ where his every
breathing moment has been televised and turned into a hit show.
</P>
<P>
   Both movies were in theaters last year, meaning that if you
watch them now you watch them _ appropriately somehow _ on
television, as videos. And both think the worst of the medium, one
finding hypocrisy aplenty in the amiable sitcoms of the past
(``Pleasantville''), the other intimating a callous and
manipulative televised future (``The Truman Show'').
</P>
<P>
   As for the here and now, there is ``EdTV,'' another film with a
bad feeling about television, only this one has a more
good-natured, comical way of showing it, with little of the
sardonic edge of the others. It's another sure-to-please offering
from Ron Howard (it opened on Friday), and it's sure to remind you
of ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In this movie, though, the protagonist, Ed Pekurny, an affable
but aimless video clerk played by Matthew McConaughey, lives not in
an eternally chirpy custom-made utopia but in the downbeat real
world, and he not only knows his life is being televised, he wants
it that way: round-the-clock coverage is the prize he won in a
contest run by a struggling cable channel, and it's his ticket out
of his rut.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a deal struck with the Devil. A Faust in blue jeans,
Ed soon discovers that becoming a media darling has a harrowing
price: the cameras trailing his every move, turning the days of his
life into soap opera, rob him of privacy, sour his relationships
and actually make him rather glum. In short, on the supposition
that it takes one to make one, television has created a monster.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, let this be a lesson to us all about the emptiness and
destructiveness of our voyeuristic fascination with celebrity and
our misdirected hunger for fame. We're so in thrall to television
that we can no longer tell the difference between real life and
what's on the screen. Howard Beale had it right, you'd have to
conclude.
</P>
<P>
   Ed, however, is too nice a guy, or too dumb, to be pilloried for
a larger social failing. Blame must fall on those evil electronic
eyes stalking him and the cold, calculating, ratings-driven
executives who run the channel and eventually hold Ed hostage to
it. Television is ruthless, television is intrusive, but worst of
all television poisons family life, ruins emotional health and
deadens the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty scary. No wonder Howard has the cast clowning it up or,
when Elizabeth Hurley is on the screen playing a temptress,
practically screaming sex.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so bald intrudes on Peter Weir's ``Truman Show,'' one of
the blackest sun-drenched movies ever made. Yet in many ways ``The
Truman Show,'' even though it was released first, is a logical
extension of ``EdTV.'' Both films blur the lines between
make-believe and reality, and both portray television as a sort of
ominous surveillance operation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In ``Truman,'' 5,000 cameras in the placid suburban soundstage
that is Seahaven watch the unsuspecting Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey)
day and night, as they have since he was plucked from an
abandoned-baby ward and given his own show without his ever being
let in on it. In Truman's world, all is treachery and deceit behind
a pastel veneer of amity: everyone in ``The Truman Burbank Show''
is a hired performer but the star.
</P>
<P>
   His cookie-baking wife is for all intents and purposes the call
girl next door, her services paid for in this case by the studio.
His best friend not only looks as if he came out of a beer
commercial, he is one, carrying a six-pack product placement
wherever he goes. Truman's world is the inverse of a paranoid's, a
place where a man of sound mind has no idea that everyone around
him really is part of a grand conspiracy against him.
</P>
<P>
   But the people Truman sees are bit players beside the one he
can't, Christof, the Dr. Moreau who created the show and directs
Truman's life from a sunless command center. If the one-word name
doesn't give him away as the bad guy (a whiff of religious cult, an
echo of the Evil Empire), the beret and black suit will.
</P>
<P>
   Christof, played by Ed Harris, is the television creative type
from hell: arrogant, cynical, power-mad. And the show he produces
is heartless and even sadistic at the core: Christof may watch over
this child of his imagination with a kind of almighty tenderness,
but he has reared him in captivity and seems ready to let him die
that way if it will boost ratings. If this is where television
could lead, what are we supposed to think of the people producing
it now?
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, what should we think of their
forerunners, the television producers of 30 or 40 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasantville'' has an answer for that, and it's damning. Its
measuring rod is a fictitious 1950s sitcom by the same name, a
black-and-white fantasy of suburban tranquillity that betrays no
inkling of life's grays. But just as in ``The Truman Show,''
unpleasantries lurk behind the Ozzie-and-Harriet facade. The young
hero of ``Pleasantville'' (Tobey Maguire) would like to think
otherwise, of course.
</P>
<P>
   A child of divorce and 90s ennui, he watches the sitcom
fanatically, seeing in its endless reruns everything his
dysfunctional world is not. But after he's swept into the
television screen itself, dragging his oversexed sister (Reese
Witherspoon) with him _ the two of them introducing passion, and
living color, to the town _ he begins to discover the truth.
</P>
<P>
   For the world of ``Pleasantville'' is soon exposed to be
emotionally sterile, hypocritically prudish, conformist,
patriarchal, racist (the town comes to discriminate against
``coloreds''), anti-intellectual, intolerant of creativity and
easily egged on into mob rule.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment of 1950s America? It seems so, although the movie
comes wrapped in entertainment values for box-office appeal, and
the Pleasantvillians do eventually reform themselves. But certainly
``Pleasantville'' finds television of the 50s guilty of fostering a
repugnant set of values inside the white picket fences, and of
lying.
</P>
<P>
   The message is clear: rather than show Americans their country
as it really was, the network men told them only that father knew
best. No wonder the subsequent years brought civil unrest, a
drugged counterculture and political disillusionment, the movie
seems to say; look to television for blame.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the viewing public is entirely let off the hook in
these films. Both ``The Truman Show'' and ``EdTV'' portray the
television audience as willing dupes of the industry. These are
Americans who can't get enough of Truman's and Ed's unremarkable
adventures, who gobble up the spinoff merchandise, who elevate the
ordinary to the plane of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about getting a life: television gives them Ed's and
Truman's. Maybe it's a kind of mass narcissism being depicted here:
everyday people crazy about people like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, the audiences here appear incapable of making
ethical or moral judgments on their own. People are truly fond of
Truman and Ed, but no one seems to regard their captivity _
particularly Truman's involuntary one _ as, you know, kind of,
well, wrong. At least not until Truman and Ed try to escape; then,
like muddled sports fans rooting for both teams, the audience that
has cheered on these guys in their fish-bowl existence now pulls
for them when they try to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Such blockheads, such sheep. And what steers them this way and
that? Correct. They're not far removed from the automatons
populating the state-run terrorscape of Orwell's ``1984'';
ubiquitous television screens control them, too. (It may be telling
that two movies, in 1955 and 1984, have been based on the novel.)
</P>
<P>
   Orwell wrote his cautionary tale in 1949, as the world, having
rid itself of one totalitarian state (Germany's), was nervously
witnessing the flowering of another (the Soviet Union). It was also
a time when the world was embracing television, and becoming
worried in some quarters about its potential brainwashing power. So
perhaps it's no coincidence that fears of one sort of population
control (electronic) were rising in tandem with fears of another
(political).
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the movies of late, habits of mind die hard.
Though Orwell's novel proved less than prophetic, though the Soviet
walls came tumbling down, the movies haven't given up their
suspicions about television. It's still out there, they warn, and
it may get us yet.

70 MINUTES ON AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER-COASTER: A SOLO JOURNEY FROM OHIO
TO AUSCHWITZ  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVEN DRUKMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bizarre Murder!!! A Lesbian Forces Blind Holocaust Victim on
Roller Coaster!''
</P>
<P>
   This phony headline is trumpeted by Lisa Kron about herself
halfway through her one-woman show ``2.5 Minute Ride,'' directed by
Mark Brokaw and opening Sunday night at the Joseph Papp Public
Theater &UR;  &LR; in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But the performer is a clown, not a killer: with auburn hair and
hazel button eyes, she bounces across the stage like a Claymation
figure. (New York audiences last saw her as a wisecracking,
wheelchair-bound rabbi in Paul Rudnick's current comic play, ``The
Most Fabulous Story Ever Told.'')
</P>
<P>
   The headline refers to an amusement-park ride that Ms. Kron
takes with her retired father, who lives in Lansing, Mich. The ride
proves to be a breeze compared with a trip to a concentration camp
_ the other major story in ``2.5 Minute Ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kron knows that her newest solo effort evokes laughs, but
she hopes that this account of a visit to Auschwitz with her father
goes deeper. ``It's the next natural step for my work,'' she said
recently. ``It's always been so easy for me to just be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The fake headline speaks volumes about the mix of humor and
horror in ``2.5 Minute Ride.'' In true tabloid fashion, Ms. Kron
does not fret about exaggeration in her titles. Her last solo
effort, the 1994 ``101 Humiliating Stories,'' offered far fewer
embarrassing scenarios from contemporary urban life than that.
Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called the show ``a
blissful piece of theater of abashment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``2.5 Minute Ride'' is, in fact, a 70- minute play that had its
premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in California in 1996 and then
went through various transformations at the Mark Taper Forum in Los
Angeles, the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and
the Barbican Center in London, among other stops.
</P>
<P>
   The roller-coaster ride occurs during the annual pilgrimage of
the author's family to an Ohio amusement park. It is an apt
metaphor for a piece that swerves sharply between comic family
anecdotes and the journey Ms. Kron made in 1990 with her ailing but
implacable 77-year-old father to the concentration camp where his
parents perished.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kron, a member of the Five Lesbian Brothers performance
troupe, got the idea to juxtapose the quotidian and the unthinkable
after reading Anne Frank's diary a few years ago. ``Today, we can
talk about the Holocaust as a historical event with 20-20
hindsight,'' Ms. Kron said. ``We (italics)know(end italics) what
happened. But I was struck by the fact that these people were
dealing with their day-to-day mundane experience.''
</P>
<P>
   To join the two narratives, Ms. Kron uses a series of projected
blank slides, a device suggested by the woman she lives with, Peg
Healey, who is also a member of the Lesbian Brothers. ``Blank
slides are the perfect metaphorical container,'' Ms. Kron said.
``The blankness speaks not only to the difficulty in representing
the Holocaust, but in telling a story about someone else's life. It
also allows the audience to envision their own stories and project
them into my particular story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kron, who would say only that she is in her mid-30s, noted
that she had learned to view the tragic and the comic ``as really
just quick turns of the screen.'' It is an ancient theme given
contemporary life by, for example, Roberto Benigni's current
Oscar-winning movie ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which employs humor as a
foil for dealing with the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many oddly funny stories I didn't use,'' Ms. Kron
said. ``For example, when my father, who was in New Haven, heard
that his parents had been sent to Auschwitz, he immediately tried
to order a ham sandwich, to distance himself from Judaism. But he
couldn't. He'd say to the waitress, `Um ... tuna fish.'''

DUKE'S COACH K ALMOST LETTER PERFECT IN RETURN TO SPLENDOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duke. Final Four. Coach K.
</P>
<P>
   College basketball's holy trinity, its modern-day mantra, is
complete again. The Blue Devils and coach Mike Krzyzewski are back
where they seemingly belong, playing in another Final Four, their
sights set on another national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went there in 1980, Duke was a good job,'' said
Delaware coach Mike Brey, a Duke assistant from 1988 to '95. ``In
the early '90s, he made it a great job. And what you have now,
bottom line, is the best coach at the best job. Nobody else is even
close.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1986 to 1994, Duke was in seven Final Fours and won two out
of five championship games. That's the best championship run for
any coach not named John Wooden or Pat Summitt. The Blue Devils
(36-1), who face Michigan State in an NCAA Tournament semifinal
Saturday, have been dominating while dealing with the seasonlong
pressure of being the championship favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's amazing NCAA success _ a record winning percentage of
.761 _ is fueled and driven by Krzyzewski, whose competitive fire
burns white hot.
</P>
<P>
   But four years ago the man who ``is'' Duke basketball was nearly
consumed by that fire. Krzyzewski doesn't coach by rote, but by
feel. Four years ago, Krzyzewski was numb.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was an unprecedented 16-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference
this season, has an average winning margin of nearly 26 points and
a 31-game winning streak. But this remarkable season is also as
much about the 52-year-old Krzyzewski's personal renewal project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't say it, but I think it means a lot to him,'' junior
Chris Carrawell said of Duke's place in this weekend's Final Four.
``It's kinda like, `We're back.' The problems he went through a few
years ago ... now we're back where he's wanted to be.''
Life-and-death matters
</P>
<P>
   The death of a friend. Infirmity that confirms one's mortality.
The death of a beloved parent. The marriage of the oldest child
that confirms the future.
</P>
<P>
   These are the life passages that have led Mike Krzyzewski on his
journey.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1992, former North Carolina State coach Jim
Valvano was found to have cancer. He spent much of his time trying
to beat the disease at Duke Medical Center. Krzyzewski was a
frequent visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't BS a BSer,'' Krzyzewski said of Valvano. ``When we
were talking, it was just straight. We laughed and cried so much.
... Those were great times for the two of us. We'd kick everyone
else out of the room, so it could just be the two of us. We could
be coaches. We could be just friends, honest with one another.
Those were ... very special times.''
</P>
<P>
   Valvano died in April 1993. That summer, a ``Sports
Illustrated'' article recounted Valvano's valiant battle. Valvano,
in what amounted to a deathbed confessional, explained how he
believed he had allowed coaching and fame to consume his life after
winning the 1983 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Mickie Krzyzewski underlined the passages she thought pertained
to her husband. ``She said, `This is you,' '' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew Jimmy's message was speaking to him,'' Mrs. K said.
``He just had no idea what to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next season, all seemed well _ another Final Four, nearly
another national championship. But Krzyzewski entered the
off-season questioning if coaching was a worthwhile profession.
</P>
<P>
   And he was caught in a time-guzzling whirlwind. Whether it was
filming an NCAA promotional spot for CBS or helping select USA
Basketball teams or leading the fight on a coaching issue or
speaking at the local Catholic Youth Organization, Krzyzewski
couldn't or wouldn't say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was always reminding himself where he came from,''
Brey said. ``He's a Chicago guy, a blue-collar guy. he didn't want
anybody to say, `Well, Mike's too big for us now.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994-95 Blue Devils lost three starters. And the program
was suffering from recruiting mistakes. Duke was still signing
All-Americans, but Krzyzewski wasn't taking the time to get to know
them like before. Krzyzewski, a West Point graduate and five-year
Army veteran, compensated by working harder.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski, then 47, had been suffering chronic back pain. In
October 1994, he underwent surgery for a herniated disk. Preseason
practice had started. Doctors told him he needed six weeks to
recover; Krzyzewski returned to work 10 days after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he was Superman,'' his wife said. ``That recovery
time was for average people. If his rehab called for 10
repetitions, he'd do 20. He thought it was like anything else, that
it could be solved by hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   The whirlwind became a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, just after the start of the ACC portion of the
season, Krzyzewski made what for him was a terrible admission of
weakness. Exhausted in body, mind and spirit, he told his staff
that he didn't ``think he could make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Mickie Krzyzewski made a doctor's appointment
for her husband. Husband told wife the appointment conflicted with
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never issued demands,'' Mrs. K said, ``but I told him if
he wasn't at the doctor's office I will know you have chosen
basketball over me and I will have to act on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slammed out of the house. Driving to the doctor's office, I
was praying he would be there because I had no idea how I was going
to act if he wasn't there. I was so relieved when I got there and
saw his car. From that point on, we were on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from then athletic director Tom Butters, Krzyzewski
took the remainder of that season off. This good Catholic boy, who
still covertly crosses himself before every tipoff, self-confessed
his own sins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got sick, the way my mind works, I thought, `It can't
just be my back. It's gotta be cancer,''' Krzyzewski said.
``Because I had done the same things that Jimmy had done. `I
deserve it, but please don't let it be cancer.' When it wasn't
cancer, I realized that I was so lucky that I had something I was
going to recover from; he had something he could not get better
from.''
Soon to be Grandpa K
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski is the son of Billy and Emily, first generation
Polish immigrants who raised two sons on the North Side of Chicago
by working hard, harder, hardest. Billy Krzyzewski died when Mike
was a senior at West Point. Emily Krzyzewski died in September 1996
after a yearlong battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after his mother's death, Krzyzewski hasn't broken
the habit of calling her after every game; he still moves toward
the phone, ready to make the call to someone who's not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost 50 years of my life, I had someone who was always
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not over that yet,'' Mickie Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, the Krzyzewskis' oldest daughter, Debbie, married
Peter Savarino. Dad gave daughter a fairy-princess wedding on the
Duke campus. ``He never let go of my hand that day,'' Debbie says.
Earlier this month, Debbie found out she was pregnant. Coach K will
become Grandpa K.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, one week after Monday's national championship game,
Krzyzewski is scheduled for surgery to replace his degenerative
left hip. This time, there is no exhaustion, no late-night guilt
trips about the pain being caused by cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always tried to be a rock,'' said Jay Bilas, an ESPN
announcer who played on Duke's first Final Four team under
Krzyzewski in 1986. ``He wanted his players to be tough, so he had
to be a tough guy. Now, he can be tough when he needs to be but
also enjoy the other things about his life without guilt or
regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Krzyzewskis moved to a secluded new house just
minutes from the Duke basketball offices. Now, Coach K can run home
for an hour or so, listen to music, sit on his deck, or take his
Labradors, Defense and Cameron, for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski, a private man in a public profession, is taking time
to stop and plant the flowers. He planned all the landscaping
around the new house, and he relaxes by planting flowers.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``Sports Illustrated'' article moved with them. It's
there on Coach K's bedside table.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski has learned how to work smarter, not harder. The
oft-replayed message of his friend Jim Valvano was ``Don't give up,
don't ever give up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if Mike had not gone through those health problems, by
now he would have given up coaching,'' Mickie Krzyzewski said.
``Mike was humbled; he knows he's been given a second chance. Jimmy
didn't have that. I think Jimmy's message to Mike was,`Don't give
up coaching, but find another way to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski has learned to say no. The Duke basketball office is
computerized and reorganized. His time is more his and his energies
are more focused. This season's team is the new and improved
product stocked with stunning talent recruited by Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 recruiting class of Elton Brand, Shane Battier, Chris
Burgess and William Avery was the best in school history and forms
the backbone of this Final Four team.
</P>
<P>
   This season's top recruit, freshman Corey Maggette, is the sixth
man, and he would probably start for any other team in the country.
Next season's freshman class could be just as talented.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Duke is back. And his family and friends have a single word
to describe Krzyzewski: Happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting back to the Final Four for me is incredibly
fulfilling,'' Krzyzewski said after his team's East Regional
victory Sunday over Temple. ``In 1994-95, there was part of me that
wasn't sure we could do this again. For a while, it seemed like it
was promised to us; we went seven out of nine years. But it's not
promised to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a good group. I'm really lucky to be coaching
these guys. NCAA games are won because of really gritty players.
I've had a lot of gritty players.''
</P>
<P>
   Coached by a gritty coach who is now a man fulfilled.

FORMER TOP AIDE AT NEW YORK CITY UNION ADMITS HE HELPED ALTER
CONTRACT VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former top official in New York City's largest
union of municipal workers Wednesday became the first person to
plead guilty to fixing a 1996 contract ratification vote and
implicated three other union leaders in the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Mark Shaplo, who was a top aide to Stanley Hill,
the former executive director of the union, District Council 37,
said Wednesday that two other top Hill aides and Albert A. Diop,
the longtime president of one of the biggest union locals in the
council, took part in the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   While making his plea in state Supreme Court in Manhattan,
Shaplo stopped short of implicating Hill, who is under
investigation by the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M.
Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   Diop and Hill, who retired last month after being forced to take
a leave, have repeatedly denied either approving or participating
in the vote fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Shaplo also pleaded guilty Wednesday to receiving more than
$50,000 in kickbacks from the sale of hundreds of holiday turkeys
each year at inflated prices to a union local representing clerical
workers at the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Shaplo described a vote-rigging scheme in which leaders of
District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees printed thousands of extra blank ballots and
then marked them to show approval of the contract. Next, they mixed
these ballots with piles of authentic ones, helping to insure
approval of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   This spared Hill and his ally, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, an
embarrassing repudiation of the five-year agreement they
negotiated. The contract was deeply unpopular with the district
council's 120,000 members and its 56 locals because it contained a
two-year pay freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the district attorney's office hinted Wednesday
that there could be more indictments or guilty pleas over the next
week. In a news conference about the Shaplo case, Morgenthau
announced the unsealing of a guilty plea made in December by Bessie
Jamison, the president of Local 1251, which represents nearly 1,800
clerical workers at the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Joseph DeCanio, president of a local representing
1,000 city highway repair workers, pleaded guilty to taking more
than $50,000 in kickbacks from his work as the chief middleman in
providing more than 10,000 turkeys a year to various locals.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's plea, Shaplo, who was long one of Hill's
right-hand men, admitted that he also got a piece of the action,
acknowledging that he ``received a portion of the stolen amount in
cash from DeCanio after the checks were cashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaplo, who was forced to resign in October following newspaper
reports that several top council officials knew about the vote
fraud, said Wednesday that Martin Lubin, the council's associate
director who was essentially Hill's deputy, and John McCabe, the
director of the union's white-collar division, also participated in
the vote-rigging.

UNLIKELY HEROES SAVE PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ A nervous freshman comes in and saves the game
like a proven veteran. A light-hitting second baseman hits a
tie-breaking three-run home run. This is what happens when a team
is having a special season.
</P>
<P>
   So far, not much can go wrong for the Pepperdine baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-ranked Waves beat USC 6-4 on Wednesday afternoon in a
non-conference game at Eddy D. Field Stadium. Pepperdine (23-3)
scored five runs in the sixth inning against the No. 22 Trojans,
who had won seven of their past eight games.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely pair cooled USC. Left-hander Stephen Correa, who
flopped as a starter earlier in the season, got the final out with
the potential tying run at first base. Junior second baseman Damon
Katz, who had just three career homers, broke a 3-3 tie in the
sixth with a three-run homer over the left-field fence. He went 3
for 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Katz has been swinging the bat better lately,'' Pepperdine
head coach Frank Sanchez said. ``The progress and the strides he
has made ... he just typifies what this team is.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz's homer wouldn't have meant much if it wasn't for Correa
staying calm in an awkward situation. Closer Jay Gehrke, who hasn't
given up an earned run in 18 appearances this season, started the
ninth and threw five consecutive balls.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez went out to talk to Gehrke. It was Sanchez's fourth trip
to the mound, and according to college rules he was forced to
remove his pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Correa, who at one point this season had an ERA of a little over
81 and who hadn't gotten out of the first inning in two consecutive
starts, was called in from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves held their collective breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew as long as I threw strikes my defense could do the
job,'' Correa said. ``I threw two innings at Gonzaga this past
weekend and I threw pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Correa struck out Beau Craig and got Justin Lehr to fly out.
Then he walked ninth-place batter Jason Gemoll before inducing a
flyout from Seth Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust Correa,'' Katz said. ``He threw great in the fall. He
shuts down our hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine starter Steve Schenewerk didn't allow a hit until
Greg Hanoian's leadoff single in the sixth. But Schenewerk walked
five and gave up a two-run single to Brad Ticehurst later in the
sixth that gave USC a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves' Dane Sardinha hit a two-run homer, his seventh of the
season, in the sixth off Trojans starter Rik Currier (2-4) to tie
the game 3-3.

   Yugoslav military authorities have begun to crack down on
foreign journalists who were reporting news of the NATO air strikes
from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   They detained a Washington Post correspondent early Thursday,
and on Wednesday shut down all television transmission complexes
and threatened a CNN correspondent and his crew in Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4:30 Thursday morning, Belgrade time, Yugoslav
plain-clothes agents who identified themselves as border guards
entered the Hyatt Hotel in Belgrade and asked for Peter Finn, one
of two Washington Post correspondents working in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The agents took Finn out of the hotel, saying he would be
deported.
</P>
<P>
   They also acted to deport a Belgian journalist, Philippe Debroz.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Milligan of The Boston Globe and William Glauber of The
Baltimore Sun and four CNN employees were also detained by police
on the roof of a hotel in Belgrade, but were released Wednesday
night, according to their editors.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, two American television correspondents remained
Wednesday, Allen Pizzey of CBS News and Brent Sadler of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said armed Yugoslav officials had slashed the tires of
his vehicle and had threatened him and his crew by holding out two
bullets and saying, ``These are for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among American newspapers, The New York Times and The Los
Angeles Times each has a reporter based in Kosovo. The Associated
Press moved some reporters out of Pristina, but still has a
half-dozen there, according to a spokeswoman, Tori Smith.

U.S. SUES NEW YORK CITY OVER DISPOSAL OF FREON APPLIANCES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lawsuit filed Wednesday by the federal government
seeks to impose heavy fines on New York City for disposing
refrigerators and other appliances in ways that cause
ozone-depleting refrigerants to be released into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency said the city had intentionally
ignored federal rules on proper disposal of the appliances and
asked for a fine of more than $48 million, or $27,500 for each day
since March 25, 1994, when the order took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the city's failure to properly address this important
issue in the past,'' said Jeanne M. Fox, the regional administrator
of the EPA, ``the federal government felt it necessary to pursue
this legal action, and expects that it will result in increased
environmental awareness on the part of city administrators.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Allan, a Sanitation Department deputy commissioner and
the agency's chief lawyer, said she had not seen the legal papers
and had no comment on the lawsuit. But she said the agency believed
that a new policy enacted on March 15 puts it in compliance with
the federal order.
</P>
<P>
   Under that policy, the Sanitation Department has posted new
guidelines in various buildings for the removal of the refrigerant
Freon or Freon substitutes from appliances. The guidelines suggest
that people wishing to dispose of appliances that contain Freon
should call the Sanitation Department's Action Center at (212)
219-8090 before placing the item on the curb. Sanitation workers
will then remove the refrigerant and tag the appliances before
taking them away.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Mears, an EPA spokeswoman, said that ``just putting out
notices is not enough'' and that the Sanitation Department needed
to provide greater documentation. The city, despite the new policy,
remains liable for the complete fine for the five years that it did
not comply with the administrative order, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the sooner they come into compliance, the less the
penalties they will face,'' Ms. Mears said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA charged that the Sanitation Department had failed since
the order was implemented to remove Freon or its substitutes from
compacting trucks in which refrigerators, air-conditioners and
other appliances containing Freon are crushed. Freon had thus
escaped into the atmosphere, it said. The gas also might have
escaped at the city's landfill at Fresh Kills on Staten Island,
where the appliances were further crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Freon belongs to a class of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons
that can damage the ozone layer, which shields the earth from
ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancers, cataracts and
other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The gas has been banned in the United States since 1995 because
of its effects on the environment, but is still found in many older
appliances and automobiles.
