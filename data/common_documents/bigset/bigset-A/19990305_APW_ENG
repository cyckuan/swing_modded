<HEADLINE> Utility Ordered To Pay $37.3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida's largest electric utility should pay $37.3  
million in damages to the parents of a 12-year-old girl killed in a 
traffic accident at an intersection where workers had shut off 
power, a jury decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Goldberg died Sept. 12, 1997, when her mother's car was hit  
at a rain-slicked intersection where a traffic signal hung dark. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers for Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. had shut off power in the  
area to repair a downed power line. Apparently none of the workers 
noticed they also cut power to the traffic signal about 150 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't simply pull the power from a traffic control signal  
and make absolutely no effort to keep the inevitable from 
occurring,'' said the girl's father, Walter Goldberg. ``They could 
have done so many things. And they did nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The utility plans to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas 400 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mark Martin is very pleased by the distance his  
team has come since the beginning of the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started last year with a brand new team, with the exception  
of my crew chief, Jimmy Fennig, and my truck driver,'' Martin said. 
``The tire changers, jackman, engine tuner and everyone else was 
new and learning how to work as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin remained with Roush Racing, for whom he has driven since  
1988, but moved with his reorganized team into a new shop near 
Charlotte, N.C., sharing space with teammate Jeff Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really worried when we finished 39th in the (1998)  
Daytona 500 because I thought that would really get the team down, 
but they came back strong and we finished third at Rockingham one 
week later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A week after that, Martin won the inaugural Las Vegas 400 and  
went on to win six more races while finishing second in the Winston 
Cup points race. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, I was afraid to tell people I had moved my shop and  
left behind a championship caliber team to start something new,'' 
Martin said. ``But, after we won right away, I was proud to say 
this was all done by a new team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that year under his belt, the three-time series runner-up  
hopes to make a run for his first championship in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	After another miserable Daytona 500 -- he crashed out and  
finished 31st -- Martin won in Rockingham. Now he is back defending 
his title at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where practice and 
qualifying opened Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This track holds nothing but good memories for me,'' Martin  
said. ``Last year, I flew home to Daytona Beach right after the 
race and by the time I got to bed, all I had going through my head 
was the strong, 'Viva, Las Vegas.' I wouldn't mind hearing it again 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	FORD RULES: Last year in Las Vegas, Ford Tauruses took the first  
seven spots and 13 of the top 14 on the 1 1/2-mile, mildly-banked 
oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, NASCAR has made several aerodynamic rule changes,  
hoping to even things up. The latest rule was instituted for the 
season-finale last year at Atlanta Motor Speedway, raising the rear 
spoilers and lowering the front air dams for Fords, Chevrolets and 
Pontiacs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was pretty bad,'' said Pontiac driver Derrike Cope.  
``It was kind of like auto racing's version of Custer's Last Stand. 
Ford had everybody outclassed because the rules were so lopsided. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been driving full-time for 11 years on this circuit and I  
had never seen such a rout. NASCAR, unbeknownst to them, had the 
Fords set up pretty well. Ford knew what they had and positioned 
themselves very well. I had never seen anything like that before 
and I hope I don't see it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	NO TIRE CHANGE: Goodyear, which is the exclusive tire supplier  
for the Winston Cup series, says the racing radial being used in 
Las Vegas this week is the same tire model used two weeks ago in 
Rockingham, N.C., and to be used next month in Bristol, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the desert conditions in Nevada, we found that the  
racetrack has aged at a slightly faster pace than some other 
tracks,'' explained Tony Freund, Goodyear's lead engineer for stock 
cars. ``Dealing with that, this is a slightly different tread 
compound than on the Eagle we raced here last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockingham and Bristol ovals are considered abrasive tracks  
that promote faster tire wear. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------

	SPARK PLUGS: Rusty Wallace and Don Miller, former general  
manager of Penske Racing South, will act as co-best men Saturday 
night at the wedding of team body shop manager and race-day pit 
supervisor David ``W.W.'' Munari. He will marry longtime girlfriend 
Jamie Jenkins at the Treasure Island Chapel in Las Vegas. ... 
Posted awards for Sunday's race are $3,797,084. ... Wally 
Dallenbach, ninth in the current points, was unranked at this point 
in 1998 after failing to qualify for the first two events. The last 
time he was in the top 10 was in February 1996, when he was ninth 
following the race in Rockingham. ... Mike Skinner, the series 
points leader, has been running at the finish of the last 25 races 
-- the longest active streak in that statistical category.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Mayor Wants Disneyland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The mayor of Shanghai said Friday he was trying  
to convince Walt Disney Co. to bring Disneyland to mainland China, 
even though executives are already scouting out Hong Kong as a 
possible site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably sign a letter of intent to conduct a  
feasibility study with Disney,'' Xu Kuangdi told reporters on the 
sidelines of the National People's Congress, China's annual 
legislative session, being held in Beijing through March 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney executives are scheduled to meet with Hong Kong officials  
this weekend to discuss opening a Disneyland in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu brushed aside fears that those talks might put Shanghai out  
of the running. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. has two Disneys: one in Florida and one in  
California. Competition is good,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Xu refused to provide further details on the talks.  
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong, sunk deep in recession with high unemployment, a  
sharp drop in tourism and a weak real estate market, is hoping the 
theme park could help lighten its woes. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk of theme parks in Hong Kong and Shanghai has followed  
an easing of Chinese anger over Disney's 1996 film ``Kundun,'' 
which was critical of China's Tibet policies. Disney Co. chairman 
Michael Eisner visited China last fall. In June, Disney named 
veteran executive John Feenie to oversee the entertainment and 
media company's expanding ventures in China.

<HEADLINE>  Spoonhour Retires After 7 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Charlie Spoonhour retired Friday after seven  
seasons as Saint Louis coach, saying the job had become too much of 
a grind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not sick, no matter how I look,'' Spoonhour joked at an  
overflow news conference. ``I'm not getting divorced. There's just 
a point when you have to get off the merry-go-round, and that time 
is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour, 59, was 122-90 at Saint Louis, and led the Billikens  
to three NCAA tournaments and one NIT. His final season was a 
frustrating 15-16 as he struggled unsuccessfully to fill the huge 
void created when Larry Hughes left for the NBA's Philadelphia 
76ers after leading Saint Louis to 22 victories and a first-round 
victory in the NCAAs his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Larry comes back this year, we're one of the elite teams,''  
senior forward Ryan Luechtefeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 Division I seasons, Spoonhour was 319-171, a .651 winning  
percentage, and reached 20 or more victories 10 times. Before 
coming to Saint Louis he led Southwest Missouri State to five NCAA 
tournaments and two NITs in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour, who leaves with two years remaining on a $325,000  
annual contract, said he knew it was time to move on early in the 
season when he found it difficult to get over losses. Months ago, 
he confided to close friends in the profession that he would be 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do the things you need to do, it finally got to be work,''  
Spoonhour said. ``And I always said if it got to be a real job I'd 
quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players saw a different side, a Spoonhour that was letting go.  
Reserve forward Troy Robertson said he thought Spoonhour was 
happier than could be expected during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the losses, I thought the next day in practice he was  
going to kill us,'' Robertson said. ``But he was pretty upbeat, 
positive. So it made a little sense that he was trying to have a 
good time on his way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour said a winning record this season wouldn't have  
changed his mind. He said he probably stayed a year longer than he 
should have. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour said he wouldn't coach again, but might be interested  
in scouting for an NBA team. For now, he said, he just wants to 
relax a bit and plans to head soon for Jupiter, Fla., to watch his 
beloved St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	When athletic director Doug Woolard asked what he could do,  
Spoonhour said, ``I told them very simply, be happy for me. Because 
this is why I work, so someday I can sit around and do nothing. 
That's what I'm going to try to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior forward Ryan Luechtefeld said Spoonhour's announcement to  
the team after Thursday night's 70-61 loss to Louisville in the 
Conference USA tournament should have been more gut-wrenching than 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody assumed that it was going to happen, but it was  
still emotional when he told us,'' Luechtefeld said. ``Then again, 
he wasn't and his son wasn't, and that told us he was happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour's son, Jay, was an assistant coach on the team.  
</P>
<P>
	A national search process will begin immediately, Woolard said.  
Spoonhour recommended longtime assistant Greg Lackey for the job 
and several players endorsed the move. 
</P>
<P>
	A top outsider mentioned for the opening is Illinois State coach  
Kevin Stallings. He led Illinois State to consecutive Missouri 
Valley Conference championships in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Balloon Team Crosses 747 Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A pair of British balloonists trying to  
circumnavigate the Earth had a surprise visit Friday when they 
crossed the path of a Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Elson and Colin Prescot were flying 25,000 feet over the  
South China Sea on Friday when the captain of a passing airliner 
radioed a request to approach the balloon, the team's London 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloonists agreed, and when they looked out their  
observation dome they saw hundreds of passengers peering out of 
windows and snapping pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an amazing sight for us, particularly seeing so many  
friendly faces smiling at us after only having each other to stare 
at during the past 16 days,'' Elson was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the pilots nor ground control could identify the  
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, the two were over the Taiwan Straits southeast of the  
China coast, heading for northern Japan and a jet stream they hope 
will catapult them across the Pacific to British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	With a second balloon team moving steadily along behind them,  
the British pair hope to pick up speed on the crossing to North 
America and in about two weeks' time to become the first 
balloonists to fly nonstop around the world. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> No Surgery for Orioles' DeShields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles second baseman  
Delino DeShields found out Friday he won't need surgery to repair a 
fractured bone in his left thumb, 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields, injured during an intrasquad game Thursday, will wear  
the cast for about seven days before replacing it with a splint, 
but it will be 3-to-4 weeks before he can begin baseball-related 
activities and another 2-to-3 weeks before he can return to the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Utility infielder Jeff Reboulet will start at second base and  
bat in DeShields' No. 2 slot in Saturday's exhibition opener 
against Minnesota at Fort Myers. Reboulet most likely will start on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say 3-to-4 weeks before I can start banging on it, but  
hopefully it will be sooner,'' said DeShields, who signed a $12.5 
million, three-year contract during the offseason. ``I was looking 
forward to getting off to a good start. But hopefully I won't miss 
too many games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields was injured during the third inning of Thursday's  
intrasquad game when a line drive from minor-league outfielder Luis 
Matos struck the palm of his glove as he made the catch. He batted 
in the bottom of the inning, singling to left field, then left and 
went for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was broken. I just thought it was a really  
bad bruise,'' DeShields said. ``I just stuck my hand out there and 
it caught me on the thumb, sort of like a catcher who gets jammed 
by a sinker. I just caught it in a bad spot. As long as it heals 
all right, it won't take me long to get in the swing of things, so 
to speak. I've just got to make sure it's healed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, right-hander Scott Kamieniecki threw two pain-free  
but ineffective innings in Friday's intrasquad game, allowing two 
runs and four hits against minor leaguers. But it was significant 
progress for a pitcher who hadn't faced live hitters since August, 
a month before disk-fusion surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt pretty good,'' he said. ``I was able to throw all my  
pitches over the plate. I'm not too concerned about results. I'm 
taking it one step at a time, and this was another step.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Have Advantages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The early front-runners for the Republican  
presidential nomination are benefiting from a popular combination 
with the public -- familiar names and fresh faces. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when most voters say they aren't even sure who is  
running, name recognition translates into big poll numbers for 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former American Red Cross head 
Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both have a great family name with an established base of  
loyalty and support in our state,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of 
the Republican State Committee in New Hampshire, site of the 
nation's first presidential primary. ``But they are not being 
charged with any of the faults of their father or spouse. They are 
getting the best of both worlds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent political history is also on their side. Since 1976, a  
Bush or Dole has been on every Republican presidential ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, whose father is former President George Bush, has held a  
double-digit lead over Dole, the wife of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole, 
in recent national polls. But they have run much closer in New 
Hampshire. Other potential Republican candidates have been far 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``One factor in (their) popularity is that the overall field is  
generally weak and there is no one who stands out from past 
campaigns as a front-runner,'' said Larry Bartels, a professor of 
politics at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
	The field of potential GOP candidates includes commentator Pat  
Buchanan, businessman Steve Forbes, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar 
Alexander, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, 
former Vice President Dan Quayle, New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith and 
social activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates with well-known names often fare well in the early  
polls because most people aren't paying attention and when asked 
whom they support ``they are grabbing at straws,'' said Robert 
Shapiro, a public opinion expert at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also has benefited from name confusion with his father. In  
one poll last year, nearly one in five respondents thought 
interviewers were asking about the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	But New Hampshire pollster Dick Bennett said George W. Bush is  
now picking up support on his own. In December, when pollsters were 
identifying the younger Bush as the son of the former president, 
many respondents would say they knew he was. 
</P>
<P>
	In six open Republican contests since 1960, the early  
front-runner has held on to win the party's nomination five times. 
The early leader in Democratic contests during that period has won 
the nomination just once (Walter Mondale in 1984), according to an 
analysis of pre-election polls by the Pew Research Center for the 
People &AMP; the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant Ralph Reed said a big early lead in the  
polls is ``no guarantee you won't have a contentious and highly 
competitive primary process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither George W. Bush nor Elizabeth Dole are new to national  
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole spent plenty of time on the campaign trail in her  
husband's 1996 presidential campaign. Bush campaigned for his 
father in past presidential elections and proved his appeal with 
Texas voters in November when two-thirds of them sent him back for 
a second term as governor.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Specifics on Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After more than a year of pledges on Social  
Security, Republican leaders and President Clinton have put 
competing plans on the table, starting in earnest the debate over 
the retirement program's future. 
</P>
<P>
	But their common ground is limited: Both sides want to use  
today's big budget surpluses to prepare Social Security for the 
flood of aging baby boomers expected to leave the system short of 
cash a decade from now. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences are over how much of the surplus to commit right  
away -- and how to use it. And the incentives to compromise may be 
few. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan, essentially preserving Social Security's  
original benefit structure by promising money from the general 
Treasury in the future, has proved popular in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials say they're willing to pursue a bipartisan  
compromise. ``Our goal is unequivocally to pass legislation,'' said 
economic adviser Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic allies such as labor unions, seeing an issue that  
might help their party win back control of Congress, are urging 
Clinton not to give up too much to the conservatives who insist 
something must be done to curb the program's rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There still continues to be this very big chance that nothing  
gets done,'' said AFL-CIO chief of staff Gerry Shea. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the potential for a political standoff, Republicans  
this week announced a plan to counter Democrats' accusations that 
they're eyeing money -- for tax cuts -- that rightfully belongs to 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans would limit the possible uses of the portion of  
the budget surplus that comes from Social Security taxes. The money 
would have to be used to overhaul the program, or, if lawmakers 
couldn't agree on changes, it would automatically be used to help 
pay down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's own rescue plan also calls for using the surpluses  
that Social Security's trust fund is expected to run in the near 
term, while baby boomers are still working. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans say Clinton's plan doesn't live up to his own  
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's running around saying he's the one saving Social  
Security,'' said Senate Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici, 
R-N.M. But it's the GOP plan, he said, that would ``lock away every 
penny ... for our nation's elderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue arises because the government's budget surplus in 2000  
will come solely from Social Security taxes. Clinton would spend 
some of the expected $133 billion -- about $50 billion -- on other 
programs including defense, education, Medicare and new 
government-subsidized retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say that spending would be made up to  
Social Security in later years, after income taxes start producing 
a surplus, too. 
</P>
<P>
	They also complain the GOP has not yet spelled out specific  
steps to improve Social Security's long-term finances, and have no 
explicit plan for Medicare, the also-overburdened health program 
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's missing is a complete picture of how surpluses and even  
debt reduction will be used to actually benefit both Social 
Security and Medicare,'' Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have their own politically potent complaints about  
Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The president wants to use $3 trillion in surpluses over the  
next 15 years to pay down the national debt, push economic growth 
and thus increase future tax revenues. He would earmark the money 
for Social Security and Medicare by placing IOUs from the general 
Treasury in the programs' trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would invest the rest, about $700 billion, in the  
stock market for Social Security. But Republicans, backed by 
business groups, argue such government investment would expose the 
financial markets to harmful political influences. 
</P>
<P>
	And because Clinton's plan would do nothing to cut Social  
Security's costs, Republicans say its claims on future budgets 
could crowd out money for other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make the tough decisions you're going to have to  
make,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, Republican leaders hope they can win support  
from moderate Democrats to divert some Social Security taxes into 
personal accounts that Americans could invest in the stock market 
on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	If individuals could grow such nest eggs, then Social Security  
checks could be reduced. During the transition, surpluses would 
likely be needed to pay benefits promised to current and near 
retirees unable to profit from the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most Democrats are confident they would come out ahead  
in a political standoff over private accounts by arguing they would 
be risky. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Republicans put more details on the table, Clinton's plan  
``will begin to look better and better,'' said Rep. Bob Matsui, 
D-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Australian G.P. Starts Off Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Mika Hakkinen tested his limits to  
the point that he ran his car into a wall, and came away satisfied. 
Michael Schumacher didn't even give himself the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Round 1 in the clash of the Formula One stars went to McLaren's  
Hakkinen today after he drove some of the fastest times on the 
circuit before spinning out and slamming his new MP4-14 into the 
wall during the first practice round of the Australian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher was forced to watch from the sidelines after delaying  
his practice start, then stalling in the pits. In the end, he 
complained of equipment problems and not enough practice time on 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, under pressure to deliver Ferrari its first drivers  
championship in 20 years, said he hasn't been able to drive the 
number of laps he wants to and that the team has been unable to 
balance to car to his satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to work on the setups. It is not balanced yet,''  
Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that we have to work a little bit harder than they  
(McLaren) have to. We have some things to do overnight, but I am 
not too worried yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen watched his mangled McLaren lifted onto a truck, then  
walked back to the pits. Annoyed at himself, not the car, he said 
the crash was the result of pushing the envelope just a little too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went a little bit over the top today,'' an unhurt but angry  
Hakkinen said afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I damaged the car quite badly, but I'm sure the mechanics are  
able to fix it to get ready for tomorrow's practice and qualifying. 
I was just finding the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do it. If you don't, you are never going to know  
the maximum ... but I wouldn't like to pass the limit on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from serious damage to the car, the testing-the-limits  
tactic worked. Hakkinen finished with the second-fastest lap time, 
beaten out only by teammate David Coulthard on his final run. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, the most favored challenger to Hakkinen's title,  
managed only the seventh-fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's stall in the pits was nasty reminder of Suzuka last  
year. Then, in the last race of the season, the two-time Formula 
One champion missed an opportunity to steal the championship from 
Hakkinen after a stuck clutch stalled him in pole position. He was 
forced to start from the back of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher said the track was very slippery, a condition made  
worse by the extra groove added to the front tire of all cars this 
year under new rules to reduce speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cars definitely slide more with the four-groove front  
tires,'' he said. ``At the moment, it is more like driving rallies 
than Formula One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both drivers said the first practice round gave little  
indication of how the teams would shape up in the qualifying 
rounds.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Says Rebels Abduct Seven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Southern rebels have kidnapped seven  
people working with the International Committee of the Red Cross, 
Sudan's foreign minister said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The relief workers were kidnapped a week ago near the town of  
Bentiu, 500 miles south of Khartoum, Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman 
Ismail told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the government did not announce the kidnapping earlier  
because it wanted to give the ICRC the chance to free them. 
</P>
<P>
	``But nothing happened even after the event went on unmentioned  
for seven days now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No rebel group has claimed responsibility for the abduction and  
no ransom demands have been made public. The ICRC did not 
immediately confirm the report, which could not be verified 
independently. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seven are Westerners and Sudanese working with the ICRC  
and under the ICRC flag when they were abducted,'' Ismail said. 
``We urge the United Nations and the world community to exert 
pressure on the rebels to release those civilians,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave no further details.  
</P>
<P>
	The town where the kidnapping reportedly took place is near the  
area where government forces are fighting the Sudan People's 
Liberation Army, which has been waging a war since 1983 for 
autonomy and development in the predominantly Christian, African 
and animist south. 
</P>
<P>
	The southerners resent the traditional dominance by the Arab-led  
and Muslim-dominated north. An estimated 1.9 million people have 
died in the fighting and related famines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ismail warned that the government will no longer extend a  
temporary cease-fire signed with the rebels in January to ease 
relief operations in the south. The cease-fire expires in April. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second time that the rebels have targeted relief  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, armed assailants opened fire on a U.N. relief convoy in  
southern Sudan, killing three officials, all Sudanese, working with 
the U.N.'s World Food Program and the ICRC.

<HEADLINE> Women Join Goldman Sachs Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Goldman Sachs Group LP moves closer to  
becoming a public company, the investment bank has added its first 
two female partners to its prestigious management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Neustein and Leslie Tortora are the newest members of the  
committee, which holds the main responsibility for setting policy 
and strategy for the 130-year-old firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointments come amid heightened scrutiny of Wall Street's  
male-dominated leadership. Rival investment bank Merrill Lynch is 
fighting a class-action gender-discrimination lawsuit, and a 
diversity group led by Jesse Jackson has been campaigning for more 
minorities and women to join Wall Street's upper ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is making gradual progress, said Edie Fraser,  
president of Business Women's Network, an organization that studies 
women's careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within all the firms, female leadership is improving,'' Fraser  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the numbers are still small. Neustein and Tortora are among  
14 women to hold coveted partnerships at the elite investment bank. 
Goldman has a total of 220 partners, who earn lucrative shares of 
the firm's profits. One of the firm's most renowned employees, 
chief market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, became a partner in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Neustein, 45, is now chief of staff to Goldman's senior  
partners. She became a partner in 1990, and a managing director in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Tortora, 42, is the head of Goldman's newly created information  
technology division. She became a partner in 1992 and a managing 
director in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the firm's co-chairman and  
chief executive officer, said Tortora's appointment reflects the 
growing role of technology in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leslie's presence on the committee will ensure that the firm  
is well positioned to make the most of these opportunities,'' 
Paulson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser said Goldman's management structure will surely come  
under more scrutiny if partners vote to sell a stake to the public. 
But a more diverse management committee shouldn't solely appeal to 
potential shareholders, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier to attract and retain women employees when women  
are in the upper ranks,'' she said. ``It's very good for the 
firms.''

<HEADLINE> Blood Safety Program Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's blood supply is about to become  
safer: Blood banks will begin next week phasing in sophisticated 
new genetic tests designed to wipe out viral infections that 
occasionally slip into transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest thing that's happened in blood banking  
since the HIV test,'' said James MacPherson of America's Blood 
Centers, which collects about half the nation's donated blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of transfusions already are infection-free.  
But the new gene testing, which should encompass all blood 
transfusions by September, promises to make blood even safer. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the new ``nucleic acid testing'' can detect tiny  
amounts of a virus, such as liver-destroying hepatitis C or the 
AIDS virus, before the blood donor's body has even recognized the 
infection. Some of the tests can detect as few as 10 copies of a 
viral gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Viral genes spread through blood faster than the immune system  
begins forming antibodies to fight them, a reaction that may not 
occur until 20 to 80 days after infection. Today's blood testing 
depends largely on tests that detect antibodies in an infected 
donor. So newly infected donors sometimes slip through. 
</P>
<P>
	Nucleic acid testing, called NAT by blood banks, promises to  
close that gap. 
</P>
<P>
	It probably will eliminate the few cases of HIV annually caused  
by donated blood, said Dr. Celso Bianco of the New York Blood 
Center. And experts estimate it will prevent 84 annual cases of 
hepatitis C transmission through blood, the majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hasn't mandated NAT-tested blood yet, because  
technically it's still experimental: Genetic fingerprinting is 
commonplace in laboratories, where it's called PCR, for polymerase 
chain reaction testing. But how to test the entire blood supply 
raises questions, and blood banks are trying different strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Food and Drug Administration is strongly encouraging  
blood banks to quickly begin genetic testing and hospitals to 
exclusively use NAT-screened blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody with any familiarity with these tests knows this is  
such an advance ... it would be a terrible mistake not to use it as 
soon as we can,'' said Dr. Edward Tabor, FDA's associate blood 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	So the FDA is taking the unprecedented step of letting blood  
banks add NAT to all the other blood safety tests they now perform 
in a nationwide research project. FDA will monitor the data to 
decide which NAT method works best. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, NAT will hunt hepatitis C and HIV. But eventually,  
blood banks may test for other contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	The genetic tests also promise that if a brand new virus ever  
sneaks into the blood supply as AIDS did two decades ago, blood 
banks could protect Americans much faster, MacPherson said. ``This 
is truly space-age technology,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NAT will cost more, about an extra $6 to $7 per unit of blood,  
which will increase hospitals' spending on blood by about 5 
percent. Although the FDA is letting blood banks charge for the 
experimental testing, hospitals can't recover the money from 
insurers. So some hospitals are questioning if it's worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	Responded Tabor: ``FDA thinks the cost increase will be worth  
the health benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NAT experiment's biggest questions is whether genetic  
testing can be performed fast enough. Blood has a limited shelf 
life, and demand is so great that much is transfused soon after 
it's donated. 
</P>
<P>
	But NAT testing takes 48 to 72 hours.  
</P>
<P>
	That's probably fine for most transfusions of red cells, which  
last 42 days after donation. But platelets expire in just five 
days. So hospitals may transfuse platelets that the standard, 
FDA-approved testing declared infection-free only to learn later 
that the extra genetic test found a problem. Then they'll have to 
track down the blood recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of confusion and a fair amount of concern on the  
part of many of the hospitals'' as they figure out how to handle 
the NAT project, said Brian McDonough of the American Red Cross, 
which provides the other half of the nation's blood.

<HEADLINE> Congress Debates Nursing Home Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY ALICE ANN LOVE   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker who used to help run  
nursing homes is warning that legislation meant to protect elderly 
Medicaid residents from eviction may actually leave them stuck in 
lower-quality homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to harm Medicaid patients, not help them,'' said  
Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a doctor who served as a nursing home 
medical director before being elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers of both political parties have flocked to support the  
bill in question, ever since a highly publicized attempt last year 
by one of the nation's largest nursing home operators, Vencor Inc., 
to remove Medicaid patients from some of its homes in several 
states, including Florida and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Public outrage and pressure from government regulators caused  
Vencor to reconsider. Still, many lawmakers want to bar by law any 
such future actions by nursing home operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation to bar nursing homes from evicting or transferring  
residents solely because they rely on Medicaid was approved this 
week by the House Commerce and Senate Finance committees. It is 
expected to come to the House and Senate floor as soon as 
scheduling allows and to pass easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and several other lawmakers -- including another doctor,  
Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa -- caution that although the bill is 
well-intentioned, it would do nothing to address the reason some 
nursing homes try to rid themselves of Medicaid patients: 
comparatively lower rates paid by the government's health insurance 
program for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of elderly nursing home patients help pay for their  
care with Medicaid. With nursing home costs averaging $40,000 a 
year, about half the older Americans who initially pay their own 
way must turn to Medicaid within three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	As the huge baby boom generation ages, some nursing home  
companies hope to attract more affluent people who can pay on their 
own -- a possibly lucrative new niche. Vencor, for example, states 
that strategy in its pitches to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes are not forced to accept Medicaid patients, and  
under the proposed legislation they could decide at any time to 
stop taking new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Homes that chose to stop taking new Medicaid patients, however,  
could not evict the ones they already have. And for the first time, 
they would have to notify new residents able to pay their own way 
that they might have to move if they eventually ran out of money 
and had to rely on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It addresses one serious concern by guaranteeing that nursing  
home residents and their families will not have to live with the 
fear of eviction,'' said Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., one of the 
bill's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Coburn said requiring nursing homes to keep Medicaid  
patients regardless of the amount the program pays for their care 
could have unintended consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, states might decide to lower Medicaid reimbursement  
rates if they knew homes would have to keep the patients, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, companies might stop accepting Medicaid patients in their  
newest facilities, reserving those homes only for wealthy private 
payers, and leave the poor elderly behind in cheaply run, older 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to see investment in high-quality, good care  
for Medicaid patients,'' Coburn said, predicting Congress will be 
forced to return to the problem within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Health Care Association, a nursing home industry  
group, supports the bill as do advocates for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to lawmakers, however, the industry group asked for  
a congressional hearing to look into the fairness of the rates that 
Medicaid pays. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too many of our providers, the rate is inadequate to cover  
the costs of caring for our vulnerable residents,'' said the March 
3 letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicaid, a health insurance program paid for jointly by the  
federal government and the states, generally is thought of as help 
for poor families and children. 
</P>
<P>
	However, almost one-fifth of the program's cost goes to pay for  
long-term care for older Americans in and out of nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, state Medicaid programs pay about $27 less a day  
than nursing homes charge people who pay on their own. Several 
years ago Congress voted to give states even more flexibility in 
setting their Medicaid rates for nursing homes.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Re-Sign Wide Receiver Stokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The 49ers took J.J. Stokes off the  
free agent market Friday, signing the star wide receiver to a 
seven-year deal and keeping him in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the contract were not released, but it was believed  
to be worth $3.3 million a year with the last two years voidable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money was not the deciding factor. That was kind of  
secondary,'' Stokes told radio station KNBR. ``I would love for my 
family to continue to come to my home games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, a native of San Diego and a first-round draft pick out  
of UCLA in 1995, was plagued by injuries in his first two seasons 
but regained his health and blossomed in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Paired with Terrell Owens while Jerry Rice was out with knee  
injuries in 1997, Stokes caught 58 passes for 733 yards and four 
touchdowns. Last season with Stokes, Owens and Rice posing one of 
the league's most formidable triple threats, Stokes had 63 catches 
for 770 yards and eight TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh had said one of his top priorities  
was re-signing Stokes and keeping San Francisco's wide receiver 
corps intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes became an unrestricted free agent and had discussions  
with several other teams, including the Cleveland Browns, Carolina 
Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 49ers had never stopped 
talking with Stokes and were finally able to come to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for a fair deal from the 49ers throughout the  
season,'' Stokes said. ``When that didn't happen, I said I was 
going to go out and explore my options. I went elsewhere just to 
see what was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a fair deal for me and I think they put one on the  
table for me, and I took it.''

<HEADLINE> Vazquez Rana: Samaranch Has Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch, whose IOC presidency  
has been marked by the worst scandal in Olympic history, gained a 
strong endorsement Friday from the head of the Association of 
National Olympic Committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vazquez Rana said the overwhelming majority of the world's  
198 Olympic committee wants Samaranch to stay in office until his 
terms expires in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to state our full support, with the certainty that by  
backing your leadership we will continue our daily endeavor of 
strengthening the Olympic movement to the benefit of world 
sports,'' Vazquez Rana wrote in an open letter to the IOC head. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled, and at least 19  
more remain under investigation because of the bribery scandal that 
grew out of Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. The IOC had 115 members before the scandal.

<HEADLINE>  Markets in U.S., Asia, Europe Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks roared ahead this morning, as a  
favorable employment report helped the market follow earlier 
rallies in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 206.19  
points, 30 points above its record high close of 9,643.32, set Jan. 
8. Broad-market indicators also posted substantial gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong numbers were fueled by a Labor Department report that  
showed the jobless rate edged up slightly to 4.4 percent in 
February. Yet the overall employment picture remained strong, 
indicating an economy that is continuing to post solid growth with 
no inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese markets set the tone for a robust trading day. Tokyo  
stocks posted their strongest gains this year, rising 5 percent. In 
Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 3.3 percent to a six-week high. 
Singapore's main index rose 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally continued in European trading today. In London, the  
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index rose 104.1 points, or 1.7 
percent, to close at 6,205.5. The main market indicators rose 2.5 
percent in Frankfurt and Paris and 3.5 percent in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong performance overseas followed a 2.1 percent rise on  
Thursday in the Dow Jones industrial average. The 191.52 point gain 
left the Dow industrials at 9,467.40 and more than erased losses 
over the previous two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was lifted by several factors: a huge contract signed by  
two U.S. computer giants, IBM and Dell Computer Co.; rising oil 
prices; and a new report about U.S. factory orders that appeared to 
dampen fears about rising inflation in America. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, which is suffering its worst recession in decades as  
well as deflation, a persistent fall in consumer prices, investors 
also benefited from some good news. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 710.55  
points, closing at 14,894.00 points. It was the highest closing 
level since Dec. 9 and the Nikkei's best single-day session since 
Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investment environment was ideal,'' said Kazunori Jinnai,  
a manager at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said some foreign investors now feel that Japan's  
economy may have bottomed out and could be headed for a slow 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Bank of Japan began guiding domestic  
short-term interest rates closer to zero in an effort to boost the 
economy by lowering costs for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	That move was praised today by top Japanese officials.  
</P>
<P>
	The lower interest rates also have helped boost the dollar,  
which has been climbing steadily against the yen, a change that 
benefits big Japanese exporters such as Sony and Toshiba by making 
their products more affordable abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 328.36 points  
to close at 10,241.12, largely because of big gains on two key 
stocks, traders said. HSBC Holdings PLC shares jumped 4 percent, 
and Hongkong Telecom shares leaped 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in Hongkong Telecom were sparked by news reports today  
that the phone company plans to announce a cooperative agreement 
with the U.S. computer giant Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the second time this week that Hong Kong, which is also  
suffering through a recession, got good news from overseas.

<HEADLINE> Marquette Fires Hoops Coach Deane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Marquette fired basketball coach Mike Deane on  
Friday after the team finished with its first losing season in his 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Deane's departure, rumored since last week, was announced two  
days after Marquette (14-15) finished the season with a loss in the 
first round of the Conference USA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike is a competitor and a fine game coach, and we wish him  
well,'' said the Rev. Robert Wild, Marquette president. ``But the 
coach and the university need to agree on the potential and goals 
of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there is a difference of opinion on those goals, it's in  
both parties' best interests to part company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deane, who had two years left on his contract, had led Marquette  
to four straight years with at least 20 wins before this season. 
His career record at Marquette was 100-55. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate all that Mike has done at Marquette,'' said  
athletic director Bill Cords. ``But the time has come for us to go 
our separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have clear expectations for all aspects of our men's  
basketball program, expectations which are not limited to, but 
definitely include, the level of excellence the program is capable 
of achieving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marquette's competitiveness ``has gradually eroded during the  
past five years,'' Cords said. ``And it has become increasingly 
clear that there is a fundamental difference in philosophy between 
Mike and Marquette in this regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Conference USA tournament Wednesday, Marquette fell  
behind early, shooting just 22 percent from the field in the first 
half and being outrebounded 24-16 in a 59-52 loss to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, which included coaching at Siena and Oswego  
State, Deane compiled a 290-157 record.

<HEADLINE> Eric Karros Glad To Be a Dodger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Eric Karros looks around the Los Angeles  
Dodgers clubhouse and sees very few familiar faces. It's almost as 
if he's been traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Karros' best Dodger buddies -- Mike Piazza, Bill Ashley, Todd  
Zeile, Paul Konerko -- are all gone. 
</P>
<P>
	He misses them, but he's glad to still be around. And now, he  
believes, the new Dodgers have what it takes to go all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior Dodger in terms of service, Karros first played with  
the team in 1991, and became the starting first baseman the 
following season, when he was voted NL Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Karros, who went to UCLA, has said repeatedly over the years  
that he loves playing in Los Angeles, but takes nothing for 
granted, especially since being unprotected in the first round of 
the expansion draft following the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	And over the past winter, there were rumors that the Dodgers  
were pursuing Mo Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still here,'' Karros said with a smile at the team's  
spring raining facility. ``I'll start worrying when my name isn't 
brought up. When you don't hear anything, that's when you get 
whacked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he hoped to spend the rest of his career with the  
Dodgers, the 31-year-old Karros, in the third season of a $20 
million, four-year contract, chuckled and replied, ``I'm hoping to 
spend the rest of my contract here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like playing for the Dodgers,'' he said. ``They're  
competitive now. I think the next few years are going to be very 
exciting, and I just want to be a part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the first under ownership of the Rupert Murdoch's Fox  
Entertainment Group Inc., the Dodgers never contended seriously, 
and finished 83-79 record, 15 games behind first-place San Diego. 
They've changed managers and general managers twice since the new 
owner took over, and only 17 players on the 40-man roster at the 
start of spring training last year are around now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just different,'' Karros said of the old and new regimes.  
``It doesn't mean one thing is better and one is worse, one is 
right and the other is wrong. Some things needed to be changed, 
other things shouldn't be changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karros admitted the money spent during the offseason on free  
agents such as pitcher Kevin Brown and outfielder Devon White plus 
other additions have changed the team's goal from winning the NL 
West to winning the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He's all for that. The Dodgers have usually been competitive in  
recent years, but haven't won a postseason game since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Karros called last year ``definitely the longest I've ever had  
on and off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He started the season on the disabled list following knee  
surgery. Despite missing the first 21 games, he hit .296 with 23 
homers and 87 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	That followed three straight seasons where he hit over 30 homers  
and drove in over 100 runs -- the only Dodger to accomplish such a 
feat in three consecutive years since the team moved from Brooklyn 
after the 1957 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Karros said he knew the Dodgers were in trouble last year even  
before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
	``And people were picking us to win,'' he said. ``Are you  
kidding me? I think last year and even in the years past we were 
always going to have a competitive team, but we always had question 
marks. That was because of payroll constraints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some have theorized that chemistry has been a problem in recent  
years, a viewpoint that causes Karros to shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't win because we didn't have good enough teams,'' he  
said. ``You can have all the chemistry in the world. If you don't 
have talent, you don't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karros now thinks the Dodgers have the talent to win, especially  
with a solid starting rotation headed by Brown, who signed a record 
$105 million, seven-year contract during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what wins: pitching,'' Karros said. ``I'm anxious to  
get going, I'm looking forward to having a healthy season. If I can 
get out there for 162 games, it will be a good year.''

<HEADLINE> Census Adjustment Issue Stirs Ire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The decision not to adjust the 1990 Census  
turned into a financial boon for Pennsylvania and Ohio but hurt 
California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 27 states and the District of Columbia lost money  
during the 1990s because of the unadjusted census, the General 
Accounting Office reports. Billions of dollars of federal aid are 
distributed among the states based on census numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and the Clinton administration are at odds over plans  
to use a method called statistical sampling to improve the accuracy 
of the 2000 Census. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 head count missed 8.4 million people and counted 4.4  
million twice, the bureau reported after using sampling to check 
its accuracy. But the Bush administration decided not to use the 
corrected figures. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant some states received more federal aid than they would  
have, some less. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, from the investigative arm of Congress, comes amid a  
battle over using sampling to correct the numbers in 2000. The 
Supreme Court last month ruled that sampling cannot be used to 
adjust numbers for the reapportionment of Congress but said the law 
requires its use for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report concluded that failure to adjust the 1990 numbers  
cost California $2.2 billion during the 1990s and said Texas was 
shorted $934 million. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, it said Pennsylvania received $1.1 billion more  
than it was due, and Ohio got an extra $532 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The states least affected were Alaska, losing $160,000, and  
Delaware, which got $210,000 less than it would have under adjusted 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In its study the GAO looked at 15 of the 22 federal programs  
that use census numbers in their distribution formulas. Those 
programs distribute $147 billion annually, or about 79 percent of 
population-based grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicaid accounted for most of the funds that would have been  
reallocated, the report said. Among the other programs included in 
the calculations were grants for rehabilitation services, foster 
care, substance abuse, child care, vocational education, highways 
and aid to women, infants and children.

<HEADLINE> Phone Merger May Force Transfers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of GTE's long-distance customers may  
eventually have to switch to another long-distance carrier if the 
company completes its planned merger with Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic isn't allowed to provide long-distance service to  
local phone customers until it receives permission by the Federal 
Communications Commission. Neither Bell Atlantic nor any other 
local Bell telephone company has gotten such approval. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Bell Atlantic and GTE have asked the FCC to give  
the merged company two years to move GTE's long-distance customers 
off its network to other carriers in any of the states where Bell 
Atlantic hasn't obtained FCC approval to provide long-distance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic provides local phone service to 13 states and the  
District of Columbia and hasn't received FCC approval to provide 
long-distance service to those areas. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE and Bell Atlantic wouldn't say exactly how many of GTE's 2.7  
million long-distance customers could potentially be affected. GTE 
has some long-distance customers scattered throughout Bell 
Atlantic's local phone region, said Bell Atlantic attorney Michael 
Glover. GTE spokesman Bob Bishop said ``less than 10 percent'' of 
the 2.7 million could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC and the Justice Department are reviewing the companies'  
merger to determine whether it would be good for consumers and for 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE and Bell Atlantic also have asked the FCC to give the merged  
company a two-year break from existing regulations that prevent 
Bell Atlantic and other Bell companies from carrying Internet 
traffic across local calling boundaries, which for regulatory 
purposes would constitute a long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The relief would permit Bell Atlantic to continue operating  
GTE's Internet ``backbone'' business, called Internetworking, while 
it seeks to obtain authority to provide long-distance service. 
Internet backbones are high capacity networks that carry Internet 
and other data traffic for third parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The requested relief, however, would take effect only after Bell  
Atlantic obtains long-distance permission in states covering 
one-quarter of its 42 million local phone lines, the companies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover said the companies detailed their plan for temporary  
relief at the request of FCC staff. The companies filed their plan 
to the FCC on Feb. 24, but made it available Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and long-distance companies AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom  
and Sprint have asked the FCC to block the deal on grounds it would 
blunt competition and lessen prospects for lower prices.

<HEADLINE> Scheme To Sell Baby Formula Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Six men and two companies have been charged with  
scheming to sell expired infant formula and nutritional products 
for invalids and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers of the products, which included brands like  
Similac and Jevity, believed that the products would be discarded 
or used to make animal feed, according to the indictment unsealed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants allegedly took the products to a warehouse and  
provided false documentation to the manufacturers saying that the 
products were being shipped to animal feed processing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the products were in Miami, the defendants allegedly put  
counterfeit labels and new expiration dates on the products. Tens 
of thousands of cases of the products were sold to wholesale 
distributors to sell to consumers, the indictment says. 
</P>
<P>
	One defendant has since died, but the five surviving men face  
sentences of up to 20 years in prison and fines up to $500,000 if 
convicted. They face charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, interstate 
transportation of stolen property, misbranding consumer products 
and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Two companies in Montreal -- The Laurentide Trading Co., Ltd.,  
and The Salvage Disposal Corp., Ltd. -- face fines of up to 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	How many products actually made it to consumers was not known,  
said John Schlesinger, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began several years ago with a complaint from  
a mother in California who bought baby formula that was chunky and 
spoiled, Schlesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	One defendant was arrested Friday in St. Louis. The others were  
expected to surrender or be arrested soon, Schlesinger said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renews Lann Lee Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today renewed an uphill  
battle to win Senate confirmation of Bill Lann Lee as the nation's 
top civil rights enforcer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton gave a personal sendoff to Lee's nomination, meeting  
with him in the Oval Office along with civil rights leaders and 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appointed Lee, a former NAACP lawyer, as acting  
assistant attorney general for civil rights in December 1997, after 
it became clear the Senate Judiciary Committee would not send Lee's 
nomination forward. The move angered Senate Republicans who vowed 
to closely monitor Lee's work on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart acknowledged that Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., have made 
statements ``that have not been supportive'' of Lee's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Lockhart said Lee has ``done an excellent job on a  
wide variety of issues over the last year'' and deserves to be 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Lann Lee's life has been in the pursuit of excellence and  
in knocking down the walls of discrimination,'' said Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass., ranking minority member on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. He talked with reporters in the White House driveway 
after the meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those that are aligned against Bill Lann Lee, their problem is  
not with Bill Lann Lee, but it is with the Supreme Court of the 
United States or with the laws of the United States,'' said 
Kennedy. ``Bill Lann Lee's life has been for the enforcement of the 
law -- nothing more, nothing less,'' Kennedy added. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we're aaking for is fairnmess and the willingness to  
listen carefully to Bill Lann Lee, and also to understand what the 
law is,'' said Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is really indecent is the failure to give him the kind of  
fair hearing under the advice and consent of the Senate,'' Kennedy 
said. ``That's what's unfair. That's what's unconstitutional.''

<HEADLINE> Fairmont State Baseball Coach Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRMONT, W.Va. (AP) -- Fairmont State baseball coach Donnie  
Retton, brother of Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton, has 
resigned after being charged with drunken driving and drug 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Retton, whose sister won gold in gymnastics in 1984, the broke  
the news to his players late Wednesday. But he did not tell them 
why he was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It caught me off guard, shocked me,'' pitcher David Maust  
said. ``You couldn't see anything like this coming, especially with 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police charged Retton, 33, with first offense drunken driving  
and possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor. Retton was pulled over 
Tuesday night after running a red light, said Police Chief Ted 
Offutt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very unfortunate situation,'' said Dave Cooper, the  
school's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Retton also is a substitute teacher in the Marion County school  
system. Superintendent Thomas Long said any additional 
repercussions from the arrest are a personnel matter he will not 
publicly discuss. 
</P>
<P>
	Retton took over Fairmont State's baseball program from Ron  
Whiting in 1996. The team went 20-13-1 in Retton's first season, 
including an 11-7 conference record. Last year, the team finished 
15-22.

Myers, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Administration To Attack Net Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Portraying the Internet as a growing  
playground for criminals, the chief of the Justice Department's 
criminal division said Friday the Clinton administration is 
readying a new program to curb fraud on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Law enforcement and regulatory authorities have been observing  
significant growth in a variety of fraudulent schemes that use the 
Internet,'' Assistant Attorney General James K. Robinson said. 
``Internet fraud ... is becoming a significant threat the tens of 
millions of people who use the Internet regularly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stock trading by computer, online auctions and direct sales of  
products to businesses and consumers already account for billions 
of dollars in sales each year and may exceed $1 trillion early in 
the 21st Century, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very factors which make the Internet so attractive as a  
medium for legitimate commerce -- communications that are global, 
instantaneous and virtually cost-free; and the ability to conduct 
commercial transactions rapidly at long distances without 
face-to-face interaction -- make it equally attractive as a medium 
for fraud,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, ``the administration in the near future will be  
launching a new initiative to address the problem of Internet fraud 
... through both criminal and civil enforcement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new program, being developed under Vice President Al Gore,  
will ``represent the first time the department has made Internet 
fraud a priority,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that instances of fraud and abuse may have been  
falling through the cracks, planners of the initiative are 
developing guidelines to increase cooperation between regulatory 
agencies, said an administration official, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	If greater coordination produces a sharp increase in cases,  
Justice officials would transfer more manpower into Internet fraud 
prosecutions, another administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's remarks were prepared for delivery to the American  
Bar Association's National Institute on White-Collar Crime in San 
Francisco. His text was released in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He outlined some of the increasing fraudulent schemes.  
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission gets 300 complaints a day  
about online stock-trading schemes, he said. Most frequently, they 
are ``pump and dump'' plots to mislead investors into putting their 
money into speculative or shell companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Using multiple e-mail messages or World Wide Web sites with  
false information, shills make it appear that many people in 
different parts of the country are enthusiastic about a stock, 
thereby pumping up its price. Insiders then dump their shares at 
handsome profits, leaving other investors with virtually worthless 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC and Justice Department prosecuted the chief executive of  
one shell company, Systems of Excellence, for price manipulation 
that gained him more than $9.6 million in illegal profits, Robinson 
said. The executive is serving 46 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said the Federal Trade Commission and the consumer  
group Internet Fraud Watch cite online auctions as the cause of 
more complaints of fraud than any other form of Internet commerce. 
Promoters promising to deliver valuable merchandise, including 
computers or Beanie Babies or Furbys, simply fail to deliver the 
goods or deliver damaged goods after the buyer has sent a check or 
money order. 
</P>
<P>
	Other criminals acquire the information to establish false  
identities from people who unknowingly entrust personal identifying 
information to others through e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet has expanded the reach of telemarketing fraud that  
used to rely on mailings and telephone calls to promote pyramid 
schemes, phony contests, bogus medical equipment or credit repair. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Web sites offer quick divorces in the Dominican Republic  
for $1,000 to $2,000, without the parties having to go there; 
victims later learn the ``divorces'' are not valid, he said.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Up by Eight / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For the second week in a row, the number of rigs  
actively exploring for oil and natural gas in the United States 
inched higher on Friday, rising by eight to 541. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide this week, 115 were exploring for  
oil and 426 for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported. 
During the same week last year, 957 rigs were operating in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom. It reached a record low 531 on Feb. 19, 1999, following four 
straight weeks of plunging counts blamed on weak oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Suffering Asian economies, heavy production by oil-laden  
countries and the record-warm conditions of 1998 all have worked to 
create a perceived glut that has depressed prices and, in turn, 
exploration activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes says there probably are fewer rigs looking for oil  
and gas in the country now than at any time since industry's 
emerging days of the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Texas gained nine  
rigs, Louisiana added three, Alaska picked up two and Wyoming rose 
by one. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma lost three rigs, New Mexico dropped two and California  
fell by one.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Plays for NCAA Seed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- For a team like No. 7 Cincinnati,  
conference tournaments don't usually mean much. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (26-4) already has secured a berth in the NCAA  
tournament, but figures it has little chance for a top seed. The 
Bearcats aren't sure they are a lock for a No. 2 seed either -- 
unless they win the Conference USA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati took its first step toward doing that Thursday,  
beating South Florida 76-56 in the quarterfinals. The win advanced 
the Bearcats into today's semifinals against North Carolina 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every win helps a little bit with seeding, but we probably are  
a No. 2 no matter what,'' guard Melvin Levett said. ``That is, if 
we can run through this. If we lose, it may hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth-seeded North Carolina Charlotte beat fourth-seeded  
Southern Miss 83-75 to set up its third meeting of the season with 
Cincinnati. The 49ers beat Cincinnati 62-60 in Charlotte in 
January, then lost 82-69 last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Alabama-Birmingham moved into the semifinals with a  
79-73 win over DePaul. The Blazers will play second-seeded 
Louisville, a 70-61 winner over Saint Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati moved into the tournament semifinals for the fourth  
straight season behind junior college transfer Pete Mickeal, who 
tied a career high with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickeal was deadly against South Florida (14-14), even though  
the noon tipoff was a bit early for his liking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt pretty tired out there, I guess because I had to get up  
at 7:30 this morning,'' Mickeal said. ``So I never really felt like 
I might get hot or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did, though, hitting his first seven shots from the field  
before missing his only two shots of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I'm really mad at him for missing those two shots,''  
Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins joked. ``When Pete is very active, and 
when he rebounds the ball, he makes everybody else better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Florida (14-14) stuck with Cincinnati for most of the  
first half, but ultimately had no answer for Mickeal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 13-of-15 from the field and made all five of his shots in  
the second half. He also led the Bearcats with nine rebounds and 
five assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete scores like that all the time, he's been so consistent  
for us,'' said Levett, who added 20 points. ``It's not always 
13-for-15 or 28 points, but it's always a consistent effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NC Charlotte (20-10) got a career-high 21 points and eight  
rebounds from Kelvin Price to set up the meeting with Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers, who led by as many as 19 in the second half before  
holding off a spirited charge down the stretch by Southern Miss, 
outscored the Golden Eagles 29-9 at the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	The most exciting game came when hometown UAB finally took the  
court. The third-seeded Blazers had a bye in the first round and 
didn't play until 6 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The wait was well worth it for UAB fans, who saw Eric Holmes and  
Damon Cobb break out of slumps by scoring a combined 39 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory helped the Blazers' (20-10) bid for an NCAA  
tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to leave it up to the selection committee,''  
Holmes said. ``We want to win tomorrow and on Saturday and then the 
committee won't be able to keep us out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes scored a career-high 24 points, Cobb added 15 and the two  
were a combined 7-for-11 from 3-point range. They had been 
horrendous down the stretch and had not combined to score more than 
16 points since Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	UAB also damaged DePaul's chances. The Blue Demons ended the  
season 17-12, but could be headed to the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just go home and lick our wounds, then wait until Sunday  
to see what tournament we're going to,'' DePaul coach Pat Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville got 20 points from Marques Maybin to move into the  
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of Maybin's points came in the final stretch after coach  
Denny Crum decided to give him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've waited on the chance all year to isolate and go  
one-on-one,'' Maybin said. ``Tonight I got it and just made some 
shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After watching Saint Louis guards Justin Love and Dave Fergerson  
control the tempo and prevent Louisville from running many plays, 
Crum decided to let Maybin loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a decision late to just go with Marques, because he's  
hard to guard one-on-one and not run set plays,'' Crum said. ``They 
guard so good, we couldn't run any set plays, so Marques took 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss likely ended the season for seventh-seeded Saint Louis  
(16-15) and possibly the career of coach Charlie Spoonhour. 
Spoonhour has indicated he might retire, but said after the game he 
has not made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably sleep on it tonight and figure out something to  
say pretty quick, get this thing over with.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton-D'Alema Text 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the news conference of President Clinton and Italian  
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, as transcribed by the Federal 
Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Good afternoon. I very much enjoyed my first meeting  
with Prime Minister D'Alema. I am proud of our alliance and our 
friendship with Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	I have to begin this press conference by stating again our great  
sorrow over what occurred at Cavalese. When I called former Prime 
Minister Prodi immediately after that terrible event, I made it 
clear that we would take strong measures to assure that something 
like that would not occur again. We have taken such measures to 
enhance safety. We will continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister and I today agreed that our secretary of  
defense and their minister of defense will review these operational 
and safety measures together to assess their adequacy and to 
determine whether additional measures should be taken to ensure the 
highest levels of safety. They will report to the prime minister 
and me as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	I know you will understand why I cannot comment on any  
particular case, in part because legal proceedings are still 
pending. But let me say that our objective has been and remains, to 
determine responsibility and accountability in an open and fair 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	As I said when this happened, the United States is responsible  
for this terrible tragedy. Again I want to say to the people of 
Italy on behalf of the American people, we are profoundly regretful 
and apologetic for what has occurred. To the families and to all 
the people of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, we must remember that we have been strong partners and good  
friends, especially in working for our common security. 
</P>
<P>
	To be able to discuss the coming 50th anniversary of NATO's  
summit. It will be here in April. We will admit new members, we 
will plan to meet new challenges, we will address our European 
allies' initiative, which I fully support, to enhance their defense 
capabilities and assume a greater role in our common defense. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's efforts have been aimed at helping the eastern half of  
Europe enjoy the freedom and stability the western half has built 
over the last half century. The end of the Cold War made this a 
possibility, but not a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	We have learned that if we do not contain conflict in Europe, it  
will spread, and we will pay a far higher price to deal with it 
down the road. That is why we and our allies acted to stop the war 
in Bosnia and start it on the path toward reconciliation and 
democracy, and why we are seeking to end the conflict in Kosovo. If 
we don't, and it intensifies, there will be a major refugee crisis 
in the center of Europe -- something that Italy knows all too well. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost certainly it will draw in nearby nations, including the  
bordering states of Albania and Macedonia, which today are engaged 
in the fragile process of building their own democracies. 
</P>
<P>
	With the next round of talks set to begin in 10 days now, I very  
much hope the Kosovar Albanians will follow through on their 
statement at Rambouillet and sign the agreement to end the fighting 
and restore self-government. It is in their strong interest, and it 
is also in Serbia's interest. Serbia must accept the agreement and 
a NATO-led force in Kosovo, which is essential for peace to take 
hold. And NATO remains ready to act, but Serbia instead continues 
the violent repression of Kosovo's people. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister recently wrote, ``The turmoil and uncertainty  
in southeast Europe has made Italy a front line state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quite true. It is terribly important that we therefore move  
together to strengthen stability across this region. NATO has been 
working closely with some of Southeast Europe's emerging 
democracies to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, when President Chirac was here, I announced a new  
initiative to expand security cooperation with these nations, to 
coordinate security assistance from NATO countries to them, and to 
improve cooperation in economic development across the region. I 
hope and believe Italy will play a key role in this effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister and I also talked about our common efforts  
and our common interests in spurring global economic growth, 
bringing greater stability to the world's financial system, and 
putting a human face on the global economy by supporting working 
families and aiding the most vulnerable citizens, communities, and 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, I'm grateful to know that our economy reached a milestone  
with 18 million new jobs last month since 1993. But the United 
States cannot grow over the long run unless prosperity is 
increasing for our friends and partners in Europe, Latin America, 
Asia and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	I want to work with the prime minister to address growth, the  
stability of the financial system, and the human needs of the 21st 
century economy. And I must say I'm quite optimistic about our 
prospects based on our first meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
	Again, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. The podium is yours.  
</P>
<P>
	D'ALEMA (through interpreter): Thank you, Mr. President, for  
your words. And thank you for our talks which for me have been very 
interesting indeed. 
</P>
<P>
	I conveyed to the president of the United States that I was  
personally shocked and so is Italian public opinion owing to a 
verdict which gave the impression that the tragic accident at 
Cavalese could find no effective answer in terms of determination 
and punishment of those responsible for it. 
</P>
<P>
	I thank the president of the United States for the sorrow he  
decided to express in remembering that tragedy. The sincere sorrow 
and a feeling we have great appreciation for. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the United States repeated here that he  
believes that accident concerns the responsibility of the United 
States. I also understand that this moment we cannot and must not 
interfere with a specific judicial proceeding which is not yet over 
which will include new trials and new verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	I just wish to stress one point. That event certainly cannot be  
considered an ordinary occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not normal for a military aircraft to fly in a valley 300  
feet from the ground. It is neither normal nor acceptable that this 
leads to the consequences it did lead to. We expect that at the end 
of the process it is made clear who was responsible for this 
accident and that these people are punished for it.

	At the same time as President Clinton said, we gave a mandate to  
the defense secretaries of the United States and Italy to jointly 
examine, reexamine old measures concerning the functioning of 
military bases, concerning the military exercises around such 
bases, all the safety measures that will reassure citizens that 
such accidents can never again occur. 
</P>
<P>
	I must say I appreciated the human sensitivity and the serious  
way in which President Clinton reminded us all of his commitments 
to Prime Minister Prodi and his will that justice is done and that 
-- in a clear way. 
</P>
<P>
	Our talks have shown that the friendship and cooperation between  
the United States and Italy is very strong, both in the preparation 
for the NATO summits and in the preparation of the G-7, G-8 
meeting, as well as in confronting the most acute and delicate 
international crises.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Hit GOP Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are attacking a Republican framework  
for a 2000 budget that the GOP says would protect Social Security 
surpluses, provide a five-year tax cut of nearly $200 billion and 
heed two-year-old spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate and House Republican leaders agreed to a broad outline of  
their plan Thursday, capping weeks of private meetings. Republicans 
hope it will help them win their battle with President Clinton over 
how to use massive budget surpluses expected for the foreseeable 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	It also seems to reflect a truce between House and Senate  
Republicans, whose bickering over cutting taxes last year resulted 
in Congress' first failure in 24 years to produce its own budget. 
</P>
<P>
	White House economic adviser Gene Sperling today applauded the  
GOP's focus on Social Security and paying down the debt, but 
criticized legislators for not promising that debt reduction would 
benefit the retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said it would be ``irresponsible'' to not apply some of  
the budget surplus to Medicare while promising tax cuts instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are adamant that we need 15 percent of the surplus set  
aside for Medicare,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement spells out general budget principles for fiscal  
2000, which begins Oct. 1, and leaves questions about many details 
for later. But even before the leaders began selling it to 
rank-and-file Republicans, Democrats derided it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure that what they're proposing in this budget is  
possible without a good deal of smoke and mirrors,'' said Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be looking particularly to see if this plan  
does anything to strengthen the solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare, as the president's plan does,'' said White House 
spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and  
House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, hope to push a 
detailed plan reflecting the agreement through their panels within 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP proposal promises to set aside $1.8 trillion in  
projected surpluses over the next decade for debt reduction, or to 
buttress Social Security and Medicare if those programs are 
overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
	They declared that exceeded the amount the Clinton's budget,  
proposed last month, would reserve by $150 billion, according to 
the Congressional Budget Office. And they cited CBO figures saying 
Clinton would only use 58 percent of next year's $137 billion 
Social Security surplus for the giant pension program. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's running around saying he's the one saving Social  
Security,'' said Domenici, one of the architects of the GOP plan. 
``If saving the trust fund and not spending it is the test, we're 
100 percent pure, and he's 58 percent pure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By setting aside that money, Republicans were hoping to protect  
themselves from Democratic accusations that they want to divert 
surpluses from Social Security and use the money for tax cuts for 
the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has had the field virtually to himself since sending  
Congress his proposed $1.77 trillion budget. In it, he proposed 
setting aside most of the expected surpluses for buttressing Social 
Security and Medicare, and spending the rest on new federally 
subsidized personal retirement accounts as well as on an array of 
defense and social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, House and Senate Republicans had clashed over how  
much, if any, of the surpluses to use to finance the tax cuts that 
many in the party consider their hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute was crucial because the CBO expects a 2000 surplus  
of $133 billion -- coming entirely from Social Security. Many House 
Republicans wanted to use some of that money so a noticeable tax 
cut could begin in 2000 -- amid the presidential and congressional 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans, worried about Clinton's attacks, were  
insistent that none of the Social Security money be used for tax 
cuts, and they prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, next year's tax reduction would likely be  
relatively small because lawmakers would have to find savings and 
new revenues to pay for them. The cut will probably be about $15 
billion next year and from $150 billion to $190 billion over the 
next five years, surging to $700 billion to $900 billion over the 
next decade, said Republicans who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also said their plan would live within next year's  
spending limit of roughly $550 billion for discretionary spending. 
</P>
<P>
	That category covers all annually approved defense and domestic  
programs but excludes automatic benefits such as welfare and 
payments to holders of federal debt. The limit was enacted as part 
of the 1997 budget-balancing pact between Clinton and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they would stay within that limit while  
increasing defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not explain, however, how they would stay within those  
limits, which many Republicans concede will be a major problem. 
Because of inflation, just to have the same programs as this year 
would take cuts of at least $15 billion -- not including increases 
desired by both parties for defense and education.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies  
Friday after coming off of a rally in Japan and New York. The 
dollar also reached a new high against the euro before reversing 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.80  
Japanese yen, down from 123.35 on Thursday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.0835, up from $1.0805. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trading day, the euro slipped to $1.0785, yet another  
low in the euro's slide since it began trading at the beginning of 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose during Asian trading as Japanese stocks surged 5  
percent thanks to Thursday's rally on Wall Street and record low 
interest rates in Japan. Interest rates fell this week in Japan 
because the government bought short-term bonds, flooding the market 
with cash and driving down interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders thought Friday that similar actions would continue  
because a senior International Monetary Fund official said he 
welcomed greater easing of Japan's monetary policy. Japan is 
fighting its worst recession in decades, and lower interest rates 
spur borrowing but weaken the yen against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, during New York trading, the dollar rallied further as  
Wall Street interpreted new economic data, a slight rise in 
unemployment to 4.4 percent in February, as a positive sign that 
inflation was not a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks and bonds rallied, the Dow Jones industrial average  
soaring 268 points to a new high. The U.S. Treasury 30-year bond 
initially rose more than 2 points, which lowered its yield. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the dollar stumbled as the lower interest rates brought  
on by the rise in bond prices made the dollar less attractive 
versus other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same old story, the dollar getting yanked around by  
bonds,'' said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics 
in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4707 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4699, and 1.5199 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5253. The British 
pound fell to $1.6064, down from $1.6098. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8051 German 
marks, down from 1.8100; 6.0533 French francs, down from 6.0716; 
and Italian lire, 1,785.71, down from 1,792.11.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Wants King To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A prosecutor wants a white supremacist who was  
sentenced to death in the dragging death of a black man to testify 
against a co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Friday he  
has yet to hear whether John William King will agree to testify 
against Shawn Allen Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer are awaiting trial for the  
June 7 slaying of James Byrd Jr, who was dragged to his death 
behind a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray asked King through his attorney this week if he would  
testify against Berry, the only suspect to make several police 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I ever put him on the stand, I would have to feel that  
his testimony is truthful,'' Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry's attorney, Joseph C. Hawthorn, said Gray's attempt to get  
King to testify indicates that the case against his client is 
flimsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would indicate that he feels like his case is so weak that  
he has got to turn to someone he has called the devil to prop up 
his case against Berry,'' Hawthorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next trial is tentatively scheduled for May 17 before state  
District Judge Monte Lawlis. Brewer likely will be tried first 
because Berry's attorney is scheduled for trial in California at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, has been confined on death row since he was sentenced  
to death Feb. 25 for killing the 49-year-old Byrd.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota, Purdue Are on Bubble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Illinois coach Lon Kruger didn't bother telling  
his young team how to pack for its trip to the Big Ten tournament. 
He wasn't sure how long they'd be staying. 
</P>
<P>
	Many thought the 11th-seeded Illini wouldn't need a change of  
clothes. Just make the three-hour trip to the United Center, take a 
beating and head home. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong. Cory Bradford made sure the Illini will be hanging around  
for tonight's quarterfinals against Indiana. The freshman guard was 
6-of-7 on 3-pointers as the Illini blew a 22-point lead and then 
regrouped to upset No. 23 Minnesota 67-64 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois isn't the only low seed to still be playing. Defending  
tournament champion Michigan, the 10th seed, got 10 late points 
from Louis Bullock and then a big 3-pointer from Robbie Reid in 
overtime to beat seventh-seeded Purdue 79-73. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first game of the opening round, Northwestern all but  
assured itself of a NIT bid by beating Penn State 54-44. 
</P>
<P>
	That set up these quarterfinals: No. 20 Iowa (18-8) vs No. 19  
Wisconsin (21-8); Northwestern (15-12) against regular-season 
champion and second-ranked Michigan State (26-4); Michigan (12-18) 
against second-seeded and 11th-ranked Ohio State (22-7); and the 
17th-ranked Hoosiers (22-9) against Illinois (12-17). 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford hit four 3-pointers in the second half, cutting off a  
Minnesota rally that saw the Golden Gophers overcome a 38-23 
halftime deficit and take a one-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford banked in one 3-pointer and then hit three others to  
bail out the Illini. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just took it upon myself to put up some points because we  
went through a long stretch where we couldn't put the ball in the 
basket,'' said Bradford, the Big Ten's freshman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's Quincy Lewis, the Big Ten's leading scorer at 24.4  
points a game, managed only eight points on 3-of-17 shooting, 
ending his stretch of 31 games in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to have Quincy making shots. We're not a great club  
without him,'' Minnesota coach Clem Haskins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins is still convinced the Gophers (17-10) should be in the  
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident we are one of the best 64 teams in the  
country. We felt this tournament was more important in terms of our 
seeding,'' Haskins said. 
</P>
<P>
	How about Purdue after its disheartening loss to Michigan in a  
rematch of last year's Big Ten championship game? 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gene Keady thinks the Boilermakers (19-12) are also  
deserving, but isn't sure how his team will react if it doesn't 
make the field of 64. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told our players after the game I'm not sure what's going to  
happen Sunday,'' Keady said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll meet and decide Sunday night if we'll pick the NIT if  
we're not picked for the NCAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan's only route to a postseason bid is to win the  
tournament again. If not, the Wolverines will be staying home from 
both the NCAA and NIT for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been undermanned in terms of depth and maybe a little  
under talented, but on a given night we're capable of being a lot 
of people,'' Michigan coach Brian Ellerbe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock scored 10 of his 26 points in the final four minutes of  
regulation. Then in overtime, Reid hit a crucial 3-pointer from 
long range and Bullock tipped in his own miss to finish the 
seventh-seeded Boilermakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Cardinal scored a career-high 33 points for Purdue.  
Leading scorer Jaraan Cornell managed just five -- 11 under his 
average-- before fouling out with 7:20 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	With Penn State collapsing on Northwestern center Evan  
Eschmeyer, freshman Steve Lepore made key shots down the stretch, 
scoring eight points of his 14 points to lead the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern, which snapped a six-game losing streak, must now  
find a way to beat one of the hottest teams in the country -- 
Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're coming in on a mission. They want to be a No. 1 seed,  
No. 2 in the country,'' Northwestern coach Kevin O'Neill said. 
``The one thing we learned playing them before is that they're darn 
good. If you give them a chance to play in the full court, they'll 
beat the snot out of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State routed Northwestern 65-48 during the regular  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats will also need another strong defensive  
performance, like the one they had against the Nittany Lions when 
Penn State's Dan Earl managed just nine shots and seven points. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't make it a halfcourt game, we will not have a  
chance,'' O'Neill said.

<HEADLINE> Wrongly Convicted Awarded Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Four black men whose murder convictions were  
overturned after a group of student journalists uncovered new 
evidence agreed to a $36 million settlement today with Cook County. 
</P>
<P>
	``This county is recognizing the extent of the gross misconduct  
and the extent of the incredible injuries that these men 
suffered,'' said Larry Marshall, a Northwestern law professor who 
represented one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
	The men claimed that the sheriff's police who investigated the  
1978 killings were racists who hid evidence that would have helped 
the defense while ignoring leads pointing to the real killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Adams, Dennis Williams, Willie Raines and Verneal Jimerson  
were in their 20s when they were wrongfully convicted of a 1978 
gang rape and double murder of a south suburban couple, Lawrence 
Lionberg and Carol Schmal. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Jimerson went to Death Row after separate trials.  
Raines and Adams were sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	They were imprisoned until 1996, when Northwestern University  
professor David Protess and some of his students who investigated 
the case proved that a state witness had lied and that other people 
had killed the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the amount of the settlement represented ``the  
punishment necessary for putting four innocent men in the 
penitentiary and two on Death Row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 11 individuals have been released from death row in  
Illinois since capital punishment was restored, including one man 
who was freed last month after more work done by Protess' class. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other defendants have been convicted in the double murder.

<HEADLINE>  Cleveland Browns Looking Like 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ty Detmer, Terry Kirby, Marquez Pope, Irv  
Smith, Antonio Langham, Roy Barker, Steve Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Every day the Cleveland Browns of 1999 look more like the San  
Francisco 49ers of last year. Next thing you know, the expansion 
team will be calling itself the Cleveland 99ers to tighten the bond 
that much more. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably wouldn't bother Browns coach Chris Palmer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a security in knowing what you're getting,''  
Palmer said Friday at a news conference where Detmer, who will be 
the Browns starting quarterback when training camp opens, and free 
safety Pope were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the players are coming from a team that was  
1-15. San Francisco's a team that's had a lot of success,'' Palmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer and Pope are among a dozen players on the Browns roster,  
including at least five projected starters, who at one time were 
with San Francisco. Kirby became the latest ex-49er to join 
Cleveland when the running back signed with the Browns on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The obvious front office connection between San Francisco and  
Cleveland -- Browns president Carmen Policy and director of football 
operations Dwight Clark were president and general manager of the 
49ers -- has grown in the past month as San Francisco has slashed 
$30 million from its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have picked up 49ers from trades, free agent signings  
and the expansion draft. This is not the way Cleveland planned it, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want to take a bunch of players from the 49ers,'' he  
said. ``Because I know when guys have left us (San Francisco) to 
coach other teams, they've taken guys from the 49ers and it's 
really bothersome to the guys that are staying there. But they kept 
asking about our interest in players that I really liked. So I said 
'Yeah, OK, I'd be happy to take those guys.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Having an influx of players from a former Super Bowl champion  
and perennial playoff team like San Francisco will be a boost to a 
young club trying to establish itself, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll help set the tone for practice,'' he said. ``Practices  
in San Francisco were short but they were crisp. People were 
running around all over the place, getting a lot of work in fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope agreed. He said the 49ers played hard every time they were  
on the field, even if they were facing each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we practiced, we competed,'' he said. Future Hall of Fame  
wide receiver ``Jerry Rice would not take a day off. You could not 
got out there and relax and say, 'OK, today is Wednesday, I'm a 
little sore. I'm going to take it easy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer, who says he wouldn't mind being a mentor if the Browns  
take Kentucky's Tim Couch or another quarterback with its first 
draft pick, said having some familiar faces around will suit him, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know the guys, you know what to expect from them,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the San Francisco shopping spree may be over for now. Palmer  
said except for a few possible moves in the next week, the Browns 
attention is turning away from free agency and toward April's 
college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark all but ruled out the Browns making a bid for yet another  
49er, free agent wide receiver J.J. Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got enough 49ers now,'' Clark said. ``Unless  
some great offer comes up.''

<HEADLINE> Asia's Top 3 Markets Enjoy Big Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Following Wall Street's example, Asia's top three  
stock markets greeted good economic news with big rallies today, 
especially in Japan, where the key index leaped 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For Tokyo stocks, it was the best day this year. In Hong Kong,  
the Hang Seng Index hit a six-week high. In fact, they left 
Singapore's 1.1 percent gain looking paltry by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average  
climbed 191.52 points, or 2.1 percent, to 9,467.40. That more than 
erased losses over the previous two sessions, and the average 
closed above 9,400 for the first time in more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was lifted by several factors: a huge contract signed by  
two U.S. computer giants, IBM and Dell Computer Co.; rising oil 
prices; and a new report about U.S. factory orders that appeared to 
dampen fears about rising inflation in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally continued in early European trading today.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 653 European companies was up 2.45  
points, or 0.9 percent, at 290.49, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 
Index, which tracks 324 companies in countries joining the single 
European currency, was up 2.97 points at 301.81. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index was up  
35.8 points at 6137.2. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, which is suffering its worst recession in decades as  
well as deflation, a persistent fall in consumer prices, investors 
also benefited from some good news. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 710.55  
points, closing at 14,894.00 points. It was the highest closing 
level since Dec. 9 and the Nikkei's best single-day session since 
Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investment environment was ideal,'' said Kazunori Jinnai,  
a manager at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said some foreign investors now feel that Japan's  
economy may have bottomed out and could be headed for a slow 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Bank of Japan began guiding domestic  
short-term interest rates closer to zero in an effort to boost the 
economy by lowering costs for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	That move was praised today by top Japanese officials.  
</P>
<P>
	The lower interest rates also have helped boost the dollar,  
which has been climbing steadily against the yen, a change that 
benefits big Japanese exporters such as Sony and Toshiba by making 
their products more affordable abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 328.36 points,  
or 3.3 percent, to close at 10,241.12, largely because of big gains 
on two key stocks, traders said. HSBC Holdings PLC shares jumped 4 
percent, and Hongkong Telecom shares leaped 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in Hongkong Telecom were sparked by news reports today  
that the phone company plans to announce a cooperative agreement 
with the U.S. computer giant Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the second time this week that Hong Kong, which is also  
suffering through a recession, got good news from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the territory's government announced that it was  
in serious negotiations with the Walt Disney Co. about plans to 
build a theme park. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore investors also were encouraged by the strong gains in  
the U.S. and Japanese bourses, said Antony Mak, a director at 
Vickers Ballas Holdings Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times Index rose 16.25 points, or 1.1 percent, to  
1,449.66, its highest close since Jan. 27.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Re-Sign Wide Receiver Stokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The 49ers took J.J. Stokes off the  
free agent market Friday, signing the star wide receiver to a 
seven-year deal and keeping him in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the contract were not released, but team officials  
said it was worth more than $3 million a year with the last two 
years voidable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money was not the deciding factor. That was kind of  
secondary,'' Stokes told radio station KNBR. ``I would love for my 
family to continue to come to my home games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, a native of San Diego and a first-round draft pick out  
of UCLA in 1995, was plagued by injuries in his first two seasons 
but regained his health and blossomed in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Paired with Terrell Owens while Jerry Rice was out with knee  
injuries in 1997, Stokes caught 58 passes for 733 yards and four 
touchdowns. Last season with Stokes, Owens and Rice posing one of 
the league's most formidable triple threats, Stokes had 63 catches 
for 770 yards and eight TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh had said one of his top priorities  
was re-signing Stokes and keeping San Francisco's wide receiver 
corps intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes became an unrestricted free agent and had discussions  
with several other teams, including the Cleveland Browns, Carolina 
Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 49ers had never stopped 
talking with Stokes and were finally able to come to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for a fair deal from the 49ers throughout the  
season,'' Stokes said. ``When that didn't happen, I said I was 
going to go out and explore my options. I went elsewhere just to 
see what was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a fair deal for me and I think they put one on the  
table for me, and I took it.''

<HEADLINE> Tudjman: WWII Trial To Be Impartial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- President Franjo Tudjman told a prominent  
Jewish group on Friday that the trial of a former commandant of the 
Balkans' most infamous concentration camp will be ``impartial and 
objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A district court judge on Thursday adjourned the trial of Dinko  
Sakic, most likely the century's last major Nazi-era war crimes 
suspect, until March 15, after a doctor said that the defendant's 
life could be at risk if he sat through the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Sakic was hospitalized Wednesday after fainting  
while watching television in the prison where he has been held 
since being extradited in June from Argentina, his home for more 
than a half century. Sakic is accused of responsibility in up to 
2,000 murders during his stint as commandant of the Jasenovac 
concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Former B'nai B'rith president Tommy Baer is observing the trial  
on behalf of the Jewish organization. Baer expressed concern after 
the postponement of the trial that it ``could be a pattern of 
dilatory tactics...to create continuous delays and to reduce the 
world's attention to a case of immense historical importance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Tudjman's office faxed to the Associated press,  
said that Tudjman told Baer that ``Croatia has condemned all crimes 
committed during Ustashe regime'' --Croatia's version of the Nazis -- 
and that ``the trial will be impartial and objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are no exact figures on the number of victims killed at  
the site 60 miles southeast of Zagreb. Historians have been 
wrangling over estimates, ranging from about 35,000 to 500,000 -- 
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and anti-Nazi Croats. The U.S. Justice 
Department has put the figure at about 125,000.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Needs Good Run in Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The Las Vegas 400 is an important, perhaps even  
crucial, event for Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time defending Winston Cup champion, who won 13 races  
and ran away with his third title in four years in 1998, finished 
17th last March in the inaugural Winston Cup event on the wide, 
mildly banked 1 1/2-mile Las Vegas Motor Speedway oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``No excuses,'' said Gordon, who was lapped midway through the  
1998 race. ``It wasn't anything mechanical or in the pits. It was 
just a matter of not being able to run the car competitively under 
the circumstances. We just weren't very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who won in Daytona, needs a good race here Sunday after  
a rare engine failure relegated him to a 39th-place finish two 
weeks ago in Rockingham and sent him tumbling to 11th in the season 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody who is competing for the championship can afford two  
bad races in a row,'' Gordon said. ``We just hope we're as 
competitive in Las Vegas as we think we will be. We'd better be. We 
don't want to dig ourselves a big hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Mark Martin led a Ford rout in Las Vegas, with the  
top seven and 13 of the top 14 driving Tauruses, the model that 
replaced the discontinued Thunderbirds only two races before. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was contested under NASCAR's ``Five and Five Rule,'' an  
aerodynamics regulation governing the height of rear spoilers and 
front air dams. The sanctioning body modified the rules the week 
following the Las Vegas race, hoping to balance out competition 
among Ford, Chevrolet and Pontiac, but it appeared the Tauruses 
continued to have an edge through most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Gordon's Chevrolet gave the General Motors camp a  
consistent shot at the Fords throughout 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR changed the rules again prior to the season finale in  
November at Atlanta Motor Speedway, raising all the rear spoilers 
and lowering the front air dams on all three models -- against 
hoping to even up among the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon won the Atlanta race, followed by three Fords.  
</P>
<P>
	The season-opener in Daytona has different aerodynamic rules  
because it is one of two NASCAR tracks at which the engines are 
restricted to keep speeds down. The results from the next race, in 
Rockingham, were inconclusive, with Fords taking four of the top 
five spots, but GM finishing in five of the top 10 positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Pemberton, crew chief for Rusty Wallace's Ford -- third  
here last year and second in the season points heading into 
Sunday's race -- said, ``The new air dam and spoiler rules now in 
effect are going to make the competition really tight. The cars are 
going to be able to race two abreast and maybe even three abreast 
in some instances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The likelihood of a driver being able to run away with the  
thing is not too great. The tire grip and driver control aspects 
really make me feel like this could be a race that they talk about 
for many months to come and we're all just hoping that it's us that 
they're doing the most talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who won in Rockingham, isn't so sure about the new rules  
being an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spoilers and air dams making better races is yet to be  
seen,'' he said. ``I think you will be able to run side-by-side, 
where before it was difficult to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had a 10th-place car at Las Vegas and everybody just  
put (new) spoilers and air dams on, you'd still have a 10th-place 
car. So I think you've got to figure out how to get your car 
driving as good and going as fast as the guy that's leading.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton-D'Alema Text 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON: And what I would hope that the people of Italy would  
give the prime minister the ability to do is to try some new ideas, 
to support him in admitting that no one has solved this problem 
perfectly and that we should want responsible leaders to have 
serious thoughts about new ideas and to try them out without having 
someone try to derail every effort that they make. 
</P>
<P>
	I think he deserves some support in addressing this issue,  
because for us, any of us, to pretend that we either shouldn't 
address it or have all the answers, I think both approaches would 
be quite wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, let me just say a word on the trade issue. First of all,  
the specific issue you mentioned must feel strange to Italy, since 
the Italians have not really been at the forefront of this 
decade-long dispute between the EU and the United States over the 
banana issue. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not really about bananas, it's about rules. I'm trying now,  
right now, to get the United States, through the authority of the 
Congress, to take the lead in further market opening measures. And 
I have done my best to keep our markets open during this very 
difficult period for the Asian economy and for much of the Latin 
American economy. 
</P>
<P>
	We had a record trade deficit last year. I thought that except  
for where I thought our laws were being violated, like in steel, 
where -- that we were having steel dumped, I felt that we should try 
to do that, that that should be our contribution, because we are 
doing well, we ought to try to help these countries as much as we 
could. But we cannot maintain an open trading system, which I am 
convinced is essential for global prosperity, unless we also have 
rules that are abided by. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice, just twice since I've been president, we've won this case  
from the EU. I think we've won it four times over the last ten 
years. It has gone on -- somehow the rules have to work. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what this about. And since it's the EU -- I had nothing to  
do, by the way, with drawing up the details of what would be in the 
package of countervailing terrorists or duties. But I think our 
trade ambassador's office must have felt that since it was an EU 
dispute, there had to be some -- we couldn't just pick out countries 
and play favorites in that way. 
</P>
<P>
	But I regret this very much. And we still have time to fix this.  
We can still fix this and it be avoided. And I hope very much we 
will in the next few weeks get a resolution of this. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's been going on ten years. And we lose cases in the WTO  
all the time, and we just take a deep breath and face the fact that 
we lost. It happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, so I would say to the people of Italy don't -- it's not a  
unilateral issue. 
</P>
<P>
	On the -- you asked me about the United Nations.  
</P>
<P>
	I can't -- there are very few countries in the world, in the  
years that I have been president, who have shown more consistent 
leadership, even through a successive change of governments, than 
Italy. For us it's a critical country in so many ways. And I -- I 
was delighted that the prime minister would come here today. I 
would do anything I could to increase the responsibility and reach 
of the Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has had a long-standing policy in favor of  
expanding the Security Council to include Japan and Germany, 
largely because of the size of their economies and their influence 
and their importance for that reason. And we have been -- we have 
recognized that there are countries in the developing world that 
believe they should have more permanent membership, so we have been 
for an expansion in the size of Security Council generally to 
guarantee certain continents and regions a permanent position. 
</P>
<P>
	The position we have taken should not be viewed as an  
anti-Italian position. We tried to calculate how many people can 
you have on the Security Council and still have it function. That's 
basically where we've been. I'm not all -- I'm not obsessed with any 
-- there is no magic number. But what we're trying to do is not to 
hold back anyone but to keep the Security Council as a functioning 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	But I doubt very seriously that there's another leader of any  
other country in the world that has a higher opinion of the 
international responsibility and capacity of the Italian government 
and the Italian people that I do, after having observed it for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.  

</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unflinching in his loyalty to President  
Clinton, Al Gore nevertheless harbored some concerns about how he 
would carry himself in public as the momentum for impeachment built 
in the House of Representatives, according to a new biography of 
the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore quickly consulted a group of his most loyal confidants,  
including his wife, Tipper. They arrived at a strategy in which the 
vice president condemned the impeachment of his boss, but not the 
man behind the inquiry -- independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr, 
according to Bob Zelnick's ``Gore: A Political Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He would not become Clinton's hatchet man,'' writes Zelnick, a  
former ABC News correspondent. ``He would not, Samson-like, tear 
down the pillars of the government he fervently hoped to inherit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, published by Regnery Press, portrays the vice  
president as a politician of conscience, but one whose ``Eagle 
Scout'' image has been sullied in part by the misdeeds of Clinton 
and by his own implications in fund-raising debacles. 
</P>
<P>
	It largely rehashes the controversies surrounding Gore and his  
efforts to raise money, both as a senator and as vice president. 
Zelnick also recounts other flaps of Gore's vice presidency, 
including federal contracts awarded to Molten Metal Technology, a 
contributor to the Democratic National Committee and the 
Clinton-Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, dismissed the book as a  
right-wing attack on the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The book appears to be nothing more than a regurgitation of  
old news. It's obvious that the radical right, after spending six 
years attacking the president, is now turning its sights on Al 
Gore,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelnick praises the vice president at times, including his ``act  
of conscience and moral courage'' in supporting the 1991 Gulf War 
resolution while in the Senate. But Zelnick also alleges that Gore 
has been willing to forsake some of his commitment to the 
environment and other issues for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Tennessee had long suffered the ill effects of  
pollution coming down the Pigeon River from the International 
Champion Corp. in Canton, N.C. But in 1987, Gore, who wanted to 
build political clout and raise funds in North Carolina, struck a 
deal with the corporation that curtailed pollution to a level that 
was still above the standards set by the Environmental Protection 
Agency, according to Zelnick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's self-proclaimed 'breakthrough' amounted to little more  
than political showboating,'' he writes. The issue eventually came 
back to haunt Gore as vice president, and he directed the head of 
the EPA to reconsider Champion's permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelnick cites other instances of the vice president's  
flip-flopping, including his attempts to ingratiate himself with 
music industry bigwigs after his wife, Tipper, launched her 
campaign against pornography in rock music, and his support for 
tobacco farmers against foreign competition while denouncing the 
health effects of cigarettes after his sister died of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between Al Gore Jr. and Al Gore Sr. left a  
strong imprint on the younger Gore and often steered his decisions, 
the book says. As a student at Harvard University, Gore once 
expressed his disenchantment with the Vietnam War in a letter to 
his father, who was a senator from Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have inveterate antipathy for communism -- or paranoia,  
as I like to put it. My own belief is that this form of 
psychological ailment -- in this case a national madness -- leads the 
victim to actually create the thing which is feared the most,'' 
Gore wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who served in Vietnam after college, never became a campus  
activist on this front because of concern for his father's 
political career and for his own future, Zelnick argues.

<HEADLINE> Justice: No Pressure on Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department lawyers did not talk to the  
White House before recommending doing away with the independent 
counsel law, a top department official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Attorney General Janet Reno did not know until recently  
that a small group of her prosecutors was studying the law that led 
to Kenneth Starr's appointment, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law will expire June 30 unless Congress extends it for  
another five years. The Clinton administration supported the law 
when it was passed in 1994, but reversed itself Tuesday when Holder 
testified to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder said there was no pressure from the White House.  
</P>
<P>
	``They had no substantive role in the formulation of the change  
in policy or the positions that I took two days ago,'' Holder said 
during the department's weekly press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Holder said the Watergate-inspired  
investigations statute failed to remove politics from 
investigations of senior administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A special panel of federal judges appoints independent counsels  
after an investigation and recommendation from the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has sought seven independent counsels in her six-year  
tenure, but opposed appointing an outside counsel to investigate 
fund raising during President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional critics such as Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin  
Hatch, R-Utah, have accused her of using her powers under the 
independent counsel law to protect Clinton. Reno has denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder said he thought it best that Reno not know about the  
initial discussions on the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted her to be in a position to be able to say in these  
press availabilities, among other places, that, you know, it was 
something ... she had not been involved in,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago, Holder said, he told Reno the task force  
had concluded the law could not be fixed and should be scrapped. 
She agreed, and the Justice Department made that recommendation to 
the administration in a meeting with White House Counsel Charles 
F.C. Ruff, Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All he said was, `Let me think about this for a day or so,'  
... and then they came back to us and said that the testimony that 
I was going to give had been cleared,'' Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Monica Lewinsky's comments about her treatment by  
Starr's deputies caught the attention of lawmakers debating whether 
to renew the 21-year-old Independent Counsel Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a lot to add to that debate if she wants to,'' said  
Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House 
Judiciary subcommittee considering the law's fate. ``I would be 
interested in hearing that if she wants to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate lawmakers of both parties said there has been  
no serious discussion of seeking her testimony.

<HEADLINE> About 100 Attend Pitcher's Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Former major league pitcher Ken  
Robinson was buried in his Arizona Diamondbacks uniform Friday, 
five days after he was killed in a car accident in which a teammate 
was driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people attended Robinson's funeral service in  
Jacksonville, including Mel Didier, special assistant to the 
general manager for the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 29, was the lone passenger in teammate John  
Rosengren's car when it left a Tucson highway and overturned Sunday 
night. Robinson was declared dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab results show Rosengren, 26, had a blood-alcohol level of  
0.162 -- well above Arizona's legal limit of 0.10, police said. He 
was charged with second-degree murder but released on $75,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had short stints as a relief pitcher for the Toronto  
Blue Jays in 1995 and 1997 and for the Kansas City Royals in 1996. 
He underwent surgery last June to repair an injured shoulder and 
was trying to make a comeback at the Diamondbacks' minor league 
spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of his pro career with the Syracuse SkyChiefs, the  
Blue Jays' Triple-A affiliate. In 1996 and 1997, he won the team's 
Community Service Award, given to the player most willing to 
volunteer time for noble causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it all,'' SkyChiefs general manager John Simone told  
the Florida Times-Union. ``Players like him come along once in a 
lifetime. Whenever we were stuck and somebody didn't show at a 
school, or there was a cancellation, Ken was the guy I always 
called. You hate to bug the same guy all the time, but he never 
said no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson is survived by his wife, Lorrie, and a 22-month-old  
son, Chase.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Gender-Based Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal law that gives civil rights  
protections to victims of gender-motivated violence is 
unconstitutional, a divided federal appeals court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 7-4 to uphold a  
lower court's ruling against the Violence Against Women Act, which 
allows women to sue their sex attackers for damages in federal 
court for violating their civil rights. It has been the target of 
several legal challenges since it became law in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a statute, we are constrained to conclude, simply cannot  
be reconciled with the principles of limited federal government 
upon which this nation is founded,'' said the ruling written by 
Judge J. Michael Luttig. 
</P>
<P>
	The act also included federal funding to help states curtail  
violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
	The full court overruled its own three-judge panel that in 1997  
had voted 2-1 to throw out the lower court's ruling in the case of 
a college student who claimed her civil rights were violated by her 
school and two football players accused of raping her. 
</P>
<P>
	Christy Brzonkala, a student at Virginia Tech, said the attack  
occurred in a dormitory a few months after the federal law took 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not report the incident for several months and no  
criminal charges were ever filed against the two players, Antonio 
Morrison and James Crawford. She contends in her lawsuit that their 
acts violated her civil right to be free from gender-motivated 
crimes of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	She contended that Virginia Tech mishandled the campus judicial  
proceedings against the players and protected them because they 
were athletes. Her case never got to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruled that Congress overstepped its bounds  
when it relied on its power to regulate interstate commerce to 
enact the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brzonkala, who has allowed her name to be made public,  
argued that gender-motivated violence affects commerce by imposing 
medical and legal costs on victims, inhibiting travel by those who 
fear violence and lessening productivity. She was the first to sue 
under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court described the law as ``a sweeping intrusion'' into  
matters traditionally handled by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	In dissent, Judge Diana G. Motz wrote that Congress had clear  
authority to enact the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that people of good will -- including federal  
judges -- could believe that the statute challenged here does not 
constitute good public policy. But judges' policy choices provide 
no basis for finding a statute unconstitutional,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``When federal courts undertake responsibility of this kind  
without specific constitutional support, the threat to our system 
of government is grave indeed,'' she wrote for the four dissenting 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling means the federal law is no longer in effect in the  
4th U.S. Circuit, which includes Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, 
North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brzonkala's lawyer said the case would be appealed to the  
U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Neuharth Says Newpapers Here To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACON, Ga. (AP) -- The Internet is not likely to replace  
newspapers anytime soon, USA Today founder Allen H. Neuharth told 
an audience at Mercer University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Newspapers have two major advantages: They are cheap and  
portable,'' Neuharth said Thursday at the university's Executive 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet will certainly continue to grow dramatically, but  
it won't replace the written word,'' said Neuharth, retired 
chairman of Gannett Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	His speaking partner was Charles Overby, chairman and chief  
executive officer of the Freedom Forum, a foundation set up in 1991 
under Neuharth's direction to protect freedom of speech. Overby 
foresees a merger of broadcast, print and Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll see a large telephone or cable provider  
purchase a major newspaper chain like Gannett or Knight Ridder 
soon,'' Overby said. ``Then you'll have the delivery system and the 
information source in place. I think you'll have a screen that can 
receive television, Internet, phone and media. I think we'll see 
this in the next 10 to 15 years.''

<HEADLINE> Finance Issues Hold Up Redskins Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Potential buyer Howard Milstein's financing  
issues are holding up the sale of the Washington Redskins, the 
Washington Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's winning bid relies too much borrowed money, the Post  
quoted NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue as saying in a letter to 
former Senator Robert Dole, who complained about the sale's delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue called for the league to investigate whether Milstein  
had put up enough collateral for the deal, according to the letter 
dated March 3 and obtained on Thursday by the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also said the highly successful New York real estate  
developer has been slow to give the league financial paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein declined to comment yesterday.  
</P>
<P>
	His bid to the estate of the late team owner, Jack Kent Cooke,  
was $800 million -- the record offered for a sports franchise in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The league has never had a good chance to review Milstein's  
ability to pay that price, despite his earlier try for a new NFL 
team in Cleveland, Tagliabue wrote.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Buys Out Legion Field Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama will pay the city of Birmingham  
more than $1 million to move three home games from Legion Field to 
Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa over the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Bob Bockrath said the home games with Auburn  
and Tennessee between 1999 and 2001 would be moved to the campus. 
The university will pay $350,000 for each game moved and guarantee 
playing four additional games at Legion Field beyond the current 
contract, which extends through the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This represents a significant event in Alabama football  
history,'' Bockrath said Friday. ``Although both Tennessee and 
Auburn have played football games in Tuscaloosa in the past, only 
Tennessee has played a game in what is now Bryant-Denny Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bockrath said the agreement with Birmingham Mayor Richard  
Arrington ensures that all future Southeastern Conference games 
will be played at Bryant-Denny. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee will play in Tuscaloosa on Oct. 23 next season, Auburn  
on Nov. 18, 2000 and Tennessee on Oct. 20, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Legion Field will host one Alabama non-conference  
football game in 2002, 2003, 2005 and either 2007 or 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	The original contract with Legion Field was set to conclude  
following the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The university completed a $35 million expansion of Bryant-Denny  
last year, adding about 13,000 seats and 81 skyboxes. The expansion 
boosted the stadium capacity to 83,817 seats, including a 
10,000-seat upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Arrington) understands our needs and desires to have as  
many games as possible in our newly renovated stadium,'' Bockrath 
said. ``At the same time, he was very protective of Birmingham's 
interest in keeping Alabama football a visible part of that city's 
landscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The switch also means Alabama will be able to host recruits on  
campus for its biggest games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be a tremendous help for our football recruiting  
efforts,'' said Tide coach Mike DuBose, who has often called the 
Legion Field games a detriment to recruiting. ``Our stadium is a 
great selling point in recruiting and the more we can showcase that 
facility, the better it is for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee first played in Tuscaloosa in 1913, again in 1928 and  
finally in 1930. Auburn visited Tuscaloosa in 1895 and 1901, but 
only the 1930 Tennessee team played in what is now Bryant-Denny 
Stadium. The other games were played on the Quad and at Denny 
Field. The George Hutchenson Denny Stadium was dedicated on Sept. 
28, 1929 and had a capacity of 12,000.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wishes Lewinsky 'Good Life' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he hopes Monica  
Lewinsky ``will be permitted to go on with her life'' and that 
everyone hurt by the scandal of his relationship with her ``will 
get the help they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't wish anyone ill who was caught up in this, and she  
paid quite a high price for a long time,'' he said. ``And I feel 
badly for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, this was a pretty tough thing for everybody  
involved,'' Clinton added. ``And I wish you well. I hope it works 
out all right for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked about Ms. Lewinsky at a news conference with  
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, two days after her ABC 
interview and the day after her book was published. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he had not watched the TV program. Asked for  
``any thoughts that might bring closure to this,'' he responded: 
</P>
<P>
	``What I hope is that she will be permitted to go on with her  
life, and I hope it'll be a good life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton went on: ``I hope that the efforts that I have made and  
that I continue to make every day at home and at work will bear 
fruit. And I hope that all the people who have been hurt by this, 
including totally innocent people who have massive legal bills, 
will get the help they need. And I'm determined to do what I can to 
help them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is that the American people are virtually  
screaming at us to get on with ... their business,'' he said. ``And 
I'm going to do my best to do that as well as I possibly can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first interview with Lewinsky aired Wednesday night to more  
than 70 million viewers. Her book, ``Monica's Story,'' went on sale 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the session with D'Alema focused on the acquittal of the  
Marine pilot whose plane severed a gondola cable in Italy last 
year, plunging 20 people to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are horrified and heartbroken by what happened and we will  
do our best to make sure something like that doesn't happen 
again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both leaders noted there was further judicial action pending and  
they gauged their comments so as to not influence it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that at the end of the process it is made clear who  
was responsible for this accident and that these people are 
punished for it,'' D'Alema said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the news conference:  
</P>
<P>
	--The two leaders called for a peace settlement in the Serbian  
province of Kosovo, and Clinton said NATO has not backed away from 
a threat of air strikes against Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton said a resolution was still possible for the escalating  
trade tiff with Europe over banana tariffs, but that the United 
States has waited long enough for its European allies to comply 
with the World Trade Organization's ruling on the issue. ``We can 
still fix this and it can be avoided,'' he said. ``But it's been 
going on 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton said that plans to research a missile defense system  
did not breach the ABM treaty, and he pledged that his 
administration wouldn't go against the strictures of the pact 
without first reaching agreement with Russia. ``I personally have 
told the Russians over and over again, I have no intention of 
abrogating the ABM treaty,'' he said. ``Anything we do, we will do 
together.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Puts Pressure on Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As much as the Internet has done to promote the  
growth of mutual fund investing, it also threatens to lure 
investors away from funds with some potent new competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The first wave of this challenge is visible now with the rapid  
rise of electronic trading services operating on the World Wide 
Web, which allow investors to buy and sell individual stocks more 
easily and cheaply than ever before. And that could be just the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	One writer at a New York research organization recently raised  
the intriguing suggestion that businesses on the Web could make 
available all the services and benefits now provided by funds at 
lower cost and without some of the tax headaches that often arise 
for fund investors. 
</P>
<P>
	This could get interesting. For the last 10 or 20 years, the  
funds, with the appealing combination of diversification, 
convenience and professional management they offer, haven't faced 
much competition from any other type of financial services firm. 
</P>
<P>
	E-trading has attracted a great deal of attention in recent  
months. More broadly, in a stock market climate favoring only a few 
dozen blue chips and high-technology companies, the idea of 
investing directly in individual stocks appears to be enjoying a 
new vogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could individual stocks be luring money away from mutual  
funds? While it's too early to call this a trend, fund flows 
haven't been as strong as they should be so far in 1999,'' analyst 
Henry McVey at Wall Street's Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
observed in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marginal investors appear to have decided not to plow their  
discretionary dollars into retail mutual funds; rather, they seem 
to be buying individual securities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As financial advisers have been quick to point out, buying  
stocks directly can pose problems for most individual investors. 
For one thing, if you give up the diversification that comes with a 
mutual-fund portfolio, you may expose yourself to dramatically 
increased risk without improving your potential rewards very much. 
</P>
<P>
	If you venture onto the Web to trade stocks frequently, rather  
than buying and holding for the long term, you are abandoning a 
fairly simple mission for a much more complicated and difficult 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	As electronic investing services continue to evolve, however,  
couldn't they start offering instant diversified portfolios to 
individual investors? ``Mutual funds deserve to be the next big 
casualty of the Web,'' argues Peter Huber, a lawyer at the 
Manhattan Institute, writing in the Feb. 8 issue of Forbes 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	What funds provide, Huber says, is knowledge of what's going on  
in the markets, plus the ability to acquire and hold a diversified 
portfolio of stocks without great inconvenience or prohibitive 
expense. Now, he says, the Web is reducing their edge by making 
information more accessible to everybody and reducing the costs of 
direct investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Huber declares, ``the major deterrent for most investors (of  
direct investing) is simply the hassle and worry ... which the Web 
will soon eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The newsletter crowd and the smart funds will go online,  
selling pure information. They will channel suggested portfolio 
profiles directly to individual investors, by way of Intuit (for 
example), which will drop it straight into Quicken on your PC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before we get too carried away, there are some reasons to doubt  
that all the fund industry's managers will be replaced by robots in 
the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, many, if not most, individual investors seem to  
like to know that a human being is in charge of their money, 
bearing the moral and legal duties of a fiduciary. If nothing else, 
this setup ensures that there will be someone to blame besides 
yourself if things go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	As McVey puts it, ``We see the mutual fund as a powerful  
product, particularly in the retirement market ... Moreover, recent 
market volatility may drive investors back to mutual funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the prospect of new competition is welcome news  
for fund investors. After all, you need competition to compel 
businesses in any industry to keep working to provide the best 
possible product at the lowest possible cost. From the consumer's 
point of view, the more competition the better.

<HEADLINE> Globe Making Progress on Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While no country will be spared computer  
failures because of the Year 2000 computer bug, most industrialized 
nations are making progress on fixing it, administration officials 
told a Senate panel Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But developing nations lag further behind, with their efforts in  
many cases hampered by scarce resources and little time left to 
make critical repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	And overseas computer failures could cause headaches for the  
United States because of its heavy dependence on some of these 
ill-prepared countries for critical supplies such as oil, 
pharmaceuticals and food, the officials told the Senate Special 
Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be  
Y2K-related failures in every corner of the globe, some of which 
could prove harmful to U.S. interests,'' said Jacquelyn 
Williams-Bridgers, the State Department inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	Since many computers recognize years using two digits, the fear  
is that many will confuse 2000 with 1900, causing widespread 
malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas that could affect U.S. interests include foreign nuclear  
reactors and power grids, military early warning systems, trade, 
worldwide shipping, oil and gas sectors and air transport, said 
Lawrence Gershwin, a CIA officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``No country will be completely immune from failures,'' Gershwin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some European nations are lagging in Y2K work because of the  
attention they paid to converting to a new currency, the euro, on 
Jan. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asia, the economic crisis interfered with repair efforts. But  
after getting a slow start, China is racing toward a March 31 
deadline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the possible fallout areas cited by Gershwin:  
</P>
<P>
	--Foreign strategic missile systems may experience  
computer-related problems. ``We do not see a problem in terms of 
Russian and Chinese missiles automatically being launched or 
nuclear weapons going off,'' he said, but Russians may have trouble 
with the early warning systems used to monitor foreign missile 
launches. The Pentagon has invited Russian officials to monitor 
U.S. missile launch warning data from mid-December to mid-January 
to bolster their confidence that America is not attacking. 
</P>
<P>
	--The vulnerability of Soviet-designed nuclear reactors is  
unknown because records on the equipment used to make them are poor 
or nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Key countries that export oil to the United States -- including  
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico -- are behind on fixing 
their computer systems used in producing, processing and 
transporting the oil. 
</P>
<P>
	--World ports and the shipping industry have done little to  
prepare for Jan. 1, which could affect the flow of oil and other 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams-Bridgers, whose State Department office studied reports  
from 74 countries, said her analysis ``does not lend itself to much 
optimism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Problems remain in many industrialized nations, she said, giving  
as an example a European country that created a Y2K committee last 
summer, but it didn't meet until two months ago. She declined to 
identify any countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Middle Eastern countries are at risk from possible  
disruptions in the oil industry and potential computer problems at 
desalinization plants that could lead to unsafe water and health 
problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing countries are in worse shape, but the relatively low  
level of computerization in their utility, transportation and 
telecommunications areas could reduce the risk of prolonged 
problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Cohen, State Department under secretary for management,  
said the agency is trying to educate all countries about the 
problem. She said the security of Americans living and traveling 
abroad Jan. 1 was its highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, the Senate panel issued a report outlining  
potential problems in health care, energy supply and government 
services unless computer systems are fixed by Dec. 31. It 
emphasized that disruptions in vital services for most Americans 
would be minimal.

<HEADLINE> `Mob Mouthpiece' Enters Mayor Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- For more than three decades, Oscar Goodman has  
been the devil's advocate, representing such mob figures as Meyer 
Lansky, Tony ``The Ant'' Spilotro and Frank ``Lefty'' Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he wants to be mayor of Las Vegas.  
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old Goodman said Friday he will join the crowded  
race to become mayor of America's fastest-growing city. Mayor Jan 
Jones is stepping down after eight years in office. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference in his office near the city's Glitter  
Gulch, Goodman addressed the image issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've represented people as vigorously as I know how,  
protecting their constitutional rights,'' Goodman said, clutching a 
yellowed copy of the Constitution. ``I've represented judges and 
mayors. If anybody has a problem with that, they shouldn't be 
allowed to vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The election is May 4. If a candidate gets more than 50 percent  
of the vote, he wins the race outright. If not, the top two 
vote-getters face off on June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman said he wants his representation of organized crime  
figures to be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I've ever done is to make sure that constitutional  
guarantees have been applied to my clients,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've appeared in courtrooms all over the United States, and on  
the Senate floor, and have lent nothing but dignity to my clients. 
I will bring that same dignity to the city of Las Vegas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Nevada's top political consultants, Billy Vassiliadis,  
said Goodman's candidacy should not be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an interesting guy,'' Vassiliadis told the Las Vegas  
Review-Journal. ``I think he can capture some people's imagination. 
Remember, Jesse `The Body-Mind' Ventura is governor of Minnesota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's client list over the years includes Spilotro, the  
reputed Las Vegas overseer for the Chicago mob who was executed 
with his brother and buried in an Indiana corn field in 1986; 
Rosenthal, a former book operator with alleged mob ties who left 
Las Vegas after his car was bombed; and Mike Tyson, who was 
stripped of his boxing license by the Nevada Athletic Commission 
for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between Spilotro and Rosenthal was chronicled  
in Martin Scorsese's ``Casino,'' which starred Robert De Niro and 
Joe Pesci. Goodman played himself in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman also plays himself in a new documentary, ``Mob Law,'' in  
which he defends his passion for defending the mob. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see me as the devil incarnate,'' he says of the FBI in  
the movie. ``I represent all that is bad. I see them as the 
obstructers, the nefarious group, the princes of darkness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman represented Spilotro in numerous cases, obtaining his  
acquittal on two Chicago murder charges and defending him in a 
federal racketeering trial in Las Vegas that ended in a mistrial. 
In that case, Spilotro was accused of overseeing the activities of 
the Hole in the Wall Gang that ripped off Las Vegas businesses in a 
$1 million crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Spilotro did anything wrong,'' Goodman said later,  
``shame on the prosecutors for not being able to convict him.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Rises; Corn, Soybeans Fall / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures finished higher Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade on talk farmers will plant less of the crop 
this spring than expected, while corn and soybeans retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were pressured from the beginning by a weak close on  
Thursday and continued lower throughout the session on news that 
prices for after Malaysian palm oil, another form of vegetable oil, 
had fallen overnight. That led to speculation demand may not be as 
strong as expected in coming days. Prices also fell back on 
prospects for a bumper South American crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat followed soybeans lower at the open, but then rebounded on  
talk the government was considering putting more land in a 
conservation set-aside program. Market participants also were 
weighing news that Pakistan is now eligible for U.S. Agriculture 
Department export credit guarantees to buy U.S. wheat, as well as 
continued dry weather in northern China growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were dragged lower by the declines in soybeans.  
Corn was also pressured by technical factors after Thursday's rally 
to a new high for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were pressured by increased selling of  
stored crops, as many took advantage of sharp gains made this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery rose 5 1/4 cents to $2.67 3/4 per bushel; May  
corn futures were off 1 cent at $2.16 per bushel; May oats were 
down 3/4 cent to $1.05 1/2 per bushel; May soybeans were off 3 1/2 cents at 
$4.64 1/2 per bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were higher and feeder cattle were mixed on  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs and pork bellies 
were both lower. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle was up .17 cent to 67.77 cents per pound;  
March feeder cattle was up .03 cent to 72.45 cents per pound; April 
lean hogs were off .60 cent at 42.82 cents a pound; March pork 
bellies were down 1.43 cents to 50.07 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> No Deadline Extension for Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball will not give the Montreal Expos an  
extension of the deadline for obtaining stadium financing and 
completing a new ownership group, a baseball official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the official, speaking on the condition he not be  
identified, also said commissioner Bud Selig will not take any 
immediate action after Saturday's deadline passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, according to the official, will wait to see what happens,  
possibly taking several months for baseball to formulate its 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Expos president Claude Brochu said earlier in the day he had  
received ``no formal notice'' that baseball planned to extend the 
deadline, saying he would ``rather wait for an official statement 
from major league baseball before making any comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brochu, who is feuding with team chairman Jacques Menard, is to  
resume control of the team Saturday, the expiration of the 150-day 
period baseball granted the team last Oct. 7 to bring in new 
investors, buy out Brochu and show it has the funds to build a 
downtown ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard, who asked for an extension two weeks ago, said on  
Thursday he expected to be granted more time. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Virginia, Washington and Charlotte, N.C., are possible  
relocation sites should the Expos' current owners decide to sell to 
out-of-town buyers. No move would be possible before the 2000 
season.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After bursting on the scene with a 20-strikeout game and winning  
the NL Rookie of the Year award, Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood 
was rewarded Friday with a $690,000, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is by far the largest for a player with less than one  
year of major league service. Wood, who has 169 days in the major 
leagues and made the minimum $170,000 last year, will not be 
eligible for salary arbitration until after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased,'' Wood said in Mesa, Ariz. ``The best part  
about it is that I don't have to worry about it anymore, not that I 
was worrying about it a lot anyway. I was just pretty much kept up 
to date on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander was 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA and 233  
strikeouts in 1998. In addition to striking out 20 against Houston 
last May, which tied Roger Clemens' record for a nine-inning game, 
he set a major league record with 33 strikeouts in consecutive 
nine-inning games. 
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Baltimore Orioles second baseman  
Delino DeShields found out he won't need surgery to repair a 
fractured bone in his left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields, injured during an intrasquad game Thursday, will wear  
the cast for about seven days before replacing it with a splint, 
but it will be 3-4 weeks before he can begin baseball-related 
activities and another 2-3 weeks before he can return to the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say 3-4 weeks before I can start banging on it, but  
hopefully it will be sooner,'' DeShields said. ``I was looking 
forward to getting off to a good start. But hopefully I won't miss 
too many games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, Florida Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez threw two  
scoreless innings and 29 pitches in an 8-1 win over Tampa Bay at 
Melbourne, Fla., his first outing since surgery to repair a torn 
rotator cuff. The game was his first since the National League 
championship series in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome,'' he said. ``I felt really good. I was able to locate  
my pitches, and it was good to be out there with different uniforms 
facing you. It's a step in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Kissimmee, Fla., Mark Wohlers' first appearance of 1999 was  
much like his outings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves reliever faced eight batters in the third  
inning of a 7-4 loss to Houston, allowing four earned runs, three 
hits and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
	He fanned his first batter, Ken Caminiti, on a changeup and  
ended the inning by striking out Carl Everett with a low fastball. 
Craig Biggio and Ricky Gutierrez hit two-run singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results weren't there, but I'm not going to worry about  
the results,'' Wohlers said. ``I think how I felt on the mound, the 
way I handled myself, and the pitches that I made, I feel good 
about. Obviously giving up four runs is kind of frustrating, but in 
the same token it's been a long time since I walked off the mound 
after finishing an inning. It's been quite some time since I've 
done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games: 	
</P>
<P>
                       *Dodgers 5, Cardinals 4 	
</P>
<P>
	At Vero Beach, Fla., while Davey Johnson won his debut as the  
Los Angeles manager, fans were disappointed Mark McGwire stayed 
behind in Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers opened their 52nd -- and possibly last -- exhibition  
season at Dodgertown with Johnson's favorite offensive weapon, a 
three-run homer, this one by Paul LoDuca. Rupert Murdoch's Fox 
Group is considering moving the team's spring site to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed McGwire didn't at least make an  
appearance for the fans,'' said long-time Cardinals backer Charles 
Swisher, 72, who came from Pennsylvania to see the game. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Blue Jays 8, Yankees 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., Hideki Irabu has a shaky spring debut for New  
York. While he allowed just two hits in three shutout innings, he 
struggled with his control, throwing just 26 of 48 pitches for 
strikes and falling behind 10 of 12 batters. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Royals 9, Indians (ss) 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Winter Haven, Fla., Cleveland's new infield combination of  
Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar executed its first double play. 
Jermaine Dye doubled and homered for Kansas City.

<P>
                      *Phillies 7, Indians (ss) 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Clearwater, Fla., rookie Marlon Anderson had three hits and  
two of stolen bases. Bobby Abreu added two doubles and drove in 
three runs.

                         *Twins 6, Reds (ss) 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, Fla., Terry Steinbach hit his first  
exhibition-season homer in two years. a two-run shot. Eddie 
Williams, a non-roster invitee trying to make the seventh major 
league team of his 17-year career, also hit a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Reds (ss) 5, Rangers 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Sarasota, Fla, Mark Lewis singled home the winning run with  
the bases loaded in the 10th. Lewis also had an RBI single during a 
three-run fourth as the Reds overcame a 4-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Tigers 8, Pirates 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Bradenton, Fla., Karim Garcia hit a go-ahead homer in the  
eighth inning and Ben Candelaria also homered. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Brewers (ss) 3, Giants 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Phoenix, Jim Abbott flied out to center in his first plate  
appearance of the spring. Abbott, who was born without a right 
hand, had played exclusively in the American League before this 
year. He has never batted during a regular-season game in the 
majors and had been 1-for-13 in spring training since 1993. He 
allowed two hits and walked one before reaching his pitch limit in 
the top of the third inning.

<P>
                       *Athletics 17, Angels 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tempe, Ariz., Mo Vaughn went 2-for-3 with a run scored and  
two RBIs in his spring debut for Anaheim. After Vaughn's two-run 
single in the second inning put Anaheim up 4-1, Angels 
knuckleballer Steve Sparks was unable to hold the lead. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Mariners 8, Cubs 2    	
</P>
<P>

	At Peoria, Ariz., Gary Matthews Jr. hit a two-run homer,  
connecting off Reggie Harris in the eighth to tie the score at 3. 
Mark Parent hit a bases-loaded single over a drawn-in outfield 
against Brian Passini in the 11th to win it.

<HEADLINE> Lott Gives Take on Disaster Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott accused  
President Clinton Friday of seeking to raid Social Security funds 
to ship disaster aid to Central Americans recovering from Hurricane 
Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation by Lott, R-Miss., was based on Clinton's plan to  
use federal surpluses to pay for the bulk of a $1.9 billion 
emergency measure approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
All of this year's projected $111 billion budget surplus comes from 
Social Security, which is building up reserves to handle the 
retirements of baby boomers beginning in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's attack underlined how Republicans are eager to cast  
themselves as protectors of Social Security, and Clinton as out to 
jeopardize it. The questions of what to do with federal budget 
surpluses and how to protect the massive pension program for the 
elderly and disabled has become this year's biggest budget dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support the people of Central America, many of whose homes  
and livelihoods have been ravaged by natural disasters,'' said Lott 
in a written statement. ``I will, however, oppose sending Social 
Security money overseas in the form of foreign aid. I will oppose 
any effort to steal the Social Security funds that rightly belong 
to our senior citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Lott's comment, White House spokesman Barry Toiv  
referred to comments made earlier in the day by Clinton economic 
adviser Gene Sperling. Sperling had noted that under budget law, 
federal surpluses can be used to pay for any item that both 
Congress and the president designate an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Central American emergency is about as classic and  
undisputed an emergency as there is,'' Sperling told reporters. He 
added, ``This is clearly an emergency, and it should be the type of 
thing that we can come together for in a bipartisan way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About half the spending bill is intended to help Honduras,  
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica rebuild from the October 
hurricane, which killed more than 9,000 people, left more than 3 
million homeless and destroyed more than $8.5 billion worth of 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee-approved measure would not use the surplus to pay  
for the aid. Instead, the committee would trim money for food 
stamps and welfare that it says would not be used, and would cut 
other domestic programs. The White House opposes the proposed 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee plans to vote on a similar  
measure next week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes To Italians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Italy in an uproar over the acquittal of  
a Marine pilot, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema stood next to 
President Clinton and demanded justice Friday for the cable car 
accident that killed 20 people. Clinton expressed profound regret 
and declared, ``The United States is not trying to duck its 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Italian leader met a day after a military jury  
in North Carolina delivered a not-guilty verdict for the pilot of 
the Marine jet that sliced through a ski gondola cable in an 
Italian alpine valley and sent its passengers plunging to their 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling outraged Italians and immediately became topic No. 1  
at the president's meeting with D'Alema, which had been scheduled 
for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders posed stiffly for photographers in the Oval  
Office. There was no handshake, as there often is for the cameras. 
Later, Clinton and D'Alema leaders held a joint news conference and 
spoke solemnly about the gondola tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema said he and the Italian people were ``personally  
shocked'' by the verdict and said it was ``neither normal nor 
acceptable'' for the jet to roar through a valley at 300 feet or so 
above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for  
what happened is found guilty and punished,'' the prime minister 
said. ``With so many casualties, with so many deaths, you can 
hardly ever say you are satisfied. It is a word I cannot use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was confident that the responsible person would be  
punished ``through a fair trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not asking for a scapegoat,'' the prime minister said.  
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema expressed appreciation for Clinton's remorse and said  
the president had shown ``great human sincerity ... with no 
arrogance, with no sense of detachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are profoundly regretful and apologetic,'' Clinton said. He  
said it was important to ``do what is appropriate by the families'' 
in terms of legal claims and settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he wanted to assure the victims' families and  
the people of Italy that ``the United States is not trying to duck 
its responsibility and that we are heartbroken and horrified by 
what happened. And we're going to do our best to make sure that 
nothing like that ever happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he could not speak to the verdict itself  
because the pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby, still faces an 
obstruction of justice charge even though he was acquitted of 
involuntary homicide and manslaughter. His navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, also faces charges. Clinton said he did not want his 
remarks to have any impact on those cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The squadron commander was relieved of command, and the  
squadron's director of safety standardization received a reprimand 
letter that effectively ends his military career. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the most important thing now is that the United States  
must clearly and unambiguously shoulder the responsibility for what 
happened,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the U.S. and Italian defense chiefs would  
review operational and safety measures to assess their adequacy and 
determine whether additional measures should be adopted. The United 
States, in the wake of the accident, already has taken steps to 
improve safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States provided a ``modest'' cash settlement to the  
victims' relatives after the accident to help them deal with 
immediate expenses, Clinton said. The families now can file claims, 
and the United States will pay the lion's share of any settlements, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, ``I don't know that my words could ever ease  
the pain of someone who lost a child or a parent or a sibling or a 
spouse in that terrible accident.''

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After bursting on the scene with a 20-strikeout game and winning  
the NL Rookie of the Year award, Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood 
was rewarded Friday with a $690,000, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is by far the largest for a player with less than one  
year of major league service. Wood, who has 169 days in the major 
leagues and made the minimum $170,000 last year, will not be 
eligible for salary arbitration until after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased,'' Wood said in Mesa, Ariz. ``The best part  
about it is that I don't have to worry about it anymore, not that I 
was worrying about it a lot anyway. I was just pretty much kept up 
to date on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander was 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA and 233  
strikeouts in 1998. In addition to striking out 20 against Houston 
last May, which tied Roger Clemens' record for a nine-inning game, 
he set a major league record with 33 strikeouts in consecutive 
nine-inning games. 
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Baltimore Orioles second baseman  
Delino DeShields found out he won't need surgery to repair a 
fractured bone in his left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	DeShields, injured during an intrasquad game Thursday, will wear  
the cast for about seven days before replacing it with a splint, 
but it will be 3-4 weeks before he can begin baseball-related 
activities and another 2-3 weeks before he can return to the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say 3-4 weeks before I can start banging on it, but  
hopefully it will be sooner,'' DeShields said. ``I was looking 
forward to getting off to a good start. But hopefully I won't miss 
too many games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, Florida Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez threw two  
scoreless innings and 29 pitches in an 8-1 win over Tampa Bay at 
Melbourne, Fla., his first outing since surgery to repair a torn 
rotator cuff. The game was his first since the National League 
championship series in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome,'' he said. ``I felt really good. I was able to locate  
my pitches, and it was good to be out there with different uniforms 
facing you. It's a step in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Kissimmee, Fla., Mark Wohlers' first appearance of 1999 was  
much like his outings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves reliever faced eight batters in the third  
inning of a 7-4 loss to Houston, allowing four earned runs, three 
hits and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
	He fanned his first batter, Ken Caminiti, on a changeup and  
ended the inning by striking out Carl Everett with a low fastball. 
Craig Biggio and Ricky Gutierrez hit two-run singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results weren't there, but I'm not going to worry about  
the results,'' Wohlers said. ``I think how I felt on the mound, the 
way I handled myself, and the pitches that I made, I feel good 
about. Obviously giving up four runs is kind of frustrating, but in 
the same token it's been a long time since I walked off the mound 
after finishing an inning. It's been quite some time since I've 
done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games: 	
</P>
<P>
                       *Dodgers 5, Cardinals 4 	
</P>
<P>
	At Vero Beach, Fla., while Davey Johnson won his debut as the  
Los Angeles manager, fans were disappointed Mark McGwire stayed 
behind in Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers opened their 52nd -- and possibly last -- exhibition  
season at Dodgertown with Johnson's favorite offensive weapon, a 
three-run homer, this one by Paul LoDuca. Rupert Murdoch's Fox 
Group is considering moving the team's spring site to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed McGwire didn't at least make an  
appearance for the fans,'' said long-time Cardinals backer Charles 
Swisher, 72, who came from Pennsylvania to see the game. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Blue Jays 8, Yankees 6    	
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., Hideki Irabu has a shaky spring debut for New  
York. While he allowed just two hits in three shutout innings, he 
struggled with his control, throwing just 26 of 48 pitches for 
strikes and falling behind 10 of 12 batters. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Royals 9, Indians (ss) 3

two of stolen bases. Bobby Abreu added two doubles and drove in 
three runs.

                         *Twins 6, Reds (ss) 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, Fla., Terry Steinbach hit his first  
exhibition-season homer in two years. a two-run shot. Eddie 
Williams, a non-roster invitee trying to make the seventh major 
league team of his 17-year career, also hit a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Reds (ss) 5, Rangers 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Sarasota, Fla, Mark Lewis singled home the winning run with  
the bases loaded in the 10th. Lewis also had an RBI single during a 
three-run fourth as the Reds overcame a 4-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Tigers 8, Pirates 6    	
</P>

<P>
                       *Brewers (ss) 3, Giants 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Phoenix, Jim Abbott flied out to center in his first plate  
appearance of the spring. Abbott, who was born without a right 
hand, had played exclusively in the American League before this 
year. He has never batted during a regular-season game in the 
majors and had been 1-for-13 in spring training since 1993. He 
allowed two hits and walked one before reaching his pitch limit in 
the top of the third inning.

	At Tempe, Ariz., Mo Vaughn went 2-for-3 with a run scored and  
two RBIs in his spring debut for Anaheim. After Vaughn's two-run 
single in the second inning put Anaheim up 4-1, Angels 
knuckleballer Steve Sparks was unable to hold the lead.

<P>
                         *Mariners 8, Cubs 2

Mark Parent hit a bases-loaded single over a drawn-in outfield 
against Brian Passini in the 11th to win it.

<HEADLINE> Royal Philips Sues VLSI Over Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Dutch consumer electronics giant Royal  
Philips Electronics NV filed a lawsuit Friday against VLSI 
Technology Inc. to block the struggling chipmaker from using a 
poison pill defense against Philips' $777 million hostile tender 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips claims VLSI is hindering shareholders from taking  
advantage of the $17-a-share offer by delaying a decision on 
whether or not to support the bid and rescind the pill, according 
to papers filed in Delaware Chancery Court. 
</P>
<P>
	A poison pill makes a hostile prohibitively expensive, usually  
by doubling the number of shares the bidder must buy. 
</P>
<P>
	If VLSI's pill, adopted in 1989, is allowed to stand, it will be  
triggered as soon as Philips acquires 20 percent or more of VLSI's 
common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also seeks to invalidate a ``dead hand'' provision  
that for a limited period of time would prevent a newly-elected 
board from removing the pill if it is triggered by the board it 
replaces. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 26, Philips made its $17 per share cash offer to VLSI, a  
58 percent premium over the previous day's closing stock price, and 
requested a response by March 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers said that ``although (the VLSI board) has an `open  
mind' toward the initial offer, it would not consider it until a 
special board meeting 20 days later on March 23.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to VLSI on Thursday, Philips requested the pill be  
removed, saying time is of the essence because the business 
combination is a ``compelling, strategic and operational 
opportunity'' for both companies, court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips has asked the court to declare that its offer qualifies  
as one for which the pill can be blocked and to compel VLSI's 
directors to do so and further to declare the dead hand provision 
invalid, should Philips move to replace VLSI's board. 
</P>
<P>
	VLSI, based in San Jose, Calif., makes and markets  
semiconductors for wireless communications, networking, digital 
entertainment and advanced computer markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of VLSI, based in San Jose, Calif., fell 12 1/2 cents, to  
$18.18 3/4, in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Before 
Philips' bid was disclosed Feb. 26, VLSI's shares were trading at 
$10.75.

	Dow Jumps 200 Points  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average surged into  
record territory today after a tame inflation report eased concerns 
that the Federal Reserve may soon raise interest rates. Just after 
3 p.m. EST, the Dow was up 216.24 at 9,683.64, adding to 
yesterday's 191-point gain. Of the 30 Dow components, all but 
Philip Morris rose today. The blue-chip index is now trading above 
its record close of 9,643.32 and previous intraday high of 
9,647.97, which both took place on Jan. 8. Other stock indexes also 
rose today. The Nasdaq composite index was up 24.99 at 2,317.88.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks are leading today's gains. IBM  
rose 5 13/16 to 176 13/16 and General Motors gained 3 1/16 at 88 
13/16. Financial stocks also rose, as the potential for an 
interest-rate hike diminished. Chase rose 2 5/16 at 85 11/16 and 
Citigroup was up 1 3/8 at 61 11/16. While technology stocks were 
mostly higher today, they failed to keep pace with the gains in 
other sectors. Technology stocks have been battered in recent weeks 
amid concerns over profits and slowing personal-computer sales.

	Jobless Rate Edges Up to 4.4 Pct.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unemployment rate edged up slightly from  
4.3 percent to 4.4 percent in February as the nation's 
manufacturers continued to be battered by the global economic 
crisis. Manufacturing employment fell by 50,000 last month, the

citizens worried about privacy, sent a message today to the 
government to withdraw proposed anti-money laundering rules that 
would track bank customers' habits. By an 88-0 vote, the Senate 
expressed support for a measure directing bank regulators to 
withdraw the proposed rules, called ``Know Your Customer'' 
regulations. The senators didn't vote on actual adoption of the 
measure, sponsored by Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Wayne Allard, 
R-Colo., so it lacks the force of law.

	Little Air Jordan Sneakers Recalled

<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike and the federal government today  
announced the recall of 110,000 pairs of the Little Air Jordan XIV 
sneakers for young children because of high levels of lead in the 
red paint trim. Nike said it has received one consumer complaint 
about the shoes and possible ingestion of a paint chip. The shoe, 
sold in sizes 2C though 10C, has been on the market since January. 
It comes in white with red painted trim and the word ``JORDAN'' on 
the outside tongue. The model number is 132549 102. Nike 
spokeswoman Vizhier Mooney said the paint supplier to the factory 
that made the shoes did not adhere to the company's policy on 
banned substances, which includes lead. She said the company has 
severed its ties to the supplier.

deal at a brief hearing today. Now the Legislature has to decide 
what to do with the money designed to help reimburse the state for

the confusion surrounds government efforts to reverse a recent rise

<HEADLINE> Viagra Does Not Offer Women Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The first preliminary study on the effects of  
Viagra on women with sexual dysfunction found the male impotence 
drug provided little, if any, relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 33 postmenopausal women was published in the March  
issue of the medical journal Urology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that there was no significant change either in  
intercourse satisfaction or in the degree of sexual desire after 
the patients had taken Viagra for 12 weeks,'' said Steven A. 
Kaplan, administrator of the Department of Urology and director of 
neurology at the Columbia Presbyterian Center at New York 
Presbyterian Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplan, who led the research team, acknowledged Friday that the  
study is not comprehensive because of the small number of women 
evaluated and a relatively short follow-up survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Viagra's introduction in April 1998, more than 6 million  
prescriptions of the anti-impotence pill have been have written, 
almost all to men. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the drug, is studying Viagra's  
effect on women. The study is to be released later this year, said 
Pfizer spokeswoman Mariann Caprino. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't comment on the Columbia Presbyterian Center study  
because we haven't analyzed it yet, but women's sexual health is a 
rapidly evolving field and any data is certainly helpful,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the study had complained of sexual dysfunction,  
ranging from decreased arousal to inability to achieve orgasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Each was in a monogamous relationship for at least 6 months and  
took Viagra an average of three times each week during the 12-week 
study. Three of the 33 women dropped out after reporting discomfort 
and hypersensitivity. Other side effects included minor dizziness 
and headaches.

<HEADLINE> La Nina Brings Weather of Extremes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It's been so mild and dry this winter that  
Coloradans have been trading parkas for T-shirts, and cactuses in 
Arizona likely won't bloom. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks in Seattle, meantime, suffered 90 days of rain in the four  
months leading up to March -- a record for soggy gloom in a region 
usually boastful about its wet climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Blame La Nina, a phenomenon that has delivered a feast-or-famine  
winter to the West, dousing the Northwest with record rains while 
keeping the Southwest mostly dry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that these types of patterns that we have seen will  
continue,'' said Marty Hoerling, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration meteorologist. ``If you will, the rich will get 
richer and the poor will get poorer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is the lesser known sibling of El Nino, which warmed the  
waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean and disrupted weather around 
the world for about a year until easing last May. 
</P>
<P>
	The current La Nina shows the opposite pattern, with sharply  
cooler ocean temperatures fostering the unusual weather. 
</P>
<P>
	And it has been unusual.  
</P>
<P>
	Mount Baker in Washington state has about 70 feet -- that's 70  
FEET -- of snow, while more than 5 feet of rain has hit parts of the 
Olympic Peninsula since Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But down in the Southwest, firefighters already fear that  
parched forests are a spark away from wildfire. Although the 
potential for summer blazes depends on spring rains, the risk of 
fire already is high in Arizona and New Mexico forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be looking at getting a lot of firefighters on  
early,'' said Dougger Hughes of Arizona's Prescott National Forest. 
``We could get a lot of rain in March and April, but from what the 
weather service is telling us, it looks like it's going to be a 
pretty dry year for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Storms have left the snowpack close to normal to above normal in  
Alaska and the mountains of Colorado, Wyoming, Nevada and Montana. 
But the lack of precipitation has dried out vegetation at lower 
elevations. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is more urgent in the far Southwest. Residents of  
Tucson, Ariz., already are being asked to conserve water to avoid 
summer restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need about 3 or 4 feet of snow to get our snowpack up to  
normal,'' said Dan Murray of the U.S. Natural Resources 
Conservation Service. ``That's going to be a stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregonians and their waterlogged friends to the north would  
gladly swap some of their snow and rain for a few minutes of 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	The gray canopy overhead has led to a gray disposition down  
below. Many people are just plain grumpy, and using a high voltage 
lamp to combat sun deprivation doesn't cut it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so depressing,'' said Clarice Jackson, a Portland  
shopper who longingly eyed a pair of opened-toe sandals that 
wouldn't last three seconds on the streets. ``I just want to see 
the sun.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets with Italy's D'Alema </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sought to smooth over  
relations with Italy today after shock and outrage over the 
acquittal of a U.S. Marine pilot in the cable car accident that 
killed 20 skiers in Italy a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton met in the Oval Office with Italian Prime Minister  
Massimo D'Alema a day after the verdict. The two leaders posed 
stiffly for photographers and did not comment. The meeting had been 
set up long ago, and it was mere coincidence that it came on the 
heels of the acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it is a testament to the strength of our  
relationship that we've been able to work through these very 
difficult and tragic circumstances in an open and honest and 
straightforward way,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly understand their strong feelings,'' Lockhart  
said. But he said he was limited in commenting further because of 
issues still to be litigated. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema said Thursday he was ``really baffled'' that a military  
jury in Camp Lejeune, N.C., cleared Capt. Richard Ashby of 20 
involuntary manslaughter charges in the accident on Feb. 3, 1998. 
D'Alema also said the situation had strained U.S. relations with 
Italy, a NATO ally. 
</P>
<P>
	During a training flight in the Italian Alps, Ashby flew into  
two cables holding up a gondola packed with tourists who were 
preparing to ski. Eight Germans, five Belgians, one Austrian, one 
Dutch person, two Poles and three Italians perished, touching off a 
wave of criticism that the Marine crew was speeding and showing off 
in complete disregard for the civilians around them. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that kind of a massacre, with so many casualties, I think  
it is a duty to ensure ... that justice is done, and that is what 
we are asking for,'' D'Alema said. ``Certainly this is not an 
Italian problem, nor does it concern Italy and U.S. relations 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton declared, ``My regret is profound,'' as he discussed the  
incident last May in a meeting with D'Alema's predecessor, Romano 
Prodi. Clinton promised the United States would ``behave in a 
completely honorable way'' in responding to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that the subject comes up again, he will again  
repeat that,'' Lockhart said Thursday. ``It is a testament to the 
strength of our relations, of U.S.-Italian relations, that this 
hasn't soured the relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the tragedy last year, Defense Secretary William  
Cohen authorized a discretionary payment of $5,000 to each victim's 
family to cover immediate transportation and burial expenses, and 
the U.S. government has reimbursed Italy for the $60,000 it paid to 
the survivors of each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 20 victims' estates have filed wrongful death claims  
with the Italian ministry of defense, ranging from $812,000 to $5.4 
million, and all 20 families have hired attorneys, with intentions 
of filing claims to be processed by the Italian government. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said Thursday the United States will  
continue to work closely with Italian officials to ensure the 
claims are handled expeditiously.

<HEADLINE> Garth's Day at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Here's how it went for Garth Brooks on  
Friday at spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks played left field in the Padres' ``B''  
game, an 8-2 loss to the Anaheim Angels. He went 0-for-3, with a 
pair of groundouts to second base and a fly ball that was just shy 
of the warning track in center field. He's now 0-for-8 in two 
intrasquad games, one ``A'' game and one ``B'' game. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* Brooks filmed a spot for Joe Garagiola's anti-spit  
tobacco campaign. Garagiola said Brooks has credibility because he 
has friends in music, baseball and down on the farm, not to mention 
the ones he sings about in low places. ``He gave me chills with the 
last one,'' Garagiola said after one of the takes. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``Hey, everybody, I'm Garth Brooks. If somebody  
tells you dipping or chewing tobacco is not harmful or possibly 
fatal, they ain't telling you the truth.'' -- one of the lines 
Brooks recited for Garagiola's public-service announcement.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Edges Up to 4.4 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.4  
percent in February as the nation's manufacturers continued to be 
battered by the global economic crisis. But Wall Street took heart 
from strong hiring gains elsewhere, sending stocks into record 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said that even with the slight 0.1  
percentage point uptick in the jobless rate, the number of payroll 
jobs rose by 275,000, better than expected, led by hiring at 
construction sites and retail establishments. 
</P>
<P>
	At midmorning the Dow Jones industrial average was up more than  
200 points at 9,679.57. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very good report. We had a lot of new jobs created  
but average hourly earnings were only up a modest amount,'' said 
Cynthia Latta, economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-sensitive bond market posted strong gains with  
investors focusing on the department's report that average hourly 
earnings compared to a year ago were up just 3.6 percent, 
indicating wage pressures are remaining contained despite tight 
labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing employment fell by 50,000 last month, the biggest  
setback since last November, with layoffs especially high at 
apparel and aircraft factories. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overall job increase of 275,000 was the best since  
December, surpassing a 217,000 gain in January. Mild winter weather 
helped boost employment in construction and workers in retail sales 
jumped by the largest amount in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the slight rise in unemployment from January's 4.3  
percent, the nation's job picture remained exceptionally bright. 
Unemployment has been at or below 4.5 percent since last April, a 
sustained low level not seen since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Most forecasters had been expecting unemployment to edge up  
slightly this year as the sizzling U.S. economy slows to a more 
moderate growth rate, reflecting a rising trade deficit that has 
hit manufacturing and farming especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far, that slowdown has yet to appear. Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan pointedly warned last week that if economy 
doesn't slow on its own accord, the Fed may be forced to start 
raising interest rates to engineer a slowdown that would keep tight 
labor markets from increasing inflationary pressures through higher 
wage demands. 
</P>
<P>
	For February, average hourly earnings were up just 1 cent to  
$13.04, representing an increase of 3.6 percent over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The big loss of 50,000 jobs in manufacturing meant that since  
last March, factory jobs have declined by 337,000 as various 
industries have been forced to cut back production to compenstate 
for a big loss in overseas markets and an increase in imports 
flooding into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest job cutbacks in February were in apparel  
manufacturing, which lost 15,000 jobs, more than twice the monthly 
job loss of the past year. The manufacturing industry has lost 
nearly one-third of its workforce, a total of 306,000 jobs, since 
its last peak in November 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Aircraft manufacturing employment fell by 6,000 last month while  
job loss in industrial machinery was down 7,000 and electrical 
equipmemt makers shed 2,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Offseting this weakness, employment in service industries was up  
263,000 last month led by a gain of 123,000 jobs in retail trade, 
the biggest one-month jump in this industry since February 1988. 
Department stores, restaurants and furniture stores all posted big 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Employment in construction was up 72,000 in February, reflecting  
in large part mild weather across much of the country.

<HEADLINE> Kjus Clinches Downhill World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KVITFJELL, Norway (AP) -- Kjetil Aamodt of Norway appeared to  
close in on the men's overall World Cup title today when he 
finished third in a downhill while one of his chief rivals, Hermann 
Maier of Austria, finished 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasse Kjus, another Norwegian, clinched the men's downill title  
for the season with a fourth-place finish, and he moved past Maier 
into second place in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Andreas Schifferer won the race in 1:46.36, one tenth  
of a second ahead of teammate Stephan Eberharter and 0.32 ahead of 
Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier left the stadium without saying a word.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had better skis than Maier, and he didn't ski very well  
either. If you don't have good skis, you've got no chance,'' Aamodt 
said. The Norwegian said there was a good chance that Maier and 
Kjus could catch him in the downhill and Super-G on Saturday and 
Sunday at Kvitfjell. 
</P>
<P>
	With his fourth place finish, Kjus assured himself the downhill  
World Cup with 580 points, 201 points ahead of Austrian Werner 
Franz who finished ninth in 1:47.42 with two downhill competitions 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Aamodt increased his overall lead and has 1,190 points,  
61 points ahead of Kjus.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Futures Rise Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose sharply Friday on the Board of Trade of the  
City of New York, posting their biggest gain in two months amid 
heavy buying. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cotton futures rose sharply as crops worldwide  
appeared to be threatened for a second consecutive year. Wheat 
futures also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures jumped as roasters took advantage of prices at  
their lowest in months to replenish their inventories. Futures 
prices have been in the doldrums as the peak consumption period 
winds down and as Central American gourmet-style arabica beans and 
lesser-quality beans from a bumper Brazilian crop reach U.S. 
shores. That had led roasters to sit on the sidelines as they 
waited for prices to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures also were boosted by technical buying that came  
after market participants largely shrugged off a study a day 
earlier that suggested coffee drinkers are more likely to be 
stressed and suffer heart disease than nondrinkers. The report 
could cause heavy drinkers to curb consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	Arabica coffee for May delivery rose 3.60 cents to $1.07 a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures advanced on the New York Board of Trade as  
drought forced farmers to put early fieldwork on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The soil in parts of Texas and the Southeast was too dry to  
allow fieldwork to procedure at a normal pace, and crops that 
already were in the ground were being stressed by the heat, 
agronomists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton futures also were supported Friday amid concern heavy  
rains in Australia's major growing regions has washed out much of 
that crop, which was set for harvesting in April. The moisture 
could cause severe damage to the mature crops or could lower the 
quality below standards needed for mills. 
</P>
<P>
	Under normal circumstances, cotton futures should be sharply  
higher this marketing year, after farmers harvested the smallest 
crop in nearly a decade and poor weather devastated competing crops 
around the globe. But world demand has fallen sharply because of 
the ongoing global economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	May cotton jumped 1.44 cents to 62.73 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures finished higher on the Chicago Board of Trade on  
talk farmers will plant less of the crop this spring than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat succumbed early to weakness across the Board of Trade but  
moved higher on talk the government was considering putting more 
land into a conservation set-aside program. Market participants 
also were weighing news that Pakistan is now eligible for U.S. 
Agriculture Department export credit guarantees to buy U.S. wheat, 
as well as continued dry weather in northern China growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	May wheat rose 5 1/4 cents to $2.67 3/4 per bushel.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Car Bomb Kills Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANKIRI, Turkey (AP) -- A car bomb exploded in central Turkey  
today as a vehicle carrying a local governor passed, killing three 
people and injuring the governor and nine others, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was planted in a parked car and went off as Gov. Ayhan  
Cevik was being driven to his office, said Osman Ates, the deputy 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, authorities had reported four dead. They gave no  
explanation for lowering the death toll. 
</P>
<P>
	A schoolgirl, a man and Cevik's bodyguard were killed by the  
blast, which also shattered windows of nearby buildings. Cevik's 
driver was among the injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Cevik, who suffered a head injury, was taken to Ankara for  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bomb,  
which authorities said was set off by remote control. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if the attack was linked to imprisoned Kurdish  
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who was captured by Turkish 
authorities last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene of the blast was cordoned off by police, but hundreds  
of people gathered around and shouted slogans denouncing Ocalan's 
rebel group. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cankiri, a city 80 miles north of the capital Ankara,  
has not witnessed any major attacks, Ocalan's autonomy-seeking 
rebel group has carried out bombings in other cities in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a suspected Kurdish suicide bomber killed herself  
and wounded three others in the southeastern city of Batman.

<HEADLINE> Senate Mulls State Education Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate ended its business this week still  
bogged down by a small but popular proposal to give states more 
flexibility in spending federal education money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to find some way to get an agreement in a timely  
way,'' Majority Leader Trent Lott said today after filing another 
measure to keep Democrats from expanding the so-called ``ed-flex'' 
bill with key elements of their education agenda. This includes a 
planned proposal to maximize funds for President Clinton's desire 
to hire 100,000 teachers to help reduce class sizes across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-drafted plan seems certain for overwhelming  
passage in the Senate next week, but the debate remains politically 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``ed-flex'' bill, supported by the White House and by many  
governors, has become part of a stew of education initiatives 
simmering in Washington as Republicans try to move beyond the 
impeachment episode. At the same time, Democrats are also zeroing 
in on education policy. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference today, Education Secretary Richard W. Riley  
joined Senate Democrats in urging Republicans to let Sen. Patty 
Murray, D-Wa., formally include the class-size proposal in the 
ed-flex bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed-flex is expected to make life a little easier for principals  
and teachers handling federal paperwork. But for now, it's at the 
core of a complex struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should have been an easy winner for both sides,'' said  
Bruce Hunter, chief lobbyist for the nation's school 
administrators. ``Suddenly the Republican leadership had 
appropriated what was originally a bipartisan bill,'' he said. 
``The Democrats got their hackles up a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats swiftly decided to seek passage of an amendment to pay  
$150 million for programs to keep dropouts in school. Republicans 
shifted that money to fill an estimated $11 billion shortfall in 
special education funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats, led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts,  
decided to approve that special education funding and it passed 
unanimously Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we bring our amendments up for vote and are defeated,  
that's fine, that's the way the system is supposed to work,'' said 
Sen. said Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. He said he still supports the 
education flexibility bill, but will offer the dropout measure as 
many times as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	After days of debate, Republicans were charging Democrats with  
mounting a filibuster against the ed-flex bill. Democrats denied 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans plan to introduce another measure next week to  
allow special education accounts, with interest to accumulate 
tax-free, which could be used for school expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republican Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the  
chairman of the Budget Committee, floated a proposal for a 40 
percent increase in federal school funding over the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	And setting to work on a schedule for the post-impeachment era,  
Lott decided on an early debate on legislation backed by governors 
of both parties to reduce federal restrictions on money that goes 
to the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The ed-flex bill would let states waive certain federal rules on  
how they spend more than $12 billion in federal aid. It expands the 
waiver privileges of 12 states in a pilot program to all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	A House version of the measure goes to the floor next week.  
</P>
<P>
	The idea dates to the early 1990s during debate over the Bush  
administration's America 2000 education program and the 
alternatives offered by congressional Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Internet Puts Pressure on Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As much as the Internet has done to promote the  
growth of mutual fund investing, it also threatens to lure 
investors away from funds with some potent new competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The first wave of this challenge is visible now with the rapid  
rise of electronic trading services operating on the World Wide 
Web, which allow investors to buy and sell individual stocks more 
easily and cheaply than ever before. And that could be just the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	One writer at a New York research organization recently raised  
the intriguing suggestion that businesses on the Web could make 
available all the services and benefits now provided by funds at 
lower cost and without some of the tax headaches that often arise 
for fund investors. 
</P>
<P>
	This could get interesting. For the last 10 or 20 years, the  
funds, with the appealing combination of diversification, 
convenience and professional management they offer, haven't faced 
much competition from any other type of financial services firm. 
</P>
<P>
	E-trading has attracted a great deal of attention in recent  
months. More broadly, in a stock market climate favoring only a few 
dozen blue chips and high-technology companies, the idea of 
investing directly in individual stocks appears to be enjoying a 
new vogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could individual stocks be luring money away from mutual  
funds? While it's too early to call this a trend, fund flows 
haven't been as strong as they should be so far in 1999,'' analyst 
Henry McVey at Wall Street's Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
observed in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marginal investors appear to have decided not to plow their  
discretionary dollars into retail mutual funds; rather, they seem 
to be buying individual securities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As financial advisers have been quick to point out, buying  
stocks directly can pose problems for most individual investors. 
For one thing, if you give up the diversification that comes with a 
mutual-fund portfolio, you may expose yourself to dramatically 
increased risk without improving your potential rewards very much. 
</P>
<P>
	If you venture onto the Web to trade stocks frequently, rather  
than buying and holding for the long term, you are abandoning a 
fairly simple mission for a much more complicated and difficult 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	As electronic investing services continue to evolve, however,  
couldn't they start offering instant diversified portfolios to 
individual investors? ``Mutual funds deserve to be the next big 
casualty of the Web,'' argues Peter Huber, a lawyer at the 
Manhattan Institute, writing in the Feb. 8 issue of Forbes 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	What funds provide, Huber says, is knowledge of what's going on  
in the markets, plus the ability to acquire and hold a diversified 
portfolio of stocks without great inconvenience or prohibitive 
expense. Now, he says, the Web is reducing their edge by making 
information more accessible to everybody and reducing the costs of 
direct investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Huber declares, ``the major deterrent for most investors (of  
direct investing) is simply the hassle and worry ... which the Web 
will soon eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The newsletter crowd and the smart funds will go online,  
selling pure information. They will channel suggested portfolio 
profiles directly to individual investors, by way of Intuit (for 
example), which will drop it straight into Quicken on your PC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before we get too carried away, there are some reasons to doubt  
that all the fund industry's managers will be replaced by robots in 
the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, many, if not most, individual investors seem to  
like to know that a human being is in charge of their money, 
bearing the moral and legal duties of a fiduciary. If nothing else, 
this setup ensures that there will be someone to blame besides 
yourself if things go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	As McVey puts it, ``We see the mutual fund as a powerful  
product, particularly in the retirement market ... Moreover, recent 
market volatility may drive investors back to mutual funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the prospect of new competition is welcome news  
for fund investors. After all, you need competition to compel 
businesses in any industry to keep working to provide the best 
possible product at the lowest possible cost. From the consumer's 
point of view, the more competition the better.

particular figures to be a showcase for the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Russian men, including world champion Alexei Yagudin, will  
compete against only two non-Russians, Germany's Andreas Vlaschenko 
and American champ Michael Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin has been sensational this season, but will be challenged  
by 1994 Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov, who is in the midst of a 
comeback from a series of injuries; Yevgeny Plushenko, the rising 
start of the sport; and Alexander Abt, who performs probably the 
most difficult technical programs, including a triple axel-triple 
loop combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Top coach Alexei Miyshin said the Russians win because of a deep  
tradition of ballet and skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We train them best,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	All the Russians have done quadruple jumps in competition. Weiss  
will have to nail his -- he's come close several times, but never 
has completed one cleanly in competition -- to have a chance to 
medal here and at worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't go in being concerned with what they are doing,'' he  
said. ``I have to do what I can and skate my best with my programs 
and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss did not practice his quad Thursday, but has vowed to use  
it in both the short program and free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Elvis Stojko, still not completely healthy from a groin  
injury suffered at the Nagano Olympics more than a year ago, was 
given a medical withdrawal from the finals. Vlaschenko replaced 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's world champion Kwan did not take part in the Grand Prix  
this season. That leaves Maria Butyrskaya of Russia as the 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya, 26, is a mature and powerful skater who won the  
European title and shouldn't have much trouble with this field, 
which also has Uzbekistan's Tatiana Malinina, winner of last week's 
inaugural Four Continents event. 
</P>
<P>
	Butyrskaya had some problems in Nagano, but has performed well  
since, and this might be a good warmup for taking on Kwan at 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also competing are Elena Sokolova of Russia, Elena Liashenko of  
Ukraine, Irina Slutskaya of Russia and Fumie Suguri of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In pairs, Russian world winners Elena Berezhnaya and Anton  
Sikharulidze, Olympic silver medalists, attracted attention this 
season for their zippy, lightning-fast routine. They will face the 
newly formed American pair Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, as well as 
Chinese, French and Russian competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working hard since nationals to erase those  
mistakes we made,'' Ina said. ``The more time we're together, the 
better we skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, in ice dancing, where the Russians usually are dominant,  
the French duo of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat offer a 
strong challenge to world champs Anjelika Krylova and Oleg 
Ovsiannikov, the Olympic runners-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The event offers a total prize pool of $482,000.

<HEADLINE>  Spoonhour Retires After 7 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Charlie Spoonhour retired Friday after seven  
seasons as Saint Louis coach, saying the job had become too much of 
a grind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not sick, no matter how I look,'' Spoonhour joked at an  
overflow news conference. ``I'm not getting divorced. There's just 
a point when you have to get off the merry-go-round, and that time 
is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour, 59, was 122-90 at Saint Louis, and led the Billikens  
to three NCAA tournaments and one NIT. His final season was a 
frustrating 15-16 as he struggled unsuccessfully to fill the huge 
void created when Larry Hughes left for the NBA's Philadelphia 
76ers after leading Saint Louis to 22 victories and a first-round 
victory in the NCAAs his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Larry comes back this year, we're one of the elite teams,''  
senior forward Ryan Luechtefeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 Division I seasons, Spoonhour was 319-171, a .651 winning  
percentage, and reached 20 or more victories 10 times. Before 
coming to Saint Louis he led Southwest Missouri State to five NCAA 
tournaments and two NITs in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour, who leaves with two years remaining on a $325,000  
annual contract, said he knew it was time to move on early in the 
season when he found it difficult to get over losses. Months ago, 
he confided to close friends in the profession that he would be 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do the things you need to do, it finally got to be work,''  
Spoonhour said. ``And I always said if it got to be a real job I'd 
quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players saw a different side, a Spoonhour that was letting go.  
Reserve forward Troy Robertson said he thought Spoonhour was 
happier than could be expected during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the losses, I thought the next day in practice he was  
going to kill us,'' Robertson said. ``But he was pretty upbeat, 
positive. So it made a little sense that he was trying to have a 
good time on his way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour said a winning record this season wouldn't have  
changed his mind. He said he probably stayed a year longer than he 
should have. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour said he wouldn't coach again, but might be interested  
in scouting for an NBA team. For now, he said, he just wants to 
relax a bit and plans to head soon for Jupiter, Fla., to watch his 
beloved St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	When athletic director Doug Woolard asked what he could do,  
Spoonhour said, ``I told them very simply, be happy for me. Because 
this is why I work, so someday I can sit around and do nothing. 
That's what I'm going to try to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior forward Ryan Luechtefeld said Spoonhour's announcement to  
the team after Thursday night's 70-61 loss to Louisville in the 
Conference USA tournament should have been more gut-wrenching than 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody assumed that it was going to happen, but it was  
still emotional when he told us,'' Luechtefeld said. ``Then again, 
he wasn't and his son wasn't, and that told us he was happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour's son, Jay, was an assistant coach on the team.  
</P>
<P>
	A national search process will begin immediately, Woolard said.  
Spoonhour recommended longtime assistant Greg Lackey for the job 
and several players endorsed the move. 
</P>
<P>
	A top outsider mentioned for the opening is Illinois State coach  
Kevin Stallings. He led Illinois State to consecutive Missouri 
Valley Conference championships in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Apologizes To Italians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, with  
President Clinton at his side, said today he is ``personally 
shocked and so is the Italian public's opinion'' over the acquittal 
of an American pilot whose plane caused the cable car accident that 
killed 20 skiers in Italy last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At a joint news conference between the two leaders, Clinton  
assured his guest that ``the United States is not trying to duck 
its responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Americans were ``profoundly regretful and  
apologetic for what has occurred to the families and all of the 
people of Italy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But D'Alema was not reassured by Clinton's words.  
</P>
<P>
	``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for  
what happened is found guilty and punished,'' he said. ``With so 
many casualties and so many deaths, you can hardly ever say you are 
satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Defense Secretary William Cohen would meet with his  
Italian counterpart to review operation changes designed to avert 
similar accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reiterated the United States remained determined to  
assess responsibility for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are horrified and heartbroken by what happened and we will  
do our best to make sure something like that doesn't happen 
again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both leaders noted there was further judicial action pending and  
they gauged their comments so as to not influence it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that at the end of the process it is made clear who  
was responsible for this accident and that these people are 
punished for it,'' D'Alema said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a military jury in Camp Lejeune, N.C., cleared  
Capt. Richard Ashby of 20 involuntary manslaughter charges in the 
accident on Feb. 3, 1998. D'Alema also said the situation had 
strained U.S. relations with Italy, a NATO ally. 
</P>
<P>
	During a training flight in the Italian Alps, Ashby flew into  
two cables holding up a gondola packed with tourists who were 
preparing to ski. Eight Germans, five Belgians, one Austrian, one 
Dutch person, two Poles and three Italians perished, touching off a 
wave of criticism that the Marine crew was speeding and showing off 
in complete disregard for the civilians around them. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that kind of a massacre, with so many casualties, I think  
it is a duty to ensure ... that justice is done, and that is what 
we are asking for,'' D'Alema said Thursday. ``Certainly this is not 
an Italian problem, nor does it concern Italy and U.S. relations 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the tragedy last year, Cohen authorized a  
discretionary payment of $5,000 to each victim's family to cover 
immediate transportation and burial expenses, and the U.S. 
government has reimbursed Italy for the $60,000 it paid to the 
survivors of each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 20 victims' estates have filed wrongful death claims  
with the Italian ministry of defense, ranging from $812,000 to $5.4 
million, and all 20 families have hired attorneys, with intentions 
of filing claims to be processed by the Italian government. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said Thursday the United States will  
continue to work closely with Italian officials to ensure the 
claims are handled expeditiously.

<HEADLINE> In Pursuit Once More of Pimpernel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Richard E. Grant is dressed in what he calls his  
``18th-century grand fop gear'' to play Sir Percy Blakeney, the 
gallant and enduring aristocrat who leads a dangerous second life 
as the Scarlet Pimpernel. 
</P>
<P>
	In tight breeches and white stockings, the 6-foot, 2-inch actor  
also wears 2-inch heels. ``They're just to annoy people who are 
height-impaired,'' he deadpans. 
</P>
<P>
	Television is preparing yet another screen retelling of ``The  
Scarlet Pimpernel,'' based on the Baroness Orczy's tales of 
derring-do and double-dealing set in 1792 near the climax of the 
French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	This version, a co-production of A&AMP;E in the United States and  
the BBC in Britain, with some Australian money as well, will have 
its American premiere on A&AMP;E Sunday at 9 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The $9 million sequence of films continues with two further  
two-hour TV movies, which can be viewed independently. Their air 
dates have not yet been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Grant in the title role, the cast includes American  
actress Elizabeth McGovern (``Ragtime,'' ``Ordinary People'') as 
Sir Percy's French wife, Marguerite, and Englishman Martin Shaw as 
Robespierre's dastardly henchman, Chauvelin, who -- in this version, 
if not in the books -- is Marguerite's one-time lover. 
</P>
<P>
	``The baroness raises nothing of the kind,'' says producer  
Julian Murphy. ``They are very pure books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This first of three movies was shot largely in the Czech  
Republic, standing in for 18th-century Paris as it did last year in 
the Liam Neeson film of ``Les Miserables.'' Both films used the 
rural town of Zatac, with ``its extraordinary rundown old center,'' 
as Murphy describes it. 
</P>
<P>
	But on this particular day, cast and crew have relocated to  
Wrotham Park just north of London. Here, taking over the same 
stately home used nearly a decade ago in Kenneth Branagh's film 
``Peter's Friends,'' an elaborate intrigue starts to unfold whereby 
the viewer discovers the Pimpernel's true identity well before the 
other characters do. 
</P>
<P>
	The story, of course, has been told and retold since ``The  
Scarlet Pimpernel'' was published in 1905 by Baroness Emma Orczy, a 
Hungarian-born Englishwoman. The baroness' novel was rejected by so 
many publishers that she and her husband, Montagu Barstow, produced 
it as a play. It was a hit that ran in London for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' became a best seller, and fodder for  
at least three TV sagas and two films, the best known being the 
1934 Leslie Howard-Merle Oberon movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broadway musical of the same name is well into its second  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody leading a double life is (part of) an ongoing literary  
and cinematic tradition that seems to grip the imagination,'' says 
Grant, who has appeared in the films ``Withnail and I,'' ``The 
Player,'' ``The Age of Innocence,'' ``Hudson Hawk'' and last year's 
``Spice World -- The Movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What does the role require? ``Swordfighting, horse riding,  
killing baddies, kissing women, saving women, saving aristocrats, 
sailing -- all gentlemen's sports, really,'' replies Grant, 41. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a romantic story with a twist,'' says Patrick Lau, Hong  
Kong-born director of the first two films. ``This guy is almost 
schizophrenic, for heaven's sake. He's an English aristocrat who 
went out and saved all these French people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tale brings together elegant society swells with plenty of  
swashbuckling, but departs in tone from the fruitiness of the 
Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely focused on the fact that if this man was saving  
anybody from being beheaded, he would have to be kind yet 
manipulative yet deceitful -- whatever is required to do that,'' 
Grant explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the set, co-star Shaw, late of Broadway's ``An  
Ideal Husband,'' is engaged in his separate negotiation with 
tights. ``Now I know what it's like for women,'' he grumbles 
agreeably. ``It's not pleasant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw isn't sure Chauvelin is one of those villains who gets the  
best lines, but he adds with a smile, ``he gets the best women.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...

	BEE GEES ON VH1: Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb have written more  
hit songs, sold more records and achieved greater heights than 
almost anyone else in rock 'n' roll. More than once, they've been 
counted out and come back again. And they have never had a free 
ride. They are, Barry has said, ``the enigma with the stigma.'' 
``Legends: Bee Gees'' follows the group from their origins in 
Australia to their phenomenal success with the ``Saturday Night 
Fever'' soundtrack and beyond. It also uncovers the personal story 
behind the group's 1969 breakup, and their volatile relationship 
with late sibling Andy Gibb. The one-hour documentary airs on VH1 
Sunday at 10 p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Soar As Joblessness Rises / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bonds rallied as much as 2 points on  
Friday after the government reported an unexpected rise in 
unemployment, easing investors' concerns the Federal Reserve may 
push up interest rates to keep the robust U.S. economy from 
overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates would hurt the value of existing fixed-rate  
securities, such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond eased from its  
highs to close up 1 11-32 points, or $13.44 per $1,000 in face 
value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 
5.60 percent from 5.69 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices shot higher after the Labor Department reported the  
unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.4 percent in February as 
the nation's manufacturers continued to be battered by the global 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	While the economy generated an extra 275,000 jobs, better than  
expected, bond investors apparently focused on a drop in factory 
employment by 50,000, the biggest setback since last November. 
</P>
<P>
	But bond prices gave up some of their gains amid a powerful  
rally on Wall Street that sent some bond investors to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds have been hit hard over the past two weeks by a series of  
reports revealing surprising strength in the economy that could 
prove inflationary. Investors fear the Federal Reserve will slow 
the economy with a boost in interest rates. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Attendance Problems at Indoor Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- It may be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for  
people in this central Japan city to see the best athletes the 
world has to offer, although you'd never guess that from looking at 
the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the 20,000 seats at the World Indoor Athletics  
Championships have been mostly empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect it to be like this,'' Ethiopia's Haile  
Gebrselassie said after winning the 3,000 gold on Friday. ``I 
thought the stadium would be full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yuko Ogihara, a 36-year-old housewife who came Saturday, said  
the only reason she came was that she got free tickets from a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess track and field isn't really part of our lives,'' she  
said, looking around at the sea of unoccupied seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Atsushi Hoshino, a press official for the International Amateur  
Athletic Federation, acknowledged that holding the event in a small 
city with only one local newspaper made publicity a critical 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this had been Tokyo, we could have done more to get the  
word out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of schoolchildren were brought in during class time  
for the opening ceremony Friday, but they left long before 
Gebrselassie raced. 
</P>
<P>
	Although organizers gave Friday's attendance at more than 8,000,  
that figure included athletes, officials and the media. And by the 
end of the day, the crowd had thinned even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosuke Saida, a 20-year-old college student, said he would be a  
lot more excited had NBA stars come to his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be honest,'' he said, admitting he did not  
recognize the name of a single athlete taking part in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents had been pretty much expected to buy the tickets,  
valued at 4,000 yen or $33, he said. It is common in Japanese 
communities for people to have to buy tickets through friends and 
the office to help make a local event a success. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in Maebashi, a city 60 miles north of Tokyo, has been  
so low, one schoolteacher who is working as a volunteer for the 
event said she kept that a secret from her co-workers for fear she 
would be seen as an oddity.

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Earns Australian GP Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Defending Formula One champion Mika  
Hakkinen knocked McLaren teammate David Coulthard off the pole 
position with a stunning last lap in qualifying for the Australian 
Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen's best circuit of the 3.295-mile Albert Park circuit  
was 131.135 mph, earning the Finn's 11th career pole. Coulthard had 
briefly taken the pole on his last qualifying lap with a speed of 
130.437 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari's Michael Schumacher rebounded from Friday's  
disappointing practice session to place third as the top three 
positions were exactly the same as last year's Australian GP. That 
race was marred by a McLaren deal which allowed Hakkinen to 
overtake Coulthard near the finish because he was first through the 
first corner. 
</P>
<P>
	All 22 drivers stayed in the pits for the first 10 minutes of  
Saturday's hour-long session before England's Johnny Herbert took 
his Stewart Ford out on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubens Barrichello, in a Stewart Ford, placed fourth with  
Heinz-Harald Frenzten of Jordan fifth and Ferrari's Eddie Irvine 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Former champion Jacques Villeneuve was 12th as BAR made its F1  
debut.

<HEADLINE> Big East Founders Are Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The seven men who formed the Big East 20 years  
ago and changed the landscape of college basketball forever were 
honored Friday by the conference they created. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletic directors from Providence, Georgetown, Syracuse,  
St. John's, Seton Hall, Boston College and Connecticut announced on 
May 31, 1979, that they would form a Division I conference. League 
play began that November, starting one of the most amazing 
two-decade runs in sports history. 
</P>
<P>
	The only coach of that original group is Dave Gavitt, who had  
led Providence to the 1974 Final Four and had been selected to lead 
the 1980 U.S. Olympic team. He was chosen as the Big East's first 
commissioner, and held that post for the league's first decade as 
it became one of the power players in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were so fortunate in so many ways at the outset,'' said  
Gavitt, now the chairman of the board of the Basketball Hall of 
Fame. ``We put together a solid foundation with a good plan, but we 
were fortunate to have four coaches who were going to be at their 
schools for a long time in John Thompson, Looie Carnesecca, Jimmy 
Boeheim and Rollie Massimino, and having them stay in place was 
very significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those coaches were very visible as the league grew, but the men  
honored Friday night -- Gavitt, Jack Kaiser of St. John's, Jake 
Crouthamel of Syracuse, the late Bill Flynn of Boston College, John 
Toner of Connecticut, Frank Rienzo of Georgetown and Richie Regan 
of Seton Hall -- made things work behind the scenes. Crouthamel is 
the only one in the same position he was then. 
</P>
<P>
	The new league readily adopted a new entity as a partner of  
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ESPN came along as we did was very fortunate for us, and  
how we worked together benefited both tremendously,'' Gavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villanova joined the league in 1980 and Pittsburgh came along in  
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's high mark was 1985, when Georgetown and St. John's  
spent most of the season as the nation's No. 1 and 2 teams and they 
were joined in the Final Four by eventual national champion 
Villanova in the Final Four. That's still the only time one league 
has had three teams in the national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	As football became an integral part of things, Miami was added  
in 1992 and membership reached 13 schools when Notre Dame, Rutgers 
and West Virginia joined in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't envy anybody in a conference when you have gone to  
more than 10 because you've made it very difficult for yourself 
because you've become less of a conference and more of an 
association,'' Gavitt said. ``There are teams in this league with 
major college football commitments and you can't ignore that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thirteen is a very awkward number, and whether 14 is better or  
16 is better I don't know. I do think that what it is now isn't 
what it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gavitt was asked what one thing since that original meeting he  
has found most remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's always amazed me more than anything else is  
that when we formed the league one of the goals we thought we could 
accomplish was to stop the drain of Eastern players going 
elsewhere,'' he said. ``We stopped that pretty quickly but I never 
imagined, and it's the power of television, that our schools would 
start attracting kids from the West Coast or New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us ever foresaw that our schools would  
become truly national in their recruiting.''

<HEADLINE> Bradford, Kanell Sign With Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons reached a contract  
agreement with cornerback Ronnie Bradford and announced today they 
and quarterback Danny Kanell have agreed to terms, giving the NFC 
champions a new backup to Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is very clear, that I'll be backing up Chris,''  
Kanell told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which reported today 
that the former Florida State star would sign a two-year deal for 
$2.5 million and a $1 million signing bonus. ``I just think it's 
going to be a great fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Kanell was cut by the Giants last month.  
</P>
<P>
	Bradford was an unrestricted free agent who started 24 of  
Atlanta's last 30 games. Terms of his contract were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford, 28, signed with the Falcons as a free agent from the  
Arizona Cardinals in 1997 and in two seasons with Atlanta has 91 
tackles, seven interceptions and 24 passes defended. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the 5-foot-10, 188-pound Bradford, a member of  
Colorado's 1991 national championship team, started 10 of the 14 
games he played and finished with 40 tackles and three 
interceptions. He started the Super Bowl against Denver and had six 
tackles and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell was a New York draft pick in 1996. He played one season  
for coach Dan Reeves, who was fired by the Giants after the 1996 
season and joined the Falcons in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The starter for most of last season, Kanell was benched in  
November after a 3-7 start. He completed 160 passes in 299 attempts 
for 1,603 yards, 11 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell, who was replaced as starter by Kent Graham, was released  
by the Giants last month after they signed Kerry Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanell, who grew up in Fort Lauderdale, also was sought by the  
Miami Dolphins, where his father served as team physician. 
</P>
<P>
	He started in 20 games in three seasons in New York. In 1997, he  
completed 156 of 294 passes for 1,740 yards, 11 TDs, and nine 
interceptions after taking over for Dave Brown in midseason and 
helping the Giants win the NFC East.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Offer New Au Pair Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A doctor claims that the baby boy in the Louise  
Woodward case was strangled, not beaten to death as prosecutors 
claimed. A prosecutor and a lawyer for the boy's family dismiss the 
theory as absurd. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Floyd Gilles, a pediatric neuropathologist, and Dr. Marvin  
Nelson, a radiologist, reviewed the medical records of 8-month-old 
Matthew Eappen at the request of CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' Both doctors 
are affiliated with Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Gilles, someone squeezed Matthew's carotid artery,  
blocking the flow of blood to his brain, CBS said in a news release 
Friday. Sometimes when infants are strangled, it can take up to 48 
hours for brain swelling to become evident, he theorized. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he came to that conclusion because Matthew had  
``unexplained'' injuries on his neck. Nelson and Gilles both told 
CBS the medical evidence suggests Matthew was serially abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Coakley, who was co-prosecutor on the case, called the  
theory ``crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes no common sense. It makes no medical sense. It  
doesn't appear to be backed up at all,'' she said. ``They say they 
believe their evidence casts doubt on the conviction of Louise 
Woodward. I believe that's irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Woodward was convicted in October 1997 of second-degree  
murder in Matthew's death. She appealed, and the trial judge 
reduced her sentence to involuntary manslaughter and released her 
from prison. She returned home to England in June, after the ruling 
was upheld on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	In January she settled a civil wrongful death case with the  
baby's parents, Drs. Sunil and Deborah Eappen. 
</P>
<P>
	During the criminal trial, prosecutors and defense lawyers  
argued that Matthew was shaken or died from trauma to the head. 
Defense lawyers never raised a theory of strangulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederic Ellis, the Eappen's lawyer, said the idea that the baby  
was strangled was absurd. He said Ms. Woodward's lawyers argued 
there were not enough injuries to Matthew's neck to support the 
prosecutors' claim that he was shaken to death. He said experts at 
trial said Matthew's only neck injuries were from a medical 
procedure to try to get him breathing again. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's Hospital spokesman Steve Rutledge said Friday that  
the two physicians had agreed not to discuss their theory until the 
CBS broadcast airs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Silverglate, one of Ms. Woodward's lawyers, said he  
wanted to watch the broadcast before he commented.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Activated by Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell, out for three weeks with an  
injured heel, scored 18 points in the New York Knicks' 88-87 loss 
to the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell came in with 3:38 left in the first quarter and  
celebrated his comeback with a dunk about 90 seconds later. He 
scored 14 points in 14 first-half minutes, helping the Knicks to a 
49-42 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're going to bring him off the bench because  
we've been starting like this for 13 games. I'm not really sure 
that I want to disrupt the rhythm,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy 
said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hard part right now is that there is not enough practice  
time to really work him back in, so I have to do it in games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired in January from the Golden State Warriors for  
John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings, played only two games 
for the Knicks -- both losses -- before being diagnosed with a stress 
fracture of the right heel. He was averaging 14.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been running and shooting with the team for the past  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks put reserve guard David Wingate on the injured list.  
</P>
<P>
	Wingate appeared in six games with the Knicks, scoring a total  
of six points. He has a tendinitis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he didn't know where the Knicks would be had  
Sprewell not gotten hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say, but certainly we'd be not having to go  
through another learning process. And, I'm sure he would have felt 
comfortable by this time with our team and what we're trying to 
do,'' Van Gundy said. ``What does that project into, I'm not sure. 
More wins? Same wins? I'm not sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea some people were floating out there that we were  
better with him hurt, that's preposterous,'' Van Gundy added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell said he didn't mind coming off the bench for now.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty much the game plan to this point, see how I'm  
playing, see how I feel,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell sounded as though he knew the layoff would hamper his  
game, but he said he hoped to have the same immediate impact he did 
upon his arrival in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope so. I don't know. It's going to be interesting to see  
if I'm able to do that or not,'' Sprewell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucks coach George Karl said Sprewell means a world of  
difference for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athleticism, speed, jumping, finishing, scoring, defensive  
attitude. Pretty damn good. All-Star player,'' Karl said. ``I'd 
vote for him Sixth Man of the Year if they'd keep him on the 
bench.''

<HEADLINE> Mom of Emaciated Teen Let Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Prosecutors on Friday closed the case  
against a woman whose 15-year-old daughter died weighing just over 
15 pounds, dropping a neglect charge against the mother and saying 
they won't seek to commit her to a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Kuffer's daughter Kay suffered from cerebral palsy, mental  
retardation and epilepsy. She died of malnutrition and dehydration 
after her mother took her to the hospital in November. Large bed 
sores on her hips were so deep they exposed the bones beneath. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a judge effectively ended the criminal case against  
Kuffer, 50, by finding her mentally incompetent to stand trial 
because of her mild retardation. Prosecutors could have asked that 
she be placed in protective placement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuffer's condition doesn't make her a danger to herself or  
others, or warrant commitment, prosecutor David O'Leary said. He 
said the criminal complaint would be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The county corporation counsel's office, which also has  
statutory authority to seek a civil commitment, won't pursue it 
either, O'Leary said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs, Wood Agree to One-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- NL Rookie of the Year Kerry Wood, who struck  
out 20 last year to tie the record for a nine-inning game, agreed 
Friday to a $690,000, one-year contract with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is by far the largest for a player with less than one  
year of major league service. Wood, who has 169 days in the major 
leagues and made the minimum $170,000 last year, will not be 
eligible for salary arbitration until after the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased,'' Wood said. ``The best part about it is  
that I don't have to worry about it anymore, not that I was 
worrying about it a lot anyway. I was just pretty much kept up to 
date on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander was 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA and 233  
strikeouts in 1998. In addition to striking out 20 against Houston 
last May, which tied Roger Clemens' record, he set a major league 
record with 33 strikeouts in during consecutive nine-inning games. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood missed the entire month of September because of soreness in  
his right elbow, then returned for Game 3 of the division series, 
pitching five innings in a 6-2 loss to the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was sidelined this spring by a upper respiratory and  
gastrointestinal illnesses, but said Friday he's 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Wood, the Cubs also agreed to one-year contracts  
with pitchers Jeremi Gonzalez, Felix Heredia, Rodney Myers and Kurt 
Miller, and catcher Sandy Martinez.

<HEADLINE> Dow Hits Record High of 9,736.08 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared 268.68  
points to a new record Friday and cracked through 9,700 for the 
first time. Stocks were ignited by a government employment report 
that calmed worries about rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip average closed at 9,736.08, topping its Jan. 8  
record finish of 9,643.32 and bringing 1999's rise to 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other indexes also rose sharply, but none set records.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've gone from lethargy to euphoria in this market over the  
last few days,'' said Larry Watchel, a market analyst at Prudential 
Securities. ``I'm sure at sometime next week the Dow will be 
sweeping up toward 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two days, the Dow has risen more than 460 points, or  
5 percent. That's the average's biggest two-day advance in points 
ever, surpassing a record of 447.98 on last Oct. 15-16. The gain is 
not close to a record in percentage terms. For the week, the Dow 
gained 429.5. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Thursday, stocks had been struggling amid uncertainty  
over whether company profits will justify the market's huge rebound 
since early October, when the Dow dipped below 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	There have also been fears that the fast-growing economy would  
spur inflation and force the Federal Reserve Board to boost 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But a jobs report from the Labor Department helped dampen those  
concerns on Friday. The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.4 
percent in February, while average hourly wages -- long considered a 
barometer of inflation -- rose a mere 1 cent to $13.04. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sign that the economy is truly not overheating,''  
said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum 
&AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ``If the economy isn't running on all 
cylinders, nothing should happen with interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-sensitive bond market also soared on the report.  
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond, which was up more than 2 
points in early trading, rose 1 11/32 points or $13.43 per $1,000 
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, 
fell to 5.60 percent from 5.69 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge on Wall Street followed big gains overnight in global  
financial markets. Japan's main market index climbed 5 percent on 
the best day of trading of this year. In London, the Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100 index gained 1.7 percent, while main 
market indicators rose 2.5 percent in Frankfurt and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks led Friday's rally on Wall Street. All 30 Dow  
components rose, with the biggest gains coming in IBM, up 7 3/8 at 
178 3/8, and American Express, up 5 9/16 at 118 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also strong were stocks in the financial sector, like banks and  
brokerage firms, which benefited from the diminishing likelihood of 
an interest-rate hike. Citigroup rose 1 7/16 to 61 3/4 and Chase 
gained 3 1/2 to 86 7/8. 
</P>

	While technology stocks were mostly higher, they failed to keep

<HEADLINE> Health Industry Executive Pay Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The chairmen of three major drug companies  
scored big in stock options during 1998, reflecting what analysts 
described as a trend of soaring compensation for health industry 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen Inc. chairman and chief executive Gordon M. Binder  
exercised stock options worth $37.4 million during 1998, while 
leaving $104 million in unexercised options on the table. Binder's 
salary and bonus were worth $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Meyers Squibb chief executive Charles Heimbold Jr.  
tapped options for $30.4 million, while holding another $204 
million in unexercised options. Heimbold also received $1.2 million 
in salary and a $1.9 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he retired, Randall Tobias, chairman and chief executive  
officer of Prozac-maker Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., exercised options that 
netted $32 million, and holds unexercised options valued in SEC 
documents at $115.2 million. The gain came in addition to Tobias' 
salary and bonus of $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensation for the three executives was outlined in documents  
filed this week with the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies each enjoyed strong profit growth during 1998. But  
the compensation awarded executives illustrate a troubling trend, 
said analyst Graef Crystal, publisher of The Crystal Report 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two new entries to the list of high-paying  
industries, paying far more for size and amount of performance. 
Those are the pharmaceutical industry and the health industry,'' 
said Crystal. ``It's interesting when we're having this national 
problem with medical care costs, that CEOs have got their snouts so 
deeply imbedded in the trough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Amgen said stock option awards are lucrative  
only when companies are doing well. In bad years, executives often 
get nothing from the grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biotechnology business and the drug discovery business is  
a risky enterprise. Our company has had strong years and 
not-so-strong years,'' said David Kaye. ``1998 was a strong year, 
the stock appreciated 93 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Amgen earnings were flat during 1997, when the  
government restricted Medicare payments on Epogen, a drug used in 
kidney dialysis treatments, Kaye said. Sales surged in the first 
half of 1998 after the restrictions were removed, and then 
flattened out for the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking comment from Bristol-Meyers and Eli Lilly  
officials were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercised options for the three executives pale in  
comparison to those of some chief executives in recent years. For 
example, Walt Disney Co. chairman Michael Eisner realized a 
before-tax gain of $516 million on options exercised in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the payouts reflect a trend in higher compensation for  
executives in the health industry. Chief executives of health 
companies, including health services, supplies and pharmaceuticals, 
reported the second highest average gain of any industry, $4.9 
million, in fiscal 1997, according to a survey by Executive 
Compensation Advisory Services. That's a distant second to the 
financial services industry's average of $15.2 million, and 
slightly ahead of high-tech at $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal, who helped craft Eisner's pay package, has noticed a  
similar trend. In a study of 31 industries, he concluded that 
health industry executives received 66 percent more in total direct 
compensation than the average. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases in executive compensation has been a concern among  
analysts and shareholders in recent years. And the trend shows no 
sign of slowing. ``We're going to be seeing some huge numbers, 
which makes you wonder whether this thing is getting out of 
control,'' Crystal said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-D'Alema Text 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Let me first of all say about Kosovo, I don't think it's fair to  
say that NATO threatens and backs away. We took military action in 
Bosnia which led directly to the peace. So I don't think Mr. 
Milosevic is under any illusion that if NATO has an action order 
outstanding that we won't activate it. And I would be astonished to 
believe that our allies would back away from a commitment we've 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	I think what happened at Rambouillet was quite important and  
justified the request not of Serbia, but of both parties, both 
parties, for some more time to try to solve this agreement, to 
ruminate on it, to decide how to respond to it. The Kosovars 
themselves wanted that. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally we have an agreement not in every single point, but in  
large measure between the Serbs and the Kosovars on what the nature 
of autonomy would be for the next three years. That's quite an 
astonishing achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	And so I -- my perception is quite the reverse. I think we were  
facing a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo last summer. We came in 
with a threat of force and it worked and we averted it and we 
didn't have to use force because we avoided the tragedy, we got 
what we wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Were there violations of the cease-fire? Yes, but they were  
violations from both sides. And there were problems there. But 
that's why we started this new process, with the new NATO action 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	It became clear we had to do more because particularly of the  
terrible killings in one village in Kosovo that were precipitated 
by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now I do not believe that at least at the present point, Mr.  
Milosevic could be under any illusion based on what happened in 
Bosnia that -- from the point of view of the United States, anyway -- 
and what NATO has said that we will keep our word. And I think we 
did the right thing to give both parties the time they asked for at 
Rambouillet to try to figure out how to get to yes. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important thing here is how to get to yes. It's a good  
agreement. It will save lives, it will stabilize Kosovo, it will 
move us toward genuine autonomy, which was working there, I might 
add, before it was taken away a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Now on the ABM treaty. Let me say, doing the research on a  
missile defense system -- which is not a violation of the ABM 
treaty. It is theoretically possible that we could develop a 
missile defense system that, either by its nature or by where it 
was deployed, would be a violation of the ABM treaty. I personally 
have told the Russians over and over again, I have no intention of 
abrogating the ABM treaty. Anything we do, we will do together. 
</P>
<P>
	But the only threat we have -- excuse me, the threat the United  
States is likely to face 10 or 20 years from now from missiles 
coming in is by no means not just from North Korea. It is a fact 
that many countries with whom we have serious differences now are 
making vigorous efforts to either to build or to buy missiles with 
increasing ranges that go distances far beyond anything that would 
be necessary to protect their own territory. General Shelton has 
said that this missile defense is tough. It's like trying to hit a 
bullet with a bullet. That's what missile defense is. 
</P>
<P>
	I think if we believe that the technology might be there, we owe  
it to ourselves and to all of our allies, not just our old allies, 
but some of our post-Cold War allies, to try to develop that along 
with an adequate warning system, to try to prevent countries that 
are desperately trying to get missiles that they could not possibly 
need to defend their own territory, from ever taking offensive 
action against us or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	But I have no intention of supporting or initiating a unilateral  
abrogation of the ABM Treaty. I will not do that. We have been very 
candid with the Russians. We have talked to them about what we are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
	We have talked about what kinds of information we might share in  
the future. But I have never advocated, initiated, encouraged, 
sanctioned or blinked at the possibility that we could unilaterally 
abrogate the ABM Treaty. I personally would be very opposed to 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Prime Minister D'Alema, next Wednesday you will have to  
answer the questions by the members of parliament. Can you say as 
of today that your government will not have to revise the legal 
status of NATO bases? And I have question for President Clinton. 
What is your answer to the many members of the Italian parliament 
who are asking for a revision of the status of the NATO bases? 
</P>
<P>
	D'ALEMA: We very clearly stated that we intend to revise the  
rules and very seriously go through and check all the rules 
relating to military actions, exercises, training, movements, 
flights, in order to ensure high and certain standards of safety 
for the civilian population. So to some extent, this does not 
concern the legal standards of the military personnel, which as you 
know is regulated by the 1952 convention, which should be revised 
by all the countries that signed it if it is to be revised. But 
this is a way to respond to the need to reconcile the function of 
these military bases, which are not a concession to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	They are a tool to defend our own security and our common  
security. It is a way to reconcile this with the safety of our 
citizens. Which -- I'll discuss this, I don't know what you meant by 
``legal'' standards of position. Legally speaking, the United 
States have asked to abide by the convention, to implement the 
convention according to which military personnel working in 
military bases abroad in case of charges should be tried by the 
country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
	This convention applies to all countries. It is not an American  
privilege. For example, when the Italian pilots were charged for 
the Ramstadt accident, they were tried in Italy. We required that 
the 1952 convention be applied. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, (off--microphone) the United States have asked to  
(off--microphone) the 1952 convention for this Cavalese accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally the convention must be respected and complied with  
because it exists, but we will be much happier to comply with it if 
our citizens and our public opinions are reassured that by adopting 
those procedures justice is done. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: I'm not sure I have a great deal to add to what the  
prime minister said. I agree with what he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the question that many Italian officials are asking is,  
shouldn't there be an agreed-upon set of changes in the procedures 
for the movements and training of American military personnel to 
make them safer for the people of Italy, I agree with that. If the 
question is, should our very presence there be reexamined and the 
agreement under which Americans charged with offenses should be 
tried in American jurisdiction, my answer is just what the prime 
minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	I believe it serves both our interests. For example, when we  
were establishing our presence in Bosnia, I flew into Aviano into 
our base there. And I took a C-17, one of our supply planes, and 
flew into Bosnia. I also flew up to Hungary from there, the place 
where we had our base from which we moved our people in there. And 
it seemed to me that our presence there in that way furthered 
Italy's interests, Europe's interests, NATO's interests, and not 
simply American interests. That, of course, is a judgment that 
every country and all the decision makers make in a way on an 
annual basis they decide they continue to support these things. 
</P>
<P>
	But I believe the larger partnership has served the United  
States and Italy very well.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week generally  
higher Friday, with the key index in Tokyo surging 5 percent in the 
largest one-day gain this year on the back of an overnight rally on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 710.55  
points, closing the week at 14,894.00 points -- the highest closing 
level since Dec. 9, when the index finished at 14,931.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's point gain in the Nikkei was the largest for a  
single-day session since Oct. 7, when the average surged more than 
800 points. On Thursday, the average gained 13.09 points, or 0.09 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the Dow Jones industrial average in New York  
climbed 191.52 points to 9,467.70 at Thursday's close, boosted by 
benign economic data, strong retail sales reports and higher oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.94 yen in late  
afternoon trading, up 0.36 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but 
below its late New York level of 123.35 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Bank of Japan began guiding domestic  
short-term interest rates closer to zero, and the move was praised 
on Friday by top Japanese officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Friday a fall in long-term  
interest rates as a result of lower overnight call rates is not a 
minus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan said Friday the nation's overall wholesale  
price index for February was up 0.2 percent from January but was 
3.8 percent lower than the year-earlier month. The data fell within 
analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong also surged in reaction to gains on  
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 328.36 points, or 3.3 percent, closing at 
10,241.12. On Thursday, the index slipped 9.64 points.

	Brokers said the Hong Kong market was also boosted by news that  
Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. plans a cooperative agreement 
with Microsoft Corp. of the United States.

benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 6.73 points, or 0.3 percent, 
to 2,170.52.

	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mostly lower on profit-taking,  
though demand for blue chips pushed the main index higher. The 
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 15.73 points, or 
0.8 percent, to 2,013.41. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, helped by a  
strong trading day on Asian regional markets and Wall Street's 2.1 
percent gain on Thursday. The All Ordinaries Index closed at

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wishes Lewinsky 'Good Life' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that ``the  
American people are virtually screaming at us'' to get on with 
their business and put the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrelenting question of the Lewinsky affair that led to  
Clinton's impeachment came up at a joint press conference with 
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, and the president answered 
with yet another call for an end to it. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined comment on Ms. Lewinsky's two-hour television  
interview, saying he hadn't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I hope is that she will be permitted to go on with her  
life,'' Clinton said. ``And I hope it will be a good life....'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is that the American people are virtually  
screaming at us to get on with their lives and their business and 
to do their business,'' Clinton said. ``And I'm going to do my best 
to do that as well as I possibly can,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who was also asked how he felt about Ms. Lewinsky  
earning money from the affair, added: ``It's been a pretty tough 
thing for everybody involved, and I wish her well, I hope it works 
out well for her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dominant topic at the question-and-answer session with  
D'Alema was the acquittal of the Marine pilot whose jet snapped the 
cable on an Italian ski gondola a year ago, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian leader was adamant that those responsible for the  
disaster must be punished. ``We shall say we are satisfied when 
whoever is responsible for what happened is found guilty and 
punished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton declined comment on the acquittal, noting that other  
charges are still pending. He expressed profound American regrets, 
and promised to work to make sure that no such disaster happens 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	A secondary theme was their joint call for a peace settlement in  
the Serbian province of Kosovo, demanded by NATO, with a threat of 
force -- the timing of which is uncertain -- to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said NATO has not backed away from that threat against  
Serbia, insisting that the alliance was right to put it on hold 
while both sides ``try to figure out how to get to yes'' on a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders joined in urging Serbs and Kosovars to agree to  
the peace terms negotiated last month at internationally sponsored 
talks in Rambouillet, France. There is no deal; the talks recessed 
with both sides balking at some terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's fair to say that NATO threatens and backs  
away,'' Clinton said. ``We took military actions in Bosnia which 
led directly to peace. So I don't think (Yugoslav President 
Slobodan) Milosevic is under any illusion that if NATO has an 
action order outstanding, that we won't activate it.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Approves Capstar Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department on Friday approved  
Capstar Broadcasting Partners Inc. acquisition of Triathlon 
Broadcasting Co. after Capstar agreed to sell five radio stations 
in Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the divestiture, Capstar would have controlled more than  
45 percent of radio revenues in the Wichita market, the government 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capstar now owns three Wichita radio stations, KKRD-FM, KRZZ-FM  
and KNSS-AM, while Triathlon owns six, KZSN-FM, KRBB-RM, KEYN-FM, 
KWSJ-FM, KFH-AM and KQAM-AM. 
</P>
<P>
	Capstar agreed to sell KNSS-AM, KEYN-FM, KWSJ-FM, KFH-AM and  
KQAM-AM to Connoisseur Communications Partners, a Westport, 
Conn.-based radio operator. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission must still approve the  
transfer of Triathlon's broadcasting licenses to Capstar. 
</P>
<P>
	Capstar, based in Austin, Texas, owns about 300 stations in 75  
markets. The San Diego-based Triathlon owns 31 stations in six 
markets. Connoisseur owns 33 stations around the nation.

<HEADLINE> NFL Commissioner Considers Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON, Calif. (AP) -- With the NFL apparently on the verge of  
choosing a city for its 32nd franchise, commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
took a helicopter ride Friday with Hollywood deal-maker Michael 
Ovitz over one of three proposed sites for a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's group, which includes Tom Cruise and Magic Johnson,  
wants to build a hacienda-style stadium and shopping mall on a 
former garbage dump in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue, calling Ovitz a visionary, seemed impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner noted that the site is easily accessible from  
two freeways, that ``the almost 200 acres is a strong positive,'' 
and that many NFL owners find the proposed stadium ``compelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and his backers, another Los Angeles group seeking a team  
to play in a remodeled Coliseum, and a group in Houston are vying 
for the expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	The team owners meet the week of March 14 in Phoenix, and  
Tagliabue expects a city, but not necessarily an ownership group, 
to be selected for the new franchise at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum group, headed by developer Ed Roski Jr. and  
billionaire Eli Broad, was thought to hold an edge in the two-city, 
three-group competition, but Tagliabue expressed some concerns 
about the historic stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner said there are ``issues we are still  
addressing'' with the New Coliseum group, mentioning cost 
variables, parking, and what kind of public investment would be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think those issues are a lot more substantial with the  
Coliseum project than they are here. I think they are pretty well 
resolved here,'' Tagliabue said at a Carson civic center news 
conference following his flight over the area. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he also said nothing should be read into his first  
visit to Carson other than that he wanted to take a look at the 
site. He said he already was very familiar with the Coliseum, some 
15 miles up the freeway, and the proposed site in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz made a point of what probably is Los Angeles' strongest  
plus in the competition for a team -- the television market. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Los Angeles is the second largest TV market in the  
nation, with Houston No. 11, Ovitz added, ``I think LA has a big 
leg-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, a member of the  
league's expansion committee, said at the news conference that, if 
the owners do decide to award a franchise to the Los Angeles area 
without immediately choosing an owner, ``There might be additional 
numbers of people in Los Angeles interested (in owning a team); I'd 
be surprised if there weren't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other subjects, Tagliabue said he doesn't consider Al Davis'  
efforts to have Los Angeles declared the Raiders' domain ``any 
factor'' presently in the league's expansion plans; and that he 
disputes the suggestion that the league might build its own stadium 
and auction it and a team off to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a big football fan, said he wants an NFL team in Los  
Angeles because ``I'm tired of going to every other city. I want a 
Super Bowl in Los Angeles.''

<HEADLINE> Globe Making Progress on Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While the United States is working to avoid  
potential problems from the Year 2000 computer bug, it may not be 
immune from such troubles overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Failures by computers abroad could still cause disruptions here  
because countries the United States relies on for imports lag 
behind, administration officials told the Senate Special Committee 
on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Most industrialized nations are making progress, the officials  
said Friday. But developing countries are further behind, in many 
instances because of inattention to the problem, scarce resources 
and little time left to make critical repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be  
Y2K-related failures in every corner of the globe, some of which 
could prove harmful to U.S. interests,'' testified Jacquelyn 
Williams-Bridgers, the State Department inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem exists because many computers use two digits for  
dates, and the fear is that many systems will treat 2000 as 1900 
and malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas that could affect U.S. interests include foreign nuclear  
reactors and power grids, military early warning systems, trade, 
worldwide shipping, oil and gas sectors and air transport, said 
Lawrence Gershwin, a CIA officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``No country will be completely immune from failures,'' Gershwin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some European nations are lagging in Y2K work because of the  
attention they paid to converting to a new currency, the euro, on 
Jan. 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asia, the economic crisis interfered with repair efforts. But  
after getting off to a slow start, China is racing toward a March 
31 deadline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the possible fallout areas cited by Gershwin:  
</P>
<P>
	--Foreign strategic missile systems may experience  
computer-related problems. ``We do not see a problem in terms of 
Russian and Chinese missiles automatically being launched or 
nuclear weapons going off,'' he said, but Russians may have trouble 
with the early warning systems that monitor foreign missile 
launches. The Pentagon has invited Russian officials to monitor 
U.S. missile launch warning data from mid-December to mid-January 
to bolster their confidence that America is not attacking. 
</P>
<P>
	--The vulnerability of Soviet-designed nuclear reactors is  
unknown because records on the equipment used to make them are poor 
or nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Key countries that export oil to the United States -- including  
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico -- are behind on fixing 
the computer systems used in producing, processing and transporting 
the oil. 
</P>
<P>
	--World ports and the shipping industry have done little to  
prepare for Jan. 1, which could affect the flow of oil and other 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams-Bridgers, whose State Department office studied reports  
from 74 countries, said her analysis ``does not lend itself to much 
optimism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem areas include many Middle Eastern countries, which  
could face disruptions in the oil industry as well as in 
desalinization plants that could lead to unsafe water and health 
problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing countries are in worse shape, but the relatively low  
level of computerization in their utility, transportation and 
telecommunications industries could reduce the risk of prolonged 
problems, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Tuesday, the Senate panel issued a report outlining  
potential problems in health care, energy supply and government 
services unless computer systems are fixed by Dec. 31. But it 
emphasized that disruptions in vital services for most Americans 
would be minimal.

<HEADLINE> Co-Workers Will Split Powerball Pot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Two convenience store workers who fought  
over a $15.9 million Powerball jackpot will split the prize, 
according to court documents filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Schultz, 21, and Sarah Elder, 20, will split $10.6  
million after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were working together at a suburban Coastal Mart the  
night Schultz sold himself the winning ticket for the Feb. 10 
drawing. Elder challenged Schultz after he claimed the jackpot, 
saying she had paid 50 cents toward the $1 ticket and was due half 
the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa law prohibits people younger than 21 from buying lottery  
tickets but doesn't bar them from collecting jackpots if somebody 
else pays. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa Lottery asked a judge to decide whether the ticket had  
been sold illegally, but Elder withdrew her claim Thursday after 
reaching an agreement with Schultz. The lottery then withdrew its 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the best outcome happened,'' Schultz said. ``I think  
it's best for everybody and we're still friends, but we haven't 
really spoken since the night that I sold the ticket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elder would not comment, but her lawyer said she was pleased  
with the agreement.

	Dow Up More Than 200  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average rose 200 points  
this morning, following a 191.52-point gain yesterday. Just before 
noon EST, the Dow was up 212.98 to 9,680.38. Leading the Dow higher 
today was IBM, which was still gaining on yesterday's news that it 
agreed to sell Dell Computer Corp. $16 billion in parts over seven 
years. IBM was up 4 13/16 at 175 13/16. Twenty-nine of the 30 Dow 
components rose this morning, with Union Carbide being the only one 
to fall. Advancers led decliners on the NYSE 1,996-760. The Nasdaq 
Composite Index was up 38.31 to 2,331.20.

	Clinton Meeting With Italian Leader  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Italy's prime minister  
are meeting at the White House, a day after the European leader 
said he was ``really baffled'' that a military jury cleared Capt. 
Richard Ashby of 20 involuntary manslaughter charges. The meeting 
had been set up long ago, and it was mere coincidence that it came 
on the heels of Ashby's acquittal in connection with the cable-car 
accident more than one year ago. 

</P>
<P>
	Ashby Wrote Condolence Letter  
</P>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot acquitted of killing 20  
Europeans on a training flight said today that if the relatives 
would let him ``I'd just like to give them a hug. ... I don't know 
if they would. I don't know how to put it into words.'' Capt. 
Richard Ashby also told The Associated Press today that the crew 
wrote a condolence letter to the victims' families a day after the 
tragedy, but the Marine Corps wouldn't deliver it. A Marine public 
affairs officer told the crew: ``We represent the Marine Corps, not 
you.''

	Clinton Renews Lann Lee Fight  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today renewed an uphill  
battle to win Senate confirmation of Bill Lann Lee as the nation's 
top civil rights enforcer. Clinton gave a personal sendoff to Lee's 
nomination, meeting with him in the Oval Office along with civil 
rights leaders and supporters. Clinton appointed Lee, a former 
NAACP lawyer, as acting assistant attorney general for civil rights 
in December 1997, after it became clear the Senate Judiciary 
Committee would not send Lee's nomination forward. The move angered 
Senate Republicans who vowed to closely monitor Lee's work on 
affirmative action.

	Disputed Bosnian City To Be Shared  
</P>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- All of Bosnia's ethnic  
groups -- Serbs, Croats and Muslims -- will administer the disputed 
town of Brcko, international officials announced today, settling 
the only unresolved territorial question from the Bosnian war. The 
status of Brcko remained unresolved after the war ended in 1995 
partly because of its strategic importance. For the Croat-Muslim 
federation, Brcko is a key river port and rail junction linking it 
to Western Europe and a place where thousands of refugees want to 
return. Muslims also claim that giving it to Serbs would be a 
reward for genocide.

	Dole Pushes for Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole is pushing ethnic  
Albanian leaders today to immediately sign a peace plan for Kosovo, 
hinting that the deal must be settled before rebels can visit 
Washington. Dole, who was in the region at President Clinton's 
request, had to meet the ethnic Albanian leaders in the Macedonian 
capital of Skopje because he was blocked from entering neighboring 
Yugoslavia when the government denied him a visa. The Republican is 
a longtime ally of the ethnic Albanians.

bring the Lockerbie suspects to trial will top the agenda of 
today's talks, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.

	GREENBELT, Md. (AP) -- Journalist Larry Matthews is being  
sentenced today for downloading images of children in sexually 
explicit situations and sending them to other people online. 
Matthews says it was legitimate research for a story, but a judge 
says Matthews possessed and distributed banned materials, and his 
actions violated federal law. Matthews is the first journalist to 
be prosecuted for accessing child pornography, according to the 
Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

much borrowed money, the Post quoted NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue as saying in a letter to former Senator Robert Dole, who 
complained about the sale's delay.

<HEADLINE> First US Grand Prix May Be the Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The first Grand Prix in the United  
States in nine years may be the last chance for Formula One to grab 
a mass U.S. audience, the man behind the race said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony George, president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has  
committed millions of dollars to ``bring the circus to town'' at 
the world's most famous racetrack sometime in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	George expects that the popularity of motorsports in the United  
States will be enough to bring some 200,000 people through the 
gates and make the event financially profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	But the question remains whether Americans will take to a  
motorsport which is huge internationally but which does not even 
have an American driver, let alone an American team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure (it is) going to make a financial profit,'' George  
said of the 2000 race, the date of which is yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the only backlash may be if the event is not  
successful, I think that you will probably risk losing the American 
market altogether.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race in 2000 will be the first Formula One race in the  
United States since Ayrton Senna won at Phoenix in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Major changes are being made to Indianapolis facilities. The  
addition of a road course to the 2 1/2-mile oval will be the first 
major reconfiguration since it was built in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Grand Prix will be run on a permanent, 2.53-mile  
circuit to be built within the speedway, much to the approval of 
Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	George said the popularity of the race will not be determined  
until tickets go on sale. But market research suggests strong 
corporate and individual interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a buzz going on around this event,'' George said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere I go I'm stopped in shopping malls and restaurants,  
people recognize me and they are very excited about the Grand Prix 
coming. Even in areas where I didn't think would necessarily have 
an interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American audiences are used to wide-open fields and circuits  
designed to deliver maximum passing opportunities for drivers and 
excitement for spectators. It will take time for them to adapt to 
the subtleties of Formula One, George said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to take a fair amount of education,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly CART racing has had a better opportunity to be  
exposed to the American racing populace and I think Formula One has 
suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I believe there is a strong desire on (the part of) those  
who hold the rights for Formula One to improve on that situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What would help is for Formula One to become a much closer  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully the competition will continue to get better,''  
George said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing what American racing fans like, a lot of close  
competition and passing and whatnot, that maybe as F1 becomes more 
competitive and more manufacturers start coming in, maybe the 
racing will tighten up a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And greater American involvement in the international field  
would not go astray. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only an American driver but I think it would be a good to  
have an American team and American funding if possible to give it 
that added flavor,'' George said. ``I think that has significant 
ability to impact on the success long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART drivers have moved into Grand Prix racing -- notably Italian  
Alex Zanardi and Canadian Jacques Villeneuve. 
</P>
<P>
	George said Grand Prix will not be as profitable as either of  
the two other events held at the track, the Indianapolis 500 and 
the Brickyard 400, one of the five big events in American stock car 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Formula One currently has only one event scheduled in North  
America, the Canadian Grand Prix, which is scheduled in Montreal 
June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	While no date has yet been set, George said an autumn race run  
as separately as possible from the two other events would maximize 
the chances of success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think an autumn race would be ideal from a weather  
standpoint and from a timing standpoint so that we have ample 
spacing between our events. I don't know (if Eccelstone agrees).''

<HEADLINE> Maryland Team Accused of Religious Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- For the past five years, a Maryland minor  
league baseball team has rewarded church-going fans with a deep 
discount in park admission. 
</P>
<P>
	But an agnostic man who didn't get the discount last Easter says  
the practice violated his civil rights. A state agency agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Commission on Human Relations charged the  
Hagerstown Suns with religious discrimination for offering 
discounted family admission prices to fans who bring church 
bulletins to Sunday games. 
</P>
<P>
	The team violated the rights of Carl Silverman of Waynesboro,  
Pa., by refusing his family a discount because he didn't bring a 
church bulletin, the commission said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency alleges the team violated state and federal laws  
against discrimination on the basis of creed in places of public 
accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
	A conference was scheduled for next month in hopes of settling  
the dispute with the Suns, a Class A affiliate of the Toronto Blue 
Jays. A public hearing will be set if settlement efforts fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to settle this all along,'' said Silverman, an  
agnostic represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. ``It's 
basically up to the Suns. If they remain intransigent, we'll be 
having the hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An agnostic believes it is impossible to know whether God  
exists. Silverman and his lawyer, Michael Berman, have asked the 
Suns to expand the promotion to include discounts for people 
carrying evidence of membership in secular charitable 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns general manager David Blenckstone said the club wants to  
continue the popular promotion, which allows families of up to six 
people entry for a group price of $6 with a church bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU also has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in  
Baltimore seeking to stop the promotion. The lawsuit is on hold 
pending the outcome of the state dispute.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Faces Big Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Baffert knows all about demanding  
races, and he's got one in the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the 5-year-old gray trained by Baffert, will face  
Puerto Madero and Free House in an intriguing race spiced with 
subplots. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who saddled the last two Kentucky Derby winners, calls  
this ``probably the toughest horse race I've ever been involved 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, goes  
into Saturday's race as a bit of a mystery horse. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to come from far behind to win the Jan. 10 San Pasqual at  
Santa Anita, then came up short in the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream 
on Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm finished third in that race, 5 1/4 lengths behind  
Puerto Madero, the Chilean import. So the 1 1/4-mile Big 'Cap provides 
a quick rematch between those two. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm's jockey, Gary Stevens, doesn't want his horse to  
lag behind as he did in the last two races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been focusing on getting him interested early,'' Stevens  
said. ``He's going to have to be a lot closer on Saturday. He's 
going to have to run the best race of his life to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always proven to us that he's a very special horse.''  
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the high weight at 124 pounds, is 12-7-1 in 21  
starts and is the richest active horse, with $6.7 million in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero is trained by Richard Mandella, who also will send  
Event of the Year to the post. Mandella, going for an unprecedented 
third straight Big 'Cap win, didn't enter last year's champion, 
Malek, instead saving the horse for the Dubai World Cup late this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandella earlier planned to also race Puerto Madero next in  
Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just came out of the Donn so well that he helped us make up  
our minds to run in both the Big 'Cap and at Dubai,'' Mandella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, who will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux and carry  
122, is 3-2-0 in six U.S. races. His overall record is 11-3-0 in 16 
starts, with earnings of $795,690. 
</P>
<P>
	The race also renews the Silver Charm-Free House rivalry. Free  
House has won two of their seven career meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the Santa Anita Derby and San Felipe Stakes two years  
ago, Free House is coming off a neck victory over Malek in the San 
Antonio Handicap on Feb. 7. He will carry 1234 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran great in the San Antonio, and he's come back to work in  
great fashion,'' rider Chris McCarron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another twist is provided by Event of the Year, a 4-year-old who  
was the early Kentucky Derby favorite in 1998 until he fractured a 
knee two weeks before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Event of the Year, who will have Corey Nakatani up and will  
carry 119, won the Strub Stakes at Santa Anita in his third start 
back from the injury. He is 5-1-1 in seven career races. 
</P>
<P>
	So Mandella, who will send out one-third of the six-horse field,  
would appear to have a good shot at winning the Big 'Cap again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a dream come true,'' he said. ``I have a hard time  
believing I've won two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field are Dr Fong, who raced in Europe and has run  
three times in the United States, including finishing second in the 
Strub; and Sidon, who finished first in the 1998 Chilean Derby but 
was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Solis will ride Dr Fong, 117; and Eddie Delahoussaye will  
be on Sidon, 114.

<HEADLINE> NASA Launches Star Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A telescope designed to  
shed light on the history of star formation ran into trouble today 
soon after its launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer, better known as Wire, began to  
experience problems keeping itself stable shortly after launch 
Thursday night, NASA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not known at this time what specifically caused the  
orientation malfunction on the spacecraft and a further 
investigation, now under way, is being done to assess the 
problem,'' a NASA statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was carried into space aboard a Pegasus-XL rocket  
Thursday. The spacecraft was to be inserted into an orbit 340 miles 
high, circling the Earth every 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The space agency designed the four-month mission to help  
scientists understand how and when galaxies formed, and the history 
of star formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire principal investigator Perry Hacking said the mission's  
science team was to measure how densely filled the universe has 
been with star-forming galaxies during its history and how quickly 
those galaxies have been forming stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wire also will conduct a search for powerful, dusty quasars in  
the very early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. If found in 
significant numbers, these quasars will carry strong implications 
about the age and structure of our universe,'' Hacking said.

<HEADLINE> Norman Learning Again About Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Greg Norman likes to say he has the left shoulder  
of a 24-year-old after innovative surgery. What he has found out 
since returning to golf after a seven-month layoff is that he has 
the mind of a 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like learning everything all over again,'' Norman said  
Friday after another suspect round in the Doral-Ryder Open left 
open the possibility of taking the weekend off. ``Patience, control 
... all those things I learned growing up I've got to teach myself 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Physically, Norman looks as fit as ever. He gets tremendous  
length off the tee and remains one of the best drivers when his 
game is on. 
</P>
<P>
	But that hasn't always been the case.  
</P>
<P>
	He took Tiger Woods to the 18th hole in a riveting match during  
the Presidents Cup, then collapsed in the Match Play Championship 
against Eduardo Romero, blowing a 3-up lead with five holes to play 
and losing on the third extra hole. 
</P>
<P>
	He nearly won the Australian Masters last month, losing to Craig  
Spence by a birdie on the 72nd hole, but struggled on a Doral Golf 
Resort course that he owns, having won three times this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman, 44, had five bogeys in his round of 73 on Friday and was  
at even-par 144, nine strokes behind Greg Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy to get across the line,'' Norman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Norman doesn't profess to be overly frustrated, especially  
considering Doral is the first stroke-play event on the PGA Tour 
since he missed the cut in the Masters last year. Still, he feigned 
slamming his club into the turf when a short iron was 60 feet off 
target on Thursday, and has shown more emotion than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge now is to be patient, one of the things he first  
learned when he started playing golf in Australia at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either there or it's not,'' he said of his game. ``I'm  
letting myself get back into it without forcing myself back into 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited his match against Romero as a case study. Having  
dispatched John Cook in the first round, Norman was cruising 
against the Argentine when he missed short birdie putts on the 14th 
and 17th holes. Romero squared the match on the 18th with a 7-iron 
into a foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two years earlier, maybe I've got more of a kill,'' Norman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-month layoff was his longest since he turned  
professional in 1976. He says he missed the competition, but could 
easily walk away without regrets if he no longer felt compelled to 
compete. That won't be determined quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where am I? On the road to recovery,'' Norman said. ``Where am  
I going? Time will tell.''

<HEADLINE> Atler Wins Three Gymnastics Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Former U.S. all-around champion  
Vanessa Atler won three individual event titles Friday night to 
lead after the preliminary round of the American Cup gymnastics 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Atler won individual titles with scores of 9.8 on the balance  
beam and floor exercise and 9.762 in the vault. Her four-event 
total of 38.337 was nearly a half-point better than Ukraine's 
Viktoria Karpenko, the defending American Cup champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really good. I feel more improved this year,'' said  
Atler, who shared the 1997 national championship with Kristy 
Powell. ``I know Karpenko is a little hurt, and I'm sure she'll 
come back tomorrow and do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karpenko finished with 37.875 points, with Italy's Adriana  
Crisci third at 37.762. American Jennie Thompson won the uneven 
bars title with a 9.525 score, placing fourth overall at 37.450. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited to make finals,'' Thompson said. ``It was  
my goal coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top eight competitors advanced to Saturday's all-around  
final, with a maximum of two competitors per country.

<HEADLINE> IOC Eyes Reform Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC is set to appoint a reform panel including  
outside experts but is backing off a plan to strip rank-and-file 
members of voting for Olympic cities. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee leaders told The Associated  
Press that the reform commission will be proposed at the special 
general assembly March 17-18 in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will consider ways of changing the structure and  
operations of the IOC, setting the stage for what could be the 
biggest changes in the body's 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to have a fresh look at the way the IOC  
functions,'' executive board member Jacques Rogge said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge also confirmed the executive board was changing plans for  
the selection of the 2006 Winter Games site, which had been 
criticized by a large percentage of members. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the board wanted a small group to pick the winner.  
But after fierce opposition from the membership, the board now 
would propose that the general assembly select the winner under 
tight controls after the smaller group pared the six-city field to 
two finalists, Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has been under tremendous pressure, from within and  
without, to enact reforms in the wake of the Salt Lake City 
corruption scandal -- the biggest crisis in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the internal investigation into the final group of 19  
members implicated in the scandal won't be concluded until sometime 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings had been expected to be announced by the end of  
this week, but Rogge -- a member of the six-man hoc inquiry 
commission -- said the panel's report was still being finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long report, a very substantial report with a lot of  
information,'' he said in a telephone interview from Belgium. ``I 
personally don't expect any news before the beginning or middle of 
next week. The end of next week is also possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel can recommend expulsions, exonerations or warnings.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, nine members have resigned or been ousted following  
allegations they received cash payments or other improper 
inducements during Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions will go to the full IOC session, where a  
two-thirds vote is required for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	The watershed meeting also will appoint an ethics committee to  
police a new code-of-conduct for IOC members, and Rogge said 
outside members would be represented on both the ethics committee 
and the reform panel. 
</P>
<P>
	While specific reform proposals aren't expected to be discussed  
at the March assembly, officials said the IOC is already studying 
fundamental structural changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible reforms include altering the way IOC members are  
selected. Traditionally, members are hand picked by the IOC 
president and appointed to virtual life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. ethics panel, headed by former Senate Majority Leader  
George Mitchell, recommended this week that IOC members be elected 
by national Olympic committees and other sports bodies and 
subjected to term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell panel also recommended the IOC open its books to  
outside audits and release the financial figures to the public at 
least once a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever changes the reform commission recommends, the final  
decisions will be up to the full IOC, Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Reedie, an IOC member from Britain, said fundamental  
reforms were paramount in the wake of the scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been caught with your pants down, changes seem  
inevitable,'' he said. ``The more secret, elitist and private you 
make the organization, the more suspicion you create in people's 
minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and his executive board  
proposed in January new bidding and selection procedures for the 
2006 games, including a ban on member visits to the six European 
candidate cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But members rebelled against the proposal to have a 15-member  
body select the host city. Many members, whose primary duty is 
choosing host cities, protested that the entire assembly was being 
branded corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he and the majority of the executive board now  
support a new proposal. While the ban on visits would remain in 
place, the 15-member panel would choose two finalists and let the 
entire membership select the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the process should take place behind closed doors on  
the same day and in the same building, with bid city officials 
barred from contact with the selectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be like the selection of a pope: you lock up all the  
cardinals, no one comes in or out, and you wait for the white smoke 
to come out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said the possibility of corruption is reduced by having  
more, rather than fewer, people involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you only have a small number deciding, there is far more  
possibility that the candidate cities could try and influence them 
very heavily,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge also said a small electoral panel lacks the universality  
and geographical representation of the general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2006 site is scheduled to be chosen at the IOC session in  
Seoul, South Korea, in June. The candidates are Helsinki, Finland; 
Klagenfurt, Austria; Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; Poprad-Tatry, 
Slovakia; and Zakopane, Poland.

</P>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Gordon C. McKibben, a retired journalist  
for The Boston Globe, The Wall Street Journal and Business Week, 
died Wednesday of cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>

ombudsman for the Globe. He worked several years for The Wall 
Street Journal in Los Angeles, and then 17 years for Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe hired him as business editor in 1980, and he remade  
the newspaper's financial section and expanded its staff and 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Later he went to London as European correspondent, and then  
returned to Boston as ombudsman, representing readers and writing a 
biweekly column on the newspaper's operations. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF, Brazil Discuss Rescue Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --The International Monetary Fund and Brazil  
concluded negotiations Friday on revising an agreement for a $41.5 
billion financial rescue package to help the country confront its 
currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian participants in the talks were returning home this  
week to review terms with senior officials and details probably 
will be announced Monday, the IMF said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the 24-member IMF executive board gives its approval, the  
way is expected to be clear for Brazil to receive the second 
installment of $9 billion from the package provided by the IMF and 
20 bilateral lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil received the first payment of $9.5 billion in December  
when the package was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The original loan program, and the fiscal and monetary policies  
it required, had to be revamped after the country's currency, the 
real, was floated in January. Since then the real has lost 41 
percent of its value against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian government had spent billions of dollars from  
reserves trying to keep the real's value within a specific range 
before deciding on the float. 
</P>
<P>
	The inability to keep the real steady has led to higher interest  
rates, a larger government budget deficit and growing inflation, 
all of which have forced Brazil to revise its IMF-approved economic 
policies and goals.

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Industry Begins Lobbying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharon Cranford, herself a lobbyist, isn't  
surprised that the companies mailing out millions of sweepstakes 
promotions have begun a high-powered lobbying campaign to influence 
a bill that would regulate the contests. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Cranford, of Gaithersburg, Md., is far more interested  
in the bill succeeding. Her mother is among the older Americans 
whose savings evaporated as she bought magazines and merchandise in 
pursuit of the sweepstakes prize she never won. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cranford has spoken about her mother with the Senate  
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the panel that is 
investigating the promotions and holding hearings Monday and 
Tuesday. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the committee chair, is chief 
sponsor of the bill that would provide the first federal regulation 
of the sweepstakes industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, which says it has reformed its practices  
voluntarily, is warily watching Collins' investigation and 
legislation, which would end come-ons such as ``You're our newest 
winner!'' sent to people who haven't won anything. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbying effort is necessary to ensure that new legislation  
does not include ``specific requirements that ... would kill 
legitimate sweepstakes,'' said Richard Barton of the Direct 
Marketing Association, which represents the major companies using 
sweepstakes to promote products. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cranford, whose mother spent more than $40,000 for  
sweepstakes-related promotions, was receiving three copies of 
Reader's Digest among more than 50 magazines a month -- even 
Playboy. After arranging for her mother's mail to be delivered to 
her, Ms. Cranford tried to have her mother's name deleted from 
promotional mailing lists and was told it would take months. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother said she was afraid of outliving her money and  
thought if she played sweepstakes, she'd win and she'd be OK,'' Ms. 
Cranford said. ``She never won anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to three trade organizations, the campaign includes  
the prominent lobbying firms of Timmons and Co. and The Duberstein 
Group and the top law firms of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers and Akin, Gump, 
Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from those prominent Washington firms who are helping  
the industry include Dan Meyer, chief of staff to Newt Gingrich 
when he was House speaker; Meyer's boss, Kenneth Duberstein, chief 
of staff for President Bush; Steven Ross of Akin, Gump, former 
chief House counsel under the Democrats; A.B. Culvahouse, managing 
partner of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers and White House counsel in the Reagan 
administration, and Tom Korologos of Timmons, one of the most 
prominent Washington lobbyists and a onetime Nixon administration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goodness, I had no idea there were that many,'' Collins  
said when a list of the lobbyists was read to her. ``To me, it 
shows how much money is at stake and how profitable the sweepstakes 
business is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Key provisions of Collins' bill also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Prohibit mailings that indicate promotions are endorsed by the  
government. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require a statement that no purchase is necessary to enter the  
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bar any suggestion that a purchase will give an entry priority.  
</P>
<P>
	--Compel a marketer to clearly state the odds of winning.  
</P>
<P>
	--Impose hefty fines for violations.  
</P>
<P>
	Barton, of the direct marketing trade group, said Collins'  
current proposal is ``something we can work with. I can't say we're 
worried or not worried. It's too early to comment on a specific 
bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, this is a watershed year for the sweepstakes  
business,'' said Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for American Family 
Publishers, the company that uses Ed McMahon and Dick Clark in its 
mailings. ``We've broken from the pack and made very sweeping 
changes in our practices. We made very forward-looking agreements 
with attorneys general in 35 states and the District of Columbia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State attorneys general have led the way in investigating  
sweepstakes companies. In addition to the multistate settlement, 
other states are pursuing their own cases to force an end to 
deceptive practices. 
</P>
<P>
	American Family Publishers has eliminated potentially deceptive  
language, included the odds of winning in the official rules, made 
clear that no purchase is needed to enter, avoided language that 
falsely tells a recipient he or she has won a prize and cut off 
business with customers who exhibit compulsive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Irving, director of consumer affairs for Publishers'  
Clearinghouse, said his company supports national standards for the 
sweepstakes industry, but needs the lobbying effort ``to allow us 
to tell the good story we have and advise us how to most 
effectively tell that story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irving ticked off a list of reforms similar to those of American  
Family Publishers, predicting that once the committee ``hears our 
stories, they will proceed in a manner fair to all involved.''

<HEADLINE> Charges in Starbucks' Triple Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man accused of shooting an off-duty police  
officer in a neighboring county was charged Friday with the brutal 
murders of three young employees of a Starbucks coffee shop here 20 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individual responsible has been charged and is going to be  
brought to justice,'' District of Columbia Police Chief Charles 
Ramsey said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey identified the suspect as Carl Derek Havord Cooper, 29,  
of Washington. The chief said the slayings occurred during a 
botched pre-dawn robbery at the Starbucks shop in upper Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper was charged with first-degree felony murder while armed  
for each of the three murders, said U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis. If 
convicted, he could face a sentence of life imprisonment without 
the possibility of parole, she said. The District of Columbia does 
not have capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper is being held in Prince George's County, Md., where he  
faces attempted murder charges in a separate case. Prince George's 
County police arrested him Tuesday and subsequently charged him 
with the wounding of an off-duty police officer in August 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey said Cooper has been a suspect in the Prince George's  
assault case since last summer and in the Starbucks slayings since 
November 1997, four months after the triple murder occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief would not describe the evidence against Cooper but  
said he is sure police have the right person based on ``the 
totality of all the evidence we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said two guns were used in the fatal shootings of  
Emory Allen Evans, 25, Mary Caitrin Mahoney, 24, and Aaron David 
Goodrich, 18, on July 6, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Homicide detective Tony Patterson said authorities believe  
Cooper fired both of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that it was a lone gunman -- that he was the only  
gunman,'' Patterson said, adding that police have not recovered the 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A second man, Keith Covington, 32, was questioned in the case  
and released earlier Friday without being charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Covington told reporters that during 15 hours of questioning by  
police and FBI agents he repeatedly denied any involvement in the 
Starbucks slayings and at least three other crimes in which Cooper 
had alleged he was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Covington acknowledged that he knew Evans, one of the victims,  
and that he grew up near Cooper. That made him an easy target for 
the false accusations, Covington said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever set it up, they set me up good,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey said he hoped Friday's arrest would bring some peace of  
mind to the victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, that will be difficult.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there will ever be closure,'' said Fran Block,  
Goodrich's mother. ``Aaron's never coming back.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Moves To Create 770,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Trying to alleviate record high joblessness,  
Japan's Cabinet endorsed a plan Friday to create 770,000 new jobs 
in areas ranging from multimedia to care for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, the government hopes to see new jobs added in  
the nation's four most promising areas -- health and welfare, 
information and telecommunications, housing, and tourism -- in which 
jobs are most likely generated, according to a spokesman at the 
Prime Minister's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is fighting the effects of its worst recession since the  
end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the government announced that Japan's unemployment  
rate for January remained at a record high 4.4 percent for the 
third month in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan approved Tuesday, about 100,000 jobs would be  
created in the health and welfare field in fiscal 1999, beginning 
April 1, through a series of measures to be implemented using the 
fiscal 1999 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for an increase in the number of home helpers and  
promotion of the development of welfare facilities for the elderly. 
The government also plans to seek ways to help private companies 
enter the nursing care business and improve child care services. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also hopes to generate 180,000 other new jobs in  
the information and telecommunications industry in fiscal 1999 and 
fiscal 2000 by expanding Internet and other multimedia businesses 
and easing industry regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400,000 jobs would be created in the housing field through  
a series of measures to provide incentives to build new homes, the 
plan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 90,000 other jobs would be created in tourism through  
deregulation in the aviation industry, according to the plan.

<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A man complaining that someone stole  
his garden hose shot and killed a fellow tenant at a condominium 
association meeting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Manuel Rodriguez, 55, barged into the meeting Thursday  
night, according to neighbors. He pulled a gun and fired several 
shots, killing his 66-year-old neighbor, Arsenio Arabitg, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez then walked next door to the building he lived in,  
fired another shot into the air and ranted some more. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was yelling, saying, `I don't care! He bothered  
everyone!''' said Jean Salas, a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Rodriquez complained about a missing garden hose  
and apparently had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer using a cellular phone talked Rodriguez out of  
the apartment. He was charged with murder and other offenses.

<HEADLINE>  Albright Urges Peace in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
urged Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to do all he can to keep 
East Timor from erupting in bloodshed if the territory chooses 
independence. ``Violence is the enemy of democracy, security and 
prosperity,'' she said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not walk away,'' Habibie responded, according to a  
senior U.S. official present at their two-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia was the last stop for Albright on a weeklong Asian  
tour that included visits to Thailand and China. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright urged Indonesians to stay on the path of democracy, a  
route they took last May with the fall of the Suharto regime. Since 
then, the Asian financial crisis has rocked the country 
economically and socially with Christians and Muslims fighting and 
demonstrations by antigovernment students. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Habibie's government has begun financial  
reforms and has scheduled the country's first democratic elections 
in more than 40 years. Albright urged that elections be ``free, 
fair and open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Indonesia has the chance for a new birth in freedom,'' she  
said, speaking to some 300 civic leaders at a hotel. ``And you have 
the opportunity to create, in a distinct Indonesian way, not 
partial democracy or sham democracy, but real democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing Habibie, Albright met with Jose Alexandre  
``Xanana'' Gusmao, a separatist East Timorese rebel leader under 
house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	To deal with the East Timor question, Gusmao suggested that  
elections be held to select representatives from about a dozen 
districts. They would then decide whether to accept an autonomy 
plan, now being negotiated with the help of the United Nations, 
according to the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie said earlier this year that East Timor could become  
independent if a majority of its people reject autonomy. But the 
government ruled out holding a referendum, fearing it could lead to 
more violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever mechanism is selected for gauging public opinion,  
Gusmao and Albright agreed, an international peacekeeping presence 
would likely be needed to ensure disarmament and to train new 
security forces to replace the Indonesian military, the official 
said, adding that the force would not necessarily be run by the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao and Albright met at the Indonesian foreign ministry to  
avoid dozens of East Timorese activists and journalists gathered 
outside the small home in central Jakarta where he has been held 
under house arrest since January. 
</P>
<P>
	Jailed in 1992 for leading separatists seeking independence for  
East Timor, Gusmao asked Albright to press the government to 
release him and dozens of other political prisoners, some of whom 
have been held for decades and are now in their 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not mentioning Gusmao specifically, Albright called for  
the release of political prisoners during her meetings with 
Habibie, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Justice Minister Muladi, 
U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spoke specifically about the importance of human rights and  
allowing people the possibility of participating within the various 
democratic processes,'' Albright said during a joint news 
conference with Alatas at the presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie's government has suggested Gusmao could be released as  
part of a plan to ease tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	While saying Habibie has brought a '' huge improvement'' in  
human rights, Albright urged the government to further investigate 
alleged abuses by the military. Indonesian leaders could boost 
confidence in the government by using ``the military and police to 
preserve stability without engaging in human rights abuses that 
serve over time to provoke new instability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also urged the Indonesian government to stick with economic  
reforms the International Monetary Fund required as part of a $43 
billion bailout.

<HEADLINE> Starr To Object to McDougal Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's office will object if  
Susan McDougal calls Monica Lewinsky to the stand in an attempt to 
prove that the independent prosecutor browbeats people unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. McDougal's lawyers claim Ms. Lewinsky may be important  
to her defense against charges she refused to answer questions 
before a grand jury empaneled by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will attempt to show a pattern by this guy ... Starr and  
his office ... to go through and wreak havoc in people's lives and 
just make them so miserable and threaten them so badly and scare 
them so much that they will say whatever it is he wants them to 
say,'' said Mark Geragos of Los Angeles, a lawyer for Mrs. 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Hickman Ewing Jr. said testimony from  
the former White House intern would be irrelevant to the case 
against Mrs. McDougal, who is going on trial next week for criminal 
contempt and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously from our standpoint, we want to keep the jury  
focused on the real issues of the trial,'' Ewing said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jurors were investigating whether Mrs. McDougal had  
improper financial dealings with President Clinton and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas. McDougal and the 
Clintons were business partners in the failed real estate 
development known as Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has said she refused to answer the questions  
because she believes Starr would twist her words to suit his 
purposes and may charge her with perjury if he doesn't get the 
testimony he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers were considering calling Ms. Lewinsky to testify  
about her experiences with Starr. Ms. Lewinsky has described one of 
Starr's prosecutors as a ``revolting specimen of humanity'' and 
another as a ``pit-bull terrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, a federal judge in the case said he would bar  
evidence regarding any alleged ``prosecutorial vindictiveness.'' 
Whether his ruling pertained to Ms. Lewinsky he did not say. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. also said he may allow  
evidence that the government asked Mrs. McDougal to lie, as she 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is also considering calling Julie Hiatt Steele, who  
was charged in Starr's investigation with obstruction of justice 
and making a false statement. The charges stem from her grand jury 
testimony that cast doubt on her former friend Kathleen's Willey's 
allegation that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele and her attorney also have been critical of Starr.

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Nine months after missing out on a chance to  
win the heavyweight title, the World Boxing Association's 
top-ranked contender returns to the ring at the University of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Akinwande of Britain will take on Reynaldo Minus on  
Saturday night at the Sports Pavilion on the university's 
Minneapolis campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Akinwande was scheduled to fight WBA and International Boxing  
Federation champion Evander Holyfield on June 6, 1998, but pulled 
out after testing positive for hepatitis-B. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Nigeria who fights out of Orlando, Fla., Akinwande  
is ranked sixth by the IBF. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the fight card is Will Grigsby, the IBF's junior  
flyweight champion, who will defend his title against Carmelo 
Caseres of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby won the title in December by beating Ratanopol Vorapin  
of Thailand in a 12-round decision. The Grigsby-Caseres bout is 
scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kjus Clinches Downhill World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KVITFJELL, Norway (AP) -- Kjetil Aamodt of Norway appeared to  
close in on the men's overall World Cup title today when he 
finished third in a downhill while one of his chief rivals, Hermann 
Maier of Austria, finished 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasse Kjus, another Norwegian, clinched the men's downill title  
for the season with a fourth-place finish, and he moved past Maier 
into second place in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian Andreas Schifferer won the race in 1:46.36, one tenth  
of a second ahead of teammate Stephan Eberharter and 0.32 ahead of 
Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier left the stadium without saying a word.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had better skis than Maier, and he didn't ski very well  
either. If you don't have good skis, you've got no chance,'' Aamodt 
said. The Norwegian said there was a good chance that Maier and 
Kjus could catch him in the downhill and Super-G on Saturday and 
Sunday at Kvitfjell. 
</P>
<P>
	With his fourth place finish, Kjus assured himself the downhill  
World Cup with 580 points, 201 points ahead of Austrian Werner 
Franz who finished ninth in 1:47.42 with two downhill competitions 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Aamodt increased his overall lead and has 1,190 points,  
61 points ahead of Kjus.

<HEADLINE> Poland Amends Secret Files Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Parliament approved minor changes Friday  
to a long-debated law that would for the first time allow victims 
of communist-era repression to see their secret police files. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was passed in September following a decade of debate  
over whether opening old files from the 1944-89 communist regime 
would help or harm the country's efforts to deal with the painful 
decades of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist, vetoed the  
law Dec. 12, saying it would give too much power to an institute 
created by the law to manage the files. And he said all Poles, not 
only victims of totalitarian regimes, should be able to see their 
files. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ruling Solidarity-led coalition was able to overrule the  
veto by promising amendments that could give opposition more say in 
appointing members of the Institute of National Remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the powerful lower chamber, or Sejm, voted that  
institute members would be appointed by a 60-percent majority vote 
in parliament instead of simple majority. The Sejm also reduced the 
term of the institute's head from seven to five years. The 
amendments require approval by the Senate and the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, the institute will be charged not only with  
managing communist-era files, but also those relating to Stalinist 
and Nazi crimes. Besides making files available to victims, the 
institute also is empowered to launch investigations, which could 
lead to trials into cases of political persecution and murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of disclosing the past has divided Poles along  
political lines. The former communists are at the vanguard of the 
leftist political parties that oppose dredging up the past, arguing 
that the files are incomplete and full of misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, figures from the powerful Solidarity movement that  
overthrew communism, including former President Lech Walesa, say 
the past must be confronted, even if that means government 
officials and others are victimized in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bill that requires government officials to declare  
whether they ever worked for or collaborated with the former 
security service went into effect in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's first attempt to open secret files was in 1992 by the  
rightist government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski. But after 
lists of alleged secret agents were leaked, the government was 
toppled on a no-confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
	During the communist era, the secret police used informers to  
monitor virtually all aspects of daily life and routinely cracked 
down on people suspected of anti-government activism. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusations of who may have collaborated in the past continue to  
hound people in all areas of Polish society, including top 
government officials.

<HEADLINE> Controversy Surrounds Mass. HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- With complaints from senior citizens rising,  
Massachusetts' secretary of state is questioning whether some of 
the state's HMOs ought to be stripped of their nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State William Galvin is attempting to pressure  
health maintenance organizations into restoring generous 
prescription drug benefits. On Thursday, he gave HMOs in the state 
three weeks to prove their nonprofit status either by letter or in 
a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Galvin admits his power is limited. But he says he's acting  
because thousands of Medicare HMO patients are facing higher costs 
for prescription drug coverage after a recent federal court 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been many hardships here. ... If these entities  
want to behave like businesses, we should treat them like 
businesses,'' Galvin said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	To pressure insurers, Galvin could declare the HMOs weren't  
operating within their state charters or question if their 
documents were filed correctly. Then, he said, he could refer the 
case to the state attorney general, who could seek a court order 
blocking the companies from doing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the attorney general's office said they were more  
interested in other solutions to the problem. And HMOs immediately 
questioned Galvin's power to do anything -- and whether it could 
ultimately affect their tax status. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the secretary's frustration is misplaced. He's  
confusing the issues,'' said Karen Ignagni, president of the 
American Association of Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignagni said the problem is that Medicare's reimbursements to  
HMOs aren't keeping pace with other parts of the Medicare program, 
which serves the disabled and people 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Galvin needed to ``confront the real world challenge of  
payment adequacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Sager, a professor at the Boston University School of  
Public Health who is a national expert on health care finance, also 
had questions about Galvin's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of doing anything that would give us more for-profit  
HMOs is dangerous,'' he said. Sager said Galvin was ``focusing on 
the symptom, not the cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real problems, he said, include the rising costs of  
medications and the failure of the market to keep those prices 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy has erupted in a state where, until recently,  
elderly people were better off than around the country in terms of 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts was the only state in the nation requiring its  
Medicare HMOs to offer at least one plan that provided unlimited 
prescription drug coverage. But a federal judge in Boston ruled in 
October that the HMOs didn't have to provide the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMOs have provided limited drug benefits and special plans  
to help lower-income people pay for their drugs. But activists say 
the elderly are still hurting. And 10,000 will end up paying more 
by some amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Mula, 72, of Hudson said he expected to spend $1,700 more  
this year on prescription drugs for his wife Isabelle, who has 
congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel the United States government, the drug industry and the  
medical industry are not taking care of their seniors,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Lite Beer Ads Revive Bar Banter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Miller Brewing Co. has recruited a new cast of  
retired sports stars and other celebrities for an advertising 
campaign recreating mock barroom debates about why they like its 
flagship Miller Lite beer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the arguments won't be about whether the beer tastes great  
or is less filling this time. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ads starting today former pros like newly-elected  
baseball Hall of Famers George Brett and Robin Yount will be at 
odds over why they like Lite's taste -- the choice hops or the 
smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health advocates are already warning that using sports  
heroes and other celebrities in beer ads will send the wrong 
message to youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miller officials say the campaign is aimed at adults.  
</P>
<P>
	The new campaign comes as the Milwaukee-based brewer tries to  
reverse trends that saw Miller Lite sales volume fall an estimated 
1.8 percent last year and Anheuser-Busch Inc.'s Bud Light widen its 
lead in the light beer category. 
</P>
<P>
	Bud Light displaced longtime leader Miller Lite as the  
top-selling light beer in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ads from the Fallon McElligott replace the  
Minneapolis-based ad agency's work over the past two years that was 
designed to give Miller Lite a hipper image with young adults, but 
was widely criticized as bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
	That campaign debuted in 1997 introduced by ``Dick,'' a  
fictional advertising executive who made ads that showed a naked 
man creep across a wheat field, a magician whose trick went 
embarrassingly awry and cowboy beer drinkers shuffling to the rest 
room to the tune ``Adios Amigo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller officials say the campaign boosted awareness of the  
brand, but didn't put enough emphasis on the beer itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Rooney, vice president of marketing for Miller, said the  
company felt having ``friends in a bar having an argument over the 
product'' was the perfect way to refocus on the beer. 
</P>
<P>
	But it couldn't lift the old ``tastes great-less filling''  
debate from its campaign that ran from the mid-1970s through the 
1980s because rivals have appeared since then that can also make 
the less filling claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ads emphasize Miller Lite's distinct taste with the  
theme ``The great taste of a true pilsner beer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one ad, Brett and Yount exchange jibes over who got the  
bigger vote in the Hall of Fame election (Brett) and who won more 
Most Valuable Player awards (Yount). Brett likes Lite's smoothness 
while Yount is a hops fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired relief pitchers Mitch Williams and Lee Smith say in  
their ad they don't agree on much. Smith favors blue darts, beer in 
cans and Lite's hops, while Williams likes red darts, bottled beer 
and Lite's smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ads without retired sports stars include one with supermodel  
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and sportswriter Rick Reilly of Sports 
Illustrated and another with the musical group Earth Wind and Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish-language ads have also been created featuring actor Eric  
Estrada, soap star Kate Castillo and retired baseball stars Tony 
Perez and Ed Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Conti, executive director of the Marin Institute for the  
Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems in San Rafael, 
Calif., said using sports figures and other celebrities in beer ads 
is unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
	She said young people often view athletes as role models and  
their appearance in ads may glamorize drinking for youngsters. 
``Drinking Miller had nothing to do with their athletic 
performance,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	George Hacker, head of the alcohol policies project at the  
Center for Science in the Public Interest, said ``other celebrities 
and stars should think about to whom they will appear'' in the ads 
even if the messages are aimed at adults.

<HEADLINE>  Germans Win First 2 Indoor Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- On his fifth try, 60-meter hurdles world  
record-holder Colin Jackson finally won his first indoor world 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	The British hurdler today set a World Championships meet record  
of 7.38 seconds to capture his first gold medal in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, whose world record is 7.30, had to lean deeply to edge  
Reggie Torian, the U.S. champion. In qualifying, Jackson was timed 
in 7.42 seconds, with Torian the runner-up at 7.43. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's final, which had to restarted after three false starts,  
was Jackson's fifth final at the championships. In three of them, 
he finished second and he was fourth once. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to race to the line when things are that tight,''  
Jackson said. ``I'm pleased to have won the gold medal. This was my 
last indoor championships and I was trying to win the gold after 
three silvers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torian, who ran 7.38 last week for the U.S. title, had a time of  
7.40 for second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how they separated us,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the distance spectrum, Ethiopia's Haile  
Gebrselassie easily won the first of what he hopes will be an 
unprecedented double, crossing the finish in the 3,000 meters at 7 
minutes, 53.57 seconds, well off the best time of the year, 
7:26.80, which he had in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to go faster because I have to run again,'' he  
said. The 1,500 meter semifinal is Saturday, and the final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	German jumpers got the first golds of the championships' opening  
day, with triple jumper Charles Friedek and women's pole vaulter 
Nastja Ryshich both setting career bests. 
</P>
<P>
	And the final gold of the day went to Didi Nathan of the United  
States, in the women's pentathlon. Nathan marked personal bests in 
all five pentathlon events, and set an American record of 4,753 
points. The previous record of 4,682 was set by Kym carter in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best races, however, was in a semifinal.  
</P>
<P>
	Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, the world indoor record-holder in  
the 200 at 19.92 -- was timed in 20.18, a championships record and 
the fastest time indoors in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Right behind him was defending champion Kevin Little of the  
United States, who clocked a 20.32. That ties the U.S. indoor 
record set last week by Rohsaan Griffin. But Little lost his meets 
record of 20.40 to Fredericks. 
</P>
<P>
	Little said he expected times in Saturday's final to be fast,  
and labeled the track at the Green Dome as good, but ``not as 
aggressive as some tracks in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The track was good for the women sprinters as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Ionela Tirlea, the 1998 European 400-meter champion, ran the  
world's fastest time this year in winning her heat in the women's 
200 at 22.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Olga Shishigina of Kazakhstan came on strong at the finish to  
win the women's 60-meter hurdles. She was clocked at 7.86 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-place finisher Glory Alozie of Nigeria thought she had it  
won. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling bad. She just beat me at the finish,'' Alozie  
said. ``My start was OK, but I have to work on my finish. Last 
year, my finish was OK but I had to work on my start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German gold medalist Friedek, last year's World Cup winner, hit  
triple-jumped 56 feet, 4 1/2 inches, matching his lifetime best, on 
his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorite Yoelbi Quesada of Cuba was fifth at 55-6 1/4.  
</P>
<P>
	Ryshich set a championship record in capturing her pole vault  
gold medal at 14-9, beating world outdoor record-holder Emma George 
of Australia, world indoor record-holder Nicole Humbert of Germany 
and defending champion Stacy Dragila of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was no problem,'' Ryshich said. ``I knew I could clear this  
height.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vala Flosadottir of Iceland finished second in the women's vault  
at 14-7 1/4 and Zsuzsa Szabo of Hungary tied Humbert, who set the 
world record of 14-11 1/2 a week ago, for third with 14-3 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	George, bothered by a shoulder injury, wound up sixth at 14-3 1/4.  
Dragila, winner of the inaugural women's pole vault at the 
championships two years ago at 14-5 1/4, also cleared 14-3 1/4, but was 
eighth on more misses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't have the background, experience or confidence,''  
Dragila said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, Bulgaria's Khristina Kalcheva won the women's high  
jump with a personal best of 6-6 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a replay of the 1997 world outdoors, the men's shot put  
went to Aleksandr Bagach, of the Ukraine, who marked 70-3, with 
John Godina of the United States runner-up, with a season's best of 
69-1 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	But two years ago, Godina was the beneficiary of Bagach's  
disqualification for doping.

<HEADLINE> Applications Rise at Colleges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Colleges around the country are reporting a surge  
in applications this year, in part because the Internet is making 
it easier to apply. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, high school seniors can apply to many colleges  
electronically. Some schools even waive their application fees -- 
typically $35 to $60 -- for students who apply online. 
</P>
<P>
	Other schools let students fill in their applications on  
computer screens and then print out a copy and mail it in the 
old-fashioned way. In some cases, the colleges and the students 
split the application costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the candidate's point of view, it is a much easier  
ballgame and the Internet has facilitated that,'' said Marlyn 
McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard University, which 
saw the number of applicants rise almost 8 percent this year over 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard does not accept applications over the Internet but posts  
its forms online for students to fill out and mail in. 
</P>
<P>
	Yale saw its applications rise 10.5 percent this year;  
University of California-Riverside was up 14.6 percent to the 
highest number ever; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, 
N.Y., was up 13 percent; and Temple University in Philadelphia was 
up a whopping 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the students who applied to Temple this year used an  
electronic application, said Tom Maxey, vice president for 
enrollment management. The Web, he said, ``is certainly giving us 
and our colleagues a lot more exposure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It used to be that prospective applicants learned about colleges  
by sending away for brochures or poring through hefty guidebooks. 
Now, most universities have Web pages that describe everything from 
admissions policies to recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without the Internet, schools would probably be reporting a  
jump in applicants. The number of high school seniors has been 
increasing about 3 percent annually in recent years. Experts 
predict there will be close to 3 million high school graduates next 
year, up from 2.6 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Trent Anderson, an executive director at Kaplan  
Educational Centers, a college preparation service, said the number 
of applications is outstripping the increase in students. 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools subscribe to electronic services such as  
CollegeLink that let students fill in their applications on 
computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
	CollegeLink president Jerry Paxton said that at a time when  
federal financial aid for college is dwindling, some students are 
applying to more schools to find out where they can get the best 
financial package. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who use CollegeLink are applying to an average of five  
schools each, up from four several years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of the 1,000 participating CollegeLink schools are  
reporting an increase in applications of 3 percent to 5 percent 
this year, he said, with the more selective institutions much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are some downsides to the Net application boom.  
</P>
<P>
	College officials are finding it harder to gauge the seriousness  
of applicants, said Joyce Smith, executive director of the National 
Association for College Admissions Counseling in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is talking about how great the applicant pool was,''  
Smith said. ``I truly sit and just wonder if the students are just 
applying to more schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How many students are applying over the Web is difficult to  
gauge. No organization keeps track. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of some 3,500 colleges nationwide, only a fraction are  
believed to accept electronic applications, Anderson said. More 
typical is for colleges to post applications on line for students 
to mail in later.

<HEADLINE>  Hunter: `Sometimes You Want to Cry' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Once a dominating right-hander, Catfish  
Hunter couldn't offer more than a weak handshake to former 
teammates when he arrived at the New York Yankees' exhibition 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	But they hugged him tenderly and shared smiles and stories while  
holding back tears Thursday when he made his first public 
appearance since learning in November that he has Lou Gehrig's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing all right,'' Hunter said. ``It's just my hands and  
arms don't work right. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not too much muscle there left,'' he said, adding with  
typical Catfish humor: ``But I never had too much to start with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participating in pregame ceremonies honoring a dozen former  
Yankees stars at Legends Field, Hunter said he felt more nervous 
walking on the diamond this time than he ever did in a World Series 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	He hid his jitters, though, just as he did during the toughest  
situations of his pitching career, and strode confidently, if 
gingerly, on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Hall of Famer has severe weakness in both arms  
and hands a year after suffering early symptoms of the progressive, 
neurological disease, formally called amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. He relies on his wife and childhood sweetheart, Helen, 
to dress him and feed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you want to cry,'' he said, ``other times you just  
look around and you're thankful that you're living. The main thing 
is, maybe there might be a cure for it one of these days, years or 
whatever. Maybe I can last that long. You never know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a lot of people who are a lot worse off than I am. A lot  
of people say, `Well, you've got this disease, there's really no 
cure for it.' But you never know, there might be a cure right 
around the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his spirits are up, Hunter briefly choked up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got my kids,'' he said before pausing, his eyes misty as he  
held back tears. ``That helps. I've got one grandson. It looks like 
he might play ball. His name's Taylor, and he's 3. He's got a ball 
in his hand right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said he tries not to worry too much about how fast the  
deadly disease might progress, about how it eventually might put 
him in a wheelchair, wipe out his ability to speak, and take his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get teary-eyed a little bit more than I used to,'' he said.  
``But it might be along with age, too. The main thing is, you only 
live one day at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stays busy on his farm in Hertford, N.C., 600 acres of  
cotton, peanut, corn and bean fields and 400 acres of woods. He 
also goes to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore once a month 
or so for treatment and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You sit around, you think too much,'' Hunter said. ``Like Dick  
Williams said about pitching, `If you start to think, you're always 
in trouble.' The best thing is not to think.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Hunter: `Sometimes You Want to Cry' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Once a dominating right-hander, Catfish  
Hunter couldn't offer more than a weak handshake to former 
teammates when he arrived at the New York Yankees' exhibition 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	But they hugged him tenderly and shared smiles and stories while  
holding back tears Thursday when he made his first public 
appearance since learning in November that he has Lou Gehrig's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing all right,'' Hunter said. ``It's just my hands and  
arms don't work right. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not too much muscle there left,'' he said, adding with  
typical Catfish humor: ``But I never had too much to start with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participating in pregame ceremonies honoring a dozen former  
Yankees stars at Legends Field, Hunter said he felt more nervous 
walking on the diamond this time than he ever did in a World Series 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	He hid his jitters, though, just as he did during the toughest  
situations of his pitching career, and strode confidently, if 
gingerly, on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Hall of Famer has severe weakness in both arms  
and hands a year after suffering early symptoms of the progressive, 
neurological disease, formally called amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. He relies on his wife and childhood sweetheart, Helen, 
to dress him and feed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you want to cry,'' he said, ``other times you just  
look around and you're thankful that you're living. The main thing 
is, maybe there might be a cure for it one of these days, years or 
whatever. Maybe I can last that long. You never know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a lot of people who are a lot worse off than I am. A lot  
of people say, `Well, you've got this disease, there's really no 
cure for it.' But you never know, there might be a cure right 
around the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if his spirits are up, Hunter briefly choked up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got my kids,'' he said before pausing, his eyes misty as he  
held back tears. ``That helps. I've got one grandson. It looks like 
he might play ball. His name's Taylor, and he's 3. He's got a ball 
in his hand right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said he tries not to worry too much about how fast the  
deadly disease might progress, about how it eventually might put 
him in a wheelchair, wipe out his ability to speak, and take his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get teary-eyed a little bit more than I used to,'' he said.  
``But it might be along with age, too. The main thing is, you only 
live one day at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stays busy on his farm in Hertford, N.C., 600 acres of  
cotton, peanut, corn and bean fields and 400 acres of woods. He 
also goes to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore once a month 
or so for treatment and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You sit around, you think too much,'' Hunter said. ``Like Dick  
Williams said about pitching, `If you start to think, you're always 
in trouble.' The best thing is not to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Yankees camp, Hunter visited with Williams, his manager  
with the Oakland Athletics. Before the game, he also chatted with 
former pitching stars Whitey Ford and Mel Stottlemyre in manager 
Joe Torre's office, swapping stories and laughing with them.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Wohlers Allows Four Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Wohlers' first appearance of 1999  
was much like his outings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves reliever faced eight batters in the third  
inning of a 7-4 loss to Houston, allowing four earned runs, three 
hits and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
	He fanned his first batter, Ken Caminiti, on a changeup and  
ended the inning by striking out Carl Everett with a low fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results weren't there, but I'm not going to worry about  
the results,'' Wohlers said. ``I think how I felt on the mound, the 
way I handled myself, and the pitches that I made, I feel good 
about. Obviously giving up four runs is kind of frustrating, but in 
the same token it's been a long time since I walked off the mound 
after finishing an inning. It's been quite some time since I've 
done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers threw 38 pitches against Houston's starters, allowing a  
pair of two-run singles to Ricky Guttierez and Craig Biggio. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was able to throw his fastball past them consistently,  
one of many positives he says he'll take with him to his next 
outing on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best command of my fastball I've had all spring,''  
Wohlers said. ``When I was warming up I was nervous and erratic, 
and that got better when I got into the game, so that's a good 
sign. My arm is in good shape, so I'm not satisfied, but I'm 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	``With where I've been and what I've gone through and what  
happened today, you might look at the linescore and say 'Man, this 
kid struggled,' but if you compare it to some linescores from last 
year it's a pretty good outing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once regarded among baseball's best closers, Wohlers began  
struggling in late May after trouble with his left oblique muscle 
put him on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon his return, the right-hander was hit hard, allowing seven  
runs in eight games with nine walks. 
</P>
<P>
	After requesting re-assignment, Wohlers struggled at Triple-A  
Richmond, losing two games and compiling an ERA of 21.60 in eight 
games. Wohlers returned to Atlanta for eight appearances, then was 
sent back to Richmond on Aug. 11 after giving up 13 runs and 
walking 15 batters in 4 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who has 112 career saves, spent the rest of the season  
on the disabled list because of an ``inability to pitch.''

<HEADLINE> Journalist Faces Porn Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENBELT, Md. (AP) -- A journalist testified at his sentencing  
hearing today he was researching a story and didn't know he was 
doing anything illegal when he downloaded images of children in 
sexually explicit situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Matthews, who faced a possible sentence of 30 years in  
prison and $500,000 fine for his guilty pleas to receiving and 
transmitting computer images of child pornography, said he 
forwarded the material to gain the trust of suspected pedophiles 
online so he could talk to them for the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naive and stupid as it sounds today, I did not know what I was  
doing was illegal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge says Matthews' status as a reporter was  
irrelevant since he broke the law by possessing and distributing 
banned materials. 
</P>
<P>
	A father of four, Matthews had done stories on the growing  
availability of child porn on the Internet in 1995 while working 
for radio station WTOP-AM in Washington. He said he wanted to 
expand on that series for magazine articles he planned to sell 
free-lance. National Public Radio, where he now works as an editor, 
did not commission the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a journalist who worked with Matthews at a  
Washington-area radio station for more than 10 years, testified 
that Matthews would often ``push the envelope'' in reporting his 
stories, such as living as a homeless person for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Deibert said he found it hard to believe that Matthews  
would download pornography purely out of personal interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the guy I know,'' Deibert said.  
</P>
<P>
	While online, Matthews communicated with a federal agent posing  
as a porn trader. In December 1996, an FBI task force on Internet 
child pornography searched Matthews' Silver Spring home and seized 
child-sex pictures from his computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have compared him with someone who buys cocaine to  
write a story on the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter ``cannot go to an open-air drug market and buy crack  
cocaine himself,'' they said in court documents. ``Nor can he 
decide to sell crack cocaine in order to develop information to 
write his story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews pleaded guilty in July to one count of receiving  
pornographic images on his computer and one count of transmitting 
child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	He had planned to argue at trial that he has a right to view  
such materials as part of legitimate research. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Alexander Williams Jr. ruled that  
Matthews' status as a journalist did not give him license to break 
the law, and that he could not invoke the First Amendment in his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law passed in 1982 prohibits possession of child  
pornography, and the Supreme Court has upheld the law, ruling that 
even owning such material creates a market for exploiting children.

<HEADLINE> State Trooper Accidentally Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH PLATTE, Neb. (AP) -- A state trooper was accidentally shot  
and killed by a fellow officer in a self-defense training session 
that was not supposed to include live ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutors said today that the shooting Thursday  
afternoon was accidental. State police are still conducting an 
internal probe to figure out why the unidentified officer's gun was 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors were made available to troopers and Gov. Mike Johanns  
ordered flags to be flown at half-staff today in honor of Trooper 
Mark Wagner, 37, a 12-year veteran from North Platte. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragedy,'' State Patrol Maj. Bryan Tuma said. ``We  
have a lot of damage control to do out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 officers took part in the annual self-defense training  
session, which calls for neither live ammunition nor bulletproof 
vests. Tuma said he didn't think Wagner was wearing a vest when he 
was shot once in the chest with a state patrol handgun. He was 
pronounced dead a half-hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	No civilians or officers from other departments were in the room  
when the shooting occurred, Tuma said, but declined to release 
details about the shooting until the internal investigation is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, who leaves a wife and three daughters, is the eleventh  
state trooper to die in the line of duty. The last was in 1989, 
when Don Matejka had a heart attack while wrestling with a domestic 
disturbance suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	North Platte is about 220 miles west of Lincoln.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Grant Estimates Sent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As President Clinton seeks backing for a  
second year of money for his 100,000 new teachers program, the 
administration gave the nation's schools Friday an estimate of how 
much they will get this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the federal government will send the states a total of  
$1.2 billion for their school districts. Congress approved the 
money last year to hire about 30,000 new teachers in the early 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's goal is to help school districts nationwide hire and  
train 100,000 new teachers over seven years to cut pupil-teacher 
ratios in the first through third grades. The national average now 
is 22 students per teacher, and he wants that reduced to 18 or 
fewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats will try to add a second year of financing to the  
education bills currently moving through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The district-level estimates issued Friday -- based on formulas  
that include school enrollments -- range from $61 million for the 
New York City schools to less than $12,000 each for Delaware's 
Sussex County schools and Polytech School District. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter figure wouldn't be enough to pay for even one new  
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	But schools can use the money for training to help aides and  
others become fully certified to teach, said Barbara Hunter, a 
spokeswoman for the Alexandria City Public Schools in Virginia. The 
11,000-student school district in suburban Washington was slated to 
get about $230,000. Hunter said she couldn't estimate how many 
teachers the district could hire with that money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is assuring our children learn in better  
classrooms,'' she told a news conference where the Education 
Department announced the estimates. ``We would welcome the money 
and we would put it to good use.''

<HEADLINE> Spoonhour Retires After 7 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Charlie Spoonhour retired Friday after seven  
seasons as Saint Louis coach, saying the job had become too much of 
a grind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not sick, no matter how I look,'' Spoonhour joked at an  
overflow news conference. ``I'm not getting divorced. There's just 
a point when you have to get off the merry-go-round, and that time 
is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour, 59, was 122-90 at Saint Louis, and led the Billikens  
to three NCAA tournaments and one NIT. His final season was a 
frustrating 15-16 as he struggled unsuccessfully to fill the huge 
void created when Larry Hughes left for the NBA's Philadelphia 
76ers after leading Saint Louis to 22 victories and a first-round 
victory in the NCAAs his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Larry comes back this year, we're one of the elite teams,''  
senior forward Ryan Luechtefeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 Division I seasons, Spoonhour was 319-171, a .651 winning  
percentage, and reached 20 or more victories 10 times. Before 
coming to Saint Louis he led Southwest Missouri State to five NCAA 
tournaments and two NITs in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour, who leaves with two years remaining on a $325,000  
annual contract, said he knew it was time to move on early in the 
season when he found it difficult to get over losses. Months ago, 
he confided to close friends in the profession that he would be 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do the things you need to do, it finally got to be work,''  
Spoonhour said. ``And I always said if it got to be a real job I'd 
quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players saw a different side, a Spoonhour that was letting go.  
Reserve forward Troy Robertson said he thought Spoonhour was 
happier than could be expected during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the losses, I thought the next day in practice he was  
going to kill us,'' Robertson said. ``But he was pretty upbeat, 
positive. So it made a little sense that he was trying to have a 
good time on his way out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour said a winning record this season wouldn't have  
changed his mind. He said he probably stayed a year longer than he 
should have. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour said he wouldn't coach again, but might be interested  
in scouting for an NBA team. For now, he said, he just wants to 
relax a bit and plans to head soon for Jupiter, Fla., to watch his 
beloved St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	When athletic director Doug Woolard asked what he could do,  
Spoonhour said, ``I told them very simply, be happy for me. Because 
this is why I work, so someday I can sit around and do nothing. 
That's what I'm going to try to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior forward Ryan Luechtefeld said Spoonhour's announcement to  
the team after Thursday night's 70-61 loss to Louisville in the 
Conference USA tournament should have been more gut-wrenching than 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody assumed that it was going to happen, but it was  
still emotional when he told us,'' Luechtefeld said. ``Then again, 
he wasn't and his son wasn't, and that told us he was happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoonhour's son, Jay, was an assistant coach on the team.  
</P>
<P>
	A national search process will begin immediately, Woolard said.  
Spoonhour recommended longtime assistant Greg Lackey for the job 
and several players endorsed the move. 
</P>
<P>
	A top outsider mentioned for the opening is Illinois State coach  
Kevin Stallings. He led Illinois State to consecutive Missouri 
Valley Conference championships in 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Research Satellite Out of Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A newly launched NASA satellite telescope was  
spinning out of control in orbit Friday and engineers were in a 
race against time to save the $67 million mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer was spinning completely around  
each second. The mishap is apparently due to the thruster-like 
action of hydrogen gas venting from a system needed to keep the 
satellite's telescope extremely cold. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft, known by the nickname Wire, was launched  
Thursday night with the hydrogen frozen solid. It was supposed to 
melt and vent very gradually, keeping the telescope cold throughout 
a four-month mission. 
</P>
<P>
	It was possible all the hydrogen would be lost within a day if  
control was not regained, said Don Savage, a spokesman at National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters in Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a race with the clock to turn this and hopefully cool  
down the spacecraft before all the hydrogen is vented,'' Savage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was designed to help scientists understand how and  
when galaxies formed, and the history of star formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire's cooling system was built to keep the instrument at  
temperatures under minus 436 degrees Fahrenheit so that its own 
heat would not overwhelm the light it would try to detect from 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	The venting hydrogen was believed to be acting like a thruster,  
spinning Wire at a rate the control system could not overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire has no thrusters to control the way it points. Rather, it  
uses devices called magnetic torque wheels, which operate much more 
gently.

<HEADLINE> Three Illinois Children Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- Three children were found dead Friday,  
apparently poisoned after being caught up in a domestic dispute, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Marilyn Lemak, was hospitalized in fair condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Police found the children after Mrs. Lemak, 41, called 911 on  
Friday morning from the family's home in this Chicago suburb. The 
children were identified as Nicholas, 7; Emily, 6; and Thomas, 3. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPage County State's Attorney Joe Birkett said no evidence  
suggests someone outside the family was involved. He said the 
children's father, David Lemak, an emergency room doctor, was 
cooperating with police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lemaks were separated and going through divorce proceedings,  
Birkett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Birkett said the children were apparently poisoned but that he  
was awaiting results of toxicology tests.

<P>
	POCATELLO, Idaho (AP) -- Idaho State University defensive back  
Jacori Rufus was killed early Friday and two teammates were injured

Page, Ariz..

	University officials said the 19-year-old a freshman was on his  
way home to Phoenix for spring break with two teammates. DeRonn 
Finley, the team's leading receiver last season, broke an arm and a 
leg, while defensive lineman Justin Giles received only bruises.

<P>
	Authorities said Rufus was not wearing a seatbelt when the  
accident happened.

	``Jacori had a tremendous future, both in athletics and in  
life,'' said Howard Gauthier, ISU's interim associate athletic 
director. ``This is a terribly tragedy.''

	Rufus started five games for the Bengals last fall and set the  
school record for interception returns, running one back 100 yards 
for a touchdown against Southern Utah.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Trooper Killed Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A state trooper participating in a  
self-defense training session was accidentally shot and killed by a 
fellow officer who forgot his gun was loaded, a prosecutor said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Wagner, 37, was shot once in the chest Thursday by a fellow  
officer at the patrol's Troop D headquarters in North Platte. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer who shot him was told that one defensive training  
segment was over and he loaded his weapon, prosecutor Kent Turnbull 
said. After a break, officers went into another mode of training 
that also involved pointing their unloaded weapons, and he forgot 
his was loaded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges will be filed because the shooting was an accident,  
Turnbull said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a terrible tragedy, not only for Mark Wagner and his  
family but for the other trooper involved as well,'' Turnbull said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnbull declined to identify the officer, but said the State  
Patrol would release the name next week after its internal 
investigation is complete. He said the trooper knew Wagner well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in that room knew Mark pretty well,'' Turnbull said.  
``He was friends with all of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Patrol Maj. Bryan Tuma said Thursday that Wagner, a  
12-year veteran, was taking part in annual training when shot with 
either a Glock .40-caliber or .45-caliber semiautomatic. 
</P>
<P>
	No civilians or officers from other departments were in the room  
when the shooting happened, Tuma said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuma said troopers are not required to wear bulletproof vests  
during the training. He did not think Wagner was wearing one. 
</P>
<P>
	North Platte is about 220 miles west of Lincoln.

	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Supporters have begun  
organizing a movement to urge 92-year-old Joaquin Balaguer to run 
for president again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with CBS Telenoticias to be aired Saturday,  
Balaguer said it was understandable that people would turn to 
someone they know well to lead them through difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
	Balaguer, who served as president for 22 years, did not rule out  
another run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Balaguer's age and health problems -- he has been legally  
blind for years -- 70 percent of his party's members want him to run 
for president in 2000, when he will be 94 years old, according to a 
recent poll.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A 10-hour riot in an overcrowded prison  
Friday left two inmates dead in southeastern Brazil, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The uprising began shortly after midnight when guards stopped a  
breakout by 50 inmates at the Santo Andre prison, on the outskirts 
of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Police inspector Wilson Roberto Alves said by phone that the  
escape attempt was likely sparked by the prison's overcrowded 
facilities. More than 400 prisoners are held in a space built for 
96. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners returned to their cells when 20 riot troopers  
arrived to quell the uprising, Alves said.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A prisoner whose testimony implicated  
Colombian paramilitary leaders in the murder of a Marxist 
Ecuadorean congressman was stabbed seven times by another prisoner 
Friday, prison authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington Aguirre, who is charged with helping organize the  
Feb. 17 murder of Congressman Jaime Hurtado, survived the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguirre has told police he helped two Colombian hitmen organize  
the killing of Hurtado, who was gunned down along with two 
assistants as he walked to his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguirre has testified that right-wing paramilitary leaders  
ordered Hurtado's murder because they thought he was helping 
Colombia's leftists operate in neighboring Ecuador and because he 
was trying to organize a local insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado's family members and leaders of his leftist party have  
denied the accusations.

	ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- The campaign manager of a leftist  
opposition party was fatally shot outside his home in the Pacific 
coast state of Guerrero, authorities said Friday.

	Gunmen with automatic rifles drove past the home of Aurelio  
Penaloza, 38, and shot him repeatedly Thursday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions have risen in Guerrero -- where leftist rebel groups are  
active -- after the ruling party narrowly won the state governorship 
in elections the opposition Democratic Revolution Party claims were 
marred by fraud and vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	During state elections last month, the Democratic Revolution  
candidate lost by a small margin in what party officials called 
``the most corrupt'' election in the history of Guerrero.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Calumet Farm President in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A magistrate's bond order didn't free the former  
president of Calumet Farm, which produced eight Kentucky Derby 
winners, including Whirlaway and Citation. 
</P>
<P>
	John T. Lundy, 58, appeared Friday at a bond hearing. He was  
picked up Tuesday by U.S. Customs agents as he returned to the 
United States from Venezuela, where he goes a few times each year 
on business, according to his lawyer, John Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy is wanted in Houston to face bribery charges linking a  
failed bank to the famed horse farm. 
</P>
<P>
	He is not a flight risk, Buchanan contended. He pointed out that  
Lundy was traveling under his own name when arrested, that 
reporters had been able to locate him last year for magazine and 
newspaper stories -- and that he is registered with the state of 
Florida as an assistant horse trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not hard to find if he wants to be found,'' responded  
assistant U.S. Attorney Orlando Patterson. ``Sports Illustrated 
wasn't looking for him for an investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turnoff ordered a $250,000 corporate bond.  
</P>
<P>
	But Patterson said the Texas prosecutor had authorized him to  
request a stay, which Turnoff granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy will remain jailed in Miami until a hearing next week to  
determine whether he will be sent to Texas to face the charges, or 
until he asks to go. Buchanan said no immediate decision was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a khaki jail uniform, the plump, bespectacled Lundy said  
little at Friday's hearing. He held his hands behind his back, 
twisting his fingers while facing U.S. Magistrate Judge William C. 
Turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy and Gary Matthews, his former lawyer, are accused of  
bribing First City Bancorporation of Texas in exchange for at least 
$50 million in loans. That money was allegedly used to prop up 
Calumet, which collapsed financially after the mysterious death in 
1990 of champion stud Alydar. 
</P>
<P>
	First City was Calumet's primary creditor. The bank had warned  
the farm that it needed to make a $15 million loan payment by 
February 1991 or face foreclosure. After Alydar died, First City 
received $20 million of a $36.5 million insurance payout. 
</P>
<P>
	The December indictments charge Lundy and Matthews with one  
count each of conspiracy to defraud a financial institution, scheme 
to defraud, bank bribery and three counts of false statements to 
bank officials, according to a Texas federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, formerly Calumet's chief financial officer, was  
arrested Wednesday in Lexington, Ky. Released on $10,000 bond, he 
was directed to report to court in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas charges stem from an investigation into loan activity  
involving First City, which failed first in 1988, then again for 
good in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Feds Accuse Wal-Mart of Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The federal government has sued  
Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, accusing it of using job 
questionnaires to screen out disabled applicants. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit claims Wal-Mart violated the Americans with  
Disabilities Act, attorneys for the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The questionnaire asked applicants to indicate if they might  
need any accommodation to perform required duties. The EEOC says it 
is illegal to ask about disability before a job offer is made. 
</P>
<P>
	``An employer is entitled to know if someone can do a job, but  
the question is: At what point?'' EEOC attorney David Kelley said 
of the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart officials said the questionnaire was designed to  
accommodate job applicants, not discriminate against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want an applicant to give up their current job, come  
to work for Wal-Mart and then find out that we couldn't accommodate 
their needs,'' said Melissa Brown, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also said Wal-Mart had removed questions about  
disabilities from its questionnaire in December 1997, following 
previous legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said EEOC investigators found the questionnaire being  
used in stores as recently as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart had assured the commission that they were no longer  
using the form,'' Kelley said. ``We learned during our 
investigation that they continued to use it in various facilities 
in California, Texas, Arizona and elsewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Shots Fired at U.S. Embassy in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Gunmen fired on the closed U.S. Embassy  
today in Sudan's capital, the interior minister said, the first 
attack on the building since hundreds of youths stormed it last 
summer in protest of a U.S missile attack on Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Several bullets hit the embassy walls, but no one was injured in  
the shooting. The embassy has been closed since 1996 when the 
United States withdrew its diplomats, accusing Sudan of supporting 
terrorism and saying it could no longer guarantee their security. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Abdel-Raheem Mohamed Hussein told Al-Rai  
Al-Aam newspaper that unknown gunmen in a passing car ``opened fire 
randomly in the air'' toward the embassy before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is investigating the attack and security has been  
increased around the embassy, the minister said. U.S. diplomats in 
the region occasionaly use the embassy to perform consular 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous attack came when hundreds of students scaled the  
embassy fence and tore down the U.S. flag on Aug. 20, hours after 
U.S. missiles had destroyed the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries 
Co. factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States alleged the plant produced precursors for  
chemical weapons, but the owners and the Sudanese government denied 
this. The attack was in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombing of the 
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, 
including 12 Americans.

<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANTS, N.M. (AP) -- A handcuffed inmate overpowered a sheriff's  
deputy who was taking him to prison, killing her and briefly 
fleeing after forcing another motorist out of his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Kelly Clark was driving inmate Michael Archuleta, 21, who  
had been convicted of receiving a stolen vehicle and assault with a 
deadly weapon, when he attacked her Thursday, state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Archuleta somehow got through the sliding  
window of a divider between the patrol car's front and back seats, 
took the deputy's gun and shot her. The patrol car went out of 
control, crossed the median and struck a tractor-trailer rig, Capt. 
Rudy Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Archuleta fled after he forced another motorist out of his car.  
He was caught soon afterward when he stopped to make a phone call 
at a gas station, still wearing his handcuffs and carrying the gun.

<HEADLINE>  NFL Commissioner Considers Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON, Calif. (AP) -- With the NFL apparently on the verge of  
choosing a city for its 32nd franchise, commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
took a helicopter ride Friday with Hollywood deal-maker Michael 
Ovitz over one of three proposed sites for a new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's group, which includes Tom Cruise and Magic Johnson,  
wants to build a hacienda-style stadium and shopping mall on a 
former garbage dump in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue, calling Ovitz a visionary, seemed impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner noted that the site is easily accessible from  
two freeways, that ``the almost 200 acres is a strong positive,'' 
and that many NFL owners find the proposed stadium ``compelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and his backers, another Los Angeles group seeking a team  
to play in a remodeled Coliseum, and a group in Houston are vying 
for the expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	The team owners meet the week of March 14 in Phoenix, and  
Tagliabue expects a city, but not necessarily an ownership group, 
to be selected for the new franchise at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum group, headed by developer Ed Roski Jr. and  
billionaire Eli Broad, was thought to hold an edge in the two-city, 
three-group competition, but Tagliabue expressed some concerns 
about the historic stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner said there are ``issues we are still  
addressing'' with the New Coliseum group, mentioning cost 
variables, parking, and what kind of public investment would be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think those issues are a lot more substantial with the  
Coliseum project than they are here. I think they are pretty well 
resolved here,'' Tagliabue said at a Carson civic center news 
conference following his flight over the area. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he also said nothing should be read into his first  
visit to Carson other than that he wanted to take a look at the 
site. He said he already was very familiar with the Coliseum, some 
15 miles up the freeway, and the proposed site in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz made a point of what probably is Los Angeles' strongest  
plus in the competition for a team -- the television market. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Los Angeles is the second largest TV market in the  
nation, with Houston No. 11, Ovitz added, ``I think LA has a big 
leg-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, a member of the  
league's expansion committee, said at the news conference that, if 
the owners do decide to award a franchise to the Los Angeles area 
without immediately choosing an owner, ``There might be additional 
numbers of people in Los Angeles interested (in owning a team); I'd 
be surprised if there weren't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other subjects, Tagliabue said he doesn't consider Al Davis'  
efforts to have Los Angeles declared the Raiders' domain ``any 
factor'' presently in the league's expansion plans; and that he 
disputes the suggestion that the league might build its own stadium 
and auction it and a team off to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a big football fan, said he wants an NFL team in Los  
Angeles because ``I'm tired of going to every other city. I want a 
Super Bowl in Los Angeles.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Won't Face More Jail in Ind. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana didn't want Mike Tyson back, so it  
struck a deal to keep the former heavyweight champion locked up in 
a Maryland jail for an extra 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will serve the additional time in Maryland for violating  
his Indiana probation for a 1992 rape conviction, according to 
court documents filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tyson would actually be released from jail and resume his  
career is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	His 60-day sentence begins at the end of the one year he is  
serving in Montgomery County, Md., for a misdemeanor assault. The 
Maryland sentence still could be reduced for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities could have forced Tyson to serve up to four  
years in prison, but they wanted to resolve the issue at no further 
cost to taxpayers while still holding Tyson accountable, Marion 
County (Ind.) prosecutor Scott Newman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were frankly not anxious -- and I don't think the people of  
Indiana were anxious -- to have Mike Tyson back in our courts and in 
our jails,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is ``satisfied that this matter is behind him now and he's  
looking forward to his future,'' said James Voyles, the boxer's 
Indianapolis lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason why he doesn't resume training and fighting''  
once he is released from jail, Voyles said. He added that he does 
not expect the agreement to affect Tyson's Nevada boxing license. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will pay Indiana $80 per day, or a total of $4,800, for  
the cost of his incarceration, and Indiana will reimburse Maryland 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Tyson admitted he violated his probation.  
He also waived his right to appeal his no-contest plea to charges 
he assaulted two men after a minor traffic accident in August. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving the additional 60 days, his record will show that  
his Indiana probation was terminated as ``unsatisfactory,'' the 
agreement said. That would be taken into consideration if Tyson 
gets into legal trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's probation was scheduled to end March 24. If he had been  
forced to appear in court in Indiana on a violation, he probably 
would have withdrawn his Maryland plea and appealed his sentence, 
Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been protracted litigation in this matter,  
probably in two states,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was signed Thursday by Newman, Tyson and Voyles  
and was accepted Friday by Judge Patricia Gifford, who had 
sentenced Tyson for his 1992 conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson began serving his Maryland sentence Feb. 5. He had until  
Sunday to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad Siddeeq, a spiritual adviser to Tyson, said those close  
to the boxer were ``extremely grateful'' a deal could be worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that Mike would want me to say on his behalf ... that  
he's going to try to be worthy of the consideration that's been 
given him,'' Siddeeq said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant  
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was released 
from prison in March 1995 after serving three years of a six-year 
sentence.

his Indiana probation for a 1992 rape conviction, according to 
court documents filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tyson would actually be released from jail and resume his  
career is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	His 60-day sentence begins at the end of the one year he is  
serving in Montgomery County, Md., for a misdemeanor assault. The 
Maryland sentence still could be reduced for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana authorities could have forced Tyson to serve up to four  
years in prison, but they wanted to resolve the issue at no further 
cost to taxpayers while still holding Tyson accountable, Marion 
County (Ind.) prosecutor Scott Newman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were frankly not anxious -- and I don't think the people of  
Indiana were anxious -- to have Mike Tyson back in our courts and in 
our jails,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is ``satisfied that this matter is behind him now and he's  
looking forward to his future,'' said James Voyles, the boxer's 
Indianapolis lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason why he doesn't resume training and fighting''  
once he is released from jail, Voyles said. He added that he does 
not expect the agreement to affect Tyson's Nevada boxing license, 
an opinion echoed by Kirk Hendrick, legal counsel for the Nevada 
State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hendrick said just having the license doesn't guarantee  
Tyson's right to fight. He said a promoter has to put together a 
card that would include Tyson, and that card would have to be 
approved by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are probably some tough questions Mike and his people  
would have to answer'' if promoters sought commission approval for 
such a card, Hendrick said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson will pay Indiana $80 per day, or a total of $4,800, for  
the cost of his incarceration, and Indiana will reimburse Maryland 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Tyson admitted he violated his probation.  
He also waived his right to appeal his no-contest plea to charges 
he assaulted two men after a minor traffic accident in August. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving the additional 60 days, his record will show that  
his Indiana probation was terminated as ``unsatisfactory,'' the 
agreement said. That would be taken into consideration if Tyson 
gets into legal trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's probation was scheduled to end March 24. If he had been  
forced to appear in court in Indiana on a violation, he probably 
would have withdrawn his Maryland plea and appealed his sentence, 
Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would have been protracted litigation in this matter,  
probably in two states,'' Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was signed Thursday by Newman, Tyson and Voyles  
and was accepted Friday by Judge Patricia Gifford, who had 
sentenced Tyson for his 1992 conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson began serving his Maryland sentence Feb. 5. He had until  
Sunday to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad Siddeeq, a spiritual adviser to Tyson, said those close  
to the boxer were ``extremely grateful'' a deal could be worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that Mike would want me to say on his behalf ... that  
he's going to try to be worthy of the consideration that's been 
given him,'' Siddeeq said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty pageant  
contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was released 
from prison in March 1995 after serving three years of a six-year 
sentence.

<HEADLINE> Committee OKs $1B Loan for Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposed $1 billion loan program for the  
U.S. steel industry is expected to help struggling steel makers 
survive until other government help comes along to counter 
low-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional aides said Friday that steel companies would be  
eligible to make use of the loans through the end of 2001 and would 
have six years to pay the money back. Each company could borrow $25 
million to $250 million at market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee attached the program  
Thursday to a wide-ranging supplemental spending measure for fiscal 
1999. The Senate is to consider the package in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who sponsored the loan program, said  
many companies now have problems borrowing money from banks because 
of uncertainties about future import trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's surge in imports triggered by the Asian economic  
crisis has been blamed for at least 10,000 layoffs and the 
bankruptcies of three U.S. companies, Laclede Steel Co., Acme 
Metals Inc. and Geneva Steel Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to stanch the damage and give the domestic steel  
industry a chance to recover,'' said Byrd, ranking Democrat on the 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.9 billion emergency spending package also includes aid  
for economically strapped U.S. farmers, victims of Hurricane Mitch 
in Central America and Jordan after King Hussein's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has found evidence that Japan, Russia  
and Brazil have illegally dumped steel in U.S. markets at prices 
below production costs. The United States has reached a settlement 
agreement with Russia and plans to make final rulings this summer 
on whether to impose tariffs against Japanese and Brazilian steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has been seeking stronger sanctions as well  
from the administration and from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the loans should help companies  
avoid more layoffs and plant closings while waiting for the 
administration to take action. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, borrowers would contribute toward the  
program's $5 million administrative cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his budget request for the fiscal year starting Oct.  
1, proposed $300 million in tax credits to give money-losing steel 
companies the opportunity to spread their tax losses over five 
years, instead of the usual two. But many industry officials said 
the provision would do little to help them.

<HEADLINE>  Silver Charm Faces Big Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Baffert knows all about demanding  
races, and he's got one in the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the 5-year-old gray trained by Baffert, will face  
Puerto Madero and Free House in an intriguing race spiced with 
subplots. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who saddled the last two Kentucky Derby winners, calls  
this ``probably the toughest horse race I've ever been involved 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, goes  
into Saturday's race as a bit of a mystery horse. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to come from far behind to win the Jan. 10 San Pasqual at  
Santa Anita, then came up short in the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream 
on Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm finished third in that race, 5 1/4 lengths behind  
Puerto Madero, the Chilean import. So the 1 1/4-mile Big 'Cap provides 
a quick rematch between those two. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm's jockey, Gary Stevens, doesn't want his horse to  
lag behind as he did in the last two races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been focusing on getting him interested early,'' Stevens  
said. ``He's going to have to be a lot closer on Saturday. He's 
going to have to run the best race of his life to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always proven to us that he's a very special horse.''  
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the high weight at 124 pounds, is 12-7-1 in 21  
starts and is the richest active horse, with $6.7 million in 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero is trained by Richard Mandella, who also will send  
Event of the Year to the post. Mandella, going for an unprecedented 
third straight Big 'Cap win, didn't enter last year's champion, 
Malek, instead saving the horse for the Dubai World Cup late this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandella earlier planned to also race Puerto Madero next in  
Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just came out of the Donn so well that he helped us make up  
our minds to run in both the Big 'Cap and at Dubai,'' Mandella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Madero, who will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux and carry  
122, is 3-2-0 in six U.S. races. His overall record is 11-3-0 in 16 
starts, with earnings of $795,690. 
</P>
<P>
	The race also renews the Silver Charm-Free House rivalry. Free  
House has won two of their seven career meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the Santa Anita Derby and San Felipe Stakes two years  
ago, Free House is coming off a neck victory over Malek in the San 
Antonio Handicap on Feb. 7. He will carry 1234 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran great in the San Antonio, and he's come back to work in  
great fashion,'' rider Chris McCarron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another twist is provided by Event of the Year, a 4-year-old who  
was the early Kentucky Derby favorite in 1998 until he fractured a 
knee two weeks before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Event of the Year, who will have Corey Nakatani up and will  
carry 119, won the Strub Stakes at Santa Anita in his third start 
back from the injury. He is 5-1-1 in seven career races. 
</P>
<P>
	So Mandella, who will send out one-third of the six-horse field,  
would appear to have a good shot at winning the Big 'Cap again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a dream come true,'' he said. ``I have a hard time  
believing I've won two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field are Dr Fong, who raced in Europe and has run  
three times in the United States, including finishing second in the 
Strub; and Sidon, who finished first in the 1998 Chilean Derby but 
was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Solis will ride Dr Fong, 117; and Eddie Delahoussaye will  
be on Sidon, 114.

<HEADLINE> Actor Richard Kiley Dies at 76 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Richard Kiley, who was Broadway's original ``Man  
of La Mancha'' and had countless other roles on TV, in movies and 
on the stage, died Friday at 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiley, who died in Warwick, N.Y., was a strong-voiced baritone  
who became of one of Broadway's stalwart leading men in musicals 
and dramas of the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in ``La Mancha,'' that Kiley, singing ``The Impossible  
Dream,'' had his biggest success. He won a Tony Award for his role 
as Don Quixote in the musical, which opened in 1965 and ran for 
more than five years. He returned to Broadway in revivals of the 
show in 1972 and 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor also won a Tony for his performance in ``Redhead,'' a  
Victorian murder-mystery musical that starred Gwen Verdon and was 
directed by Bob Fosse. 
</P>
<P>
	On television, Kiley appeared in ``The Thorn Birds,'' one of the  
most successful miniseries of all time, and won an Emmy Award for 
playing an Australian sheep farmer. He also won Emmys for the TV 
series ``A Year in the Life,'' which lasted only a year on NBC, and 
for ``Picket Fences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the movies in which he appeared were ``The Blackboard  
Jungle,'' ``The Little Prince,'' ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' 
``Endless Love'' and ``Patch Adams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kiley was born in Chicago and studied at Loyola University and  
Barnum Dramatic School. After serving in the Navy during World War 
II, he got his first big break touring in the national company of 
``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' He replaced Anthony Quinn in the role 
of Stanley Kowalski. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiley first gained notice in New York in 1953, appearing in a  
revival of George Bernard Shaw's ``Misalliance'' and winning a 
Theater World Award, given to promising newcomers. Later that year, 
he played the caliph in ``Kismet'' and sang the show's hit song, 
``Stranger in Paradise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kiley starred with Diahann Carroll in 1962 in ``No Strings,''  
the only Broadway musical for which Richard Rodgers wrote the music 
and lyrics. In this tale of an interracial romance, Carroll played 
a high-fashion model and Kiley, a jaded, prize-winning novelist. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiley also appeared on Broadway in an adaptation of Allen  
Drury's ``Advise and Consent'' in 1960 and Alan Ayckbourn's comedy 
``Absurd Person Singular'' in 1974. He starred in a praised 1987 
revival of Arthur Miller's ``All My Sons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kiley's first marriage, to Mary Bell Wood, ended in divorce.  
They had six children. In 1968, he married Pat Ferrier, a dancer he 
had met in ``Redhead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be private.

	Dow Up 200 Points  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than  
200 points today and is on pace for an all-time high close. Just 
before 2 p.m. EST, the Dow was up 214.07 to 9,681.47. Leading the 
Dow higher today was IBM, which was still gaining on yesterday's 
news that it agreed to sell Dell Computer Corp. $16 billion in 
parts over seven years. IBM was up 6 at 177. Twenty-nine of the 30 
Dow components rose this morning, with Union Carbide being the only 
one to fall. Advancers led decliners on the NYSE 2,001-867. The 
Nasdaq Composite Index was up 32.31 to 2,325.20.

	Clinton Meeting With Italian Leader  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Italian Prime Minister  
Massimo D'Alema, meeting at the White House, posed stiffly for 
photographers and made no comments one day after the acquittal of a 
U.S. Marine pilot in the cable car accident that killed 20 skiers 
in Italy a year ago. The meeting between the two leaders had been 
set up long ago, and it was mere coincidence that it came on the 
heels of the acquittal. 

</P>
<P>
	Italy Stunned by Marine's Acquittal  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Angered by the acquittal of a U.S. Marine pilot,  
Italians demanded justice today for 20 people who were sent 
plunging to their deaths when his jet ripped through a gondola 
cable in the Alps. Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, was acquitted yesterday 
at Camp Lejeune, N.C., of 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for 
the Feb. 3, 1998 tragedy, in the Cavalese ski resort in northern 
Italy. He still faces an obstruction of justice charge. ``The 
victims didn't get the justice they deserved,'' said Fausto 
Bertinotti, head of the small but influential Communist 
Refoundation party. ``This is not only the acquittal of a pilot, 
this is the acquittal of an entire system.''

	Court Nixes Anti-Violence Law  
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal law that gives civil rights  
protections to victims of gender-motivated violence is 
unconstitutional, a divided federal appeals court ruled today. The 
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 7-4 to uphold a lower 
court's ruling against the Violence Against Women Act, which allows 
women to sue their sex attackers for damages in federal court for 
violating their civil rights. It has been the target of several 
legal challenges since it became law in 1994. The appeals court 
ruled that Congress overstepped its bounds when it relied on its 
power to regulate interstate commerce to enact the law.

	Albright Urges Peace in Indonesia  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
urged Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to do all he can to keep 
East Timor from erupting in bloodshed if the territory chooses 
independence. ``Violence is the enemy of democracy, security and 
prosperity,'' she said today. ``We will not walk away,'' Habibie 
responded, according to a senior U.S. official present at their 
two-hour meeting. Indonesia is the last stop for Albright on a 
weeklong Asian tour that included visits to Thailand and China.

	Dole Pushes for Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole is pushing ethnic  
Albanian leaders today to immediately sign a peace plan for Kosovo, 
hinting that the deal must be settled before rebels can visit 
Washington. Dole, who was in the region at President Clinton's 
request, had to meet the ethnic Albanian leaders in the Macedonian 
capital of Skopje because he was blocked from entering neighboring 
Yugoslavia when the government denied him a visa. The Republican is 
a longtime ally of the ethnic Albanians.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Four black men whose murder convictions were  
overturned after a group of student journalists uncovered new 
evidence agreed to a $36 million settlement today with Cook County. 
``This county is recognizing the extent of the gross misconduct and 
the extent of the incredible injuries that these men suffered,'' 
said Larry Marshall, a Northwestern law professor who represented 
one of the men. The men claimed that the sheriff's police who 
investigated the 1978 killings were racists who hid evidence that 
would have helped the defense while ignoring leads pointing to the 
real killers.

	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Former major league pitcher Ken  
Robinson was buried in his Arizona Diamondbacks uniform today, five 
days after he was killed in a car accident in which a teammate was 
driving drunk. About 100 people attended Robinson's funeral service 
in Jacksonville. Robinson, 29, was the lone passenger in teammate 
John Rosengren's car when it left a Tucson highway and overturned 
Sunday night. Robinson was declared dead at the scene.

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Trooper Killed Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A state trooper was shot and killed during  
a self-defense exercise by a fellow officer who forgot his gun was 
loaded, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Wagner, 37, was shot once in the chest Thursday at the  
patrol's station in North Platte. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Lincoln County Attorney Kent Turnbull, officers had  
completed one defensive training segment when a trooper loaded his 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	After a break, officers began another training session that also  
involved pointing unloaded weapons, but the trooper forgot his 
weapon was loaded, Turnbull said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges will be filed against the trooper, whose name was not  
disclosed, because the shooting was an accident, Turnbull said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a terrible tragedy, not only for Mark Wagner and his  
family but for the other trooper involved as well,'' Turnbull said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Patrol Maj. Bryan Tuma said Thursday that Wagner, a  
12-year veteran, was taking part in annual training when shot with 
either a Glock .40-caliber or .45-caliber semiautomatic. 
</P>
<P>
	No civilians or officers from other departments were in the room  
when the shooting happened, Tuma said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuma said troopers are not required to wear bulletproof vests  
during the training. He did not think Wagner was wearing one. 
</P>
<P>
	North Platte is about 220 miles west of Lincoln.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- In a story March 4 on the Venezuelan  
economy, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Finance 
Minister Maritza Izaguirre predicted the economy would shrink by 
3.8 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she expected it to shrink by 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jets Sign LB Phifer to 3-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Jets strengthened an already  
solid position Friday by agreeing to a three-year contact with 
linebacker Roman Phifer. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement with the eight-year veteran were not  
disclosed, but Phifer was seeking a deal for close to $3 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Phifer had 99 tackles and 6 1/2 sacks last season for St. Louis and  
has 820 tackles, 16 1/2 sacks and seven interceptions for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Phifer could mean the end of James Farrior's  
short tenure in New York. Farrior, selected in the first round of 
the 1997 draft, was a starter for much of his rookie year. But he 
lost his job to Bryan Cox last season and would appear to be 
vulnerable because he plays the same outside position as Phifer. 
</P>
<P>
	New York does not have a first-round draft pick in the April  
draft and might try to package Farrior to get one. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox had a superb season for the Jets and the other outside  
linebacker, Mo Lewis, was an All-Pro. There is decent depth at the 
position, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets also are concerned about Marvin Jones, who is returning  
from a major knee injury and missed all of last season. The team 
told veteran Pepper Johnson it would not re-sign him and Dwayne 
Gordon is a free agent.

<HEADLINE> Feds Accuse Wal-Mart of Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A federal lawsuit accuses Wal-Mart of  
trying to screen out disabled job applicants through a 
questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit accuses the country's largest retailer of violating the  
Americans with Disabilities Act with a pre-employment questionnaire 
that asked questions about disabilities, attorneys for the U.S. 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The questionnaire asked applicants to indicate if they might  
need any accommodation to perform required duties. The EEOC says it 
is illegal to ask about disability before a job offer is made. 
</P>
<P>
	``An employer is entitled to know if someone can do a job, but  
the question is: At what point?'' EEOC attorney David Kelley said 
of the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart officials said the questionnaire was designed to  
accommodate job applicants, not discriminate against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want an applicant to give up their current job, come  
to work for Wal-Mart and then find out that we couldn't accommodate 
their needs,'' said Melissa Brown, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also said Wal-Mart had removed questions about  
disabilities from its questionnaire in December 1997, following 
previous legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said EEOC investigators found the questionnaire being  
used in stores as recently as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wal-Mart had assured the commission that they were no longer  
using the form,'' Kelley said. ``We learned during our 
investigation that they continued to use it in various facilities 
in California, Texas, Arizona and elsewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton-D'Alema Text 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	D'ALEMA: We want -- we both want the Rambouillet peace accord to  
be signed. We ask this with great determination. We ask this of 
Albanians, Kosovo Albanians, for whom this peace agreement means 
autonomy, safety and recognition of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	And we ask the same with great determination of the federal  
--Yugoslav Republic and Serbia Republic, which have a duty to 
respect the rights of Kosovo Albanians, and for them the peace 
accord means putting an end to guerrilla activities and showing 
respect for the territory -- integrity of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	We are ready to take upon ourselves our responsibilities as we  
did in Bosnia and Albania together with our allies. We are ready to 
deploy our forces to ensure peace and security in that war-torn 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	We also talked about Russia, the very serious problems in  
Russia, the need for a common strategy between Europe and the 
United States to help Russia to embark the path of a more solid 
democracy, an open and functioning market economy. 
</P>
<P>
	I also expressed to the president of the United States my own  
personal gratitude for his commitment to peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	And I repeated to him our commitment to support and encourage  
that peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	It was very interesting for me to have a dialogue on the major  
problems of the economy and of societies, making a comparison 
between the experiences and problems of Europe and the United 
States of America. 
</P>
<P>
	We admire the American economic dynamism and American capability  
for innovation for job creation and creation of wealth. At the same 
time, we are very fond of the social rights and social solidarity 
which is one of the assets of Europe. This is indeed a major issue 
for a shared dialogue and effort at finding news ways between 
Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	How do we combine together strong economic dynamism with the  
values of social solidarity? We have opened a dialogue on this 
issue, on this major issue, which President Clinton so many times 
has been actively engaged upon. And I suggested to him that after 
the forum that was held in New York with Prime Minister Prodi, with 
Tony Blair, with President Clinton himself, I suggested to him that 
after that dialogue we could have a similar dialogue including 
European and American intellectuals and political leaders, and 
President Clinton told me he will think about this idea, namely, 
about the possibility for a new dialogue of this nature. 
</P>
<P>
	And we would be very pleased to host it in our country and  
organizing it. 
</P>
<P>
	It is very important for me that, as well as having a loyal and  
active alliance at a military and political level, we can develop a 
common dialogue and rethinking together. The world is confronting 
us with major challenges and we must and can search for the answer 
to these challenges together. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Thank you. Now we'll alternate questions between the  
American and Italian press. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry?  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, the prime minister said yesterday that he was  
baffled by the acquittal of the marine pilot and that he felt that 
the accident was a massacre. What do you say to Italians who feel 
that justice has not been done and that if the pilot is not guilty 
then someone else is? 
</P>
<P>
	And to the prime minister, sir, could you say, do the  
president's remarks today about this, do you think that they will 
calm the anger in Italy? How far will they go? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, let me answer, first of all. Because there are at  
least two further court-martial proceedings to go forward, I have 
to be quite careful in not making any comments that will have any 
kind of impact in those one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
	To me, the important thing now is that the United States must  
clearly and unambiguously shoulder the responsibility for what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Our presence in Italy and our air operations, our training  
operations, were the context, the environment in which this 
horrible thing occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	I think the things that we can do are, first of all, to work  
closely with the Italians, as I've said, to make sure that we have 
done everything we can to reduce the prospect to zero that 
something like this will occur again and that our Italian 
counterparts agree with that and will agree with the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, that we do what is appropriate by the families. And  
there was a modest cash settlement given to each of the victims' 
families shortly after the accident to deal with the immediate 
expenses. And under Italian law, they can -- they file claims 
adjudged by the Italians and then we pay 75 percent of those claims 
under our agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	And the third thing is to do everything we can to have a just  
disposition of the cases that are now going through. And I'm 
committed to all three things. I will do the best I can. 
</P>
<P>
	I also think it's very important -- I don't know that my words  
could ever ease the pain of someone who lost a child or a parent or 
a sibling or a spouse in that terrible accident. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least, it's important for the people of Italy and for  
those families to know that the United States is not trying to duck 
its responsibility and that we are heartbroken and horrified by 
what happened. And we're going to do our best to make sure that 
nothing like that ever happens again. 
</P>
<P>
	D'ALEMA: I think President Clinton spoke very clearly.  
</P>
<P>
	I think President Clinton spoke very clearly. We are not asking  
for a scapegoat. I do not know who was responsible for what 
happened. It is up to the justice system to determine who was 
responsible and who was guilty. But we expect that at the end of 
this process, it is clear and it is determined who is responsible 
and those who are found responsible are punished through a fair 
trial. We are confident that this will happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Prime Minister D'Alema, you touched upon something that we  
Italian journalists have very much at heart, the Cavalese events. 
But I ask you to make an effort, could you please very sincerely 
say to us, are you satisfied with the answer given by President 
Clinton on this specific point, on the Cavalese charges. 
</P>
<P>
	And I'd like to ask President Clinton, were you expecting a  
verdict of acquittal on this case? 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	D'ALEMA : Let me repeat, I appreciated --let me repeat, I  
appreciated President Clinton's words very much and the commitment 
he has taken. I consider them to be serious commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for  
what happened is found guilty and punished. With so many 
casualties, with so many deaths, you can hardly ever say you are 
satisfied. It is a word I cannot use. But let me say very clearly 
that I have appreciated very much, and I think we should appreciate 
the great human sincerity with which President Clinton has shared 
this tragedy, with no arrogance, with no sense of detachment. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Sir, let me say again, because the person involved in  
that court-martial is facing another action, and because there is 
yet another action against another person who was in the plane, 
another trial pending, I cannot comment on what my reaction to the 
verdict was. 
</P>
<P>
	Because anything I say, under our law, that goes across the  
airwaves, could be inferred one way or the other to have an impact 
on a pending proceeding in ways that would be disastrous for what I 
think we all want, which is an orderly and just process. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen?  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. Clinton, I have a couple of foreign policy questions. Do  
you expect a breakthrough on Kosovo? And especially in view the 
policy seems to be attacking or threatening Serbia and then 
retreating. It's constant. And my other question is, how can you 
justify chipping away at the ABM Treaty which helped keep the peace 
during the Cold War and pour billions and billions into a Star Wars 
defense against the possibility that starving North Korea might 
fire a missile at us? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all . . . You know, I -- she's been doing  
this for quite a long time. And it's not a fair fight, she's better 
at it than I am.

<HEADLINE> Noisemakers Punished With Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LUPTON, Colo. (AP) -- They don't take requests at this  
after-hours club and there's definitely no karaoke. The DJ is a 
police officer, and he's ready to bounce anyone who dances or 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Employing something like the aversion therapy in the movie ``A  
Clockwork Orange,'' Municipal Judge Paul Sacco requires people 
convicted of violating the city's noise ordinance to listen to 
music they don't like. 
</P>
<P>
	The noise scofflaws -- most of whom got in trouble for playing  
their stereos too loud -- gather once a month, on a weekend night, 
to listen to court-selected songs. The offenders are mostly young, 
so there is a heavy dose of lounge music, including Wayne Newton 
and Dean Martin, plus some Navajo flute music, bagpipes and John 
Denver songs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the most recent session, the group of seven heard one of  
the judge's own jazz compositions, ``I'm Sleeping in My Car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen-year-old David Mascarenas was apparently scared  
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to jam no more,'' he said. ``I took my stereo  
out already. I don't want to be hassled no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Court coordinator Patrice Redearth, who suggested the one-hour  
music treatment, said she got her first playlist by asking her 
17-year-old ``what the kids would hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The worst selection was the ``Barney'' theme song, said Ryan  
Bowles, 21, adding, ``If you laugh they cite you for contempt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DJ policeman, Joe Morales, said there's something annoying  
for everyone, and it works. He recalled having problems ``with one 
kid three or four times. He came here once and he hasn't been 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A requiem might have been the most appropriate choice for the  
most recent session, Feb. 26. It certainly looked like a funeral. 
One teen wore a shirt that read, ``I hate this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they fall asleep their eyes will be pried open,'' said  
clerk Patrice Redearth, in a joking reference to ``A Clockwork 
Orange,'' in which a gang member involved in a rape is forced to 
watching sickening videos, his eyes pinned open, while listening to 
Beethoven, his favorite composer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacco's program debuted Dec. 5 in this agricultural and  
industrial town of 5,200 people 30 miles north of Denver. The 
sessions are held in City Hall. Most of the offenders are 
rap-loving teens. But not all. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a guy who was 45 who got a ticket for listening to  
Bob Seger,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacco, who is 45 himself and has been playing blues guitar since  
he was 10, said the point he is trying to make is that ``it's wrong 
to impose your music or style on someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got guys going around now with 15-inch speakers in a  
small car with a 1,000-watt amplifier,'' the judge said. ``Maybe 
the ordinance will help them save their ears.''

<HEADLINE> Committee OKs $1B Loan for Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Appropriations Committee is backing  
a $1 billion loan program for steel producers struggling because of 
low-priced imports, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, attached to a wide-ranging supplemental spending  
measure for fiscal 1999, was based on legislation by Sen. Robert 
Byrd, D-W.Va., the committee's ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel companies would be able to make use of the loans through  
the end of 2001 and would have six years to pay the money back. 
</P>
<P>
	``This loan guarantee program is designed to give steel makers  
access to an infusion of capital that can help them survive until 
trade mechanisms are put into place to end this steel-import 
crisis,'' Byrd said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's surge in imports triggered by the Asian economic  
crisis has been blamed for at least 10,000 layoffs and the 
bankruptcies of three U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has found evidence that Japan, Russia  
and Brazil have illegally dumped steel in U.S. markets at prices 
below production costs. The United States has reached a settlement 
agreement with Russia and plans to make final rulings this summer 
on whether to impose tariffs against Japanese and Brazilian steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry has been seeking stronger sanctions as well  
from the administration and from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the loans should help companies  
avoid more layoffs and plant closings while waiting for the 
administration to take action. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan program was part of the $1.9 billion emergency spending  
bill that includes aid for economically strapped U.S. farmers, 
victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America and Jordan after King 
Hussein's death. The Appropriations Committee endorsed the package 
Thursday, and the Senate is to take it up in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, a company would be able to borrow $25  
million to $250 million at market interest rates. Borrowers would 
contribute toward the program's $5 million administrative cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd said many companies now have problems borrowing money from  
banks because of uncertainties about future import trends. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his budget request for the fiscal year starting Oct.  
1, proposed $300 million in tax credits to give money-losing steel 
companies the opportunity to spread their tax losses over five 
years, instead of the usual two. But many industry officials said 
the provision would do little to help them.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Want Second Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles met with State Department  
and baseball officials Friday night in an effort to gain 
governmental approval for an exhibition game against Cuba in Havana 
on March 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos attended the meeting, as did Sandy  
Alderson, the executive director of baseball operations in the 
commissioner's office, according to a baseball official who spoke 
on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba and the Orioles agreed to the Havana game, according to  
unidentified sources quoted in Friday's editions of The (Baltimore) 
Sun and The Washington Post. But approval from the Clinton 
administration is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles wanted a return exhibition against the Cuban  
national team on April 3 at Camden Yards, and haggling over that 
game threatened to terminate the entire deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Friday, a State Department official, speaking on the  
condition of anonymity, said there appeared to be some progress but 
said there was no final agreement as yet. It was the first official 
acknowledgement of progress since discussions began in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the main hangup continued to be distribution  
of the proceeds. A State Department official is providing technical 
assistance to the parties on matters of U.S. law and policy, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman Lee McClenny said Friday that  
discussions about the possibility of a home-and-home series were 
continuing and that no final decisions had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speculate on the outcome of those talks at this point  
in time. I can say the reports that an agreement has already been 
reached are premature,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although negotiations have been slowed by political  
considerations, McClenny said it is the policy of the U.S. 
government to encourage these kinds of exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the Orioles will succeed in their discussions, and  
that the people of Cuba will have an opportunity to watch U.S. 
baseball in action,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks, which got under way in earnest two months ago, have  
reached a point where there is no more room for delay. Both sides 
would have to scramble to make travel arrangements and the Orioles 
would have to hastily cancel their March 28 spring training game 
against Boston at Fort Myers, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles are currently scheduled to face the Philadelphia  
Phillies in an exhibition game in Alabama on April 3 and open the 
regular season April 5. If there is to be a home game against Cuba, 
the Orioles will have less than a month to print and sell tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's a minor consideration compared to the vast obstacles  
the home-and-home series still must clear. Before the Orioles could 
play in Cuba, approval must come from major league baseball, the 
Cuban government and the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Cuba and major league baseball were unable  
to reach an agreement in January when Angelos, who has long wanted 
to play in Cuba, visited Havana. Angelos has since met with 
officials in Washington in an effort to clear a path for the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos did not return telephone messages Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The main hurdle has been over the use of proceeds from the  
exhibition games. The Clinton administration does not want profits 
to go to the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro. The 
Americans have suggested the money go to the Cuban operation of the 
Roman Catholic charity Caritas. Cuban leaders suggest using the 
money to help Cuban doctors in Central America who are assisting 
victims of Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of having the Orioles play in Cuba has been criticized  
by Cuban exiles and national groups in Florida, which oppose 
contact with the Castro government that seized power 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban exile groups, responding to the latest news, plan a Sunday  
protest during an exhibition game between the Orioles and the 
Florida Marlins at Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this exhibition game takes place it will forever taint  
American baseball history,'' Pedro Solares of the group Agenda Cuba 
said. ``We hope that the Orioles players do not allow themselves to 
be part of what will be a tragic manipulation of the sport.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest Tested by Constant Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Even for the Pacific Northwest, this is a  
soggy year, with a near-constant drizzle that has plunged even 
longtime residents into a gray funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's horribly depressing,'' said Dan Bentrup of Vancouver,  
Wash., whose window-washing business has slowed to a crawl since 
the rains began in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually defensive -- even boastful -- about their wet climate,  
Northwest natives say they're having a tough time weathering this 
winter not because of how hard it has rained, but because of how 
often. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifelong Oregon resident Sheila Stokes said: ``I have been  
tested by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Nov. 1 through Feb. 28, rain fell in Portland on 93 out of  
120 days, breaking the record of 91 days set in 1955-56. Over the 
same period, Seattle got rain on 90 days, a record for gloom in the 
Emerald City. And there's no sign it's letting up. It has rained 
every day in March so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chances of a warm, dry spring are pretty remote,'' said  
Oregon state climatologist George Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, sour moods can be blamed on seasonal affective  
disorder, a condition brought on by too little sunlight. People get 
tired and depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can just see it in everybody,'' said Michelle Dwyer,  
wearing a trench coat. ``Drivers have no tolerance. People are 
crabby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strolling through a Portland shoe store, Clarice Jackson  
longingly eyed a pair of red, open-toed sandals that wouldn't last 
three seconds on the soggy city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so depressing,'' Ms. Jackson said, holding the  
strappy sandal in her palm for a brief moment before reluctantly 
trading it for a sensible, water-resistant pump. ``I just want to 
see the sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a briefest of moments one day this week, downtown Portland  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	Bentrup hurried to take advantage of the break in the weather to  
wash the windows of a downtown building. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hallelujah!'' said Bentrup, squinting skyward. ``I'm not sure  
what that giant glowing orb is. It's a little scary. But it feels 
good.''

<HEADLINE> Wrongly Convicted Awarded Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Four black men who were imprisoned for a double  
murder for two decades until some journalism students proved their 
innocence won an unprecedented $36 million settlement from the 
county Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys called it the biggest settlement ever reached in a  
civil rights lawsuit stemming from police misconduct in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The four men had sued Cook County, claiming the sheriff's  
officers who investigated the 1978 case were racists who hid 
evidence that would have helped the defense while ignoring leads 
pointing to the real killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the wrongly convicted men went to death row; the other  
two got life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	All were freed from prison in 1996 and pardoned after  
Northwestern University journalism professor David Protess and 
three students proved a prosecution witness had lied. Three other 
men were later convicted of the killings and sentenced to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``No amount of money can be satisfactory for what has been done  
to us,'' said one of the men wrongly sent to death row, Dennis 
Williams, 42. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone asked me 18 years ago, `Can I buy your life for  
$100 million or can I borrow your life for $100 million for 18 
years?' I would have said hell, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four men said they plan to donate some of the money to  
efforts to help free other inmates who have been wrongly convicted. 
They declined to say what their other plans were. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, Kenny Adams, Verneal Jimerson and Willie Raines were  
in their 20s when they were convicted of the gang rape and murder 
of Carol Schmal and Lawrence Lionberg. The two were abducted from a 
gas station. Their bodies were found in the Chicago suburb of Ford 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that never leaves you,'' said Adams, 41, who  
was serving a life sentence. ``You think about it every day. You 
can never feel comfortable again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams works with Protess investigating cases, Adams is  
employed at United Parcel Service and Jimerson does detail work on 
cars. Raines, who lives in Wisconsin, did not attend a news 
conference with the three others. As of a year ago, he was a 
maintenance man at a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the county recognizing the extent of the gross  
misconduct and the extent of the incredible injuries these people 
suffered,'' said Larry Marshall, a Northwestern law professor who 
represents Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine, who was not in  
office when the case was prosecuted, said the men had asked for $77 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the plaintiffs cannot recover the years they spent  
incarcerated, this settlement compensates them fairly,'' Devine 
said. His office would not comment on the men's allegations of 
police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 11 men have been released from death row in Illinois  
since capital punishment was restored -- as many as have been 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
	The man most recently freed from death row was released last  
month -- also after Protess and some of his students obtained a 
confession from another man.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Still Unsure About Guillen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates gained more  
information about outfielder Jose Guillen's unsettled visa 
situation Friday. They're not certain if it is good news or not. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Cam Bonifay doesn't expect Guillen in camp until  
next week at the earliest, but said there has been some movement 
toward resolving his unsettled status. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I optimistic? I'm always optimistic,'' Bonifay said. ``We  
found out some information today, and we hope it is positive. We 
hope he'll be here next week. ... But I'd say the odds don't run 
better than 50-50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service so far has declined  
to readmit Guillen into the United States from his native Dominican 
Republic. Guillen visited Pittsburgh last month for medical 
treatment, but questions about his visa status arose before he 
could return for spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	There apparently is some question about documentation --  
apparently a marriage license -- that Guillen filed with the U.S. 
government. Guillen is listed as single in the Pirates' 
just-published media guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We received a lot more information today, we understand the  
situation and the battle he has had to go through,'' Bonifay said. 
``The embassy made a statement and we have to get that cleared up. 
There's an investigation going on and that investigation must be 
finalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen, the Pirates' right fielder the last two seasons, has  
missed 10 days of camp.

<HEADLINE> Iditarod Mushers Ready for Nome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Martin Buser spent a good chunk of time  
mapping a strategy for winning his fourth Iditarod Trail Sled Dog 
Race. 
</P>
<P>
	But given all of the things that can happen during the  
1,100-mile race, he doesn't really expect to follow that plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You usually end up throwing it out, but it's good to put it  
down on paper,'' said Buser, who will be among the 56 mushers 
leaving the starting chute Saturday in the race's 27th edition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferocious weather, angry moose, lame dogs and smashed sleds are  
among the trail hazards that can befall mushers trying to make 
their way across the wilds from Anchorage to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	There are, however, no strategies or dangers on the first day,  
which is mostly ceremonial. Teams travel leisurely through the city 
while carrying high-paying race fans in their sleds. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans, called Iditariders, have shelled out up to $4,000 each  
for the 11-mile trip along Anchorage's wooded trails. Among this 
year's group are several celebrities -- comedienne and talk-show 
host Joan Rivers, soap-opera star Susan Lucci, and husband-and-wife 
actors Gary Collins and Mary Ann Mobley. 
</P>
<P>
	The real competition begins Sunday, when the race restart is  
held in the town of Wasilla, 40 miles north of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, the trail quickly heads out of populated areas and  
into the rugged and roadless wilderness en route to the Bering Sea 
coast, which it hugs for the final 225 miles to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Buser on the trail will be defending champion Jeff King,  
also a three-time winner; Montana musher Doug Swingley, who set the 
race record of 9 days, 3 hours in 1995; perennial front-runner 
DeeDee Jonrowe and five-time champ Rick Swenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson last won the Iditarod in 1991 by pressing on through a  
blizzard in the final 100 miles, while other front-runners 
retreated to shelter. He hasn't finished higher than fourth since 
then, but this year he's taking a page out of his old playbook in 
an effort to grab the $54,000 top prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going back to my old tactics of being more patient, and  
trying to make a race out of it at the end, instead of at the 
beginning, like Martin (Buser) and Doug Swingley,'' Swenson said. 
``I'll be trying to stay within striking distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iditarod's best time is two days faster than when Swenson  
last triumphed, as top mushers have increasing bred speedy sprint 
dogs with their endurance dogs to pick up the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, the only non-Alaskan ever to win the race, said he's  
banking on his team of young dogs with a little Iditarod experience 
setting a tempo that will daunt more veteran teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old dogs, 6 or 7 years old, they can't help but get stiff  
trying to run with these young guys,'' Swingley said. ``It's like a 
50-year-old guy trying to work out with a 20-year-old. You can do 
it, but you'd be stiff and sore every morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the mushers in the field aren't in the race to win, but  
instead have set their sights on placing in the top 20, which would 
earn them at least $8,500 from a total purse of $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Race rookie Dan Dent, an investment counselor from Baltimore,  
said he has trained hard for months with the even more modest goal 
of finishing ``next to last, or better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iditarod, named after an Interior Alaska gold-mining ghost  
town, commemorates the effort of mushers in relaying diphtheria 
serum to Nome during a 1925 epidemic. The race began in 1973, and 
is run along historic trails traveled by bygone prospectors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Senate `Ed-Flex' Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton threw his weight Friday  
behind efforts to attach his key school proposals to a small but 
popular Republican-sponsored education bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must make a long-term commitment now to hire 100,000 new,  
well-prepared teachers,'' Clinton said in a statement as senators 
ended the week without reaching agreement on the ``ed-flex'' bill, 
which would give states more freedom in how they spend federal 
education money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will use his weekly Saturday radio address to urge  
Congress to approve the spending for new teachers along with the 
ed-flex bill, the Education Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Friday, Education Secretary Richard W.  
Riley announced the grants that school districts will get later 
this year from the first round of the $1.2 billion in teacher 
money, approved by Congress last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., had said she would introduce a plan  
for a second round of grants when the Senate resumes debate on the 
ed-flex bill Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., filed another  
measure Friday to keep Democrats from expanding the ``ed-flex'' 
bill with key elements of their education agenda, including the 
new-teacher plan to help reduce class sizes in early grades across 
the country. The Senate will vote on two attempts to limit debate 
Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican governors, who pushed ed-flex in the first place,  
have urged Congress to pass a bill free of amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The jockeying is part of a battle between Republicans and  
Democrats to show who is most in touch with voters' education 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls indicate Democrats won that battle in recent years. This  
year, Republicans hoped to push through the bill that many states 
and governors applaud as getting the federal government out of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans, who pushed in the past to abolish the  
Education Department, are even reversing their stance regarding 
federal money for schools. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M., has suggested a 40 percent increase in federal 
school money over the next few years. House Republicans are working 
on an education tax break. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Democrats are introducing bills resembling the  
sweeping proposals Clinton outlined in his State of the Union 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he was willing to compromise on the ed-flex bill, but  
Democrats wouldn't agree to an acceptable time-limit on debating 
the proposals. Other Democratic amendments offered or considered 
involve dropout prevention and training for school principals. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said the Democrats are not giving up because the time to  
act is now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to begin to debate on education policy, there  
are other issues that merit consideration on an up-or-down vote,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A House version of the ed-flex bill will be voted on Wednesday.  
Aides say House Democrats will likely follow their Senate 
counterparts in proposing added measures on class-size reduction, 
school construction and after-school programs. And Republicans will 
respond with calls for more special education money. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders are still deciding how much to limit debate, if at  
all.

<HEADLINE> Padres Brass to Meet With Hoffman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- The top executives for the San Diego  
Padres, in town for their board of directors meeting, plan to sit 
down this weekend with star reliever Trevor Hoffman to discuss his 
contract situation. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers said Friday evening that it  
wouldn't be a formal negotiating session, but rather would be a 
chance for club president Larry Lucchino and possibly owner John 
Moores to talk with Hoffman, the best reliever in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, who is entering the final year of an $8.4 million,  
three-year contract, says he wants an extension completed by 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry feels very strongly about having Hoffman back,'' Towers  
said. ``I think he wants a chance to let him know that and find 
out, maybe hear some of the same things I heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towers met with Hoffman last week over dinner.  
</P>
<P>
	``He really wants to remain a Padre,'' Towers said. ``If he's  
forced to, he'll go out and test the free agent market, but he buys 
into what we're doing here and wants to remain a part of it. And he 
definitely wants to have it done before the season starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the Padres are willing to meet Hoffman's price remains  
to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said earlier Friday that he's seeking $8 million a year,  
at a minimum of four years with a no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres last offered $24 million for four years before talks  
broke down in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be a deal on my terms this time,'' said Hoffman,  
whose last two contracts were bargains for the Padres, the 
so-called San Diego discount. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said the contract matter wasn't a distraction, ``only  
because I'm more in the driver's seat, and I know that sounds a 
little cocky, but in the past, it's like we're going to them and 
hoping we get a long-term deal and hoping we get something worked 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hold that lottery ticket and I hope I can cash it in.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman converted 53 of 54 saves last year and was runner-up to  
Tom Glavine in the NL Cy Young voting. He is the team's career 
saves leader with 186. 
</P>
<P>
	Moores wouldn't comment on Hoffman's asking price, saying:  
``We're probably not going to negotiate through the media, per our 
club policy, but hopefully we can get together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, when Ken Caminiti was seeking an extension,  
Moores said no ballplayer was worth $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Is one worth $8 million?  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good question; I don't know that I have a good answer  
for that one. I think my comment has to be taken in the context of 
the time,'' Moores said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still faced with the same issues,'' Moores said. ``If  
we give too much money to one guy, are we better off with one 
really expensive guy or two medium expensive guys?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sides came close to a deal in November, and the Padres might  
have signed Hoffman for $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody sort of understands where the market is,''  
Moores said. ``I think we got very close before (Rupert) Murdoch 
single-handedly moved the salary curve. Now it's just going to take 
us a while to try to figure out where that is. I think Trevor 
responded, and so will we.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's Dodgers signed former Padres ace Kevin Brown to a $105  
million, seven-year deal in December.

<HEADLINE> Adelphia To Buy Century for $3.6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA Pa. (AP) -- Adelphia Communications Corp. is buying  
Century Communications Corp. for $3.6 billion in a deal that will 
make Adelphia the nation's fifth-largest cable television system 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
	Adelphia also will assume about $1.6 billion of Century's debt  
in the merger announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other cable operators, Adelphia and Century are trying to  
build customer bases and revenues by merging. Their deal, which 
must be approved by shareholders and government regulators, is 
expected to close during the third quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the acquisition of Century, Adelphia's annual revenues  
will exceed $2 billion and we will serve nearly 5 million 
customers,'' said John Rigas, chairman and CEO of Coudersport-based 
Adelphia. ``This transaction strengthens the company financially 
and adds significant talent to our management team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fast-changing market is causing a wave of mergers among  
telecommunications companies trying to keep pace, said Jeffrey 
Kagan, an industry analyst based in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the merger AT&AMP;T expects to close this month with  
TCI, the second-largest cable company, may not only affect the 
cable market but also could the way consumers get local telephone 
and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	For smaller companies trying to amass the resources to keep up,  
Kagan said, ``Consolidation is the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Tow, Century's chairman and CEO, said merging with  
Adelphia would create a nationwide cable operator capable of 
delivering advanced video and data services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adelphia shares our views with respect to the future of the  
industry, the opportunities for our shareholders and the importance 
of our employees,'' Tow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Century's Class A common stockholders will get $9.16 per share  
and 0.6122 shares of Adelphia Class A common stock for each share 
of their Century Class A common stock. Century's Class B common 
stockholders will get $11.81 and 0.6360 shares of Adelphia Class A 
common stock for each share of Century Class B common stock they 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	New Canaan, Conn.-based Century Communications owns and operates

<HEADLINE> Poland Amends Secret Files Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Parliament approved minor changes Friday  
to a long-debated law that would for the first time allow victims 
of communist-era repression to see their secret police files. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was passed in September following a decade of debate  
over whether opening old files from the 1944-89 communist regime 
would help or harm the country's efforts to deal with the painful 
decades of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist, vetoed the  
law Dec. 12, saying it would give too much power to an institute 
created by the law to manage the files. And he said all Poles, not 
only victims of totalitarian regimes, should be able to see their 
files. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ruling Solidarity-led coalition was able to overrule the  
veto by promising amendments that could give opposition more say in 
appointing members of the Institute of National Remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the powerful lower chamber, or Sejm, voted that  
institute members would be appointed by a 60-percent majority vote 
in parliament instead of simple majority. The Sejm also reduced the 
term of the institute's head from seven to five years. The 
amendments require approval by the Senate and the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, the institute will be charged not only with  
managing communist-era files, but also those relating to Stalinist 
and Nazi crimes. Besides making files available to victims, the 
institute also is empowered to launch investigations, which could 
lead to trials into cases of political persecution and murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of disclosing the past has divided Poles along  
political lines. The former communists are at the vanguard of the 
leftist political parties that oppose dredging up the past, arguing 
that the files are incomplete and full of misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
	However, figures from the powerful Solidarity movement that  
overthrew communism, including former President Lech Walesa, say 
the past must be confronted, even if that means government 
officials and others are victimized in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bill that requires government officials to declare  
whether they ever worked for or collaborated with the former 
security service went into effect in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Poland's first attempt to open secret files was in 1992 by the  
rightist government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski. But after 
lists of alleged secret agents were leaked, the government was 
toppled on a no-confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
	During the communist era, the secret police used informers to  
monitor virtually all aspects of daily life and routinely cracked 
down on people suspected of anti-government activism. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusations of who may have collaborated in the past continue to  
hound people in all areas of Polish society, including top 
government officials.

<HEADLINE> Marine Offers Gondola Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A day after his acquittal, the pilot  
of a Marine jet that sliced a ski gondola cable in the Italian Alps 
said Friday he would like to hug the relatives of the 20 victims if 
they'd let him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they would. I don't know how to put it into  
words,'' Capt. Richard Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby also said he and his three crewmates wrote the families a  
sympathy letter the day after the accident, but the Marines refused 
to deliver it. A public affairs officer told the aviators, ``We 
represent the Marine Corps, not you,'' Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, President Clinton met in the Oval Office with  
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, who on Thursday said he was 
baffled by the verdict. The meeting had been set up long ago, and 
it was mere coincidence that it came on the heels of the acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury of eight Marine officers acquitted Ashby of 20 counts of  
involuntary manslaughter and other charges in the Feb. 3, 1998, 
disaster near Cavalese, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ashby ignored altitude and speed limits, while  
his attorneys said that an alarm never warned Ashby he was flying 
too low and that an optical illusion made him think he was flying 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict enraged and embittered relatives of the victims --  
all of them Europeans -- as well as Italian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Americans were ``profoundly regretful and  
apologetic for what has occurred to the families and all of the 
people of Italy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But D'Alema was not reassured by Clinton's words.  
</P>
<P>
	``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for  
what happened is found guilty and punished,'' he said. ``With so 
many casualties and so many deaths, you can hardly ever say you are 
satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema said Thursday that Italy will explore its options for  
pursuing a case. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Friday, Ashby said of the victims' families:  
``I'd just like to give them a hug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's offer got a chilly response from Sindy Renkewitz, 20, a  
German whose father and sister were killed. Other relatives who 
attended Ashby's trial were returning home Friday and couldn't be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to ask him if he can go on and live his life as  
normal as before. I think I really need to do that,'' Renkewitz 
said. ``I cannot say what kind of apology I expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said the letter he and his crewmates wrote was an attempt  
``to get our thoughts and our prayers and our feelings to these 
families'' and might have made a difference in their attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said: ``What occurred on 3 February was a tragedy. We  
cherish life and take our jobs very seriously. We would never do 
anything to purposefully endanger the lives of others. We all share 
in your tremendous loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Jack Blau, the public affairs officer to whom Ashby spoke,  
said he didn't ``specifically recall'' the letter and would look 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said his life isn't the same. ``I don't know if there  
isn't a single aspect of my life that hasn't changed from this 
whole thing. That's when we come into the recovery phase,'' the 
aviator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once destined for a job flying the swifter F-18 fighter jets,  
Ashby said he doesn't know whether he will stay in the Marine 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just woke up this morning. It was kind of like the weekend's  
here, relax. That's about as far as I've gotten,'' he said. 
``Definitely a day at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of  
Westbury, N.Y., face obstruction of justice charges over a missing 
videotape Schweitzer shot during the flight. They could get a year 
in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer also is scheduled to stand trial March 22 on the same  
charges Ashby faced.

<HEADLINE> Ore. MDs Wary of Suicide Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Terminally ill patients in Oregon who want to  
use the nation's only assisted-suicide law are running into a 
little-known roadblock: Many doctors are unwilling to prescribe the 
deadly drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been trained to kill people,'' said Portland cancer  
specialist Dr. Jana Reddoch. ``I've been trained to help them live 
as long as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the 15 terminally ill people who used the law to end  
their lives last year were turned down by at least one doctor. And 
by the state's own informal sampling, 67 percent of doctors who 
treat terminally ill patients said they would refuse to participate 
in a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The law gives doctors and health care organizations the right  
not to participate on moral or ethical grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering for nearly two years with terminal colon cancer,  
37-year-old Brian Lovell of Hillsboro decided he would use the law 
to end his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovell's cancer specialist wanted nothing to do with it and sent  
him to another doctor who would write him a prescription for a 
lethal dose of barbiturates. Lovell died before he could use the 
pills. 
</P>
<P>
	His widow is bitter about the experience, particularly because  
her husband was so weak it was hard from him to visit one doctor, 
let alone two. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nightmare getting him there. He was so uncomfortable  
and nauseated,'' Martha Lovell said. ``It was one of the hardest 
days of his illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Katrina Hedberg, an epidemiologist with the Oregon Health  
Division, said that some doctors who refuse to take part in 
suicides might be worried about controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being an abortion doctor,'' she said. ``Doctors who  
take a stand and participate might be subjected to public 
harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some medical observers were surprised by the small number of  
terminally ill people who requested lethal drugs in the law's first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Susan Tolle, director of the Center of Ethics in Health Care  
at Oregon Health Sciences University, said she wonders whether some 
people simply dropped the idea after being unable to find a doctor 
to take part. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not people of unlimited energy. They are near  
death,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lovell said the main thing she learned was not to wait until  
a terminal illness is in its final stages before broaching the 
subject with a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have this discussion with the doctor until way late  
in the game,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Marcos' Swiss Accounts To Be Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine tax agency will seize  
$590 million in Swiss bank accounts held by the late President 
Ferdinand Marcos, an official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine National Bank has held the money in escrow since  
it was transferred by order of Swiss courts. The courts said the 
money could only be released to the Philippine government once it 
was proved to be part of Marcos' ill-gotten wealth and human rights 
victims were compensated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Supreme Court made public this week a Jan. 13  
ruling ordering the Marcos family to pay a $602 million inheritance 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a legal right over the money because we believe it  
forms part of the Marcos estate and assets,'' said Osias Baldovino, 
chief of the prosecution division of the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcos died in exile in Hawaii after fleeing a civilian-backed  
military uprising in 1986. President Joseph Estrada has estimated 
that Marcos' wealth exceeded $10 billion and might be as high as 
$15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a fraction of Marcos' wealth has been recovered after 12  
years of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $150 million of the Swiss money is supposed to go to 9,539  
Filipinos who won a class-action suit against the estate in U.S. 
District Court in Hawaii for torture, killings and the 
disappearance of dissidents during Marcos' rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcos' daughter, Imelda ``Imee'' Marcos-Manotoc, said the  
inheritance tax was excessive, adding that her family was unaware 
how much wealth her father actually left behind.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi To Face Kentucky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Kentucky might have ended the regular season on a  
sour note, but don't tell anybody in a Mississippi uniform that 
this is an off year for the No. 14 Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say they're down because they've lost two out of their  
last three. That's nonsense,'' says Ole Miss guard Michael White. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rebels (19-11) beat South Carolina 64-60 in Thursday's first  
round of the Southeastern Conference tournament to earn today's 
matchup with the Wildcats (22-8). 
</P>
<P>
	In other opening round games, Alabama beat Georgia 65-58,  
Mississippi State defeated Vanderbilt 76-58 and No. 21 Florida 
routed Louisiana State 97-75 as Greg Stolt and the Gators set 
tournament records for 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stolt was 8-for-15 on 3s, breaking the mark shared by three  
players, and finished with a season-high 27 points. Florida was 
17-of-36 outside the stripe, snapping the record of 16 set by 
Kentucky in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (the record) doesn't mean anything unless we win the  
championship,'' said Stolt. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Beshara led LSU (12-15) with 17 points.  
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate a track meet,'' said Florida coach Billy Donovan,  
whose Gators (20-7) play No. 22 Arkansas (20-9). Florida beat the 
Razorbacks 74-61 during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played them earlier when they didn't play particularly  
well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's other games at the Georgia Dome included Alabama (17-13)  
facing West champion and fourth-ranked Auburn (26-2), and 
Mississippi State (19-11) meeting East champ and No. 18 Tennessee 
(20-7). 
</P>
<P>
	``Kentucky will be a difficult game,'' said Mississippi coach  
Rod Barnes, in his first season as head coach of the Rebels. 
``They've a very talented team. We'll come in prepared and 
hopefully be in position to win the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What could make it even tougher is the fact Kentucky has never  
lost in the Dome, winning 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, despite losing four of its final seven games,  
Kentucky is still the defending national champion and has captured 
the SEC tournament two years in a row and six of the last seven 
years. The Wildcats also beat the Rebels 63-57 in their only other 
meeting this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome against Kentucky, Barnes believes beating  
South Carolina should have clinched an NCAA berth for the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope so. I think we should be in,'' he said. ``I think the  
SEC deserves seven teams, at least six, and I believe we're 
sixth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi beat the Gamecocks (8-21) despite failing to make a  
basket over the last 7:21 following a 3-pointer by Keith Carter. 
What the Rebels did, however, was make 11 of 14 free throws down 
the stretch to hold off the second-half scoring of the Gamecocks' 
BJ McKie, who scored 21 of his 28 points after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Smith matched his career high in scoring (24) and rebounds  
(14) for Ole Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama coach Mark Gottfried believes a win over Auburn could go  
a long way toward an NCAA bid, but it will be difficult. The 
Crimson Tide lost both regular season games to the Tigers -- 73-58 
at home and 102-61 at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are one of the best teams in the nation,'' he said. ``But  
we need to play a Top 5 team right now if we want to go to the 
NCAAs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Williams scored 29 points and Jeremy Hays added 15 points  
for the Crimson Tide. Georgia (15-14) was led by G.G. Smith with 13 
points. Jumaine Jones, the SEC's top scorer with a 19-point 
average, was held to 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State outrebounded Vanderbilt 51-31 and pulled away  
in the second half in what was the final game for Commodores coach 
Jan van Breda Kolff, who announced his resignation last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs are hoping the win clinched an NCAA bid.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope today was the one that got us in,'' said Mississippi  
State coach Rick Stansbury. ``Who knows? We've got 19 wins and have 
won six of our last nine. I think it's very important how you play 
down the stretch. But we don't know. We just have to keep on 
winning games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs beat Tennessee 88-82 in Knoxville in their only  
meeting earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt (14-15) failed to draw inspiration from van Breda  
Kolff's resignation. He closed out his six-year career at his alma 
mater with a 104-81 record.

<HEADLINE> USS Liberty Captain McGonagle Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Retired Navy Capt. William L. McGonagle, who  
received the Medal of Honor for heroism as skipper of the USS 
Liberty when Israel unleashed a deadly attack on the 
intelligence-gathering ship in 1967, has died. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	McGonagle died Wednesday in Palm Springs, where he lived, said  
Donald Pageler, editor of the Liberty News, a newsletter of the 
ship's survivors' association. He did not know the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four crewmen were killed and 171 were wounded when the  
Liberty was attacked by Israeli air force planes and torpedo boats 
in international waters north of Sinai during the Six Day War 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship was bombed with napalm, torpedoed and shelled.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack, blamed on a mistaken identification of the Liberty  
as an Egyptian ship, remains one of the most controversial events 
in U.S.-Israeli relations and led to allegations of a cover-up by 
the governments that persist to the present day. 
</P>
<P>
	McGonagle, who was severely wounded but stayed in command on the  
bridge through the battle and for many hours afterward, broke his 
silence years later and joined former shipmates in demanding the 
two governments release all details of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's about time that the state of Israel and the  
United States government provide the crew members of the Liberty 
and the rest of the American people the facts of what happened, and 
why ... the Liberty was attacked 30 years ago today,'' McGonagle 
said during a 1997 reunion of Liberty survivors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years I have wanted to believe that the attack on the  
Liberty was pure error,'' McGonagle said. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``it appears to me that it was not a pure case of mistaken  
identity. It was, on the other hand, gross incompetence and 
aggravated dereliction of duty on the part of many officers and men 
of the state of Israel,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel apologized to the United States but claimed there had  
been a misidentification and that the ship's markings were 
inadequate. Israel paid more than $12 million in compensation.

	Dow Ends At Record High  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average today rose  
268.68 points to end at a record high of 9,736.08, its first close 
ever above 9,700. The surge was sparked by a slight rise in 
unemployment and wages that eased investor concerns of rising 
interest rates. The Dow's previous record close of 9,643.32 and 
previous intraday high of 9,647.97 both took place on Jan. 8, 1999. 
In the last two days, the Dow has gained more 460 points, or 5 
percent. While that is the biggest two-day advance in points ever, 
surpassing a record of 447.98 last Oct. 15-16, the gain isn't close 
to a record in percentage terms. Leading the Dow higher today was 
IBM, which was up 7 5/8 at 178 5/8. Advancers led decliners on the NYSE 
2,076-914. The Nasdaq was up 45.38 at 2338.27.

	Clinton: U.S. Is Responsibile  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, with  
President Clinton at his side, said today he is ``personally 
shocked and so is the Italian public's opinion'' over the acquittal 
of an American pilot whose plane caused the cable-car accident that 
killed 20 skiers in Italy last year. At a joint news conference 
between the two leaders, Clinton assured his guest that ``the 
United States is not trying to duck its responsibility.'' Clinton 
said Americans were ``profoundly regretful and apologetic for what 
has occurred to the families and all of the people of Italy.'' But 
D'Alema was not reassured by Clinton's words. ``We shall say we are 
satisfied when whoever is responsible for what happened is found 
guilty and punished,'' he said.

a jet cut the cable of a ski gondola in the Alps. Capt. Richard 
Ashby, 31, was acquitted yesterday at Camp Lejeune, N.C., of 20 
counts of involuntary manslaughter for the Feb. 3, 1998, tragedy. 
He still faces an obstruction of justice charge.

	Clinton Wishes Lewinsky 'Good Life'

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that ``the  
American people are virtually screaming at us'' to get on with 
their business and put the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal to rest. The 
unrelenting question of the Lewinsky affair that led to Clinton's 
impeachment came up at a joint press conference with Italian Prime 
Minister Massimo D'Alema, and the president answered with yet 
another call for an end to it. ``What I hope is that she will be 
permitted to go on with her life,'' Clinton said. ``And I hope it 
will be a good life....''

	Social Security Specifics on Table

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders and President Clinton have  
put competing Social Security plans on the table, starting in 
earnest the debate over the retirement program's future. But their 
common ground is limited: Both sides want to use today's big budget 
surpluses to prepare Social Security for the flood of aging baby 
boomers expected to leave the system short of cash a decade from 
now. The differences are over how much of the surplus to commit 
right away, and how to use it.

and Wireless balloon, being flown by Andy Elson and Colin Elliot, 
took off from Spain on Feb. 17. They're now over the South China 
Sea. The pair have traveled 10,300 miles, and are steadily nearing 
the 15,200-mile mark set by American millionaire Steve Fossett in

	China Warns U.S. on Taiwan Missiles  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- U.S. inclusion of Taiwan in a regional  
anti-missile defense system could cause ``serious consequences'' 
for American relations with China, a senior Chinese official said 
today. The comments were the gravest public warning Beijing has 
delivered yet on a possible theater missile defense system. They 
came four days after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
tried to allay Chinese concerns over the system, now under study 
with Japan. Beijing regards Taiwan, once a staunch U.S. ally, as a 
rebel province to be reunified by force if necessary.

	Tyson To Serve More Time

probation for a 1992 rape conviction, according to court documents 
filed today. The former heavyweight champion, however, will not 
have to return to Indiana for the jail time under an agreement 
reached yesterday with Marion County (Ind.) Prosecutor Scott 
Newman.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Harry Miller quit as basketball coach at  
Baylor on Friday, one day after the Bears finished the 1998-99 
season without a single victory in the Big 12 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor announced Miller's departure at an 8 p.m. CST news  
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach was not at the conference, but had called the Waco  
Tribune-Herald earlier in the evening to tell them he was 
resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor lost to Oklahoma State 83-57 on Thursday in the first  
round of the Big 12 tournament, completing a 6-24 season that

<HEADLINE> Wrongly Convicted Awarded Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Four black men wrongfully convicted of murdering  
a couple nearly two decades ago have won $36 million from the 
county in what their lawyers say is the biggest settlement ever 
reached in a civil rights lawsuit over police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The four had sued Cook County, claiming the sheriff's officers  
who investigated the 1978 case were racists who hid evidence that 
would have helped the defense while ignoring leads pointing to the 
real killers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No amount of money can be satisfactory for what has been done  
to us,'' said one of the men wrongly sent to death row, Dennis 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone asked me 18 years ago, `Can I buy your life for  
$100 million or can I borrow your life for $100 million for 18 
years?' I would have said hell, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four were freed from prison in 1996 and pardoned after a  
group of student journalists at Northwestern University proved a 
state witness had lied. Three other men were later convicted of 
killing the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Mark Ter Molen, who represents one of the group now  
known as the Ford Heights Four, said Friday he would petition the 
county's chief criminal courts judge for a special prosecutor to 
investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of the settlement reflects the gravity of the  
misconduct that occurred in this case,'' Ter Molen said. ``We 
believe the evidence we found warrants review by a special 
prosecutor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was approved Friday during a meeting with Circuit  
Court Judge William Maddux. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, Kenny Adams, Verneal Jimerson and Willie Raines were  
in their 20s when they were convicted of the 1978 gang rape and 
double murder of a south suburban couple, Carol Schmal and Lawrence 
Lionberg. The two were abducted from a gas station. Their bodies 
were found in the Chicago suburb of Ford Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Jimerson went to death row; Raines and Adams were  
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that never leaves you,'' said Adams, referring  
to his time in the penitentiary. ``You think about it every day. 
You can never feel comfortable again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After months of discussions about how to wrap-up the  
embarrassing case, the Cook County Board decided to authorize the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the plaintiffs cannot recover the years they spent  
incarcerated, this settlement compensates them fairly,'' said Cook 
County State's Attorney Richard Devine. He said the settlement 
represents less than half of the $77 million the four had 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 11 men have been released from death row in Illinois  
since capital punishment was restored, including one man who was 
freed last month after Northwestern professor David Protess and 
some of his students found evidence of his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams now works with Protess investigating cases. He said the  
group expected to donate some of the settlement to efforts to help 
free other inmates who have been wrongly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams is employed at United Parcel Service and Jimerson does  
detail work on cars. Raines, who lives in Wisconsin, did not attend 
a news conference with the three others. As of a year ago, he was a 
maintenance man at a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement will be paid out in three installments over two  
years, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Mack Won't Seek Re-Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Connie Mack's decision not to  
seek re-election in 2000 gives Democrats a shot at a seat that was 
regarded as a lock for the two-term Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	No reason was given for the decision, but an adviser to Mack  
said he is resigning because he believes it's time to move on to a 
new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, 58, is expected to make a formal announcement in  
Washington on Monday about his future, deputy press secretary 
Bethany Rogers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors had swirled in recent weeks that Mack might leave the  
Senate. He was first elected in 1988 and easily defeated Hugh 
Rodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, in 1994 with 71 percent 
of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush tried last week to persuade Mack to remain in the  
Senate. The governor is ``surprised and disappointed,'' Bush 
spokesman Cory Tilley said. ``But he understands Sen. Mack's 
reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans now hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate, but must defend  
19 seats next year, compared with 14 for the Democrats. The 19 GOP 
seats include many held by first-termers who were pulled into 
office on the strength of the GOP landslide in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential candidates for Mack's seat include U.S. Reps. Mark  
Foley, a Republican, and Peter Deutsch, a Democrat. Others include 
state Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson, a former Democratic 
congressman, and Republican U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum, whose profile 
was raised as a prosecutor during President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Another politician who might run is former Republican state Sen.  
Charlie Crist, who lost to U.S. Sen. Bob Graham last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack's razor-thin victory over Democrat Buddy MacKay in 1988  
began a series of election victories that catapulted Republicans 
into control of Florida politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack won re-election by a resounding margin four years ago when  
the GOP gained control of the Florida Senate. The Republicans 
gained control of the House two years later and crowned off the 
sweep of state politics when Bush was elected governor last 
November.

<HEADLINE> Candy Maker Just Born Plans TV ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Peeps, those sugar-crusted marshmallow chicks  
that are an Easter basket staple, will make some noise this month 
with help from the creator of the California Raisins. 
</P>
<P>
	Candy maker Just Born Inc. is planning the first TV advertising  
for the candy since acquiring the brand about 46 years ago. The ads 
begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial features a computer-generated ensemble of  
marshmallow chicks and rabbits performing in a musical revue to a 
reworked version of the tune ``Rockin' Robin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ad was created by the New York agency Griffin Bacal and Will  
Vinton Studios, the Portland, Ore.-based production house that 
created the raisin characters that sang in ads for California 
growers more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Aimed mainly at mothers aged 25 to 35, the Peeps ad will be run  
on daytime shows aimed at women and on cable channels like Lifetime 
and the Weather Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Barratt, head of marketing for privately-held Just Born,  
declined to say how much is being spent to run the ads, but he 
expects 60 percent of the targeted women will see the ad five to 
six times in the four weeks leading to the holiday on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The candy, which sells in packs of 15 for less than $1.50 and in  
other sizes, has been growing without any advertising to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	While their appeal mystifies some consumers, Barratt said the  
gooey, sugary confections are popular with children and with adults 
who often got their first taste of them as children. Peeps are also 
used as Easter decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales have risen at a 13 percent clip over the past five years  
compared with 7 percent growth in the non-chocolate candy business, 
Barratt said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Peeps have been the top-selling non-chocolate Easter  
candy for at least four years but declined to offer sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	So why spend money on TV commercials?  
</P>
<P>
	``The confectionary arena is very competitive,'' Barratt said in  
a telephone interview. ``We want to make sure our brand is seen as 
the brand leader in that environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just Born, a 76-year-old company based in Bethlehem, Pa., and  
run by a grandson of founder Sam Born, hired Griffin Bacal last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	While the admakers were trying to come up with original music,  
they stumbled across Jimmie Thomas' 1958 song ``Rockin' Robin,'' 
wrote new lyrics and had the chicks sing ``Peeps, Peeps'' as the 
chorus. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad shows off the brand in all five colors -- yellow, pink,  
blue, lavender and white -- and assorted shapes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barratt cites one more reason he likes the ad -- it mentions  
the brand name 11 times in 15 seconds.

<HEADLINE> China Official Assails Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is guilty of dealing in  
double standards by highlighting what it considers human rights 
abuses around the world while ignoring a ``far from perfect'' 
rights situation at home, a Chinese official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu Shuning, a Chinese Embassy spokesman, responded at a news  
conference to the annual State Department human rights report 
released last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said China's human rights record deteriorated sharply  
late last year, citing a crackdown on political dissent that 
reversed signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu called the allegations unfounded and said ``great progress''  
was made in China in advancing political, economic, social and 
cultural rights under communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	He expressed special disappointment that the criticism of China  
came just weeks after the two countries resumed 
government-to-government dialogue on the rights question after a 
three-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope the U.S. side will give up this wrong approach and  
come back to the right track, and that is to handle and resolve the 
differences between the two countries on human rights through 
dialogue and consultations,'' Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that it would be unwise for the United States to  
pursue an anti-China resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission 
in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	That tactic has been tried seven times and failed seven times,  
he said, and ``If they do it again, they will fail again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's annual meeting begins next week. The  
administration has not said whether it will seek a China 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright raised human rights with  
Chinese authorities during her recent visit there and drew 
complaints that she was interfering in China's domestic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering the same argument, Yu said China ``firmly opposes''  
such meddling. 
</P>
<P>
	He defended recent arrests of political activists in China as  
appropriately stern action against those who attempt to overthrow 
the government. He said under U.S. law, those who attempt to 
subvert the democratic system can receive prison terms of 20 years 
and fines of $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu also suggested that pro-democracy activists in China receive  
support from outsiders. China does not tolerate such activity, nor 
does the United States, he said, noting stiff U.S. laws that bar 
foreign funding of political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	A chief U.S. complaint about China is the lack of a peaceful  
outlet for dissent regardless of circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Laundering Proposals Draw Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, joining a torrent of criticism  
from people worried about privacy, told the government Friday to 
withdraw proposed anti-money laundering rules that would track bank 
customers' habits. 
</P>
<P>
	By an 88-0 vote, the Senate expressed support for a measure  
directing bank regulators to drop the proposed rules, called ``Know 
Your Customer'' regulations. Senate Democrats blocked a vote on 
actual adoption of the measure, sponsored by Sens. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, and Wayne Allard, R-Colo., so it lacks the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is such a broad-reaching regulation that it infringes on  
our constitutional rights,'' Gramm, the chairman of the Senate 
Banking Committee, said on the Senate floor. He maintained that the 
rules would violate the Fourth Amendment prohibition against 
unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ever wondered whatever happened to the people in the  
former Soviet Union who used to run things there and now are 
permanently out of work, the answer is they're all in the Clinton 
administration, and they're running the banking authorities of this 
country,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Banking Committee on Thursday adopted an  
amendment to a big financial services bill that would kill the 
proposed banking rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and the  
nation's bankers have complained that the rules would transform 
every bank teller into a spy for Big Brother. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one federal regulator agrees with the Senate. U.S.  
Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr., who oversees 
nationally chartered banks, told a House subcommittee hearing 
Thursday that the rules should be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my judgment ... that the proposal should be promptly  
withdrawn,'' Hawke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawke and Donna Tanoue, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance  
Corp., said recently they were reconsidering the proposed rules, 
which were denounced in a flood of angry e-mail starting in 
December. The FDIC has received more than 170,000 e-mail messages 
and letters during the 90-day public comment period, which closes 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The other agencies involved in the matter are the Federal  
Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's bankers recently joined the chorus of people and  
groups urging banking agencies to withdraw the proposals, warning 
they could make Americans lose confidence in the banking system and 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations would require banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits. Money laundering is a major concern of law enforcement 
officials; it reached an estimated $30 billion in this country last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., noting that law enforcement  
priorities are involved, urged senators to be ``careful'' in their 
actions related to bank privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawke, in his House testimony, said any law enforcement benefits  
to be gained from the proposed bank rules ``are strongly outweighed 
by (their) potential for inflicting damage on the banking system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., voted present on the Senate  
measure Friday.

<HEADLINE> `Mob Mouthpiece' Enters Mayor Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- After more than three decades of being what  
some call the mouthpiece to the mob, attorney Oscar Goodman says 
he's ready to take on a new challenge -- as mayor of the nation's 
fastest-growing city. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, who calls himself an advocate for the underdog,  
announced Friday that he would seek the mayor's office in the city 
where he built a reputation of being the top counsel to some of 
America's leading wiseguys. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins a crowded race to replace Mayor Jan Jones, who is  
stepping down after eight years in office. The election is May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference in his office near the city's Glitter  
Gulch, Goodman addressed the image issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've represented people as vigorously as I know how,  
protecting their constitutional rights,'' said Goodman, 59. ``I've 
represented judges and mayors. If anybody has a problem with that, 
they shouldn't be allowed to vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's client list over the years includes former organized  
crime czars Meyer Lansky, Nick Civella and Anthony Civella; Frank 
``Lefty'' Rosenthal, a former sports book operator who left Las 
Vegas after his car was bombed; and boxer Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman gained additional fame by playing himself in the movie  
``Casino,'' and in a new documentary, ``Mob Law,'' in which he 
defends his passion for defending the mob. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Goodman's best-known clients is Tony ``The Ant'' Spilotro,  
obtaining his acquittal on two Chicago murder charges and defending 
him in a federal racketeering case that ended in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the racketeering trial, Spilotro was accused of overseeing  
the activities of the ``Hole in the Wall Gang'' that ripped off Las 
Vegas businesses in a $1 million crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Spilotro did anything wrong,'' Goodman said later,  
``shame on the prosecutors for not being able to convict him.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Warn Banks About Hacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's banks, already beset by Year 2000  
worries of customers taking out their money in droves, are being 
warned about another threat: computer hacking by 
``cyber-terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The office of the U.S. comptroller of the currency, which  
oversees nationally chartered banks, sent a notice to the banks 
Friday outlining the risks posed by ``cyber-terrorist'' attacks. 
The risks include compromise of private information, destruction of 
computer databases and codes, and manipulation of computer, 
satellite or telecommunications services, according to the 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they noted, bank employees and others with access  
to codes can sabotage computer systems, causing them to crash or 
destroying data. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of computer security problems at banks involve  
insiders, according to Kawika Daguio, a technology policy 
consultant at the American Bankers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take it seriously,'' Daguio said in a telephone interview.  
He said the regulators' notice to the banks ``brings additional 
attention ... to the importance of sound security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daguio says banks sometimes use a data-scrambling method that is  
far more difficult to crack than encryption codes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford A. Wilke, director of bank technology at the  
comptroller's office, said that although computer intrusions into 
bank systems are very rare, ``our goal is to raise awareness ... 
and ensure that national banks are taking appropriate 
precautions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the incidence of such intrusions, comptroller's  
office spokesman Dean DeBuck said they were virtually non-existent, 
making the regulators' action an attempt to ward off problems 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, banks must report computer crimes to law enforcement  
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the precautions recommended by the regulators:  
</P>
<P>
	--Strong systems for detecting computer intrusions, which can  
identify deviations from normal patterns of communication and can 
resist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	--Regular monitoring of computer activity within the bank's  
network and reminders to employees of the bank's security policies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Strong ``firewalls'' that combine hardware and software to  
block unwanted communications into and out of the bank's computer 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	--The use of passwords for electronic transactions, ``log-in  
banners'' warning unauthorized users that the system is monitored, 
and electronic traces on telephones to identify intrusions. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators define ``cyber-terrorism'' as the use of  
computers against people or property to intimidate or coerce a 
government, the civilian population or any segment of it, as a way 
to advance political or social objectives. ``Cyber-terrorists'' can 
be individuals, criminal groups, political factions or foreign 
nationals, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Year 2000 issue, bankers have been telling people not to  
panic over the date change, trying to counteract doomsday scenarios 
of millions of Americans draining their bank accounts this year. 
ATM machines, credit cards, checks and banking services will be 
functioning normally, industry officials have promised.

<HEADLINE> Writer Defensive in Child Porn Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENBELT, Md. (AP) -- A journalist who pleaded guilty to  
distributing child pornography online testified Friday that he was 
trying to gain the trust of suspected pedophiles so he could write 
a story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naive and stupid as it sounds today, I did not know what I was  
doing was illegal,'' Larry Matthews said at his sentencing hearing, 
which was to continue Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews could be sentenced to 30 years in prison and fined  
$500,000 for receiving pornographic images on his computer and 
transmitting child pornography. He pleaded guilty in federal court 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, a National Public Radio producer, is the first  
journalist to be prosecuted for accessing child pornography, 
according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. 
Media and civil liberties groups have supported him in court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews had planned to argue at trial that he has a right to  
view such materials as part of legitimate research. But U.S. 
District Judge Alexander Williams Jr. ruled that Matthews' status 
as a journalist did not give him license to break the law and that 
he could not invoke the First Amendment in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews' attorneys have said he made the plea to push the case  
more quickly to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews had done stories on the growing availability of child  
porn on the Internet in 1995 while working for radio station 
WTOP-AM in Washington. He said he wanted to expand on that series 
for magazine articles he planned to sell freelance. National Public 
Radio, where he now works, did not commission the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews said he felt that to sell the story, he had to provide  
something no one else had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a tremendous amount of zeal to find something that was  
maybe unfindable,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Avery C. Alexander, a patriarch of New  
Orleans' civil rights movement who was arrested 20 times before he 
lost count, died Friday at 88.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Loses $637M in Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Chevron's 1998 earnings will be reduced by  
$637 million because of a ruling Tuesday by the Oklahoma Supreme 
Court involving an oil company's lawsuit over a terminated merger 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron officials said they plan to ``seek further review'' of  
the court decision, but said the adjustment was necessary to comply 
with accounting standards. The company made the announcement after 
the close of stock trading Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for 1998 was reduced from $1.97 billion to $1.33  
billion. Fourth quarter net income went from a $431 million profit 
to a loss of $206 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special items, operating earnings for 1998 of $1.94  
billion were not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The $637 million charge reflects an increased reserve for the  
potential estimated after-tax impact of the $742.2 million judgment 
in July 1996, plus interest through Dec. 31, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The case dates to 1982 when Cities Service Co., a Tulsa, Okla.,  
oil company, filed suit against Gulf Oil Corp., when Gulf 
terminated plans to acquire Cities Service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since the suit was filed, both companies were  
acquired by other energy companies: Cities Service by Occidental 
Petroleum and Gulf by Chevron. The lawsuit remained in the names of 
the original parties.

	Dow Has First Close Above 9,700  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials soared 268.68 points to a  
new high of 9,736.08 today, posting its biggest two-day point gain 
ever and moving within 300 points of 10,000. Stocks surged as a 
slight rise in unemployment and wages eased investor concerns that 
the fast-growing economy would spur inflation and higher interest 
rates. The Dow topped its Jan. 8 record close of 9,643.32, bringing 
the new year's gain to 6 percent. In the last two days, the Dow has 
gained more than 460 points, or 5 percent, far from a percentage 
record, however. While technology stocks were mostly higher today, 
they failed to keep pace with the gains in other sectors. The 
Nasdaq composite was up 44.13 to 2,337.02.

	Jobless Rate Edges Up to 4.4 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.4  
percent in February as the nation's manufacturers continued to be 
battered by the global economic crisis. But the Labor Department 
said that even with the slight 0.1 percentage point uptick in the 
jobless rate, the number of payroll jobs rose by 275,000, better 
than expected, led by hiring at construction sites and retail 
establishments. Manufacturing employment fell by 50,000 last month, 
the biggest setback since last November, with layoffs especially 
high at apparel and aircraft factories. But the overall job 
increase of 275,000 was the best since December, surpassing a 
217,000 gain in January. Mild winter weather helped boost 
employment in construction, and workers in retail sales jumped by 
the largest amount in more than a decade.

	Milk Producers Due for Price Drop  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Milk producers enjoying record-high prices  
will experience a sharp drop over the next month -- the largest 
change in one month in history, the government said today. It's 
good news for consumers who should see a decline in the prices of 
milk, cheese, butter and other dairy products, economists say. The 
Agriculture Department said the basic milk price received by 
producers will drop from $16.27 per hundred pounds of milk to 
$10.27. The upcoming price decline is earlier than normal. Prices 
paid to producers usually drop in the summer when it's hotter and 
milk production declines. Chris Nubern, an economist with the 
National Milk Producers Federation, said the dip in prices is 
partly due to the effect of increased production, which was 
prompted by record prices.

	Royal Philips Sues VLSI Over Offer

<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Dutch consumer electronics giant Royal  
Philips Electronics NV filed a lawsuit against VLSI Technology Inc. 
to block the struggling chipmaker from using a poison pill defense 
against Philips' $777 million hostile tender offer. Philips claims 
VLSI is hindering shareholders from taking advantage of the 
$17-a-share offer by delaying a decision on whether or not to 
support the bid and rescind the pill, according to papers filed in 
Delaware Chancery Court.

	Anti-Laundering Proposals Draw Fire  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate, joining a chorus of criticism from  
citizens worried about privacy, sent a message today to the 
government to withdraw proposed anti-money laundering rules that 
would track bank customers' habits. By an 88-0 vote, the Senate 
expressed support for a measure directing bank regulators to 
withdraw the proposed rules, called ``Know Your Customer'' 
regulations. The senators didn't vote on actual adoption of the 
measure, sponsored by Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Wayne Allard, 
R-Colo., so it lacks the force of law.

	Little Air Jordan Sneakers Recalled  
</P>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike and the federal government today  
announced the recall of 110,000 pairs of the Little Air Jordan XIV 
sneakers for young children because of high levels of lead in the 
red paint trim. Nike said it has received one consumer complaint 
about the shoes and possible ingestion of a paint chip. The shoe, 
sold in sizes 2C though 10C, has been on the market since January. 
It comes in white with red painted trim and the word ``JORDAN'' on 
the outside tongue. The model number is 132549 102. Nike 
spokeswoman Vizhier Mooney said the paint supplier to the factory 
that made the shoes did not adhere to the company's policy on 
banned substances, which includes lead. She said the company has 
severed its ties to the supplier.

settlement with big tobacco companies, despite complaints from 
cities, counties and hospitals around the state that say they are 
being wrongly excluded. Circuit Judge Jimmie Edwards announced the 
deal at a brief hearing today. Now the Legislature has to decide 
what to do with the money designed to help reimburse the state for 
medical costs associated with smoking, among other expenses, state 
Attorney General Jay Nixon said. However, appeals by the cities and 
hospitals could delay the money flow, possibly for several years, 
according to Nixon.

	Japanese Waver Over Economic Cures  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In their search for a way to end a debilitating  
recession, Japanese policy-makers have recently reversed their 
stance on the yen, made an about-face on government purchases of 
bonds and continue to argue over how to heal ailing banks. Much of 
the confusion surrounds government efforts to reverse a recent rise 
in long-term interest rates, which threatens to drive Japan deeper 
into recession and slow global economic growth. Rates have risen on 
worries about a huge increase in bond issuance to pay for public 
works projects and tax cuts designed to stimulate the economy.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Surge at Week's End / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks staged a 5-percent surge today in  
their largest one-day rally of the year, bolstered by an overnight 
Wall Street rally and record low interest rates in Japan. The 
dollar's gains against the yen also encouraged investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.94 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.36  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level 
of 123.35 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 710.55  
points, closing the week at 14,894.00 points -- the highest closing 
level since Dec. 9, when the index finished at 14,931.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's point gain in the Nikkei was the largest for a  
single-day session since Oct. 7, when the average surged more than 
800 points. On Thursday, the average gained 13.09 points, or 0.09 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved as high as 123.58 yen earlier in the session,  
but met profit-taking by Hong Kong and U.S. players ahead of the 
release of main U.S. payroll data later today, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dollar sentiment remains fairly bullish amid notions that the  
Bank of Japan may be looking to ease monetary policy further to 
help pull the country out of its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment was bolstered by comments today from a senior  
International Monetary Fund official who said he would welcome any 
further easing of Japan's monetary policy to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less  
attractive to investors, but spur stock investments by lowering 
borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Bank of Japan began guiding domestic  
short-term interest rates closer to zero, and the move was praised 
today by top Japanese officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today a fall in long-term  
interest rates as a result of lower overnight call rates is not a 
minus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan said today the nation's overall wholesale  
price index for February was up 0.2 percent from January but was 
3.8 percent lower than the year-earlier month. The data fell within 
analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the data were considered neutral, currency investors were  
using it to buy dollars in the morning, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 122.43 yen and 123.58 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.98 yen, down  
from 133.13 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, traders said investors from overseas bought  
futures to increase their weight in Japanese shares. They said that 
many investors from abroad are beginning to feel that Japan's 
economy may have bottomed out and could be headed for a slow 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investment environment was ideal today,'' said Kazunori  
Jinnai, deputy general manager of the equity department at Daiwa 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was heavy, with an estimated 669 million shares traded  
on the exchange's first section and the biggest turnover of the 
year. On Thursday, 389 million shares changed hands. Advancers 
overwhelmed decliners by 1,146 to 89, with 71 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks started higher today after the Dow Jones industrial  
average in New York climbed 191.52 points to 9,467.70 at Thursday's 
close, boosted by benign economic data, strong retail sales reports 
and higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations that public funds were buying today also attracted  
investors to shares, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gainers in Tokyo included Sony and Toshiba, which were heavily  
bought following Thursday's announcement the two companies will 
join hands to produce a new advanced chip for the next generation 
of the popular PlayStation video game player. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 41.61 points, or 3.76 percent, to 1,146.72 
points. The TOPIX rose 5.30 points, or 0.48 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.560 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.610 percent, 
driving its price up to 101.94 yen from 101.53 yen.

	Dow Passes 9,700 for First Time  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than  
260 points today to pass 9,700 for the first time, sparked by a 
slight rise in unemployment and wages that eased investor concerns 
of rising interest rates. Just before the 4 p.m. EST close, the Dow 
was up 262.70 to 9,730.10. The Dow's previous record close of 
9,643.32 and previous intraday high of 9,647.97 both took place on 
Jan. 8, 1999. Leading the Dow higher today was IBM, which was up 5 
11/16 at 176 11/16. Advancers led decliners on the NYSE 2,021-949. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 43.59 to 2336.48.

	Clinton Apologizes in Cable Car Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said that Americans are  
``profoundly regretful and apologetic'' for the cable car accident 
in Italy that killed 20 people a year ago. Clinton and Italian 
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema held a joint news conference this 
afternoon. D'Alema, while thanking Clinton for ``the sorrow he 
decided to express,'' added that he was ``personally shocked and so 
is the Italian public's opinion.'' Clinton responded: ``The United 
States is not trying to duck its responsibility.'' Both leaders 
noted there was further judicial action pending and they gauged 
their comments so as not to influence it.

	Italy Reacts to Marine's Acquittal  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- One day after the acquittal of the U.S. Marine  
Pilot, Italians are demanding justice for the 20 people killed when 
a jet cut the cable of a ski gondola in the Alps. Capt. Richard 
Ashby, 31, was acquitted yesterday at Camp Lejeune, N.C., of 20 
counts of involuntary manslaughter for the Feb. 3, 1998 tragedy. He 
still faces an obstruction of justice charge.

	Clinton Wishes Lewinsky 'Good Life'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that ``the  
American people are virtually screaming at us'' to get on with 
their business and put the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal to rest. The 
unrelenting question of the Lewinsky affair that led to Clinton's 
impeachment came up at a joint press conference with Italian Prime 
Minister Massimo D'Alema, and the president answered with yet 
another call for an end to it. ``What I hope is that she will be 
permitted to go on with her life,'' Clinton said. ``And I hope it 
will be a good life. ...''

	China Warns U.S. on Taiwan Missiles  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- U.S. inclusion of Taiwan in a regional  
anti-missile defense system could cause ``serious consequences'' 
for American relations with China, a senior Chinese official said 
today. The comments were the gravest public warning Beijing has 
delivered yet on a possible theater missile defense system. They 
came four days after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
tried to allay Chinese concerns over the system, now under study 
with Japan. Beijing regards Taiwan, once a staunch U.S. ally, as a 
rebel province to be reunified by force if necessary.

	Albright Urges Peace in Indonesia  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
urged Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to do all he can to keep 
East Timor from erupting in bloodshed if the territory chooses 
independence. ``Violence is the enemy of democracy, security and 
prosperity,'' she said today. ``We will not walk away,'' Habibie 
responded, according to a senior U.S. official present at their 
two-hour meeting. Indonesia is the last stop for Albright on a 
weeklong Asian tour that included visits to Thailand and China.

	Dole Pushes for Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Former Sen. Bob Dole is pushing ethnic  
Albanian leaders today to immediately sign a peace plan for Kosovo, 
hinting that the deal must be settled before rebels can visit 
Washington. Dole, who was in the region at President Clinton's 
request, had to meet the ethnic Albanian leaders in the Macedonian 
capital of Skopje because he was blocked from entering neighboring 
Yugoslavia when the government denied him a visa. The Republican is 
a longtime ally of the ethnic Albanians.

	Tyson Serving More Time  
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mike Tyson will have to serve an extra 60  
days in jail in Maryland for violating terms of his Indiana 
probation for a 1992 rape conviction, according to court documents 
filed today. The former heavyweight champion, however, will not 
have to return to Indiana for the jail time under an agreement 
reached yesterday with Marion County (Ind.) Prosecutor Scott 
Newman.

<HEADLINE> Twins' Coomer in Lineup -- Somewhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- If all goes as planned with the  
Minnesota Twins' youth movement, Corey Koskie will win the starting 
job at third base and Doug Mientkiewicz and David Ortiz will 
platoon at first. 
</P>
<P>
	So where does that leave Ron Coomer, one of the Twins' most  
productive and fan-friendly players over the last two seasons? 
</P>
<P>
	In the lineup almost every day. Somewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	And that's just fine with Coomer, one of the AL's better third  
baseman. After waiting until age 30 to play his rookie season in 
1996, he isn't going to gripe about the possibility of giving up 
his everyday job at third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand what the program is here,'' Coomer said. ``You go  
out and you do your job, (and if) you play well, you play. I don't 
get overly concerned about having to have the manager or general 
manager talk to me about what my role's going to be. I know to 
bring a first baseman's glove and third baseman's glove and my bat, 
and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly how manager Tom Kelly sees it, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelly doesn't know what to expect from Koskie, Mientkiewicz and  
Ortiz, but he knows what he'll get from Coomer. A productive bat, a 
solid glove no matter where he plays and the same team-first, 
workaday attitude that allowed him to endure a frustrating 8 1/2-year 
journey through the minor league systems of the Oakland Athletics, 
Chicago White Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be playing pretty much every day, I would  
think,'' Kelly said. ``He's going to be playing either third or 
first or DH. He'll be in the game. He offers too much offense. He 
needs to be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just not in early March.  
</P>
<P>
	Coomer started at third in Thursday's split-squad opener against  
the Boston Red Sox, but he was a spectator during Friday's 6-2 
victory over the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskie and Brian Richardson handled third base, and Ortiz and  
free-agent Eddie Williams split time at first. Marty Cordova and 
Chad Rupp filled the designated hitter slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Coomer doesn't have to prove anything to the Twins in spring  
training, but a lot of other players do. Kelly's going to give the 
younger players as much of an opportunity as possible early in the 
exhibition season before starting to work the regulars in more 
often later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to let some of these other fellows play some so I  
can make a few decisions,'' Kelly said. ``But Coomer, that's one 
name that we'll probably be writing down most of the time, if not 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news for Twins fans, who haven't had a lot to cheer  
about in recent seasons and probably don't have much to look 
forward to in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Coomer has been one of the Twins' best hitters and one of the  
AL's best defensive third basemen over the last two seasons. He's 
regularly been showered with choruses of ``Coooom'' from the sparse 
crowds at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	That love affair will continue this summer, even if the fans  
might have to check the lineup each day to find out exactly where 
to find their favorite player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's up to TK,'' Coomer said. ``He's been pretty  
good with me so far with playing time and all that, and I've played 
just about every day for the last two years now. I don't see that 
changing, but we'll see. Guys have got to win jobs, and that's the 
key.''

<HEADLINE> Ducey Tries Out Despite Family Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- On the Philadelphia Phillies' practice  
field not far from his home, Rob Ducey is treated to the whooshing 
breeze and the crack of bats on a clear afternoon that seems close 
to perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	If only it was. While Ducey competes for a job with the  
Phillies, his adoptive mother is fighting bone cancer hundreds of 
miles away in Canada. He's kept the family struggle private for 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	During a yeomanlike journey through baseball, from Syracuse to  
Oklahoma City and even Japan, Ducey was strengthened by his 
mother's courage. She has taken on cancer with the same toughness 
and vigor that was needed to raise Ducey, a dark-skinned man 
adopted into a white family. 
</P>
<P>
	``She tells me, `Hey, you do what you've got to do. Don't worry  
about it,''' Ducey said. ``If something happens, I'll know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, when Ducey was reporting to the Phillies' camp with  
hopes of making the team as an extra outfielder, his mother had one 
of her worst scares since she started battling cancer in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad took her to the hospital in the middle of the night,''  
Ducey said quietly. ``She was having difficulty breathing. She had 
pneumonia, and she had heart failure. And while she was in the 
hospital she had a mini-stroke. Then she caught an infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the cancer, she's getting treatment for her cancer. And  
it's showed up in three different spots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors in Ontario solemnly told Ducey's adoptive father, Ed  
Heather, that the cancer has spread to his wife's hip, spine and 
pelvis. Ducey told none of his new teammates about the ordeal, 
speaking only with manager Terry Francona in case he has to leave 
camp suddenly and rush to his mom's bedside. 
</P>
<P>
	``As important as baseball is -- and it's more important to me  
probably than a lot of people -- when you're talking about you're 
family, it's different,'' Francona said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll know. I'll know,'' Ducey said, his monotone voice somehow  
covering the anguish. ``I'll know when it's time to go see her. I 
hope that she doesn't die suddenly. You always want to see your 
family if there's that chance to see them before they do pass. She 
told me that she's going to be in Montreal this year when we go to 
Montreal. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ducey, 33, has bounced around baseball since starting his career  
in the Pioneer League in 1984 after being signed as a non-drafted 
free agent by the Blue Jays. He's filled part-time roles with the 
Angels, Rangers and Mariners and played two seasons in Japan. The 
Phillies signed him to a one-year contract in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Ducey was born in Toronto in 1965, the same year Martin Luther  
King Jr. led the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march during the 
heat of the Civil Rights movement. His birth mother was from 
England, and his father was from Trinidad and Tobago. He has no 
idea why they gave him up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never met the lady, never really even thought about trying  
to get in touch with people so I could meet them,'' Ducey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita Heather and Leo Ducey adopted him, and he grew up in  
Canada. Though he gets his name from his adoptive father, Ducey 
doesn't consider him his dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``By name, yes, he's my father,'' Ducey said. ``But he wasn't  
around. My mother raised me, and he had zero to do with my 
upbringing.' 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Heather married Anita when Ducey was 17. Ducey considers them  
his real parents, and he has always been close with his four white 
sisters. He never wanted to seek out his birth parents and delve 
into the past -- always a difficult decision for adoptees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe because they're trying to deal with something that they  
feel that they've been cheated out of their parents,'' Ducey said. 
``In my case, I'm not. I don't feel that way. My family's my 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Ducey was growing up, his mother worked long hours as a  
secretary to raise her five children. 
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't want me just to settle for anything,'' Ducey said.  
``Because of the fact that she knew I would be a non-Caucasian in a 
Caucasian world, I had to do better than average.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ducey lives with his wife and two sons in Tarpon Springs, Fla.,  
a few miles from the Phillies' training complex. Somehow, he must 
concentrate on baseball every morning as the serenity of the Gulf 
Coast washes over him in stark contrast to his mother's fight. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother taught him never to take anything for granted.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everything I did almost wasn't good enough,'' Ducey said.  
``Sure, she was proud in her own way. But growing up, she didn't 
want me to settle. And I thank her for that.''

<HEADLINE> Cashmere Workers Fear Trade War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Like her mother, father and a clutch of cousins  
before her, Angela Graham has made a career of knitting sweaters 
and coats from the delicate woolen fibers of an Asian goat. 
</P>
<P>
	But a trade dispute between the United States and the European  
Union threatens to unravel Ms. Graham's livelihood at a Scottish 
cashmere factory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not an awful lot else to do around here,'' she says of  
Innerleithen, her rural hometown in the Scottish Borders region. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Graham works at Ballantyne Cashmere Co. laying panels of  
cashmere fabric on a circular machine so that a coworker -- her 
mother -- can sew them into finished pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, retaliating for European restrictions on  
bananas imported from Latin America, has announced a 100 percent 
tariff on a range of European goods, including cashmere sweaters. 
Such goods normally warrant only a 6.5 percent tariff. 
</P>
<P>
	The punitive tariffs would double the price of Ballantyne's  
exports to the United States -- its biggest market. Orders would 
likely dry up from Saks Fifth Avenue and other U.S. luxury stores, 
which account for 15 percent of Ballantyne's total sales. The lost 
business could mean layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Trade Organization, which already has ruled against  
the EU in the banana dispute, has postponed a ruling on the 
validity of the new tariffs until April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	British cashmere companies won some support Thursday when the  
government indicated it would guarantee the loans they need until 
they get paid for their exports. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the peak cashmere buying season just a few months off,  
Ballantyne, the region's largest cashmere factory and the largest 
employer in Innerleithen, is preparing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would obviously have to scale back,'' managing director  
George Peden said in a telephone interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to say how many of the factory's 450 workers might  
lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Innerleithen, 360 miles north of London, lies in a region of  
forested hills and sheep farms where textile mills have dominated 
the economy since the Industrial Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	While cashmere wool comes largely from China and central Asia,  
the Scottish Borders area forms the backbone -- together with Italy 
and China -- of the world's cashmere clothing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction has come at a price.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're overly dependent on textiles. We're trying to find other  
areas to diversify into,'' said John Askew of the governing 
Scottish Borders Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The region already is reeling from the loss of 2,500 textile  
jobs over the past three years, mostly due to competition from 
lower-cost producers in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say as many as 2,000 workers -- 45 percent of the total  
in the region's cashmere industry -- are at risk if American 
importers look elsewhere for cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the area's smaller knitting factories export up to 80  
percent of their clothing to the United States. The U.S. tariffs 
would almost certainly force them out of business, Peden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Graham's mother, Irene Bell, is baffled and angry that a  
spat over tropical fruit might endanger her factory job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can totally not understand how bananas can affect our  
business and our future. I find it very political, and a lot of 
innocent people are going to be hurt by it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bell, whose parents both toiled at now-defunct weaving  
mills, has worked at Ballantyne for 29 of her 54 years. Her husband 
and seven other relatives also work there. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike many Britons, her daughter blamed fellow Europeans  
for the trade crisis. The Americans, said Ms. Graham, ``are just 
standing their ground for a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, pondering her prospects, she added bitterly: ``There's a  
new golf course opening up here soon. Maybe we could get jobs there 
as chambermaids.''

<HEADLINE> Alabama Senate Shuts Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The legislative session in Alabama is  
only three days old, and the political feuding already has 
paralyzed the state government. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen Democrats -- a majority of the 35-member Senate --  
refused to show up for work Wednesday and Thursday and are 
threatening to stay out indefinitely unless the lieutenant governor 
makes key rule changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle started in November, when Steve Windom became the  
first Republican elected lieutenant governor in Alabama this 
century. That also made him presiding officer in the Senate, which 
has been controlled by the Democrats for more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the Democrats stripped him of most of his power in  
an organizational session presided over by Gov.-elect Don 
Siegelman, a Democrat who was lieutenant governor at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	But Windom snatched the power back on Tuesday, the Legislature's  
opening day, by gaveling through new rules on a voice vote while he 
ignored the shouts and shaking fists of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, among other things, allow Windom to appoint new  
committees to consider major bills and to decide which committee 
considers each bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's insane to think one man can run over the majority of an  
elected body,'' said Senate President Pro Tem Lowell Barron, a 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 17 of Windom's allies -- 12 Republicans and five  
Democrats -- did attend the Senate sessions on Wednesday and 
Thursday, it was one short of the number needed for a legal 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the state constitution, the Senate has to keep trying to  
meet each day until a majority shows up. The Legislature meets only 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are prepared to stay out however long it takes to get our  
right restored to vote in that body,'' Barron said. ``We're 
protecting democracy and there is no price too great to pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides expect the boycott to last at least through Monday,  
when a judge is scheduled to hear a lawsuit filed by Democrats that 
accuses Windom of violating their rights. By that time, nearly 
one-fourth of the legislative session will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Windom's allies said taxpayers will tire quickly of senators  
being paid to do nothing, as well as spending taxpayer money on a 
lawsuit over Senate rules. Senators are paid $220 for each week of 
the session and $2,280 per month for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman has refused to get involved, saying, ``My job is to  
fix schools, not rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the business of the people is on hold, including  
Siegelman's plan to create a state lottery to pay for education 
programs and college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP Chairman Winton Blount sees no quick end.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to have to melt down some more,'' he said. ``Then  
they will find something in the middle.''

<HEADLINE> Bodies of Uganda Victims Flown Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- The bodies of eight foreign tourists  
slain by Hutu rebels were sent home Friday as FBI and other 
investigators sought to discover how the rebels obtained such 
detailed information on the adventure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffins bearing the bodies were transported Friday from the  
Ugandan capital of Kampala to Entebbe airport, where a private 
flag-folding ceremony was held in memory of the two Americans who 
died in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Haubner, 48, and Susan Miller, 42, both Oregon-based  
executives at the computer chip giant Intel, were among eight 
foreigners hacked and bludgeoned to death by rebels in southwestern 
Uganda's Bwindi National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Four rangers were also killed in the rebel raids and six other  
tourists who had hoped to view rare mountain gorillas on their 
vacation managed to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	The flags were given to the slain Americans' friends, Susan  
Studd and Bob McLaurin, also Intel employees, who survived the 
rebel attack and who departed on the same flight for Britain, said 
U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officer Virgil Bodeen. 
</P>
<P>
	Bodeen said they would bring the flags to the victims' families.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandan government, meanwhile, said it would make every  
effort to ensure the safety of future tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandan army has intensified a joint manhunt with Rwandan  
forces to capture or kill the Hutu rebels who attacked three 
tourist campsites on Monday, killing the two Americans as well as 
four Britons and two New Zealanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of troops are combing the dense jungles along the  
Uganda-Congo border looking for the rebels. Fifteen rebels, some 
wearing clothes stolen from the tourists, were killed by the troops 
Wednesday, Ugandan officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you we are doing everything possible so that this  
point of tourism is safe for everyone,'' said Ugandan Foreign 
Minister Eriya Kategaya. Still, the rebels -- Rwandans who are based 
in eastern Congo -- may be difficult to stop because of Congo's 
uncooperative government, Kategaya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Notes left by the assailants said they were targeting Britons  
and Americans because their governments supported the government in 
Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	Kategaya met with the ambassadors from the United States and  
Britain on Friday to express his country's condolences. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI team had arrived earlier in the week and detectives from  
Scotland yard arrived late Thursday to participate in the 
investigation. Kategaya said he hoped the investigation might shed 
light on how the rebels had obtained such precise information about 
the campsites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe there are some collaborators within our population,  
because the attacks seemed to have been very precise and clear with 
prior information on the positions of the people and even the look 
of the place,'' Kategaya said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was unaware of the detention of a suspect, which had  
been reported in a government-owned newspaper Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rwandan rebels were among Hutu fighters who fled Rwanda in  
1994 after killing more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and 
politically moderate Hutus in a government-orchestrated genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, they have been operating from bases in Congo,  
launching cross-border attacks in Rwanda and more recently inside 
Congo and in Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Powell, the U.S. ambassador to Uganda, said a note that  
the rebels gave to an American survivor of the attack criticized 
the U.S. and British governments for supporting Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was signed with the acronym ALIR, or the Rwanda  
Liberation Army, which put a bounty on the heads of Americans in 
Rwanda in 1996. The group has claimed responsibility for several 
rebel attacks in northwestern Rwanda in 1996 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Law Benefiting Rape Victims Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- For the first time, a federal appeals court  
on Friday declared unconstitutional a 1994 federal law that allows 
rape victims to sue their attackers for violating their civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling 7-4 in the case of a Virginia Tech student who sued two  
football players, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called the 
Violence Against Women Act a ``sweeping intrusion'' into matters 
traditionally handled by the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Congress stretched too far its interpretation of  
its right to regulate interstate commerce when it passed the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower court judge had previously thrown out the Virginia Tech  
student's lawsuit. The student, Christy Brzonkala, was the first 
person to sue under the Violence Against Women Act. She sought 
unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruling is binding only in Virginia, West  
Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Wagner, one of Ms. Brzonkala's lawyers, said she expects  
the case to go to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can either give it a thumbs-up -- in which case people  
will use this law, which they are reluctant to do now -- or a 
thumbs-down, which would encourage Congress to go back to the 
drawing board and rewrite the thing,'' Ms. Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brzonkala, who has allowed her name to be disclosed, said  
she was raped in a dormitory. She did not report the alleged 
incident for several months and no charges were filed against the 
two Virginia Tech players, Antonio Morrison and James Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	Their lawyers did not return calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brzonkala's lawyers defended the Violence Against Women Act  
by arguing that gender-motivated violence affects commerce by 
imposing medical and legal costs on victims, inhibiting travel by 
those who fear violence and lessening productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court rejected that line of reasoning.  
</P>
<P>
	``Such a statute, we are constrained to conclude, simply cannot  
be reconciled with the principles of limited federal government 
upon which this nation is founded,'' Circuit Judge J. Michael 
Luttig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said Congress could not enact the law under  
the Constitution's 14th Amendment, either. The 14th Amendment bars 
states from denying people equal protection under the law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dissent, Circuit Judge Diana G. Motz wrote that Congress  
had clear authority to enact the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation,  
called the law the first major advance for women since Congress 
banned sex discrimination in federally funded schools in 1975. She 
said she hoped the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn the appeals 
court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a tragedy if this became the law of the land,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Man Wants To Marry His Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Many men have had love affairs with  
their cars. Buster Mitchell wanted to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
	Jilted by his girlfriend, a bereft Mitchell decided he wanted to  
marry his true love -- his 1996 Mustang GT. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been broken hearted and hung out to dry, so I am going to  
the courthouse and try to marry my car,'' Mitchell said before 
attempting to get a marriage license Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, 28, didn't get very far in the application before the  
clerk dashed his dreams. Only men and women can marry under 
Tennessee law, officials explained. 
</P>
<P>
	It was sometime after he listed his fiance's birthplace as  
``Detroit,'' her father as ``Henry Ford'' and her blood type as 
``10-W-40'' that his plans sputtered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, in California they are doing same-sex marriages,'' he  
said. ``So we are here in Tennessee. Why can't we do the good ol' 
boy thing and marry our cars and trucks?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he isn't giving up. He plans to try at a couple of  
wedding chapels in the Great Smoky Mountains.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Green Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Seahawks running back Ahman Green pleaded  
innocent Friday to fourth-degree assault in a domestic violence 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	At his appearance in Kirkland Municipal Court, Green's bail was  
set at $2,000, which he posted a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Nebraska star appeared in court in an orange jail  
jumpsuit and handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Green on Thursday after his girlfriend said he  
had pushed a door into her face, chipping a tooth and causing a 
bloody lip. In court Friday, she told the judge that Green had 
pushed, pulled and kicked her at other times in their relationship 
while they lived together in Nebraska and California. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a child together, and were supposed to be married  
Thursday. Green has been ordered to have no contact with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Green did not speak in court. The plea was entered by his  
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Green rushed for 209 yards and one touchdown on 35 carries for  
the Seahawks last season, his rookie year. He is expected to be the 
team's primary kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the No. 2 rusher in Nebraska's history. The three-year  
starter had nearly 3,900 yards and 42 touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> NFL Executive Impersonated in Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Someone has been impersonating Gene Upshaw,  
the head of the NFL players' union, in an effort to get money from 
college football coaches, union officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL Players Association, in a statement released Friday,  
said an impostor or impostors ``have contacted different college 
assistant coaches and asked them to wire money to an individual 
purporting to be a relative of Upshaw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Berthelsen, general counsel for the NFLPA, said at least  
three coaches have been contacted -- one in the Midwest, one in the 
Mountain Time Zone and one in the Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least one has wired money that the impostor requested,''  
Berthelsen said from San Francisco, where union officials were 
attending an agents' seminar. 
</P>
<P>
	Berthelsen said the union was giving few details because it  
could hinder an investigation.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Browns Looking Like 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ty Detmer, Terry Kirby, Marquez Pope, Irv  
Smith, Antonio Langham, Roy Barker, Steve Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Every day the Cleveland Browns of 1999 look more like the San  
Francisco 49ers of last year. Next thing you know, the expansion 
team will be calling itself the Cleveland 99ers to tighten the bond 
that much more. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably wouldn't bother Browns coach Chris Palmer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a security in knowing what you're getting,''  
Palmer said Friday at a news conference where Detmer, who will be 
the Browns starting quarterback when training camp opens, and free 
safety Pope were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the players are coming from a team that was  
1-15. San Francisco's a team that's had a lot of success,'' Palmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer and Pope are among a dozen players on the Browns roster,  
including at least five projected starters, who at one time were 
with San Francisco. Kirby became the latest ex-49er to join 
Cleveland when the running back signed with the Browns on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The obvious front office connection between San Francisco and  
Cleveland -- Browns president Carmen Policy and director of football 
operations Dwight Clark were president and general manager of the 
49ers -- has grown in the past month as San Francisco has slashed 
$30 million from its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have picked up 49ers from trades, free agent signings  
and the expansion draft. This is not the way Cleveland planned it, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want to take a bunch of players from the 49ers,'' he  
said. ``Because I know when guys have left us (San Francisco) to 
coach other teams, they've taken guys from the 49ers and it's 
really bothersome to the guys that are staying there. But they kept 
asking about our interest in players that I really liked. So I said 
'Yeah, OK, I'd be happy to take those guys.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Having an influx of players from a former Super Bowl champion  
and perennial playoff team like San Francisco will be a boost to a 
young club trying to establish itself, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll help set the tone for practice,'' he said. ``Practices  
in San Francisco were short but they were crisp. People were 
running around all over the place, getting a lot of work in fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope agreed. He said the 49ers played hard every time they were  
on the field, even if they were facing each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we practiced, we competed,'' he said. Future Hall of Fame  
wide receiver ``Jerry Rice would not take a day off. You could not 
got out there and relax and say, 'OK, today is Wednesday, I'm a 
little sore. I'm going to take it easy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer, who says he wouldn't mind being a mentor if the Browns  
take Kentucky's Tim Couch or another quarterback with its first 
draft pick, said having some familiar faces around will suit him, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know the guys, you know what to expect from them,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the San Francisco shopping spree may be over for now. Palmer  
said except for a few possible moves in the next week, the Browns 
attention is turning away from free agency and toward April's 
college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark all but ruled out the Browns making a bid for yet another  
49er, free agent wide receiver J.J. Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've got enough 49ers now,'' Clark said. ``Unless  
some great offer comes up.''

</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On March 6, 1836, the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, fell to  
Mexican forces after a 13-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1834, the city of York in Upper Canada was incorporated as  
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1853, Verdi's opera ``La Traviata'' premiered in Venice,  
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1857, in its ``Dred Scott'' decision, the Supreme Court held  
that Scott, a slave, could not sue for his freedom in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1933, a nationwide bank holiday declared by President  
Roosevelt went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1935, retired Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.  
died in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, U.S. heavy bombers staged the first American raid on  
Berlin during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, the former British African colonies of the Gold Coast  
and Togoland became the independent state of Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, in a case that drew much notoriety, a woman in New  
Bedford, Mass., reported being gang-raped atop a pool table in a 
tavern called Big Dan's; four men were later convicted of the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, 189 people died when the British ferry ``Herald of Free  
Enterprise'' capsized off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: With nearly 90 percent of its pilots honoring the  
picket lines of striking machinists, Eastern Airlines shut down 
operations on all but three routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Two top Clinton administration officials, Vice  
President Al Gore and White House adviser George Stephanopoulos, 
appeared on the Sunday TV talk shows to blame Republican sniping 
for much of the furor over Whitewater. Greek 
actress-turned-politician Melina Mercouri died in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: The Army honored three Americans who risked their  
lives and turned their weapons on fellow soldiers to stop the 
slaughter of Vietnamese villagers at My Lai in 1968. A Connecticut 
state lottery accountant shot to death three supervisors and the 
lottery chief before killing himself.

<HEADLINE> Report: Sydney Targeted China Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic bidders planned to  
discredit Beijing's bid for the 2000 Games with a secret publicity 
campaign highlighting China's poor human rights record, according 
to a newspaper report Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New South Wales state premier John Fahey, one of the  
leaders of Sydney's successful bid in 1993, was part of a strategy 
group formed by leading businessmen, The Age newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper cited notes from a confidential meeting held by the  
group on Dec. 14, 1992, which included how a damaging picture of 
China's human rights abuses could be ``shown around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney eventually beat Beijing by two votes, although the  
Chinese city was the early favorite to win the games. China's human 
rights record was thought to have swayed several IOC members in the 
final days of the vote process. 
</P>
<P>
	The Age said the strategy group ``developed an elaborate plan to  
run a secret public relations campaign out of London to discredit 
Beijing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fahey told the paper he remembered those at the meeting had  
discussed the ``strengths and weaknesses'' of Beijing's bid but 
denied knowledge of a plan to mount an anti-Beijing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``To my knowledge there were no dirty tricks campaigns  
mounted,'' Fahey was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say that at no point in time did I ever encourage,  
condone or agree to any deliberate tactic being employed in any 
capacity by the bid company or the state government that would 
start to focus on those issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said Australian IOC member Kevan Gosper learned of the  
plan in April 1993 and warned against it.

<HEADLINE> Little Air Jordan Sneakers Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike and the federal government today  
announced the recall of 110,000 pairs of the Little Air Jordan XIV 
sneakers for young children because of high levels of lead in the 
red paint trim. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike said it has received one consumer complaint about the shoes  
and possible ingestion of a paint chip. 
</P>
<P>
	The shoe, sold in sizes 2C though 10C, has been on the market  
since January. It comes in white with red painted trim and the word 
``JORDAN'' on the outside tongue. The model number is 132549 102. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike spokeswoman Vizhier Mooney said the paint supplier to the  
factory that made the shoes did not adhere to the company's policy 
on banned substances, which includes lead. She said the company has 
severed its ties to the supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	Mooney added that the company has tested all other colors and  
sizes of the Air Jordan XIV and determined that none of the shoes 
contain paint with lead above federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission said the shoes  
should be taken away from children and returned to the store where 
purchased for a substitute product or a store refund. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers can also call Nike at 1-800-344-6453.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates Rights Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Friday again nominated  
Bill Lann Lee to be the nation's top civil rights enforcer despite 
Republican objections to Lee's views on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has held the post since December 1997 when Clinton used his  
recess appointment powers after Congress adjourned to put him in 
office on an acting basis without Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that the Clinton administration has chosen  
to renominate Bill Lann Lee and play politics with the Civil Rights 
Division rather than put forward a consensus, confirmable 
candidate,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton gave a personal sendoff to Lee's nomination Friday,  
meeting with him in the Roosevelt Room, along with civil rights 
leaders and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart acknowledged the  
opposition of Hatch and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to Lee. 
But Lockhart said Lee has ``done an excellent job on a wide variety 
of issues over the last year'' and deserves to be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Lann Lee's life has been in the pursuit of excellence and  
in knocking down the walls of discrimination,'' said Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass., who talked with reporters in the White House 
driveway after the meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking minority member on  
Judiciary, lauded Lee's ``strong record of fair and effective 
enforcement'' and said Lee deserves ``foursquare treatment by the 
Senate and he most certainly deserves confirmation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton angered Senate leaders when he appointed the former  
NAACP lawyer as acting assistant attorney general after it became 
clear that Hatch's committee would not forward his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders and groups like the Institute for Justice and the  
Center for Equal Opportunity have criticized what Lee's support for 
what Hatch termed ``unconstitutional policies such as quotas which 
give preference to one group at the expense of another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House defended Lee as a ``skilled consensus builder''  
and ``an excellent litigator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Lee has spent his 25-year legal career seeking equal  
opportunity for all people and working diligently against 
discrimination in all forms, including in employment, housing, 
voting and education,'' the White House said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton's move was sure to provoke a standoff with  
Hatch's committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt any Senate would confirm a candidate who chose to  
serve in violation of the Senate's constitutional right to 
consent,'' Hatch said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-D'Alema Text 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, more than 70 million Americans watched Monica  
Lewinsky's recent television interview and a number of people are 
buying a book that she's put out. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm just wondering, do you have any thoughts on it that you can  
share with us that perhaps might bring closure to this? And do you 
have problem with the idea that she's actually making money off 
that relationship? 
</P>
<P>
	And, Prime Minister, some of your countrymen are suggesting that  
NATO ought to conduct a review, an investigation of this accident. 
Do you support that idea to just ensure a sense of impartiality? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, let me -- let me answer your question.  
</P>
<P>
	First of all, I did not see the interview, so I can't really  
comment on that. What I hope is that she will be permitted to go on 
with her life, and I hope it'll be a good life. And I hope that -- 
that the efforts that I have made and that I continue to make every 
day at home and at work will bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	And I hope that all the people who have been hurt by this,  
including totally innocent people who have massive legal bills, 
will get the help they need, and I'm determined to do what I can to 
help them. 
</P>
<P>
	And just the important thing is that the American people are  
virtually screaming at us to get on with their lives and their 
business and to do their business. 
</P>
<P>
	And I'm going to do my best to do that as well as I possibly  
can. 
</P>
<P>
	But, you know, this was a pretty tough thing for everybody  
involved. And I wish you well. I hope it works out all right for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	I tell you, you know, that's not a decision for me to make. I  
think that my -- I can only -- one of the things I've learned that I 
had relearn all over again in this last four-year episode, is that 
all I can control in life is what I do and what I say. And if I do 
and say the right things, then that's the thing that's best for me 
and my family and for the American people, and that's what I'm 
concentrating on doing. And I don't wish anyone ill who was caught 
up in this. And she paid quite a high price for a long time, and I 
feel badly for that. So I just hope it works out all right. 
</P>
<P>
	D'ALEMA: I think that at present we should follow with attention  
and respect the proceedings and the judicial process which is 
envisaged in the United States. As President Clinton mentioned, two 
more trials have to be held concerning these events at Cavalese. 
When this process is over, when we have a complete picture of who 
was held of responsibilities and punishment for the events, then we 
shall evaluate what to do, once it is made clear who is responsible 
and needs to be brought -- punished. 
</P>
<P>
	But at this time I don't think it would be right to examine  
other possibilities and put forward new ideas that do not seem well 
founded as yet. Then we shall evaluate what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Once it is made clear whose responsible and these people are  
punished, but at this time, I don't think it would be right to 
examine other possibilities and put forward new ideas that do not 
seem well founded as yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Prime Minister, you talked about American, European and  
Italian values. Sometimes, you sound criticism towards American 
values. These American values have created 18 million new jobs in 
last years. How many of these are you willing to learn to create 
new jobs in Italy and in Europe, if any? 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with Italian public opinion is a little more  
widespread than just the crisis. (off--microphone) the accident 
happened yesterday. We have a crisis in trade and Italy somehow 
feels to be a target within the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	So what can you say to reassure Italians and what actions are  
you going to take, because the public opinion is rather upset, not 
just for that, but for the fact that Italian products are 
constantly --constantly -- whenever there is a trade war -- on target. 
And on other issues like the Security Council, the U.S. is against 
Italian position, while Italy seems to be having a position very 
much in sync on G-8 and NATO position with the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	What do you say to that? What do you say to the public opinion?  
What will you do? 
</P>
<P>
	D'ALEMA: It is not the first time that I have expressed great  
interest for the dynamic nature of the American society and 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	I think that when exchange of views and ideas and suggestions,  
they are certainly useful for Europe to learn some lessons from -- 
some important lessons from the experience of the United States, 
and more specifically, I think that one of the future's impressed 
me most is their speed in terms of innovation, the ability to 
innovate and the amount of investment in education. 
</P>
<P>
	Last night I was talking about this with the secretary of  
education of the United States, and I think that undoubtedly this 
is a strategic issue. The speed of innovation, investment in human 
capital, certainly strategic options. 
</P>
<P>
	And these are some of the things -- there are other things as  
well -- that we are interested in, in the American experience. And 
Europe has a more rigid, heavy, less dynamic system so that Italy 
must learn from them. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: If I might just say -- I will the answer the question  
you asked me. But I would also like to also comment on the question 
you asked the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The great struggle every serious country faces is how to reap  
the benefits of the astonishing revolution in technology and the 
globalization of the economy, and to minimize the disruptions so 
that you can have some sort of stable family and community life. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, what we had to do when I took office was to get rid of this  
terrible deficit we had, which kept interest rates high for us and 
too high for you, and was taking too much money out of the global 
economy, and to focus on some areas where we really needed to do 
better with our own economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is true that we are blessed in this country with a very  
dynamic system. Of the 18.1 million new jobs we've had, almost 17 
million of them were created in the private sector. They were 
nongovernmental jobs. An enormous percentage of them were created 
in small businesses. But I wouldn't say that you have nothing to 
look to within Italy. I told the prime minister, when I was the 
governor, I came to Italy 10 years ago to study the economic 
organizations of small businesses in Northern Italy that grew out 
of the Medieval artisans' guilds. 
</P>
<P>
	And I think -- and they are quite flexible. They have individual  
business owners working together to market their products, to 
develop new products, to advertise their products. There are all 
kinds of exciting options which will be job creating if you can 
figure out how to multiply them. 
</P>
<P>
	And what we are trying to do in America now by strengthening our  
family leave law, by strengthening our child care support system, 
by moving people from welfare to work but making sure they keep the 
health care for their children, is to get the benefits of having a 
social contract that recognizes the need for families and 
communities to get support, and the benefits of the dynamic 
economic. 
</P>
<P>
	You're coming at it from a different direction. What you need to  
do is to keep as many of the benefits of the social contract as you 
can, but to make the economy as dynamic as possible because you 
know that you have a country full of intelligent, innovative people 
who could generate more jobs than they're generating. 
</P>
<P>
	But you understand that this is the dilemma that every single  
country is facing from some perspective or another, and no one has 
all the answers.

<HEADLINE> Galfione Wins Pole Vault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- France's Jean Galfione, the 1996 Olympic  
gold medalist, won a controversial pole vault competition at the 
World Indoor Championships Saturday over American Jeff Hartwig. 
</P>
<P>
	Galfione became the fourth pole vaulter to clear 6.00 meters (19  
feet, 8 1/4 inches) indoors, but he was not given credit for the 
result until after the French team lodged a protest. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, his clearance at that height was ruled invalid by  
technical delegate Cecil Smith of Canada because it appeared that 
Galfione illegally touched the bar with his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the appeal, the decision was reversed, and Galfione  
became the winner over Hartwig, who set an American record for the 
third time this season, clearing 19-6 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	If the original ruling had stood, Hartwig would have been the  
winner since Galfione had passed at 19-6 1/4 after missing his first 
try. 
</P>
<P>
	By clearing 6.00 meters, Galfione became the No. 4 performer in  
indoor history, behind world record-holder Sergei Bubka of Ukraine, 
and Rodion Gataullin and Maksim Tarasov, both of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Galfione then missed three times at 19-10 1/4, but it didn't  
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Hartwig won he would have been the first American to capture  
a major title in the pole vault in 31 years, since Bob Seagren at 
the 1968 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Romania's Gabriela Szabo, the 1997 women's 3,000  
champion, won the 1,500 in 4:03.23, a meet record and the fastest 
time in the world this year. She will try for a distance double in 
the 3,000 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, winner of four Olympic and four  
silver medals, sped to victory in the men's 200 in 20.10, the 
second-fastest time in history. Obadele Thompson of Barbados became 
the No. 3 career performer, finishing second at 20.26, and Kevin 
Little of the United States won his third bronze in the event, 
placing third at 20.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Ionela Tirlea of Romania won the women's 200 in 22.39, the best  
in the world this year; Tatyana Kotova of Russia took the women's 
long jump at 22-6, and Vita Pavlysh of Ukraine successfully 
defended her title in the women's shot put at 70-3 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Haile Gebrselassie remained on target for his unprecedented  
distance double. 
</P>
<P>
	The seemingly unbeatable Ethiopian, who won his second straight  
3,000-meter title Friday, advanced to Sunday's 1,500-meter final by 
winning his semifinal heat in 3:41.21 -- the fastest of the two 
heats. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was pressed by Rul Silva of Portugal and Laban Rotich  
of Kenya, the irrepressible Gebrselassie prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Hakimi of Tunisia won the other semifinal at 3:42.46.  
</P>
<P>
	But it was Gebrselassie who commanded all the attention.  
</P>
<P>
	One dissenter of Gebrselassie, however, was qualifier Andres  
Diaz of Spain. Diaz said he didn't think Gebrselassie would win and 
Silva would provide the toughest opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be a slow race, a tactical race,'' Diaz said.  
``I think it will be decided in the last 300 meters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mozambique's Maria Mutola, seeking to become the first woman to  
win four track gold medals at the championships, cruised into the 
women's 800-meter final with an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Controlling the pace from the outset, Mutola, the 1993, 1995 and  
1997 gold medalist, won her semifinal heat in a modest 2:02.18, 
more than five seconds slower than her 1999 best of 1:57.06. 
</P>
<P>
	``The World Championships are important,'' Mutola said. ``Going  
for a record-breaking win, for the fourth time, means a lot to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only Bulgarian high jumper Stefka Kostadinova, with five titles,  
has won more world indoor titles than Mutola. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutola is unbeaten this season in six races, including a world  
record at 1,000 meters, and is the prohibitive favorite in Sunday's 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic's Ludmila Formanova, the 1998 European indoor  
champion, won the other semifinal heat in 1:59.82. Russia's Natalya 
Tsyganova also dipped under two minutes, finishing second to 
Formanova at 1:59.96. 
</P>
<P>
	American Jearl Miles-Clark, the defending champion in the  
women's 400, had the world's fastest time, 50.83, in winning her 
semifinal heat and leading the way into Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Her performance came shortly after Germany's Grit Breuer, the  
European indoor and outdoor champion, won the other heat in 50.88, 
also under the previous 1999 world best of 50.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark's Wilson Kipketer, who seemed invincible at the 1997  
championships, breaking the world 800-meter record twice, was 
beatable Saturday, finishing second to South Africa's Johan Botha 
in a semifinal heat, 1:46.65 to 1:46.76. Germany's Nico Motchebon 
(1:47.05) and Hungary's Balazs Koranyi (1:48.74) won the other 
heats. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first four events of the heptathlon, Roman Sebrle led  
a 1-2 placing by the Czech Republic, accumulating 3,616 points. 
Tomas Dvorak, the 1997 world outdoor champion, was runner-up with 
3,550.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Computer Hackers Alarming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recent attempts by hackers to break into  
Defense Department computers have alarmed the chairman of the House 
subcommittee responsible for military research and developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said a recent episode in which the  
network was penetrated through the Internet in a new fashion 
underscores the problem of safeguarding military computers against 
sophisticated terrorists or rogue nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department says it was able to stop the hackers and  
that they did not penetrate the ``closed'' part of the network with 
access to classified material. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre gave a closed-door briefing  
to House members last week on the subject of efforts to hack into 
the Pentagon's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	According to congressional and administration officials, who  
spoke on the condition of anonymity, Hamre told the briefing that a 
new, potentially more damaging method of penetrating the Pentagon's 
computer system had been detected. 
</P>
<P>
	A military computer server near San Antonio was probed for  
several days in January by hackers who entered the system through 
an overseas site on the Internet, the sources said. The intrusions 
were detected by the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The new method for intruding ``is larger and much harder to  
understand'' than previous assaults by hackers, Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they have made progress'' in coming up with better  
surveillance systems and programs, Weldon said of the Pentagon. 
``The frustration I have is I don't think the military is prepared 
to deal with this in the way that we have to in the next century.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates, Young Near $20M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates appeared close  
Friday to signing first baseman Kevin Young to a four-year contract 
that would make him the first $20 million player in franchise 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonifay met with Young's agent, Sam Levinson, after Friday's  
exhibition game against Detroit in an effort to wrap up the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides neared a deal Thursday night, but Bonifay first  
needed managing general partner Kevin McClatchy to sign off on a 
deal estimated at $24 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure would be a compromise between Young's request for  
$30 million over five years and the Pirates' offer of $16.5 million 
over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come to a conclusion about what we're going to do,''  
Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was confident the talks were about to conclude, he  
said, ``I'd hate to make that statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young hoped to finalize a deal before position players reported  
to camp last week, but the talks stalled as Young developed 
pneumonia and the Pirates spent time on outfielder Jose Guillen's 
unsettled visa status. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who didn't resume working out until Thursday, didn't play  
Friday and may not be ready for game action for several more days. 
</P>
<P>
	The richest contract in Pirates' history was the $17.5 million,  
four-year deal reached by shortstop Jay Bell in 1993, a signing 
that followed an offseason migration of star players such as Barry 
Bonds and Doug Drabek. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates were criticized at the time for overpaying for Bell,  
an above-average fielder who occasionally hit for power but was not 
a run producer in the mold of a Cal Ripken. The Pirates 
subsequently traded Bell to Kansas City in 1997, the last year of 
the contract, and he signed an even-richer $34 million, five-year 
deal with Arizona before the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the Pirates were trying to save face by signing at  
least one of their veteran players after dismantling a three-time 
division championship team. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the Pirates are trying to lock up their most  
efficient run producer as they hope to field a contending team by 
the time they move into the new ballpark in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 29, hit .300 with 18 homers and 74 RBIs in 1997 despite  
missing six weeks with a broken thumb, then hit .270 with a 
career-high 27 homers and 108 RBIs last season. He also is one of 
the NL's best-fielding first basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates initially were counting on Young to help them  
rebuild in 1993, but he hit only .236 that season and .205 in 1994 
and subsequently was released in March 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for Kansas City in 1997, hitting .242 with eight  
homers and 23 RBIs, then finally developed into the power hitter 
the Pirates envisioned after the Royals released him and he 
returned to Pittsburgh as a minor league free agent.

<HEADLINE> Comparison of Clinton and GOP Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A comparison of Social Security plans from President Clinton and  
from Republican congressional leaders: 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON:   	
</P>
<P>
	The president wants to use about 60 percent of the government  
surpluses expected over the next 15 years for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of that money would be used to pay down the national debt  
in an attempt to boost the economy and thus future tax revenues. He 
would earmark that money for Social Security by placing IOUs from 
the general Treasury into the retirement program's trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest, about $700 billion, the government would invest in the  
stock market for Social Security, to try to increase the money's 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining surpluses would be spent on other programs, including  
Medicare -- the health insurance program for the elderly -- defense, 
education and new government-subsidized retirement savings 
accounts. The accounts would be targeted toward those least likely 
to have employer-sponsored pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	 *--------	 
</P>
<P>
	REPUBLICANS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would set aside about two-thirds of expected  
surpluses, requiring that the money be used either to overhaul 
Social Security, or, if lawmakers can't agree on changes, to reduce 
the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would not, however, promise money from the general  
Treasury -- in other words, from income taxes -- to help Social 
Security in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP's preferred overhaul plan, although not yet fully  
developed, would be to divert some Social Security taxes now 
deducted from workers' paychecks into personal accounts that 
individual Americans could invest in the stock market on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The hope is that individuals could grow a bigger nest egg than  
the government could provide with the same money. Then, Social 
Security checks could be reduced proportionally. During a 
transition, budget surpluses would likely be needed to pay benefits 
promised to current and near retirees unable to profit from the new 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plans for the remaining third of budget surpluses  
include income tax cuts and new spending on defense, education and 
possibly Medicare.

<HEADLINE> Big Air Force Restructuring Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to ease the strain of increasing  
overseas missions, the Air Force began a far-reaching restructuring 
Friday that would limit the time air crews and other service 
members must be on call for trouble spots like Bosnia or Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The change sets up 90 days in every 15 months as the standby  
maximum, achieved through establishment of 10 main 
``expeditionary'' groups that would rotate responsibility for 
foreign deployments. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the first major overhaul for the Air Force since the  
end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the forces for military-type missions, an  
additional five groups were set up to handle humanitarian missions 
such as last year's delivery of aid to victims of Hurricane Mitch 
in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the first time, members of the Air Force Reserve and Air  
National Guard would be included among the rotations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to take a lot of unpredictability out of  
people's lives,'' Acting Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters said 
in an interview. ``This is a way to reshape the force that gives it 
a sustainable peacetime organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll still be pulling some travels, you'll still be flying  
jets or whatever you do,'' he said. ``But you're going to know when 
that's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring is scheduled to be done by next January, but  
Peters said the Air Force hopes it will be in operation by October. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization represents an Air Force effort to ease the  
toll of increasing overseas missions and to improve morale in the 
face of a growing exodus of pilots for higher-paying jobs with 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are being run pretty ragged,'' Peters  
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new structure, Air Force crews would know well in  
advance when they might be sent overseas -- and for how long they'd 
have to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	He said almost 70 percent of active Air Force members are  
married, many with children, a reversal of the force during the 
Vietnam War, when a similar percentage was single. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're only on call to deploy for 90 days every 15 months,  
that is a sustainable pace in life from all we can tell,'' Peters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For military missions, the new groups are intended to deploy  
anywhere in the world within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Each ``air expeditionary force'' unit will total about 175  
planes, including fighter jets and heavy bombers as well as 
reconnaissance, electronic warfare, refueling and transport 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft will be based at separate airfields, but air crews  
will train together. Two groups will be on duty at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
	Each force would average about 20,000 people, Peters said. The  
service has 365,000 active-duty personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 main ``air expeditionary force'' units will be  
headquartered at Hill Air Force Base, Utah; Dyess Air Force Base, 
Texas; Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska; Lakenheath Air Base in 
England; Davis Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.; Shaw Air Force Base, 
S.C.; Barksdale Air Force Base, La.; Ellsworth Air Force Base, 
S.D.; Cannon Air Force Base, N.M.; and Langley Air Force Base, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the five units that will focus only on humanitarian  
aid missions have headquarters at Pope Air Force Base, N.C.; Travis 
Air Force Base, Calif.; McConnell Air Force Base, Kan.; Grand Forks 
Air Force Base, N.D.; and Fairchild Air Force Base, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Two additional units -- Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho and  
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C. -- would not be part of the 
usual rotation but would remain on call at all times as backup 
units. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force cited as a reason for the overhaul a fourfold jump  
in the number of foreign operations over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul also brings the 125,000 people in Air Force Reserve  
and Air National Guard units into the rotation schedule. It would 
not affect those permanently attached to most overseas bases, 
including those in Europe, South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The first groups to be on call, once the system is in place, are  
those at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and Dyess Air Force Base, 
Texas. The group at Pope Air Force Base, N.C., would be first 
called for a humanitarian mission.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Edges Up to 4.4 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 4.4  
percent in February as the nation's manufacturers continued to be 
battered by the global economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing employment fell by 50,000 last month, the biggest  
setback since last November, with layoffs especially high at 
apparel and aircraft factories, the Labor Department reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the weakness in manufacturing, the overall number of  
payroll jobs climbed by 275,000 last month, slightly higher than 
expectations. Mild winter weather helped boost employment in 
construction and workers in retail sales jumped by the largest 
amount in more than a decade.

<HEADLINE>  Renate Goetschl Captures Ski Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. MORITZ, Switzerland (AP) -- World champion Renate Goetschl of  
Austria added the World Cup downhill crown to her resume with a 
victory Friday, and teammate Alexandra Meissnitzer tightened her 
grip on the overall title. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing better than winning the race the day you win  
the title,'' Goetschl said. ``It just confirms you're the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intent on securing the title before the World Cup finals next  
week in Sierra Nevada, Spain, Goetschl whipped down the course in 1 
minute, 48.65 seconds, leaving compatriot Michaela Dorfmeister .30 
seconds behind and the rest of the field trailing by more than a 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy to have clinched the title here so I can go to  
the finals, relax and enjoy everything Sierra Nevada has to 
offer,'' Goetschl said. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked Goetschl's third straight downhill victory. The  
Austrian won in Are, Sweden, last week and took the gold at the 
worlds in Vail, Colo., last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old skier, who also won the season-opening downhill  
double-header in Lake Louise, Alberta, tops the rankings with an 
unbeatable 560 points, 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes me happiest is how I was so consistent this year,''  
said Goetschl, who won the World Cup downhill title in 1997 on the 
strength of a single victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Goetschl surrendered the World Cup downhill crown to  
Germany's Katja Seizinger, who's been sidelined this season due to 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Runner-up behind Goetschl at the worlds in Vail and again in Are  
last week, Dorfmeister once more settled for second, crossing in 
1:48.95 to climb to second in the downhill standings with 414 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Isolde Kostner finished third in 1:49.77.  
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Hilde Gerg, also vying for the coveted title coming  
into the race, tied for sixth with Meissnitzer in 1:50.34, and 
slipped to third with 399 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, meanwhile, has transferred her attention to  
Saturday's super-G, where she could lock up both the prestigious 
World Cup overall and super-G titles. 
</P>
<P>
	With her main super-G rivals, Martina Ertl of Germany and  
France's Regine Cavagnoud, out with knee injuries, Meissnitzer's 
hunt for points has been facilitated. 
</P>
<P>
	To clinch the overall, Meissnitzer needs only to earn two points  
more than Gerg, the only skier who can mathematically overtake her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still-100 percent motivated because there is still so much  
at stake,'' said Meissnitzer, who won gold in the super-G and giant 
slalom at the worlds. ``I hope I can win the titles tomorrow, but 
in Sierra Nevada there will still be the giant slalom to be 
decided.''

<HEADLINE> Engler, Watts Join Bush Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is turning to fellow  
elected officials to help him get elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Gov. John Engler, Sen. Paul Coverdale of Georgia and  
Reps. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, Jennifer Dunn of Washington and Roy 
Blunt of Missouri will be members of Bush's presidential 
exploratory committee. They will join former Secretary of State 
George Schultz and about four others on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush wants to show a range of support that reflects the  
coalition he hopes to build. Watts is one of the nation's leading 
black elected officials. Dunn is former state party chair who has 
urged the party to find ways to appeal to women. Engler is one of 
16 Republican governors who have pledged their support to their 
fellow chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush's vision, like my own, is one of less government  
and greater freedom for every American,'' Coverdale said Friday. 
``His vision has served the state of Texas well, and has set an 
example for other state and national leaders to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officials are expected to act as liaisons to their fellow  
elected officials who might support Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Tuesday he was forming the committee, the next step  
toward a full-fledged presidential race expected to begin in late 
summer or early fall. He will conduct a news conference Sunday in 
Austin, Texas, to introduce his committee to the public.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Soccer Star Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian soccer star Edmundo was  
sentenced Friday to 4 1/2 years in ``open prison'' for his part in a 
1995 car accident that killed three people. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, those sentenced to ``open prison'' must spend  
daytimes in jail but can go home at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmundo Alves de Souza Neto, who plays for Fiorentina in the  
Italian League and was a part of Brazil's World Cup team last 
summer, has the right to appeal, lawyer Michel Assef said. The 
28-year-old forward remained in Italy with his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Edmundo is going to wait and see what happens; he's hopeful  
the sentence will be overturned,'' said Assef, who intends to file 
the appeal Monday at the Justice Tribunal of Rio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sentence is absurd and unjust,'' added Assef, who alleged  
the other motorist involved in the crash was responsible for the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred when the pickup truck Edmundo was driving  
collided with a car and flipped over, smashing into a pole and 
killing three passengers. Edmundo was saved by the truck's air bag, 
later needing 10 stitches in his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	At a court hearing last May, Edmundo denied he was drunk, saying  
he had consumed two glasses of beer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes To Italians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Italy in an uproar over the acquittal of  
a Marine pilot, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema stood next to 
President Clinton and demanded justice Friday for the cable car 
accident that killed 20 people. Clinton expressed profound regret 
and declared, ``The United States is not trying to duck its 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Italian leader met a day after a military jury  
in North Carolina delivered a not-guilty verdict for the pilot of 
the Marine jet that sliced through a ski gondola cable in an 
Italian alpine valley and sent its passengers plunging to their 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling outraged Italians and immediately became topic No. 1  
at the president's meeting with D'Alema, which had been scheduled 
for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders posed stiffly for photographers in the Oval  
Office. There was no handshake, as there often is for the cameras. 
Later, Clinton and D'Alema leaders held a joint news conference and 
spoke solemnly about the gondola tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema said he and the Italian people were ``personally  
shocked'' by the verdict and said it was ``neither normal nor 
acceptable'' for the jet to roar through a valley at 300 feet or so 
above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for  
what happened is found guilty and punished,'' the prime minister 
said. ``With so many casualties, with so many deaths, you can 
hardly ever say you are satisfied. It is a word I cannot use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was confident that the responsible person would be  
punished ``through a fair trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not asking for a scapegoat,'' the prime minister said.  
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema expressed appreciation for Clinton's remorse and said  
the president had shown ``great human sincerity ... with no 
arrogance, with no sense of detachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are profoundly regretful and apologetic,'' Clinton said. He  
said it was important to ``do what is appropriate by the families'' 
in terms of legal claims and settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he wanted to assure the victims' families and  
the people of Italy that ``the United States is not trying to duck 
its responsibility and that we are heartbroken and horrified by 
what happened. And we're going to do our best to make sure that 
nothing like that ever happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he could not speak to the verdict itself  
because the pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby, still faces an 
obstruction of justice charge even though he was acquitted of 
involuntary homicide and manslaughter. His navigator, Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, also faces charges. Clinton said he did not want his 
remarks to have any impact on those cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The squadron commander was relieved of command, and the  
squadron's director of safety standardization received a reprimand 
letter that effectively ends his military career. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the most important thing now is that the United States  
must clearly and unambiguously shoulder the responsibility for what 
happened,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the U.S. and Italian defense chiefs would  
review operational and safety measures to assess their adequacy and 
determine whether additional measures should be adopted. The United 
States, in the wake of the accident, already has taken steps to 
improve safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States provided a ``modest'' cash settlement to the  
victims' relatives after the accident to help them deal with 
immediate expenses, Clinton said. The families now can file claims, 
and the United States will pay the lion's share of any settlements, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, ``I don't know that my words could ever ease  
the pain of someone who lost a child or a parent or a sibling or a 
spouse in that terrible accident.''

<HEADLINE> Fernandez Returns to Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- The verdict on Alex Fernandez came  
quickly. Deliberations took only two innings and 29 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't get over how good he was,'' Florida Marlins manager  
John Boles said. ``It's official: He's back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, returning from shoulder surgery, pitched two  
scoreless innings Friday to help Florida beat the Tampa Bay Devil 
Bays 8-1. The game was his first since the National League 
championship series in October 1997, when Fernandez was sidelined 
by a torn rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old right-hander allowed a double and two singles,  
including an infield grounder. One runner was caught stealing, and 
another was erased on a double play. He pitched around an error and 
walked none of the eight batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be off that long and come back and do that,'' Boles said,  
``it was impressive. It was amazing. It was remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the game, Fernandez ran laps in the outfield with  
former Chicago White Sox teammate Wilson Alvarez, who is now with 
the Devil Rays. Later, Fernandez bounced his 5-year-old son on his 
lap as he talked about his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Awesome,'' he said. ``I felt really good. I was able to locate  
my pitches, and it was good to be out there with different uniforms 
facing you. It's a step in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez estimated that he threw 20 fastballs, and he also  
threw sliders, curveballs and changeups. He was especially pleased 
with the slider, which produced the double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	He has yet to regain full velocity on his fastball, and the  
batters he retired -- Bubba Trammell, Brooks Kieschnick, John 
Flaherty and Kevin Stocker -- are hardly future Hall of Famers. 
Still, the Marlins were encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alex did a great job,'' catcher Mike Redmond said. ``Maybe  
there were some questions until today, but now I think he knows 
he's going to be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez admitted to butterflies at the start and fell behind  
leadoff hitter Randy Winn 3-0, but 19 of the next 26 pitches were 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Devils Rays manager Larry Rothschild, the Marlins' former  
pitching coach, said he never doubted that Fernandez would come 
back. But at times last year, Fernandez wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had doubts,'' he said. ``I wouldn't be human if I didn't,  
because it's such a tough injury to come back from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doubts are gone. Fernandez is slated to start the Marlins'  
opener April 5 against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I'm going,'' he said, ``there's no reason I shouldn't  
be ready.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A NASA satellite  
carrying a telescope designed to shed light on the history of star 
formation was launched Thursday night over the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wide-Field Infrared Explorer, better known as Wire, was  
carried into space aboard a Pegasus-XL rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wire spacecraft was to be inserted into an orbit 340 miles  
high, circling the Earth every 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA designed the four-month mission to help scientists  
understand how and when galaxies formed, and the subsequent history 
of star-formation in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Wire principal investigator Perry Hacking said the mission's  
science team will measure how densely filled the universe has been 
with star-forming galaxies during its history and how quickly those 
galaxies have been forming stars.

	``Wire also will conduct a search for powerful, dusty quasars in  
the very early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. If found in 
significant numbers, these quasars will carry strong implications 
about the age and structure of our universe,'' Hacking said.

<HEADLINE> Statue Slated Near to White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A brightly colored 32-foot statue will go up  
next month a block from the White House, but passersby may have 
some trouble figuring out what it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brushstroke Group'' was cast in aluminum and colored yellow,  
blue, green, black and white a decade ago by Roy Lichtenstein, a 
practitioner of Pop Art known for paintings that look like blown-up 
comic strip panels. It will stand in front of the Corcoran Gallery 
of Art at 17th Street and New York Avenue to call attention to an 
exhibit of his sculpture that opens June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Present-day sculpture is a favorite taste of the president and  
Hillary Rodham Clinton. She likes to tell of their first date, to 
see a show of statues by British sculptor Henry Moore. She holds 
sculpture exhibits in a small garden outside the White House's East 
Wing, where visitors can see them as they enter the presidential 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its proximity, however, the Clintons won't be able to  
see the Lichtenstein work from the White House. Their view will be 
cut off by the bulk of the Old Executive Office Building and trees 
behind it. 
</P>
<P>
	Corcoran curator Jack Cowart, a longtime friend of the artist,  
said the statue will remain up for a year, on loan. He may try to 
collect money to buy it for the Corcoran from the private collector 
who owns it in Rhinebeck, N.Y. Similar statues stand in Singapore, 
Tokyo and Barcelona, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pricey piece,'' he said, but he wouldn't name a figure.  
</P>
<P>
	A statue on a similar subject, but only about eight feet high,  
sold at Sotheby's auction house for $126,000 in 1990. Lichtenstein 
died in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The subject of the statue is a kind of joke, emphasized by its  
great size. The sculptor seems to have been amused by a discussion 
among artists and critics about whether a painter's brush strokes 
should be visible in a finished painting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lichtenstein did several paintings that were in effect portraits  
of brush strokes, ironically making his own brush strokes 
invisible. Then he carried the joke a step further by creating 
immense sculptures on the same theme.

<HEADLINE> Adelphia To Buy Century for $3.6B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA Pa. (AP) -- Adelphia Communications Corp. is buying  
Century Communications Corp. for $3.6 billion in a deal that will 
make Adelphia the nation's fifth-largest cable television system 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
	Adelphia also will assume about $1.6 billion of Century's debt  
in the merger announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other cable operators, Adelphia and Century are trying to  
build customer bases and revenues by merging. Their deal, which 
must be approved by shareholders and government regulators, is 
expected to close during the third quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the acquisition of Century, Adelphia's annual revenues  
will exceed $2 billion and we will serve nearly 5 million 
customers,'' said John Rigas, chairman and CEO of Coudersport-based 
Adelphia. ``This transaction strengthens the company financially 
and adds significant talent to our management team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fast-changing market is causing a wave of mergers among  
telecommunications companies trying to keep pace, said Jeffrey 
Kagan, an industry analyst based in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the merger AT&AMP;T expects to close this month with  
Tele-Communications Inc., the second-largest cable company, will 
not only affect the cable market, but could give consumers a new 
provider of local telephone and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	For smaller companies trying to amass the resources to keep up,  
Kagan said, ``Consolidation is the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Tow, Century's chairman and chief executive, said  
merging with Adelphia would create a nationwide cable operator 
capable of delivering advanced video and data services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adelphia shares our views with respect to the future of the  
industry, the opportunities for our shareholders and the importance 
of our employees,'' Tow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Century's Class A common stockholders will get $9.16 per share  
and 0.6122 shares of Adelphia Class A common stock for each share 
they own. Century's Class B common stockholders will get $11.81 and 
0.6360 shares of Adelphia Class A common stock for each share they 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	New Canaan, Conn.-based Century Communications owns and operates  
cable television systems in California, Colorado and Puerto Rico. 
Century recently entered into an agreement with Tele-Communications 
Inc. to create a 70 percent-owned joint venture which will operate 
a cable system group serving approximately 800,000 subscribers in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	After completion of the Century deal and the recently announced  
acquisition of FrontierVision Partners LP, Adelphia will become the 
nation's No. 5 cable company.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps 205 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average surged into  
record territory today after a tame inflation report eased concerns 
that the Federal Reserve may soon raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 205.38 at 9,672.78,  
adding to Thursday's 191-point gain. Of the 30 Dow components, all 
but Philip Morris rose today. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index is now trading above its record close of  
9,643.32 and previous intraday high of 9,647.97, which both took 
place on Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other stock indexes also rose today, the second day of big gains  
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been correcting and consolidating for eight weeks. The  
market was short-term oversold,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director 
of market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``We 
had the preconditions in place for a rally and that's what we are 
getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling today's gains was a Labor Department report that showed  
the unemployment rate edging up slightly to 4.4 percent in February 
and the number of payroll jobs rising by a better-than-expected 
275,000 last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The average hourly earnings, a gauge of business costs, rose a  
smaller-than-expected 1 cent to $13.04, representing an increase of 
just 3.6 percent over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report conveyed that the U.S. economy continues to expand  
without any inflationary threats. With such data in hand, investors 
believe the Fed will have little reason to raise interest rates in 
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sign that the economy is truly not overheating,''  
said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum 
&AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ``If the economy isn't running on all 
cylinders, nothing should happen with interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks soared on the report, as did the inflation-sensitive bond  
market. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 48/32 or $15 
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction, fell to 5.59 percent from 5.69 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge on Wall Street followed big gains overnight in global  
financial markets. Japan's main market index climbed 5 percent on 
the best day of trading of this year. In London, the Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100 index gained 1.7 percent, while main 
market indicators rose 2.5 percent in Frankfurt and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading today's gains were blue-chip stocks. IBM rose 5 13/16 to  
176 13/16 and General Motors gained 3 1/16 at 88 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks also rose, as the potential for an  
interest-rate hike diminished. Chase rose 2 5/16 at 85 11/16 and 
Citigroup was up 1 3/8 at 61 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	While technology stocks were mostly higher today, they failed to  
keep pace with the gains in other sectors. Technology stocks have 
been battered in recent weeks amid concerns over profits and 
slowing personal-computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``They still look like they are out of gas,'' said Belski. ``The  
market can and should go up without the support of technology 
stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 572.78 million 
shares, up from 508.4 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 20.39 at 1,267.03, and  
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 30.70 at 
2,323.59. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 8.76 at 599.51, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 10.56 at 709.08.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jumps Another 200 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average rose another  
200 points this morning, following a 191.52-point gain yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
	As of 10 a.m. EST, the Dow was up 197.23 to 9,664.63.  
</P>
<P>
	It would be a record-high close today if the Dow can maintain  
that level. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 43.21 to 2,336.10.  
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 710.55 points,  
closing the week at 14,894.00 points -- the highest closing level 
since Dec. 9, when the index finished at 14,931.90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 200 points in the first  
half-hour of trading, and broad-market indicators also posted 
substantial gains. The strong numbers were fueled by a Labor 
Department report that showed the jobless rate edged up slightly to 
4.4 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the overall employment picture remained strong, indicating  
an economy that is continuing to post solid growth with no 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese markets set the tone for a robust trading day. Tokyo  
stocks posted their strongest gains this year, rising 5 percent. In 
Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 3.3 percent to a six-week high. 
Singapore's main index rose 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally continued in early European trading today. In London,  
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index was up 117.4, or 1.9 
percent, at 6,218.8 by afternoon. The main market indicators were 
up 1.2 percent in Frankfurt and Paris and 1.3 percent in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong performance overseas followed a 2.1 percent rise on  
Thursday in the Dow Jones industrial average. The 191.52 point gain 
left the Dow industrials at 9,467.40 and more than erased losses 
over the previous two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was lifted by several factors: a huge contract signed by  
two U.S. computer giants, IBM and Dell Computer Co.; rising oil 
prices; and a new report about U.S. factory orders that appeared to 
dampen fears about rising inflation in America. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, which is suffering its worst recession in decades as  
well as deflation, a persistent fall in consumer prices, investors 
also benefited from some good news. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 710.55  
points, closing at 14,894.00 points. It was the highest closing 
level since Dec. 9 and the Nikkei's best single-day session since 
Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investment environment was ideal,'' said Kazunori Jinnai,  
a manager at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said some foreign investors now feel that Japan's  
economy may have bottomed out and could be headed for a slow 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Bank of Japan began guiding domestic  
short-term interest rates closer to zero in an effort to boost the 
economy by lowering costs for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	That move was praised today by top Japanese officials.  
</P>
<P>
	The lower interest rates also have helped boost the dollar,  
which has been climbing steadily against the yen, a change that 
benefits big Japanese exporters such as Sony and Toshiba by making 
their products more affordable abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 328.36 points  
to close at 10,241.12, largely because of big gains on two key 
stocks, traders said. HSBC Holdings PLC shares jumped 4 percent, 
and Hongkong Telecom shares leaped 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains in Hongkong Telecom were sparked by news reports today  
that the phone company plans to announce a cooperative agreement 
with the U.S. computer giant Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the second time this week that Hong Kong, which is also  
suffering through a recession, got good news from overseas.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Mack Won't Seek Re-Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two-term Republican Sen. Connie Mack  
will not seek re-election in 2000, The Associated Press learned 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, 58, already has told close friends and family members of  
his decision. He will make an announcement in Washington on Monday 
on his future, deputy press secretary Bethany Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the senator said that Mack would return to  
Florida to formally announce his resignation plans March 13 in his 
hometown of Fort Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors had swirled in recent weeks that Mack might leave the  
Senate. He was first elected in 1988 and easily defeated Hugh 
Rodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, in 1994 with 71 percent 
of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush tried last week to persuade Mack to remain in the  
Senate. The governor is ``surprised and disappointed,'' Bush 
spokesman Cory Tilley said. ``But he understands Sen. Mack's 
reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No reason was announced for his decision, but an adviser to Mack  
said he is leaving the Senate because he believes it's time to move 
on to a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, two Democratic senators, Richard Bryan of Nevada and  
Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, announced they would not seek 
re-election. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., also is 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans now hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate, but must defend  
19 seats next year, compared with 14 for the Democrats. The 19 GOP 
seats include many held by first-termers who were pulled into 
office on the strength of the GOP landslide in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack is a longtime advocate of term limits, supporting a Florida  
law that limits most statewide elected officials to a maximum of 
eight years in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack already had collected $2.9 million for a re-election bid  
since 1994 and has $1.7 million in cash in his campaign account, 
according to the Federal Elections Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential candidates had been lining up to run if Mack retired.  
They include U.S. Reps. Mark Foley, a Republican, and Peter 
Deutsch, a Democrat. Others include state Insurance Commissioner 
Bill Nelson, a former Democratic congressman, and Republican U.S. 
Rep. Bill McCollum, whose profile was raised as a prosecutor during 
Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former politician who might run is former Republican  
state Sen. Charlie Crist, who lost to U.S. Sen. Bob Graham last 
year.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers To Get Tax Refunds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service wants to make  
this tax season easier for hog farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Friday the IRS would  
expedite processing tax returns for pork producers with net 
operating losses in 1998. Those farmers should receive their tax 
refunds within 30 days of filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers have been devastated in recent months by record low  
prices. At their lowest, prices in December dropped to around $8 
per hundredweight compared to $40 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this particularly difficult time for America's small  
hog farmers, every possible step can mean the difference between 
going out of business and surviving,'' Glickman said at a meeting 
of pork producers in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers with net operating losses, which occur when business  
expenses exceed gross income, may apply for refunds by filing IRS 
Form 1045 and writing ``Hog Farmer'' across the top of the form. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has already announced $50 million in payments to  
help hog farmers.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Computer Hackers Alarming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer problem is a ``piece of  
cake'' compared with the challenge of safeguarding the Pentagon's 
computer network against an attack by high-tech terrorists or a 
rogue nation, the head of a House Armed Services panel says. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., chairman of the subcommittee on  
research and development, said a recent episode in which computer 
hackers were able to break into the network through the Internet in 
a new fashion only underscores the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department says it was able to stop the latest  
episode of computer hacking. It said the intruders did not 
penetrate the ``closed'' part of the network and thus were not able 
to access any classified material. 
</P>
<P>
	But Weldon said Friday, ``I would be shocked and surprised'' if  
the Pentagon had been successful in thwarting the recent efforts to 
break into the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre gave a closed-door briefing  
to House members last week regarding efforts to hack into the 
Pentagon's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and administration officials, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said Hamre told the lawmakers that a new, 
potentially more damaging method of penetrating the Pentagon's 
computer system had been detected. 
</P>
<P>
	A military computer server near San Antonio was probed for  
several days in January by hackers who entered the system through 
an overseas site on the Internet, the sources said. The intrusions 
were detected by the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The new method for intruding ``is larger and much harder to  
understand'' than previous assaults by hackers, Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they have made progress'' in coming up with better  
surveillance systems and programs, Weldon said. ``The frustration I 
have is I don't think the military is prepared to deal with this in 
the way that we have to in the next century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weldon called for a full-scale effort to find innovative ways to  
safeguard the computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, he suggested that the first war ``of the 21st century  
is going to be an attack we don't even know about until it's under 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the amount of attention given to the Year 2000 computer  
problem is ``laughable.'' Compared with the problem of safeguarding 
the Pentagon's computers, ``the Y2K problem is a piece of cake. 
It's identified, and you know how to deal with it,'' Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, former government officials and defense  
experts said an attack on critical information infrastructures was 
the most immediate national security threat facing the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ellsworth, a former deputy defense secretary, told the  
Senate Armed Services Committee's new panel on emerging threats and 
capabilities that the systems at risk include those involving 
medical services, electric power generation, telecommunications, 
banking and finance and oil and gas production. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most important, most compelling danger and one to  
which we should apply our resources immediately,'' Ellsworth said.

<HEADLINE> Suspects in Gay Killing Described </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYLACAUGA, Ala. (AP) -- Steve Mullins talked tough, shaved his  
head, wore boots and racist T-shirts and was said to get his kicks 
taunting blacks. His new buddy, construction worker Charles Butler 
Jr., was quieter. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, police say, they beat a gay man to death and burned  
his body on a pile of kerosene-soaked tires in a killing that has 
once again turned a national spotlight on violence against 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins, 25, and Butler, 21, are charged with murdering  
39-year-old textile worker Billy Jack Gaither on Feb. 19. According 
to investigators, the men said they did it because Gaither had made 
sexual advances on them. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton offered his prayers to Gaither's friends and  
family and compared the slaying to the dragging death of a black 
man in Texas and the fatal beating of Matthew Shepard, the gay 
Wyoming college student who was lashed to a fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``In times like this, the American people pull together and  
speak with one voice, because the acts of hatred that led to the 
deaths of such innocent men are also acts of defiance against the 
values our society holds most dear,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sylacauga, about 40 miles southeast of Birmingham, Larry  
Hammond, who owns The Tavern, a country-music bar frequented by 
Mullins and Gaither, said Mullins once taunted blacks at a 
restaurant. Wearing a Ku Klux Klan T-shirt, he pressed his back 
against the window so the diners could see the racist insignia, 
Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins also once caused a scene in the bar by using racial  
epithets when blacks entered, Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins was known as a skinhead wannabe who acted tough but  
backed down quickly if challenged, the tavern owner said. ``He 
tried to walk around like a bully, but he wasn't,'' Hammond said 
Friday. ``He was mostly talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins and Butler, a high school dropout, began hanging around  
together about a month ago, said Terry Butler, Butler's stepmother. 
They had known each other for several years because Mullins lived 
with Butler's half-brother, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Butler said she never heard her stepson express hatred of  
gays. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a big issue here, but it might have been when he was  
out with his friends,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler blamed the actual killing on Mullins, his relatives said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He told his daddy he didn't know the other guy was going to do  
that,'' said a Butler uncle, Freddie Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ain't ever been into a lot of trouble. He's just a typical  
boy,'' said Butler's grandmother, Willene White. ``It's just hard 
for me to believe he did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Deputy Al Bradley would not comment on which man took  
the leading role. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullins' relatives could not be located. Neither man had an  
attorney yet. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service may be held for Gaither next week in Alabama.  
Details had not yet been worked out.

<HEADLINE> Italy Stunned by Marine's Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Bewildered and outraged by the acquittal of a U.S.  
Marine pilot, Italians demanded justice today for 20 people who 
were sent plunging to their deaths when his jet ripped through a 
gondola cable in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, was acquitted Thursday at Camp Lejeune,  
N.C., of 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the Feb. 3, 1998 
tragedy, in the Cavalese ski resort in northern Italy. He still 
faces an obstruction of justice charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the pilot wasn't guilty, then someone above him was,'' said  
the Rev. Lorenzo Caserotti, the Roman Catholic pastor in the Alpine 
town. ``This verdict leaves us all astounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had alleged that Ashby was flying the EA-6B Prowler  
too fast and too low during a training mission through the Alpine 
valley. The defense blamed faulty equipment and bad maps. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian newspapers reported that Premier Massimo D'Alema would  
bring up the matter when he meets President Clinton today at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are asking for justice, and we shall explore all the legal  
ways to ensure that those who are responsible are held liable,'' 
D'Alema told reporters in Boston on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident strained relations between the United States and  
Italy, which hosts a number of military bases important to the 
United States and to the NATO alliance. The verdict renewed calls 
by some to close down the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The victims didn't get the justice they deserved,'' said  
Fausto Bertinotti, head of the small but influential Communist 
Refoundation party. ``This is not only the acquittal of a pilot, 
this is the acquittal of an entire system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The undersecretary of defense, Paolo Guerrini, said parliament  
should review the provisions of the NATO treaty that gave the 
United States jurisdiction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's ambassador in Rome, Thomas M. Foglietta, said in a  
statement distributed today that the verdict ``shocked'' him. 
</P>
<P>
	After ``speaking to our military experts in the Department of  
Defense, I concluded and said that the pilots flying that plane 
were flying too fast and too low, and that it was our fault. ... 
Like many, I am surprised at the verdict,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shameful verdict,'' said Klaus Stampfl, the son of one  
of the victims, Maria Steiner, a 60-year-old retired shopkeeper 
from northern Italy. ``It was certainly not a serious trial, not as 
serious as it would have been in Italy,'' said Stampfl, who 
attended a few court sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Steiner was one of three Italians who died, along with two  
Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, two Austrians and one Dutch 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have proven facts like flying too fast, too low in an open  
valley. And then we have a not-guilty verdict? It is not to be 
understood,'' said Filip Vermander, the brother of Belgian victim 
Stefaan Vermander. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgian Justice minister, Tony Van Parys, said: ``Based on legal  
perceptions, I have the impression that some things are not in 
synch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's acquittal ``leaves a bitter taste in the mouth,''  
wrote Il Messaggero columnist Roberto Martinelli in a front-page 
piece today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impunity of the powerful,'' was the title of La  
Repubblica's lead column. 
</P>
<P>
	One of NATO's top military commanders, however, urged the United  
States' European allies to live with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope all our European nations will accept that the judge,  
the court, has spoken,'' said German Gen. Klaus Naumann, head of 
NATO's military planning panel. ``It is one of our common rules 
that we accept the rulings of our courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naumann said the priority was for NATO military to tighten  
safety procedures to prevent similar incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The only positive reaction came from the Italian lawyers who  
defended Ashby in the Italian investigation, Antonio and Bruno 
Malattia, who called the trial ``scrupulous'' and the verdict 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, is awaiting trial on  
similar charges. Charges against the back-seat crew were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the victims are seeking damages from the U.S.  
government.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Stottlemyre a Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre already has injected his  
irreverent personality into the Arizona Diamondbacks clubhouse. Now 
he wants to bring a new pitch to his game, too. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing a $32 million, four-year contract, the 33-year-old  
right-hander came to spring training vowing to add a new pitch to 
his repertoire. A simple game of catch with reliever Greg Swindell 
showed him just the pitch he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``About the third or fourth day of camp I was playing catch with  
Swindell,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I was working on my changeup and he 
threw me a changeup back and it fell off the table. I said `What 
the hell is that?' He said he just split his fingers on the 
baseball real lightly and throws a fastball. I gave it a shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a marriage made in pitching heaven: A pitcher who thrives  
on intensity learns a changeup pitch that doesn't require him to 
ease up his throwing motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say it comes naturally, but it fits my  
personality,'' Stottlemyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre's personality made its imprint on the Diamondbacks  
from day one. He is funny, sharp, cutting and a little profane. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a go-getter,'' said Swindell, who didn't know Stottlemyre  
until this spring. ``He doesn't take anything from anybody. If 
something is on his mind, he's going to let you know about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it's the president of the United States. When President  
Clinton dropped by the Diamondbacks' spring training camp last 
week, Stottlemyre took the opportunity to ask for a presidential 
opinion of a major golfing dispute with Andy Benes. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Clinton sided with Stottlemyre.  
</P>
<P>
	Personalities like Stottlemyre's are of immense importance to a  
team, Swindell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where it starts -- in the clubhouse,'' Swindell said.  
``You can't come in the clubhouse tense or uptight every day. 
You've got to have people like that to keep you loose. When you can 
come into the clubhouse to expect a few laughs and someone who can 
ease the tension when things are going bad, it's good to have 
people like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes to pitching, he is as no-nonsense as a pitcher  
can be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know when I'm through that I've left it all on the  
field,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has learned, though, that spring training is not for  
intensity but for working on his game. So he wasn't upset at all to 
give up three runs and three hits in his two-inning debut for the 
Diamondbacks against Colorado on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was excited about this new pitch. He had purposely  
avoided throwing his ``out'' pitch, a slider, and had gone to the 
new changeup often. He got a couple of strikeouts with the pitch 
and was intrigued about what it would do for him down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another pitch he can use with a left-handed hitter,''  
pitching coach Mark Conner said. ``He's used to bringing his slider 
in, in, in against left-handers with two strikes. Now he's got 
something going away from them with a different speed than his 
fastball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre will continue to avoid his slider for another week  
or so, then will work on all four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm splitting my fingers on the baseball and throwing a  
fastball,'' he said. ``It comes out like a changeup and it has real 
good movement. It's a lot of fun. It's a great challenge.''

<HEADLINE> North Korea Nuclear Talks Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S.-North Korean talks on American concerns  
about an underground construction site in North Korea recessed 
Friday night, the State Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	No date was set for resuming the talks but a meeting Saturday  
was considered possible, spokesman Lee McClenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks got under way last Saturday and have been held at the  
U.S. mission to the United Nations. The State Department has 
declined to say whether progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is concerned that the site is being used to  
develop nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 U.S.-North Korean 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have demanding unconditional access to the site  
but North Korea has thus far refused.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Royal John Mayberry Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Former Kansas City Royals star John  
Mayberry was charged with resisting arrest after scuffling with 
police on a traffic warrant and swallowing a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old former player was released after posting bond  
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayberry was stopped about 7:40 p.m. Wednesday and police  
discovered he was wanted for a traffic violation. When they tried 
to arrest him, he shoved a plastic bag into his mouth and ran off, 
the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers tackled Mayberry and he swallowed the plastic bag,  
police said. He was taken to a hospital to be examined. 
</P>
<P>
	``As to what he swallowed, we don't know what it was,'' Sgt.  
Floyd Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayberry, a power-hitting first baseman in the 1970s, spent 15  
seasons in the majors, playing with Houston, Kansas City and 
Toronto. In his six seasons with the Royals, he averaged 24 home 
runs and 94 RBIs. He retired in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Strives for 'Clean' Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The committee planning the 2002 Winter  
Games is trying to figure how to fulfill a promise to be ``squeaky 
clean,'' and whether that will mean the resignations of more board 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Three trustees with conflicts -- owners of companies that are  
building venues and hosting competitions -- resigned last month as 
the scandal-rocked Salt Lake Organizing Committee announced a 
sweeping new philosophy grounded in ethics and open 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	But now attention is turning to the second tier, trustees whose  
business acumen is vital to planning such an immense sporting 
event, but who have indirect or perceived business ties to the 
SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among those is Gordon Strachan, a Park City lawyer who  
earlier in his career was an assistant to H.R. Haldeman, President 
Nixon's chief of staff during the Watergate coverup. 
</P>
<P>
	Strachan is legal counsel for Powdr Corp., which owns Park City  
Mountain Resort, the venue for giant slalom and snowboarding in 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense tells me that crosses the line,'' says Glenn  
Bailey, a leader of Impact 2002 &AMP; Beyond, a coalition representing 
low-income, disabled and minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition long has demanded the resignations of trustees who  
stand to gain financially through their contracts with the SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	That was something the governor, trustees and even the SLOC's  
ethics panel resisted until the clamor from corporate sponsors grew 
loud amid revelations the city's Olympic bidders spent $1.2 million 
currying favor with International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the coalition is pressing for the SLOC to deliver on  
promises made by Leavitt and new chief executive officer Mitt 
Romney. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan Karras, the governor's stand-in on the board, is heading  
up the committee writing new rules. He'll take a draft to the 
board's management committee on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My objective is to be as honest and open as possible,'' Karras  
says. But, he concedes, ``the devil is in the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is clear there is no conflict for a trustee whose gain is  
shared by all Utah residents in an Olympics-injected economy. And 
everyone agrees it is a conflict when a trustee stands to gain 
personally and financially from being on the SLOC board. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving at a clear standard, though, begs myriad questions.  
</P>
<P>
	How much of a company must a trustee own before its business  
with the SLOC becomes an issue -- 1 percent, 10 percent, 50 percent? 
What if the company is a supplier to a business that contracts with 
the SLOC? What if a trustee's spouse, son or daughter wants to do 
business with the Olympics? Is it a conflict for a trustee to own 
or work for a company sponsoring the games, selling Olympic 
merchandise or simply donating money? 
</P>
<P>
	The chief executive of First Security Corp., Spence Eccles, is a  
trustee, and Utah Speaker of the House Marty Stephens, who joined 
the board in the February reorganization, works for Zions Bank. 
Does that mean the SLOC can have no accounts at those banks? 
</P>
<P>
	What about Karras, who is on the board of PacifiCorp, which will  
supply electricity for the games, and trustee R.D. Cash, chairman 
of Questar, which will supply all the natural gas? 
</P>
<P>
	And how about Henry Marsh, a former Olympian and lawyer who  
works as an author and lecturer for Franklin Covey, a Salt 
Lake-based personal planning business that wants to become a 
sponsor? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry nearly as much about people giving money as  
making money off the games. That's where I think the real concern 
of the community is,'' Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he were forced to resign from the board, then so be it, Marsh  
said. ``What benefit have I had? It's all work, it's volunteer 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney has investments in businesses such as Dominos Pizza  
through his venture capital firm, Bain Capital Inc. of Boston, and 
he sits on the boards of others, such as Marriott. Romney has said 
he will either sever ties or install barriers to separate his 
organizing committee work from his business ties. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's the man Romney replaced, Frank Joklik, who  
resigned Jan. 8 amid the housecleaning. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey at Impact 2002 &AMP; Beyond says he was ``horrified'' Joklik  
remained on the board in spite of what Bailey considers a big 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik is chief executive of MK Gold, a public company whose  
major shareholder, Leucadia Corp., also is a major shareholder in 
Powdr Corp., the parent of Park City Mountain Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik insists the two companies have nothing to do with each  
other. ``We're purely in the mining business. We're not in the ski 
business,'' he said. ``There's no conflict of interest. There just 
isn't any, either in reality or perception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most important decisions facing the board is whether  
to open trustees' disclosure forms to public inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	``What that does is create a situation where potential conflicts  
of interest are public and can be considered by the people,'' 
Bailey said. ``As long as those remain private, it's impossible to 
do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At present, the forms are secret. Trustees who wonder if they  
have conflicts ask SLOC lawyers for an opinion, and don't take part 
in votes affecting them. 
</P>
<P>
	But conflicts are not always obvious.  
</P>
<P>
	Strachan, for instance, refused to confirm this week that he is  
Park City Mountain Resort's lawyer, citing attorney-client 
privilege. He also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Karras agrees the disclosures should be public, yet he frets  
that the pendulum for openness may swing so far that board trustees 
are deprived of privacy and the board loses the best minds in Utah 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could make a war out of this,'' Karras said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trustees should not have to disclose their net worth or  
investments that have nothing to do with the Olympics, Karras 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to set a trap for people to say `ah ha, he didn't  
report that he owns 200 shares of AT&AMP;T,''' Karras said. ``I don't 
want this public service to be so onerous that it will be seen as a 
penalty to be on the board.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared 268.68  
points to a record of 9,736.08 today and cracked through 9,700 for 
the first time. Stocks were ignited by a government employment 
report that calmed worries about rising interest rates. Today's 
finish topped the Dow's Jan. 8 record finish of 9,643.32 and 
brought 1999's rise to 6 percent. In the last two days, the Dow has 
gained more than 460 points, or 5 percent. However, the gain is not 
even close to a record in percentage terms. Advancers led decliners 
on the NYSE 2,076-914. The Nasdaq was up 45.38 at 2338.27.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Three bodies were found today that  
authorities believe belong to three Americans kidnapped by 
suspected leftist rebels in Colombia last week. Two tattoos on one 
body confirmed it belonged to Ingrid Washinawatok, 41, a member of 
the Menominee nation in Wisconsin, her tribal chief said. The other 
two Americans kidnapped were Terence Freitas, 24, of Los Angeles, 
and Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii. The three were seized Jan. 25 
after spending time with an indigenous people on a mission aimed at

their business and put the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal to rest. The 
Lewinsky affair that led to Clinton's impeachment came up at a 
press conference, and the president answered with yet another call 
for an end to it. ``What I hope is that she will be permitted to go 
on with her life,'' he said. ``And I hope it will be a good 
life....''

	Defense Experts Cite Cyberattacks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of a cyberattack on high-tech  
equipment is the most immediate, compelling danger facing the 
United States, former government officials and defense experts told 
a Senate panel today. Other concerns include the proliferation of 
missiles capable of mass destruction among rogue states and 
terrorists developing chemical and biological weapons. A former 
deputy defense secretary warned against cyber-based attacks 
disguised as Y2K computer problems.

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mike Tyson must serve a 60-day sentence for  
violating his Indiana probation at the end of the one-year sentence 
he is serving in Montgomery County, Md. However, he won't be 
returned to Indiana for the jail time under an agreement reached 
yesterday with the Marion County (Ind.) prosecutor. Tyson was on 
probation in Indiana for a 1992 rape conviction when he was 
convicted of misdemeanor assault in Maryland.

	Dow Passes 9,700 for First Time  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than  
260 points today to pass 9,700 for the first time. By 3:25 p.m. 
EST, the Dow was up 260.25 to 9,727.65. The Dow's previous record 
close of 9,643.32 and previous intraday high of 9,647.97 both took 
place on Jan. 8, 1999. Leading the Dow higher today was IBM, which 
was up 5 1/8 at 176 1/8. Advancers led decliners on the NYSE 1,955-934. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 24.99 to 2,317.88.

	Clinton Apologizes in Cable Car Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said that Americans are  
``profoundly regretful and apologetic'' for the cable car accident 
in Italy that killed 20 people. Clinton and Prime Minister Massimo 
D'Alema are to holding a joint news conference at this hour. The 
two had a private meeting earlier today in the Oval Office, one day 
after the acquittal of a U.S. Marine pilot in the cable car 
accident that killed skiers in Italy a year ago.

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- One day after the acquittal of the U.S. Marine  
Pilot, Italians are up in arms demanding justice for the 20 people 
killed when a jet cut the cable of a ski gondola in the Alps. Capt. 
Richard Ashby, 31, was acquitted yesterday at Camp Lejeune, N.C., 
of 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the Feb. 3, 1998

	Jobless Rate Edges Up to 4.4 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The unemployment rate edged up slightly from  
4.3 percent to 4.4 percent in February as the nation's 
manufacturers continued to be battered by the global economic 
crisis. But Wall Street took heart from strong hiring gains 
elsewhere, sending stocks into record territory today. The Labor 
Department said that even with the slight 0.1 percentage point 
uptick in the jobless rate, the number of payroll jobs rose by 
275,000, better than expected, led by hiring at construction sites 
and retail establishments.

	Court Nixes Anti-Violence Law

<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal law that gives civil rights

unconstitutional, a divided federal appeals court ruled today. The 
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 7-4 to uphold a lower 
court's ruling against the Violence Against Women Act, which allows 
women to sue their sex attackers for damages in federal court for 
violating their civil rights.

East Timor from erupting in bloodshed if the territory chooses 
independence. ``Violence is the enemy of democracy, security and 
prosperity,'' she said today. ``We will not walk away,'' Habibie 
responded, according to a senior U.S. official present at their 
two-hour meeting. Indonesia is the last stop for Albright on a

Albanian leaders today to immediately sign a peace plan for Kosovo, 
hinting that the deal must be settled before rebels can visit 
Washington. Dole, who was in the region at President Clinton's 
request, had to meet the ethnic Albanian leaders in the Macedonian 
capital of Skopje because he was blocked from entering neighboring 
Yugoslavia when the government denied him a visa. The Republican is 
a longtime ally of the ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cop Admits Faked War Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A retired police chief who was honored as a  
war hero a month ago admitted he never served in Vietnam or was a 
prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Nicholson, 62, told The Cincinnati Enquirer for a story  
published today that he fabricated his service record to try to get 
increased veterans benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived such a straitlaced way of life since I was a kid,''  
he told the newspaper. ``Nothing but honor and integrity always 
came first, until 2 1/2 years ago. I can't face this. I've got such a 
good reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said that after Nicholson's tearful confession, he  
said he felt suicidal and was taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper discovered that Nicholson, who was police chief in  
nearby Amelia from 1982-86, had made false claims about his service 
record and confronted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Army National Guard's 147th Armor Battalion  
honored Nicholson for heroic action while serving in Vietnam with 
the Army. He also claimed he had been a prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson had sought recognition and produced documents and a  
Distinguished Service Cross to support the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Several veterans notified the newspaper that Nicholson was not  
what he claimed to be. The Enquirer searched military records and 
found no record of Nicholson serving in the Army. Government 
records showed he served in the Navy from 1964-68. 
</P>
<P>
	When confronted by the newspaper, Nicholson said he bought the  
Distinguished Service Cross and forged military documents from a 
stranger 2 1/2 years ago. He said he hoped to increase his veterans 
benefits by passing himself off as a Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	He could be charged with forging military documents and honors,  
which carry maximum penalties ranging from fines to a year in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army and the National Guard are investigating and will  
decide whether to ask the Justice Department to pursue charges, 
said Shari Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Total Army 
Personnel Command in Alexandria, Va.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Missouri Tobacco Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A judge has approved Missouri's $6.7 billion  
settlement with big tobacco companies, despite complaints from 
cities, counties and hospitals around the state who say they are 
being wrongly excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Jimmie Edwards announced the deal at a brief  
hearing today. Now the Legislature has to decide what to do with 
the money. The money is meant to help reimburse the state for 
medical costs associated with smoking, among other expenses, state 
Attorney General Jay Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, appeals by the cities and hospitals could delay the  
money flow, possibly for several years, Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for St. Louis, Kansas City, two counties and 53  
hospitals argued that the current deal doesn't guarantee them any 
money and could interfere with their own lawsuits against the 
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards ruled that they are not entitled to part of this  
settlement. City and hospital lawyers have filed their own lawsuit 
against big tobacco seeking $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri is one of 46 states that reached an agreement in  
November with the tobacco industry. The deal is part of a national 
settlement offered by four tobacco companies that would pay the 
states about $206 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement calls for Missouri to receive annual payments for  
25 years beginning June 30, 2000, with an initial payment of about 
$200 million. A smaller payment of about $54 million would be due 
before that.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Wins 3,000 at Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- Conserving his energy for a full weekend  
of racing, Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie ran just fast enough to 
win his second straight 3,000-meter title at the World Indoor 
Championships Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie's winning time of 7 minutes, 53.57 seconds was more  
than 18 seconds slower than his championship record time of 7:34.71 
in 1997 and nearly 30 seconds off the world record of 7:24.90 by 
Kenya's Daniel Komen. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gebrselassie, who thrives on world records -- he has set 15  
marks during his illustrious career -- was content to toy with the 
field and not overly exert himself because he is attempting an 
unprecedented double in the 1,500 and 3,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,500 semifinals are Saturday and the final Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie remained just off the pace until just over 400  
meters remained. Then he burst to the front, and no one came close 
to catching him. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Bitok of Kenya finished second and Gebrselassie's teammate,  
Million Wolde, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to go faster because I have to run again  
tomorrow,'' Gebrselassie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandsr Bagach of Ukraine finished first in the men's shot  
put, just like he did at the 1997 World Outdoor Championships 
before testing positive for the stimulant ephedrine and losing the 
title and the $60,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he threw 70 feet, 3 inches.  
</P>
<P>
	And just like at the 1997 world outdoors, John Godina of the  
United States was runner-up, with a season's best of 69-1 1/4. Two 
years ago, Godina was the beneficiary of Bagach's disqualification 
and was awarded the title and the big money. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second straight defeat for Godina, the world's  
top-ranked shot putter last year. He had a 24-meet winning streak 
snapped last weekend at Atlanta, where he finished third in the USA 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuri Belonog of Ukraine, the 1997 indoor champion, finished  
third this time at 68-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	A big surprise was the victory by Kristina Kalcheva of Bulgaria  
in the women's high jump. She cleared 6-6 1/4, a significant 
improvement over her previous season's best of 6-3 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	A bigger surprise was the fourth-place finish of Romania's  
Monica Dinescu, last year's undisputed No. 1 in the world. She 
cleared only 6-4 behind Zuzana Kovacikova-Hlavonova of the Czech 
Republic and Tisha Waller of the United States, both of whom jumped 
6-5. The Czech got the silver medal on fewer misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Germans won the first two gold medals, with men's triple jumper  
Charles Friedek and women's pole vaulter Nastja Ryshich both 
setting career bests. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedek, last year's World Cup winner, leaped 56 feet, 4 1/2  
inches, matching his lifetime best, as favorite Yoelbi Quesada of 
Cuba wound up fifth at 55-6 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryshich set a championship record in capturing the gold medal at  
14-9, beating an outstanding field that included world outdoor 
record-holder Emma George of Australia, world indoor record-holder 
Nicole Humbert of Germany and defending champion Stacy Dragila of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	George, bothered by a shoulder injury, wound up sixth at 14-3 1/4.  
Humbert, who set the world record of 14-11 1/2 a week ago, tied for 
third, also at 14-3 1/4. Dragila, winner of the inaugural women's pole 
vault at the championships two years ago at 14-5 1/4, also cleared 
14-3 1/4, but was eighth on more misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedek's best jump came on his first attempt, and it stood up  
through all six rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first jump was a security jump,'' he said. ``My coach told  
me to be relaxed. It wasn't my best jump (technically), but after I 
made the jump and saw the length, I thought it might be the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me very nervous. It was very hard to jump after  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rotislav Dimitrov of Bulgaria took the silver at 55-11 1/4 and U.S.  
champion LaMark Carter got the bronze with a season's best of 
55-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Vala Flosadottir of Iceland finished second in the women's vault  
at 14-7 1/4, and Zsuzsa Szabo of Hungary tied Humbert for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men's 60-meter hurdles heats had the makings of a  
final, with Colin Jackson, the world record-holder, edging Reggie 
Torian, the U.S. champion and 1999 world leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was timed in 7.42 seconds, his season's best, with  
Torian the runner-up at 7.43. Torian ran 7.38 in winning the U.S. 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran conservatively,'' Torian said. ``When I run  
conservatively, it is usually sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured Colin was going to get out front to show he was  
still head honcho.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two were to meet later Friday in the final. It was Jackson's  
fourth final at the championships and he was seeking his first 
victory, having finished second three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, the world indoor record-holder in  
the 200 at 19.92 -- the same time he already has run outdoors in 
Australia this year -- eased through his first-round heat in 20.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Kevin Little of the United States also won  
his heat in 20.83 as did American record-holder Rohsaan Griffin at 
20.83. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I run to the best of my ability (in Saturday's final), I  
will get a better time than last week,'' said Griffin, who set the 
American record of 20.32 at the USA Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Little labeled the track at the Green Dome as fast, but ``not as  
aggressive as some tracks in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ionela Tirlea, the 1998 European 400-meter champion, ran the  
world's fastest time this year in winning her heat in the women's 
200 at 22.64. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition was punctuated by a bizarre start to the women's  
60 hurdles heats. In the first heat, the starter fired his recall 
gun shortly after the start, but it was so low that it went 
unheeded. He fired it again before the fourth hurdle, where some 
runners slowed or stopped and some continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Morrison, the U.S. champion, ran all the way and  
finished first, but it didn't count. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of minutes later, the heat was rerun and Morrison won  
again in 7.95, qualifying for the final. The fastest qualifier 
among the three heats was Kazakhstan's Olga Shishigina at 7.88.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Asked Court About Speaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When she received immunity from prosecution,  
Monica Lewinsky agreed to get permission or receive prior approval 
from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr before speaking publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the House released Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury  
testimony, her lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway 
Johnson to change the immunity agreement and let her speak without 
first getting Starr's OK, according to court documents released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the past year, Monica Lewinsky has been subjected to  
unprecedented public scrutiny and embarrassment,'' her lawyers, 
Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris, wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wishes to speak publicly about the impact of the past year  
on her, her family and friends, and her future, as virtually 
everyone else involved in her case has already done. She wishes to 
correct the terrible mischaracterizations of her by the press, 
repair her reputation and resist further reputational harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stein and Cacheris filed the papers in December, after the House  
voted to impeach President Clinton for perjury and obstruction of 
justice, and while Ms. Lewinsky was negotiating with ABC's Barbara 
Walters for a television interview. Starr gave approval for the 
interview, albeit with restrictions. Holloway has not ruled on the 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents were released in response to requests by The  
Associated Press and other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	In opposing Ms. Lewinsky's request, Starr argued that she could  
hurt the Office of Independent Counsel's ongoing investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This 'prior approval' provision serves to prevent Ms. Lewinsky  
from unwittingly (or, for that matter, intentionally) undermining 
the OIC's investigatory and prosecutorial efforts,'' Starr wrote. 
``It allows the OIC to ensure that Ms. Lewinsky does not reveal 
information which might assist witnesses in concocting false 
testimony or tampering with evidence.''

people. At a joint news conference, President Clinton expressed 
profound regret and declared, ``The United States is not trying to 
duck its responsibility.'' Clinton and D'Alema met a day after a 
military jury acquitted the pilot of the Marine jet that sliced 
through a ski gondola cable in an Italian valley and sent its 
passengers plunging to their deaths. D'Alema said he and the

their attackers for violating their civil rights. Ruling 7-4 in the 
case of a Virginia Tech student who sued two football players, the 
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called the Violence Against Women 
Act a ``sweeping intrusion'' into matters traditionally handled by

	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The 49ers took J.J. Stokes off the  
free agent market today, signing the star wide receiver to a 
seven-year deal and keeping him in San Francisco. Team officials 
said it was worth more than $3 million a year with the last two 
years voidable. Last season, Stokes had 63 catches for 770 yards 
and eight touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes To Italians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, with  
President Clinton at his side, said today he is ``personally 
shocked and so is the Italian public's opinion'' over the acquittal 
of an American pilot whose plane caused the cable car accident that 
killed 20 skiers in Italy last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At a joint news conference between the two leaders, Clinton  
assured his guest that ``the United States is not trying to duck 
its responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Americans were ``profoundly regretful and  
apologetic for what has occurred to the families and all of the 
people of Italy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But D'Alema was not reassured by Clinton's words.  
</P>
<P>
	``We shall say we are satisfied when whoever is responsible for  
what happened is found guilty and punished,'' he said. ``With so 
many casualties and so many deaths, you can hardly ever say you are 
satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Defense Secretary William Cohen would meet with his  
Italian counterpart to review operation changes designed to avert 
similar accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reiterated the United States remained determined to  
assess responsibility for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are horrified and heartbroken by what happened and we will  
do our best to make sure something like that doesn't happen 
again,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both leaders noted there was further judicial action pending and  
they gauged their comments so as to not influence it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that at the end of the process it is made clear who  
was responsible for this accident and that these people are 
punished for it,'' D'Alema said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a military jury in Camp Lejeune, N.C., cleared  
Capt. Richard Ashby of 20 involuntary manslaughter charges in the 
accident on Feb. 3, 1998. D'Alema also said the situation had 
strained U.S. relations with Italy, a NATO ally. 
</P>
<P>
	During a training flight in the Italian Alps, Ashby flew into  
two cables holding up a gondola packed with tourists who were 
preparing to ski. Eight Germans, five Belgians, one Austrian, one 
Dutch person, two Poles and three Italians perished, touching off a 
wave of criticism that the Marine crew was speeding and showing off 
in complete disregard for the civilians around them. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that kind of a massacre, with so many casualties, I think  
it is a duty to ensure ... that justice is done, and that is what 
we are asking for,'' D'Alema said Thursday. ``Certainly this is not 
an Italian problem, nor does it concern Italy and U.S. relations 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the tragedy last year, Cohen authorized a  
discretionary payment of $5,000 to each victim's family to cover 
immediate transportation and burial expenses, and the U.S. 
government has reimbursed Italy for the $60,000 it paid to the 
survivors of each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 20 victims' estates have filed wrongful death claims  
with the Italian ministry of defense, ranging from $812,000 to $5.4 
million, and all 20 families have hired attorneys, with intentions 
of filing claims to be processed by the Italian government. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said Thursday the United States will  
continue to work closely with Italian officials to ensure the 
claims are handled expeditiously.

<HEADLINE> EU Asks Meeting on Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization has summoned all 133  
member countries to an emergency meeting Monday to discuss European 
Union claims that the United States is imposing illegal sanctions 
in a trade war over bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO agreed Friday to a meeting of its general council -- the  
organization's top decision-making body -- after an EU request that 
the council discuss its complaint that the sanctions violate global 
trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members have to say something, otherwise it is a bad  
message for the future'' of the trading system, said Ambassador 
Roderick Abbott, head of the EU trade delegation in Geneva, where 
the WTO is based. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has ``taken this measure in blatant  
disregard of the provisions'' of the WTO, Abbott told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials in Geneva said they are confident they will be  
able to defend the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation EU bloc is protesting planned U.S. tariffs on $520  
million worth of European goods in retaliation for European 
barriers on banana imports. The tariffs would double the cost of 
the targeted goods -- from handbags to coffee makers and cashmere 
sweaters -- pricing them out of the American market. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the EU filed a formal WTO complaint against the  
United States. The Europeans asked the WTO to give the two sides 20 
days to try to settle their differences. If they failed, the EU 
could then ask the WTO to rule on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says American banana companies lose $520  
million annually in sales to Europe because of illegal trade 
barriers that favor bananas imported from former European colonies 
in the Caribbean and Africa. The sanctions are meant to equal the 
lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO has already ruled against the EU in the banana dispute,  
prompting Europe to modify its import rules. But the United States 
says the Europeans didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO is to rule on the EU changes, and has asked both sides  
for more information.

<HEADLINE> Last-Second Buyer Saves J. Peterman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A white knight named Paul Harris Stores  
Inc. rode to the rescue of the man in the J. Peterman duster. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming forward at the last-minute, Paul Harris paid $10 million  
for the J. Peterman Co. on Friday and said the upscale catalog 
retailer once parodied on TV's ``Seinfeld'' would remain in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid beat out a competing offer from a group that would have  
liquidated Peterman, as well as a package of piecemeal bids for the 
company's assets. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William S. Howard gave preliminary  
approval to the sale, and Peterman lawyer Greg Pavey said the two 
sides plan to complete the deal by next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Founder John Peterman had spent the last 10 days preparing to  
dismantle his upscale clothing company after failing to find a 
buyer to rescue it from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The company filed for protection from its creditors on Jan. 25,  
just over a year after launching an ambitious 70-store retail 
expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said he was pleased with the outcome.  
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly liked the people I talked to,'' Peterman said.  
``The alternative wasn't good because the company would have gone 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman said Paul Harris, an Indianapolis-based women's  
clothing company that operates 300 stores nationwide, will bring 
back all Peterman employees that have been laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers can expect to see new catalogs in their mailboxes in  
about a month, Peterman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterman started his company in 1987 by selling cowboy-style  
canvas duster coats in the back pages of The New Yorker and The 
Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is well-known for its catalog, which combines poetic  
descriptions and artistic drawings of the merchandise.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Boost Aviation Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud  
Shuster is resuming his campaign to ensure that airports get to 
keep every dollar of tax paid by users. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster, R-Pa., introduced legislation Thursday that would  
double funding for the Federal Aviation Administration over the 
next five years to $20 billion. Most important, it would require 
that all the user fee revenues that go into the Aviation Trust 
Fund, amounting to some $10 billion this year, be set aside for 
airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress now decides every year how much out of the fund will go  
to airport projects. This year, they've dedicated about $6 billion, 
with the rest going into the general budget or used to bolster the 
budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Walling the aviation fund off from the general budget, as  
Shuster succeeded in doing last year with a similar highway fund, 
could reduce the projected surplus by some $30 billion over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and Senate Commerce Committee  
Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., have rival proposals that do not 
change the status of the trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill, which cleared his committee last week, emphasizes  
steps to increase competition to smaller air markets. It would 
increase flights out of Washington's Reagan National Airport by 48 
slots, or 24 round-trip flights, a day, half going beyond the 
1,250-mile limit for flights now in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall Congress was forced to approve a stopgap six-month  
reauthorization of the FAA after failing to reach a compromise over 
increased flights from Reagan National, Chicago's O'Hare, and New 
York's La Guardia and Kennedy airports. 
</P>
<P>
	That extension expires on March 31, and the House has already  
approved another six-month bill to give the two chambers time to 
work out their considerable differences. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said that unless the trust fund is separated from the  
general budget, the fund's balance will increase from $10 billion 
now to more than $90 billion in 2009. This comes at a time, he 
said, ``when we need a 60 percent increase in aviation 
infrastructure spending just to keep delays at current unacceptable 
levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster's bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Increase the facilities and equipment program, which funds air  
traffic control equipment, from $1 billion to $3 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	--Eliminate flight ceilings at O'Hare, Kennedy and La Guardia,  
and add six slots at Reagan National for underserved airports and 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase funding for the Airport Improvement Program, which  
funds runways, taxiways and provides noise abatement, from $2 
billion to $5 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCain bill, authorizing the FAA for two years, would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Add 48 slots at Reagan National, with 24 for flights beyond the  
1,250-mile perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide 30 slot exemptions at O'Hare, with 18 for service to  
underserved communities and add flights from Kennedy and La Guardia 
for smaller airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration bill, a five-year reauthorization, would drop  
limits on the number of flights at airports in Chicago and New York 
in five years, but would not change flights or how far they can fly 
at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	It would increase an airport tax which goes to state and local  
authorities from $3 to $5 per airport and institute $1.5 billion in 
new user fees for the air traffic control system.

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Earns Australian GP Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- McLaren stars Mika Hakkinen and  
David Coulthard stunned Ferrari rival Michael Schumacher with their 
dominance in qualifying for the season-opening Australian Grand 
Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, the defending F-1 champion, claimed his 11th career  
pole with his final lap Saturday, edging Coulthard, who had gone 
ahead with his last run moments earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, relegated to third, admitted he had little chance of  
winning Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen's best lap of the 3.295-mile Albert Park course was  
131.135 mph. Coulthard, whose session was disrupted by a foray into 
a trap, had earlier gone 130.437 mph on his last lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, clearly disappointed, was 1.319 seconds off  
Hakkinen's lap pace, reaching 129.250 mph. He said his famous red 
car was running roughly compared to winter testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We struggled to get performance out of the car and I would be  
surprised if we can fix it overnight, to be honest,'' Schumacher 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari's boss Jean Todt was also downbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed. We are a long way off the performance  
level that we should have achieved and that we expected to 
achieve,'' Todt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen and Coulthard refused to discuss whether they would  
have a pre-race deal. Last year, Hakkinen was allowed to pass 
Coulthard near the finish because the two had agreed before the 
race that the leader heading into the first lap would be allowed to 
win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll tell you tomorrow, maybe,'' Hakkinen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Added Coulthard: ``Tactics should remain confidential to the  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team boss Ron Dennis made it clear this week he would do the  
same as last year despite criticism from Australian GP chief Ron 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard was upset at losing the pole and if a similar deal is  
struck Hakkinen is better placed to take advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I could have gone a bit quicker but I just ran out of  
time,'' Coulthard said. ``It's an advantage to have the pole, 
especially in a team because you get a few meters ahead for the 
first corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's teammate, Eddie Irvine, lagged in sixth, an  
improvement on four poor practice rounds, while Rubens Barrichello 
gave Stewart-Ford a boost with his fourth and Jordan's Heinz-Harald 
Frentzen was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very good day at the office,'' Barrichello said. ``I  
think they have done a superb job with the car and I hope this is 
the car where maybe I can really show what I am able to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former champion Jacques Villeneuve, having his first race with  
the new British American Racing team, was 11th while his former 
team, Williams, struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralf Schumacher placed eighth for Williams but former IndyCar  
champ Alex Zanardi was back in 15th in his return to F-1.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Makes Run at Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAEBASHI, Japan (AP) -- An ad in the program for the World Indoor  
Championships depicts Haile Gebrselassie with the words, ``What do 
you buy the man who has everything?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer: ``A trophy case with reinforced shelves.''  
</P>
<P>
	At the rate Gebrselassie is going, he'll need those extra  
shelves shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie, winner of three world outdoor titles and one  
Olympic gold medal at 10,000 meters, plus last year's Golden League 
jackpot and the IAAF's Male Athlete of the Year Award, captured his 
second world indoor 3,000-meter title Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he will go after the 1,500. If he completes the  
double, it would be an unprecedented feat at the championships, 
which began in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he was looking ahead to the 1,500, including Saturday's  
semifinals, the wispy Ethiopian ran a conservative race in the 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 1,500 is more important to me than the 3,000,''  
Gebrselassie said. ``I've never won a 1,500 (title) before. I will 
test myself. This will be a check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no real test in the 3,000. No one pushed the pace and  
Gebrselassie was able to stay within striking range before charging 
to the front with just over 400 meters remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, he raced to the finish without a challenge. His time  
of 7 minutes, 53.57 seconds was more than 27 seconds off his 
career-best of 7:26.15, more than 18 seconds slower than his 
winning time of 7:34.71 in 1997 and nearly 30 seconds slower than 
the world mark of 7:24.90 by Kenya's Daniel Komen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 3,000 was not very hard for me,'' Gebrselassie said. ``I  
had to run hard only the last 600 meters. The other competitors 
were not that strong. I did not try to run fast because I wanted to 
save my power for Saturday. Then, the competition will be harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Paul Bitok, the runner-up at 7:53.79, and Ethiopia's  
Million Wolde, the third-place finisher at 7:53.85, said it is 
frustrating trying to catch Gebrselassie, whether he's running slow 
or fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to challenge him today,'' Bitok said. ``With  
Gebrselassie, you never know when he's going to push hard. I 
thought today was going to be my race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Wolde's first experience chasing Gebrselassie, although  
he has been in several races with him, but only as a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Previously, all Ethiopian runners were inspired to be  
marathoners by the great exploits of our countrymen, especially 
Abebe Bikila,'' Wolde said, referring to the 1960 and 1964 Olympic 
gold medalist. ``However, I and many of my generation follow in the 
footsteps of Haile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope one day to follow Haile's golden footsteps and I have  
him as a close inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides trying to conserve energy for the 1,500, Gebrselassie  
said the time was slow in the 3,000 because of the 13-man field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tight, with many athletes around,'' he said, after  
getting jostled early. ``It was difficult to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,500 field will be smaller, more to Gebrselassie's liking.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never run the 1,500 before in a championship meet,'' said  
Gebrselassie, who has the second-fastest time ever outdoors, 
3:31.76, and has run 3:34.78 this season indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	And hardly ever had he run in front of such a small crowd. Much  
of the early announced crowd of 8,100 left after the departure of 
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, following the opening 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gebrselassie ran, the stands were practically empty.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a problem,'' he said. ``I don't have any fans here.  
But I don't know why there weren't any in the stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who left missed seeing one of the greatest distance  
runners in history, even if it wasn't his best race.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment edged up slightly to 4.4 percent  
in February as factories cut jobs to cope with the global financial 
crisis. But outside of manufacturing, job growth remained robust 
even as wage pressures lessened -- a combination that sparked huge 
rallies on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices soared 268 points to close at a new record high.  
The bond market, which had been gripped by fears of imminent 
interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, posted big gains as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good economy just keeps getting better,'' said Allen  
Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in New York. 
``We have tremendous job creation in the United States with a tight 
labor market but no inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 275,000 jobs were created last month as mild winter  
weather in much of the nation spurred a hiring boost of 72,000 
workers in the construction industry, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail establishments from restaurants to department stores also  
expanded employment by a strong 123,000, the biggest one-month gain 
in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But factories shed 50,000 jobs, bringing total manufacturing job  
losses over the past year to 337,000. Hardest hit last month were 
plants making clothing with a job loss of 15,000, the aircraft 
industry, which cut 6,000 jobs, and industrial machinery plants, 
which lost 7,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton hailed the strong overall job gains and said  
part of his discussions with visiting Italian Prime Minister 
Massimo D'Alema were devoted to exploring ways that wealthy 
industrial countries can help nations leveled by the global 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States cannot grow over the long run unless  
prosperity is increasing for our friends,'' Clinton said during a 
joint news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	While the widespread economic hard times have meant falling  
exports and increased import competition for many American 
manufacturers, strong job gains in service industries have kept the 
overall economy humming. 
</P>
<P>
	That has given the country 20 straight months with unemployment  
below 5 percent, a feat last accomplished in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last April, the unemployment rate has remained in a narrow  
range between 4.3 percent, where it dipped in December and January, 
and 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan worried anew last week  
about how long such low unemployment can last without increasing 
inflationary wage pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday's report showed those pressures actually decreased  
last month. Average hourly wages went up just a penny in February 
and, compared with 12 months earlier, were up only 3.6 percent, the 
smallest increase in nearly two years and down from a 4 percent 
year-over-year rise in wages in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderation in wages calmed inflation jitters on Wall Street.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the stock leap, a strong bond market rally helped  
push down yields on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond to 5.60 
percent compared to 5.69 percent on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investor euphoria -- based on the belief that the Fed will  
not raise interest rates soon -- occurred even though a separate 
report showed that consumer demand remained exceptionally strong at 
the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve reported that consumer credit swelled by  
$14.7 billion in January, the biggest monthly gain in more than 
three years, as consumers borrowed heavily to finance auto 
purchases and take on credit card debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The good economy is seen as a major reason that Clinton's  
approval ratings remained strong throughout his impeachment 
travails. 
</P>
<P>
	For February, unemployment among blacks was 8.3 percent and for  
Hispanics the rate was 6.7 percent, up only slightly from January's 
all-time lows of 7.8 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have speculated that one factor that has allowed  
unemployment to stay at such low levels without triggering higher 
inflation is that productivity gains -- the output per hour of work 
-- are much stronger than the government's statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Productivity has got to be better than the official numbers. I  
don't see any other explanation for the combination of strong job 
growth and low inflation,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at 
Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Europe, US Trade Dispute Rages On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- If bananas seem a little unlikely as a subject for  
a major international trade dispute, seasoned trade diplomats have 
been through much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	In its four-year history, the World Trade Organization has  
looked at enough foodstuffs to put anyone off their dinner, 
including nectarines, walnuts, tomatoes, beef, processed cheese, 
rice, salmon and shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not just about food. A glance through the alphabetical  
listing of disputes beyond bananas brings up brooms, buses, butter, 
cattle, cement, coated woodfree paper sheets, coconuts, computers, 
copyright and corn syrup. 
</P>
<P>
	At the WTO, trusted by 134 countries to solve their  
international trading disputes, even a minor item can become a 
multimillion-dollar problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and European Union are battling in the WTO  
over EU controls on banana imports, which Washington complains are 
squeezing out U.S. growers. In retaliation, Washington put into 
effect Wednesday hefty tariffs on millions of dollars of European 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	For those involved, bananas are a serious issue which goes not  
only to the heart of European import policies but also to the heart 
of the WTO itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But a case for seriousness was rather thwarted by the American  
trade ambassador, Rita Hayes, who told reporters that the EU was 
suffering from ``a case of sour grapes over bananas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other issues that have been the subject of WTO discussions  
are the matter of United States quotas on the importation of 
underwear from Costa Rica and a complaint by Washington about the 
lack of openings for overseas companies to produce commercial 
telephone directories in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	If the item is large enough, a trade dispute can center on a  
single object. The European Union complained to the WTO about the 
procedures used by Japan in its purchase of a navigational 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the WTO may only just have celebrated its fourth  
birthday, trade disputes are nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1880, fueled by the fear of cheap imports, German Chancellor  
Otto von Bismarck banned American pork from his country. 
</P>
<P>
	His justification was the increasing number of trichina worms  
being found in hog's meat from Cincinnati and the danger to the 
population from disease. The dispute lasted 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a century later, the European Union banned imports of  
hormone-treated beef from countries including the United States and 
Canada, claiming there was a cancer risk. That dispute, which comes 
to a head in May, could well be the next banana battle.

<HEADLINE> Pro Soccer Returns to Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Professional soccer returned to  
Argentina with the end of a three-week shutdown that stemmed from 
fan violence surrounding the country's national sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's first-division players went on strike Feb. 9 in  
solidarity with players in the lower divisions. An appeals court 
ruled Wednesday the lower leagues could resume play, prompting the 
return of the first division players. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower leagues took the job action because of the fan  
violence sweeping the country. Wednesday's ruling allows the summer 
league play to begin and comes amid a new round of soccer violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Club- and knife-wielding hooligans attacked rival fans last  
Wednesday as Boca Juniors played second-division Chacarita, leaving 
four people injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of absurd violence cannot be tolerated whatsoever,''  
said Interior Minister Carlos Corach, exhorting the courts to bring 
the full weight of the law to bear on violent fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Local news reports said at least four people have been arrested  
in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of violence, fans were jubilant at the prospect of  
returning to the stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``Soccer belongs to the people and they just can't take it  
away,'' said Marcela Nogueira, a 23-year-old teacher and fan of 
River Plate. ``When the ball moves, so do we. Without football ... 
all of us were very sad.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets with Italy's D'Alema </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton sought to smooth over  
relations with Italy today after shock and outrage over the 
acquittal of a U.S. Marine pilot in the cable car accident that 
killed 20 skiers in Italy a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton met in the Oval Office with Italian Prime Minister  
Massimo D'Alema a day after the verdict. The two leaders posed 
stiffly for photographers and did not comment. The meeting had been 
set up long ago, and it was mere coincidence that it came on the 
heels of the acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it is a testament to the strength of our  
relationship that we've been able to work through these very 
difficult and tragic circumstances in an open and honest and 
straightforward way,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly understand their strong feelings,'' Lockhart  
said. But he said he was limited in commenting further because of 
issues still to be litigated. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alema said Thursday he was ``really baffled'' that a military  
jury in Camp Lejeune, N.C., cleared Capt. Richard Ashby of 20 
involuntary manslaughter charges in the accident on Feb. 3, 1998. 
D'Alema also said the situation had strained U.S. relations with 
Italy, a NATO ally. 
</P>
<P>
	During a training flight in the Italian Alps, Ashby flew into  
two cables holding up a gondola packed with tourists who were 
preparing to ski. Eight Germans, five Belgians, one Austrian, one 
Dutch person, two Poles and three Italians perished, touching off a 
wave of criticism that the Marine crew was speeding and showing off 
in complete disregard for the civilians around them. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that kind of a massacre, with so many casualties, I think  
it is a duty to ensure ... that justice is done, and that is what 
we are asking for,'' D'Alema said. ``Certainly this is not an 
Italian problem, nor does it concern Italy and U.S. relations 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton declared, ``My regret is profound,'' as he discussed the  
incident last May in a meeting with D'Alema's predecessor, Romano 
Prodi. Clinton promised the United States would ``behave in a 
completely honorable way'' in responding to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that the subject comes up again, he will again  
repeat that,'' Lockhart said Thursday. ``It is a testament to the 
strength of our relations, of U.S.-Italian relations, that this 
hasn't soured the relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the tragedy last year, Defense Secretary William  
Cohen authorized a discretionary payment of $5,000 to each victim's 
family to cover immediate transportation and burial expenses, and 
the U.S. government has reimbursed Italy for the $60,000 it paid to 
the survivors of each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 20 victims' estates have filed wrongful death claims  
with the Italian ministry of defense, ranging from $812,000 to $5.4 
million, and all 20 families have hired attorneys, with intentions 
of filing claims to be processed by the Italian government. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department said Thursday the United States will  
continue to work closely with Italian officials to ensure the 
claims are handled expeditiously.
