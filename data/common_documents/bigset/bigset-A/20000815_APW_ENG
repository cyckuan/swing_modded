<HEADLINE> Officials hope flooded northwestern N.J. gets no more rain  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKETTSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - Cathy Derechailo of the Red Cross is
watching the sky and rooting against the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are predictions of heavy rain Wednesday into Thursday,''
Derechailo said. ''We could be out there again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross official was speaking about northwestern New
Jersey, which was hit by drenching rains Monday for the second time
in three days. The downpours strained more dams to the breaking
point and forced hundreds of additional evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she would ask the Clinton
administration to declare Morris and Sussex counties disaster
areas. She put both counties under a state of emergency, allowing
the state to order evacuations and activate New Jersey National
Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Warren County were also inundated.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries have been reported since Saturday's
downpour, whose torrents damaged dozens of homes, devoured Newton's
water supply system, and claimed bridges, roads and dams.
</P>
<P>
   The cost will surpass $100 million, Whitman spokesman Peter
McDonough said. Estimates were not complete Monday, since some
areas were still under water and could not be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Mount Holly said Monday night
the forecast calls for the possibility of rain Tuesday night into
Wednesday and then on Friday for that part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers were grateful that an additional downpour
Monday night did not add to the problem because it only lasted
about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had continued it probably would have given us some
problems,'' said Eskil ''Skip'' Danielson, the Sussex County
emergency coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Byram police Sgt. Raymond Rafferty said the hour-long downpour
seemed to have little effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't add to our mess,'' Rafferty said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sussex County, an additional 100 homes were evacuated Monday
in Sparta along with 150 homes in Byram. Some residents in
Ogdensburg were also urged to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Danielson said Monday night there were still serious water
problems in Byram and Stanhope and that damage assessment would
continue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got so much work to do,'' Danielson said.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people were evacuated in Hackettstown Monday amid
concern that upstream dams could burst, according to Gary Wassel,
deputy coordinator of emergency management in Warren County.
</P>
<P>
   Derechailo said the Hackettstown residents were back in their
homes Monday night after being sheltered at Hackettstown High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they get the word they can go back, they run out of
there,'' she said. ''It's not the Ritz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Musconetcong River, which flows out of Sussex County and
borders Morris and Warren counties, rose a foot an hour Monday
before cresting in mid-afternoon, said Derechailo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The river is expected to maintain its crest peak for two to
three days. So this is far from over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The high school was reopened for shelter Monday, after the Red
Cross closed all six shelters that had opened Saturday afternoon
amid the downpour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state is investigating claims that 14 inches of
rain fell Saturday in Sparta when a storm system stalled over the
hilly region.
</P>
<P>
   A better estimate is 8 to 10 inches, said David Robinson, state
climatologist at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ''That 14 inches is probably high and we've traced that back to
the gauge that gave us that figure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Jefferson Township were able to begin cleanup efforts
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mlynarz sprayed mud off boat parts in a soggy, muddy back
yard. Several inches of water still stood in the yard along Lake
Hopatcong. On Saturday, rushing waters claimed his dock and garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have a mess to clean up. I don't have any major
damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those evacuated Monday were 900 children at the Jefferson
Lake day camp in Byram, due to worries about the integrity of a
nearby dam.
</P>
<P>
   A freight line running parallel to Route 517 in Sussex County,
the New York Susquehanna &AMP; Western Railway, was closed at 1 a.m.
Monday because its bed was undermined, State Police spokesman John
Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit said there would be no bus or rail service out of
Hackettstown Tuesday morning because of the flooding. A spokeswoman
said commuters should go to the Netcong stop for the train.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing water destroyed the mains in Newton, so residents were
advised to boil water for drinking and cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Three bridges and parts of three roads were swept away in
Sparta, where Main Street residents were evacuated Sunday because
fire officials feared a mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, gawkers flocked to the area to take pictures, where a
road was covered by a swift-running brown river.
</P>
<P>
   The dam on Seneca Lake in Sparta burst over the weekend,
emptying it and leaving a 25-acre patch of mud.
</P>
<P>
   Other dams that have failed include those at Hawthorne Lake in
Sparta, Shawnee Lake in Jefferson, and Lake Tomahawk in Byram,
state officials said. In Stanhope, two sides of the small dam on
Furnace Pond washed away Sunday and the surge broke through the
windows of a nearby paper factory.
</P>
<P>
   Under watch were dams at Saginaw Lake in Ogdensburg, and Sunset
Lake in Sparta, Hagerty said.

Clinton Addresses Democratic Party
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Going before the Democratic Convention, President Clinton
on Monday night urged voters to elect Vice President Al Gore as his successor
and to send first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to the U.S. Senate from New York.
He told Democrats that he has delivered on the promise of 1992, saying, ''I ran
for president to change the future, for those left behind in America.'' He
recalled: ''I made one of the best decisions of my life: asking Al Gore to be my
partner.''

Monday night ''for your faith and support in good times -- and in bad.'' She
made a prime-time address to the Democratic National Convention just before
President Clinton offered his political farewell to the party faithful. Mrs.
Clinton hailed his administration and called for voters to elect Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman to carry on that work.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A festive protest concert outside the Democratic National
Convention turned violent Monday night as demonstrators began throwing chunks of
concrete and firing steel balls from slingshots at police who responded with
pepper-spray balls, rubber bullets and finally a charge on horseback. Police
herded the demonstrators to the far end of a designated protest area, pushing
them away from the convention hall. The confrontation originally involved about
300 people out of the crowd of 8,000 but then spread. Nine people were arrested
in an earlier clash.

Russians Trying To Rescue Sub
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy is trying to find a way to rescue more than
100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a crippled submarine. By
early Tuesday, about a dozen military ships including a nuclear-powered cruiser
were at the site, Russian reports said. The chance of a happy ending was ''not
very high,'' the navy chief conceded. The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear
submarines, was apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of
feet near the Arctic Circle.

Korea arrived in South Korea Tuesday for temporary reunions with relatives they
have not seen for half a century. A passenger jet of Air Koryo, North Korea's
national airline, ferried the aging family members from Pyongyang on a 50-minute
flight to Seoul's Kimpo airport and prepared to pick up 100 South Koreans for
similar exchanges in the North.

<HEADLINE> Titans 30, Rams 3  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams should be grateful
their championship rings weren't on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McNair threw for a touchdown, backup Neil O'Donnell tossed
two more and the defense got five sacks as the Tennessee Titans
routed the Rams 30-3 Monday night in a preseason rematch of the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Georgia Dome in January, but the atmosphere felt
like much more than just an exhibition. Navy SEALS jumped into
Adelphia Coliseum before kickoff, and tickets were being scalped
outside the sold-out stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams (1-1) helped excite the crowd with their college
impersonation as they jumped on the Titans' flameball logo at
midfield before the introductions.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the most life the Super Bowl champs showed all
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans (2-0) played keepaway the entire first quarter,
allowing St. Louis just one series where the Rams went
three-and-out. Eddie George had a night's worth of work as he
carried 15 times for 69 yards in two series that lasted 12 and 13
plays each.
</P>
<P>
   McNair looked almost as sharp early. He completed six straight
passes at one point to five different receivers, including a 5-yard
TD toss to Frank Wycheck. But he had trouble connecting with
Wycheck, his favorite target the past four seasons, in the second
quarter and finished 10-of-18 for 74 yards.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, who led the NFL in scoring last season, never got
going. The Titans helped, but the Rams stopped themselves with five
turnovers, dropped passes and seven penalties. The problems started
on the first play when Kurt Warner was sacked, and he missed
Az-Zahir Hakim on his only pass attempt as he played one series.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Green didn't fare much better as the Titans played their
first-team defense the entire first half. St. Louis coach Mike
Martz tried to protect Green and his surgically repaired knee by
keeping his first-team offensive line in front of him, but Green
tripped coming away from the center once and was sacked twice.
</P>
<P>
   Green played the first series of the third quarter protected by
the first-teamers for all the good it did. He was sacked by Titans
cornerback Ty Howard at the St. Louis 1 and left the game after
that. He connected on 5 of 12 passes for 68 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Germaine's debut was even worse. Justin Watson fumbled the
ball away on his first play.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, who came up 36 inches short of the tying touchdown
in losing the Vince Lombardi Trophy, didn't pass up the chance to
pour it on the Rams. Tennessee led 13-3 when O'Donnell came into
the game in the third quarter, and he needed only three plays
before finding a wide-open Erron Kinney in the end zone for a
25-yard TD.
</P>
<P>
   He later added a 24-yard TD toss to Chris Sanders with 11:20
left in the fourth quarter, and Al Del Greco added field goals of
35, 42 and 25 yards.

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks To Rescue Downed Sub  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more
than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a
submarine crippled by a major collision. The chance of a happy
ending, the navy chief conceded, was ''not very high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear submarines, was
apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of
feet to the sea floor near the Arctic Circle on Sunday, naval
commander Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov said. It had been taking part
in naval exercises off the country's north coast.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the vessel was carrying no nuclear
weapons and its nuclear reactors had been switched off, but the
reports of serious damage raised concerns about a possible
radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western submarines sometimes play cat-and-mouse
games in the area and have scraped each other in the past,
according to reports. But the Pentagon said Monday no U.S. ship or
submarine was involved in the collision.
</P>
<P>
   The ITAR-Tass news agency said an initial outside inspection of
the Kursk by a deep-water apparatus did not support Kuroyedov's
version of a crash. The agency cited an expert involved in the
operation as saying the submarine could have been damaged by a
blast in its bow which caused the torpedo section to fill with
water.
</P>
<P>
   By early Tuesday, about a dozen military ships including a
nuclear-powered cruiser were at the site of the accident, Russian
reports said. A team of ship designers was rushed to the area to
help suggest ways to rescue the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the efforts being taken, the probability of a
successful outcome from the situation with the Kursk is not very
high,'' the navy chief said.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the crew was unknown and the navy did not
release an official count. Russian news reports said it carried 117
to 130 servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The navy said at first that it was in radio contact with the
submarine, but later admitted that there was only ''acoustic
contact'' that could be the noise of crewmen pounding on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how long the Kursk could remain
submerged before it ran out of air for the crew. Nuclear submarines
depend on their reactors to replenish their air supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk went down far above the Arctic Circle, but the sea was
free of icebergs, said meteorological officials in nearby Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to say how far down the vessel was
trapped, but a Norwegian report said the Kursk was some 450 feet
down, a depth at which rescue would be difficult because of the
crushing water pressure. Various Russian reports said the submarine
was 330 to 510 feet down.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the administration
''made clear to the Russians that any assistance we can offer is
available.'' He said there had been no request for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, another Clinton administration official said two
U.S. Navy submarines were operating in the area at the time of the
accident, and one reported having heard an explosion at the site
Saturday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, is
familiar with U.S. intelligence reports on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the explosion occurred on Saturday, possibly
conflicting with Russian reports that accident happened on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the Oscar-class submarine was
not carrying nuclear weapons. The Kursk is designed to carry 24
nuclear armed cruise missiles designed to knock out large surface
vessels such as aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But some Western military analysts were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, all submarines go to sea equipped for war. I would
be surprised if they had gone to sea without something,'' said Paul
Beaver, a British analyst.
</P>
<P>
   There was also concern about a possible radiation leak from the
vessel's two nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem with the nuclear propulsion system is that if the
submarine has damaged itself while it was running aground, then
you've got a reasonable chance that there will be some sort of
radioactive leakage,'' said Lionel Trippett of the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, which has a scientific vessel in the region, detected no
sign of a radiation leak, said Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Karsten Klepsvik.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Gundarov, a submarine specialist at Red Star, the
official daily newspaper of the Russian military, said rescuing
people from a submarine is very difficult and there is no set
procedure. The Russian navy does not have advanced submarine rescue
vessels, according to standard naval reference works.
</P>
<P>
   The crew may be able to use on-board capsules to escape, but in
the worst case would have to swim out through the torpedo tubes,
which would be very dangerous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1983 Soviet submarine accident, the crew perished when
trying to escape from a depth of 180 feet, according to the
Norwegian environmental group Bellona, which closely monitors
Russia's northern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, launched in 1995, weighs some 14,000 tons, according
to Jane's Fighting Ships, an authoritative guide to warships.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of
accidents in recent decades. The navy, like the rest of the Russian
military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no
maintenance on its ships.
</P>
<P>
   In the last major accident involving one of Moscow's nuclear
submarines, the Komsomolets sank in April 1989 after catching fire
200 miles north of Norway. Forty-two of the 69 Soviet sailors
aboard died in the accident and the wrecked hull with its reactor
still lies on the sea bottom.

<HEADLINE> A TV Finale for a Video Presidency  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A familiar-looking man strode purposefully along
a backstage corridor, alone -- except, of course, for the camera
that tracked him.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's smiling, loaded-for-bear visage was splashed
across the huge video screen at the Democratic National Convention
in Los Angeles -- and broadcast to homes across the nation -- as
cheering rose at the Staples Center arena.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting more than a minute before he emerged at the podium,
Clinton's long, long walk served as quite a buildup. It was a
galvanizing TV interlude. And very much his style.
</P>
<P>
   The speech he then delivered, which was carried in its entirety
by the big three broadcast networks, the all-news cable networks,
plus PBS and C-SPAN, had been described as Clinton's valedictory
address.
</P>
<P>
   As a passing of the torch to his vice president, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Even as possibly stealing the thunder from Gore, the party's
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's star turn Monday night was something else: a big
TV finish for a video presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, CBS anchor Dan Rather called his farewell ''a slo-mo
Hollywood fade-out.''
</P>
<P>
   On MSNBC, commentator Chris Matthews said ''Clinton's job
tonight is to leave. Nicely, effectively, but to leave,'' while on
Fox News Channel, Bill Kristol argued, ''I'm not sure that can
happen. This is Bill Clinton's convention.''
</P>
<P>
   But CNN's Jeff Greenfield had no doubt that, before his retreat,
Clinton would deliver the goods at the podium. ''If you know
someone who's spent eight years waiting for Bill Clinton to
self-destruct, send them a bottle of Maalox. They'll need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has defied his opponents' expectations many times in the
past, and often television was involved.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first term in 1992 in part by his masterful use of
TV, whether it was sparring with talk-show host Phil Donahue or
playing the saxophone on ''Arsenio Hall'' or rescuing his candidacy
with an interview on ''60 Minutes'' with wife Hillary Rodham
Clinton at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be remembered for many things. But his nearly eight
years in the White House were marked by a succession of vivid TV
moments. (Don't forget his MTV-aired disclosure on the
boxers-or-briefs issue.)
</P>
<P>
   Some, of course, were moments he would rather have avoided, yet
he nearly always made the most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the summer's hottest telecast was his
presidential mea culpa, four minutes of it, during which he
cautioned that any marital dalliance was a matter ''between me, the
two people I love most -- my wife and our daughter -- and our God.''
He drew an estimated 68 million viewers and, by most assessments,
satisfied his audience.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, Clinton was on TV screens with another
message of contrition: ''Surely no fair-minded person would blame
him (Gore) for any mistake that I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the convention, he was shrewdly pre-emptive. ''Whatever
you think about me ...,'' he said as he built to his speech's grand
conclusion. After Monday night, this TV president left no doubt:
The success of the prospective Al Gore Show could depend on
Clinton's persuasiveness.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a pre-dawn strike Monday, Colombian
soldiers rescued another kidnapping victim held by leftist rebels
south of the capital Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were chasing kidnappers who escaped Sunday with two
hostages after a raid that freed five people, including a prominent
Colombian journalist-businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers tracked the retreating rebels from the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, during the night and rescued
Colombian Edgar Andres Vargas early Monday, army Gen. Jorge Mora
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had excellent intelligence information before we mounted
any rescues,'' Mora said. ''That intelligence made the second
rescue effort easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for those holding the remaining hostage was
continuing, Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Cortes, 73, former owner of a Bogota soccer team and
part owner of a popular TV news show as well as several magazines,
was kidnapped from his weekend home outside Bogota on Jan. 22 by
FARC guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had demanded $1 million for his release. According to
the government, FARC is responsible for about 30 percent of the
8,000 annual kidnappings in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-kidnapping squad rescued the five hostages Sunday from
a guerrilla camp in the mountains between the towns of Medina and
Los Alpes, about 55 miles south of Bogota, Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A group of soldiers successfully surrounded those guarding the
victims without them realizing it,'' Mora said of the Sunday
mission. One kidnapper was killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth hostage was rescued Monday near the same area, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those released Sunday was German Rolf Sommerfeld, 57, an
engineer who has lived in Colombia for 12 years. He was kidnapped
last August when he was pulled from his car by masked FARC
guerrillas on a crowded Bogota street.
</P>
<P>
   Also rescued were Colombians Alejandro Londono and Ricardo
Ramirez and an Austrian-Colombian dual citizen, Jaime Correal.
</P>
<P>
   The isolated rugged region is so dominated by the FARC that any
army movements in the area are usually reported to rebels by local
residents, giving the rebels time to move hostages between several
makeshift camps, Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   Sommerfeld gave his rescuers high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all very professional,'' Sommerfeld said on Bogota's
Caracol Radio. ''We were in bed waiting for (the rebels) to bring
us breakfast, but it never came. The solders arrived instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebel activity has escalated apparently in the run-up to
President Clinton's planned visit to Colombia on Aug. 30. A car
bomb exploded outside a police station in Bogota on Sunday,
injuring a civilian. And on Monday, police said they had defused
explosives from a sedan in an upscale north Bogota neighborhood.

<HEADLINE> N. Koreans Visit Families in South  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Smiling and waving, a group of 100
separated family members from North Korea arrived in South Korea on
Tuesday for temporary reunions with relatives they have not seen
for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian-made passenger jet of Air Koryo, North Korea's
national airline, ferried the aging family members from Pyongyang
on a 50-minute flight to Seoul's Kimpo airport. It then picked up
100 South Koreans and took off for similar exchanges in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators clapped as the North Koreans, mostly men in dark
suits wearing pins with the image of their revered late leader, Kim
Il Sung, walked through airport customs and boarded buses bound for
a Seoul hotel. The visitors included an 84-year-old woman in a
traditional Korean gown with a cane who came to meet her elder
sister and a niece.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very happy,'' said the woman, Hwang Ui Bun, who grinned
with delight.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions are one of the most emotional issues that have
defined the longrunning standoff between the two Koreas, which were
once devoted to each other's downfall but have made great strides
toward reconciliation in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the North Korean delegation, 78-year-old Yoo Mi
Young, told reporters that she was very happy and that the reunions
this week were not an isolated event and more would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only the beginning,'' said Yoo, who defected to North
Korea from the South in 1986 along with her husband, former South
Korean Foreign Minister Choi Duk Shin. He died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 North Korean family members were accompanied by 31
officials and 20 journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Rapprochement between the communist North and the democratic
South accelerated after their leaders held a summit in June and
pledged to work toward eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   That goal remains distant and complex, but events like the
family reunions -- the first since 1985 -- are likely to help
dissipate some of the animosity that has flourished since the
1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   While this week's reunions constitute a political gesture of
good will between governments, they are a source of private joy,
discovery and pain for those involved.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jung-ho, a 91-year-old South Korean, said he expected to
meet a 60-year-old son when he arrives in Pyongyang, the North
Korean capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who bought watches and gold rings as gifts for his
relatives in the North, last saw his son when he fled alone to
South Korea in 1951 during the chaos of war.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing I want to ask him is: What happened to the
other family members? Then I would ask how he endured through all
those difficult years,'' Kim said before heading to the airport for
the flight to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day reunions began on Aug. 15, a national holiday in
both Koreas that is the anniversary of the peninsula's liberation
from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast live on national television, South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung vowed to work to end the threat of war
between the Koreas and pursue economic and other exchanges ahead of
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ''Attempts at unification by force of arms and unification by
absorption taking advantage of economic superiority will only lead
to war and destruction,'' Kim told an audience of independence
fighters, political leaders and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, which has one of the largest economies in the
world, is far wealthier than North Korea, where poor centralized
planning, heavy military spending and bad weather have undercut the
economy and forced Pyongyang to appeal for outside food aid.
</P>
<P>
   The family members who arrived from Pyongyang were scheduled to
meet their South Korean relatives at a Seoul conference center
Tuesday afternoon. Their schedule includes private meetings in
hotel rooms, banquets and city tours.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean visitors to the North had a similar schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Yo in-yul, an 81-year-old South Korean, fled North Korea in 1951
with his parents, leaving behind a 9-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
   Yo expected to see his sister, Yo Jung-suk, on arrival in
Pyongyang Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart is aching whenever I recall the moment of separation.
She held me by the hand and cried, begging me to take her along,''
Yo said.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions are a pressing issue because many aging family
members have only a few years left to see relatives. Many people
have died without making contact with relatives. There is no mail,
telephone or other direct means of communication between private
citizens in the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rapprochement, uneasiness lingers in the South over
apparent political use of the event by the North.
</P>
<P>
   While South Korea chose its 100 finalists for the reunions
through a computer lottery, the North Korean list includes a
renowned poet, a painter, a film maker, a scientist and other
celebrated people. And all the Northern visitors are natives of
South Korea who defected to the North.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean critics said loyalty to the communist system
appeared to be the most important criterion for getting on the
North's list.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Addresses Democratic Party  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In an emotional last hurrah to the party
faithful, Bill Clinton thanked the nation for giving him ''the
chance to live my dreams.'' In return, the first two-term
Democratic president in a half century said he tried to better
Americans' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, with hair grayer and wrinkles deeper, but with the same
optimism and hope I brought to the work I so love eight years ago,
I want you to know my heart is filled with gratitude,'' he said in
his political finale to the Democratic National Convention on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The hall was filled to the rafters with Democrats who cheered
wildly before and after Clinton's 41-minute speech. They shouted
''Thank you! Thank you!'' and waved placards that read ''America,
better than ever!''
</P>
<P>
   Mixing nostalgia with partisan applause lines, Clinton said he
had delivered on the promise of 1992, saying, ''I ran for president
to change the future,'' for those left behind in America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended his speech with the words ''I love you.'' With a
wave, the president left the stage with his wife Hillary Rodham
Clinton and daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked voters to help elect his understudy Al Gore as his
successor, to send his wife to the Senate and -- for the sake of his
own legacy -- to refute the charge of Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush that America, blessed with prosperity, had
coasted during the Clinton years. He didn't mention Bush by name.
</P>
<P>
   America gave him the chance to turn his ideals into action,
Clinton said, ''after I made one of the very best decisions of my
life: asking Al Gore to be my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeated several refrains about how much better off
Americans are at the end of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are more hopeful,'' he said four times, because of tax
cuts, education reforms, new job creation and welfare reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are more secure,'' he said three times, because of less
crime, better health care and a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are more free,'' he said twice, because of less bigotry and
less discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, he said: ''My fellow Americans, the future of our
country is in your hands. You must think hard, feel deeply, and
choose wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, keep putting people first. Keep building those
bridges. And don't stop thinking about tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans responded even before Clinton had left the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This speech was about Bill Clinton trying to write his own
legacy, not about Al Gore's future,'' said Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer. ''Instead of passing the baton to Al Gore, Bill Clinton
used it to beat his own drum. The vice president remains in Bill
Clinton's shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Who leads America next, Clinton said, is the American people's
and not his. But he said all he could to influence it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity going by
paying down the debt, investing in education and health care, and
in family tax cuts that we can afford,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In stark contrast, the GOP wants to spend every dime of our
projected surplus and then some -- leaving nothing to extend the
life of Medicare and Social Security, nothing for emergencies,
nothing in case the projected surpluses don't come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was only the third president in modern history to make
his farewells to a party after having served two full terms. The
others were both Republicans -- Dwight D. Eisenhower, who succeeded
Truman in 1953, and Ronald Reagan, who ousted Democrat Jimmy Carter
and took office in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended his first convention in 1972, not a good year
for Democrats. He spoke at the 1988 gathering, in a speech so
ponderously long that he still gets ribbed about it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech was the main event of the convention's opening
night. On Tuesday, he will meet up with Gore on the campaign trail
in Michigan for a symbolic passing of the party torch.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who watched the speech from Missouri, praised Clinton's
speech as a ''very strong case'' for the record of the Clinton-Gore
years and looked ahead to the hand-off in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a symbolic message that's more important than most of the
words we'll be using,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-an-era theme was underscored by a tribute video
similar to the ''Man From Hope'' biography that introduced Clinton
to millions of voters at the 1992 convention.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton was aware of the risk of over-playing his
moment before the delegates. He knows ''it's his moment to get off
the stage and let someone else get on the stage and do the job,''
White House chief of staff John Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his leave, Clinton also hoped to energize Democrats with
some partisan fire.
</P>
<P>
   But he hoped that his farewell address, like President Reagan's
in 1988, would be remembered for its softer, more evocative
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a student of American history, is mindful of the
historical shift in political conventions -- away from the drama of
nomination fights and toward the gauzy world of first impressions.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Honor Ex-President Carter  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jimmy Carter hadn't planned to attend the
Democratic National Convention, even though his presidential status
made him an automatic delegate and Al Gore pressed him to make a
speech.
</P>
<P>
   But then the vice president came back with a more appealing
offer -- a video tribute Monday night to the only surviving former
Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to worry about details of a speech,'' he said in
an interview with The Associated Press. ''Now I can enjoy the
convention with my children and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter mingled among the Georgia delegates on the convention
floor ''with my friends'' before he and his wife, Rosalynn, slipped
unannounced into a VIP section prior to his tribute.
</P>
<P>
   California Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced Carter to the crowd,
who reciprocated with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-minute video showcased Carter's accomplishments as
president and peacemaker. The audience cheered throughout several
spots, particularly during the footage of the signing ceremony for
the Camp David peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to be associated with my name, maybe the words
peace and human rights. That would be my preference,'' Carter said
at the conclusion of the video.
</P>
<P>
   During the tribute, Carter smiled broadly and his wife appeared
to be blinking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton later paid tribute to Carter during his
convention address, saying that ''in the great tradition of
President Jimmy Carter ... we are still the world's leading force
for human rights around the world. Thank you, President Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he ''really appreciated'' the acknowledgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was heartwarming to me,'' he said on CNN's Larry King Live.
</P>
<P>
   Following the tribute, Carter received a call from Gore, who
''just thanked me for being here and congratulated me.'' Carter
called the vice president ''a very close personal friend of mine
for 25 years,'' explaining that Gore was elected to Congress the
same year he was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Carter lost his re-election bid to Ronald Reagan in 1980. His
term was marred by an energy shortage, skyrocketing inflation, and
the Iran hostage crisis but also included several highlights,
including the successful 1978 Camp David summit when he helped
hammer out a Middle East peace deal between Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the White House, Carter's popularity has increased
along with his reputation as a globe-trotting diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates criticized the Democratic Party for failing to
recognize Carter during previous conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's long overdue to pay tribute to President Carter,'' said
Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, Carter's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was ''treated like a pariah at earlier conventions,''
said fellow Georgia delegate, former Rep. Buddy Darden.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never have felt excluded and I never have been treated
poorly,'' he said. ''I've always felt that I've been treated quite
well'' by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two conventions where he was nominated as president,
Carter made several other prime-time convention speeches. He said
he decided against going to the 1996 gathering because President
Clinton and Gore were being renominated.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't need my help,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> India Braces for Rebel Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Security forces turned Srinagar into a
garrison town Monday, the eve of India's independence day, as they
sought to prevent further rebel attacks like the car bombing that
killed 14 people last week.
</P>
<P>
   No violence was immediately reported in Srinagar, but an
explosion ripped through a passenger train in northern India on
Monday night, killing nine people and wounding 33 others, Press
Trust of India news agency reported Tuesday. No one claimed
responsibility for the train blast in Roza Gaon, nearly 300 miles
southeast of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of soldiers, paramilitary troops and police spread
across Srinagar, summer capital of disputed Kashmir, and other
areas vulnerable to attack by Islamic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a war zone. We are taking all precautions,'' said
Kul Bhushan Jandial, the state government's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is the focus of an Islamic insurgency that has killed at
least 25,000 people in the past 11 years. More than a dozen
militant groups have been fighting Indian forces, demanding
independence or Kashmir's merger with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, suspected militants attacked paramilitary patrols
and wounded three soldiers and five civilians in Kashmir. The
attacks came a day after two land mines killed six soldiers, 10
rebels died in gun battles with government troops and three
explosions injured 42 other people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two powerful blasts Monday injured eight people,
including four policemen, in Kanpur, 240 miles southeast of New
Delhi, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, also in northern India, the
Press Trust of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on who carried out the attack. Kashmir
separatist have threatened violence during independence
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpshooters took positions Monday overlooking Bakshi Stadium
in Srinagar, where Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, Kashmir's top
elected leader, was to give a speech Tuesday. Police fear rocket
attacks on the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and helmets inspected cars at
checkpoints and looked for bombs under cars in parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cars have been stolen. Some of them could be used by the
militants in such attacks,'' Chavang Phunsog, Kashmir's principal
home secretary, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Girish Chandra Saxena, the federal representative in
Kashmir, acknowledged human rights excesses by security forces in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''This problem is inherent in the prevailing circumstances,
which have been created by the terrorist and their foreign
mentors,'' Saxenna said in a statement. He urged security forces to
''take care to minimize civilian casualties or losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Separatist guerrillas in the Kashmir Valley have observed
India's Independence Day as a ''Black Day'' since 1989. India
accuses neighboring Pakistan of fomenting and backing the
militancy, a charge Pakistan denies.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan President Rafiq Tarar said in an address Monday -- the
day his country celebrates independence from Britain -- that
Islamabad would continue to support the struggle in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, hopes for peace rose when Hezb-ul Mujahedeeen, the
main militant group, announced a cease-fire and the Indian
government responded by suspending its offensives.
</P>
<P>
   But peace talks fell through when India refused a demand to
include Pakistan in the discussions. The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen broke
the cease-fire with a car bomb in downtown Srinagar that killed 13
soldiers and a journalist and wounded 25 other people Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   India holds two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest. The
hostile nuclear armed neighbors have fought two wars for control of
Kashmir since they won independence from Britain in 1947.

Clintons Rally Democrats for 2000
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton offered a triumphant review of his
years in office Monday night before the Democratic National Convention and
appealed to Americans to elect Al Gore as his successor. Clinton described his
vice president as a ''profoundly good man'' who will ''keep this progress and
prosperity going.'' The evening session ended to a rendition of ''Seventy-six
trombones,'' an upbeat counterpoint to the scene in the street outside the hall,
where police in riot gear struggled with protestors.

pepper-spray balls, rubber bullets and finally a charge on horseback. Police
herded the demonstrators to the far end of a designated protest area, pushing
them away from the convention hall. The confrontation originally involved about

worth of work as he carried 15 times for 69 yards in two series that lasted 12
and 13 plays each.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Rally Democrats for 2000  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton offered a triumphant review
of his years in office Monday night, exhorting the Democratic
National Convention to propel Al Gore on the road to succeed him.
Clinton described his vice president as a ''profoundly good man''
who will ''keep this progress and prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My fellow Americans, are we better off today than we were
eight years ago? You bet we are,'' said the man who twice led his
party to victory.
</P>
<P>
   The evening session ended to a rendition of ''Seventy-six
trombones,'' an upbeat counterpoint to the scene outside the hall,
where police in riot gear and on horseback clashed with
demonstrators following an evening of music and protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' four-day political production was designed not
only to promote Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman, but also to
stir memories of John F. Kennedy's nomination in this city 40 years
ago. Kennedy's image appeared on the video screen behind the
speaker's podium as the convention opened; his voice echoed in the
hall. His daughter, Caroline, addresses the delegates Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates cheered Clinton even before he stepped to the podium,
watching a giant video screen that captured him image he strolled
through an underground corridor. The noise drew louder when he made
it to the stage and delegates chanted, ''Thank you'' over and over
again.
</P>
<P>
   In his valedictory convention address as president, Clinton
praised Gore for his work in the White House. ''Whether it was
reforming welfare, protecting the environment, closing the digital
divide or bringing jobs to rural and urban America,'' said Clinton,
''there has been no stronger champion than Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the convention that twice nominated him for the
presidency, Clinton said Gore was ''always there'' when the tough
decisions were being made in the White House and that he would
succeed ''by paying down the debt, investing in education and
health care and in family tax cuts we can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans responded even before Clinton had left the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This speech was about Bill Clinton trying to write his own
legacy, not about Al Gore's future,'' said spokesman Ari Fleischer.
''Instead of passing the baton to Al Gore, Bill Clinton used it to
beat his own drum. The vice president remains in Bill Clinton's
shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton preceded her husband to the
podium, cheered loudly herself to the booming strains of ''New
York,'' her new home and site of her Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned in Missouri as the convention's opening gavel
fell, stressing his commitment to Social Security and Medicare and
vowing an issue-oriented campaign setting out the choice between
parties. From the road he spoke to Clinton and thanked him for his
''generous and kind words.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The people on the other ticket are good men, I'll never attack
them personally,'' Gore said, referring to George W. Bush and Dick
Cheney. He said, ''The American people need to know the specifics
of how the American people would be affected if the other side
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later completed the thought, telling 4,338 delegates and
many thousands more in the Staples Center arena, ''The GOP wants to
spend every dime of our projected surplus and then some -- leaving
nothing to extend the life of Medicare and Social Security, nothing
for emergencies, nothing in case the projected surpluses don't come
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from the convention hall, Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of
Delaware candidly discussed the issue of Clinton's personal
failings and their impact on the party. ''We have been so cowered
as a party by a guy I love, Bill Clinton's incredible
indiscretions,'' he told Iowa's delegates. ''I think we should make
this election about integrity, I think we should make this election
about honesty. Not shy away from it,'' he said.	   The Democratic hope for their
convention week was for Gore to
emerge from Clinton's presidential shadow, gain a measure of credit
and respect for the accomplishments of the last eight years, but
avoid being tarred with the brush of Clinton's personal misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the escapades of President Clinton in the White
House are still in people's memories but I think that time is
passing by,'' former President Carter said in an NBC interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been a hint of scandal about Al Gore,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hall, hundreds of protesters clashed with police
after a concert by the edgy rock band ''Rage Against the Machine.''
Activists threw chunks of dirt in the direction of police, who
responded by firing balls of pepper spray from paintball guns.
Protesters also sprayed police with ammonia and were firing steel
balls from slingshots, said California Highway Patrol Assistant
Chief Stan Perez. ''We're deploying en masse,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd inside the hall was unaware as they listened to
Clinton skewer the Republicans and urge four more years for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''America's success was not a matter of chance; it was a matter
of choice,'' he said, rebutting claims by Georger W. Bush to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed Republicans for their dire predictions about his
first-term economic plan, a blueprint that he said has led to
soaring surpluses instead of deficits. ''The Republican said they
would not be held responsible for our economic policies,'' he said.
I hope the American people will take them at their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeated several refrains about how much better off
Americans are compared to the end of the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are more hopeful,'' he said three times, because of tax
cuts, new job creation and welfare reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are more secure,'' he said three times, because of less
crime, better health care and a cleaner environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are more free,'' he said twice, because of less bigotry and
less discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded his remarks with an appeal to voters, saying ''the
future of our country is in your hands. You must think hard, feel
deeply, and choose wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Clinton struck many of the same themes.
Thinking back to the 1992 campaign, she said, ''I remember a group
of children holding a sign: ''Please stop. If you give us eight
minutes, we'll give you eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, we did stop, we did listen. And what an eight years it's
been! I'm proud to stand here at this extraordinary moment -- the
most peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's endorsement of Gore was crafted to get the party
juices flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've worked closely together for eight years now. In the most
difficult days of the last years, when we faced the toughest issues
-- of war and peace, of taking on powerful special interests -- he
was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   With a swipe at Bush, he added, ''To those who say the progress
of the last eight years was an accident, that we just coasted
along, let's be clear: America's success was not a matter of
chance. It was a matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton basked in applause after he finished his 41-minute
speech. Strains of ''Don't stop thinking about tomorrow,'' - the
theme song of his 1992 campaign, filled the hall. Delegates clapped
and waved signs that read, ''Thank you President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention began with an invocation that must have been
jarring for the majority of delegates who favor abortion rights.
''In you, oh God, we trust ... that you will keep us ever committed
to protect the life and well-being of all people, but especially
unborn children,'' prayed Catholic Cardinal Roger Mahony.
</P>
<P>
   In a postscript to pre-convention controversy over a fundraiser
at the Playboy Mansion, Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California visited
the hall after turning down a speaking slot for Tuesday. Under
pressure from party officials, she had agreed previously to move
the fund-raiser, and said she didn't want to give the impression
she had done so for ''personal gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The pre-convention polls were muddled. One suggested Bush's lead
had shrunk to three percentage points, but others made it a
double-digit lead. CNN said more Americans are concerned with a
candidate's stand on the issues than about character -- a switch
from the primaries of earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, Gore campaigned in Independence, home to the
political patron saint to underdogs, Harry Truman. It was there, as
well, that Lyndon Johnson signed legislation creating Medicare in
1965. ''I won't stop fighting until all our families have the
quality health care and the secure retirements they deserve,'' the
vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore have competing plans for Social Security, and Bush
has yet to lay out details of a plan to offer prescription drug
coverage under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   There was grumbling among some Gore strategists that the
president's four-night stay in the convention city complicated
Gore's efforts to establish his own identity for the campaign
ahead. It was the fourth convention address for the one-time
governor of Arkansas. Twelve years ago, he placed Michael Dukakis'
name in nomination in an overlong speech that drew widespread
ridicule. By 1992, he was the nominee, the ''Man from Hope'' who
was leading his party to the White House. In 1996, he spoke at
length about the ''bridge to the 21st century'' as he campaigned
toward a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Now his role was different.
</P>
<P>
   A look back at his accomplishments, a vision for the future,
and, finally, yielding the spotlight to his longtime vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore appear together in Michigan on Tuesday in a
ceremonial passing of the torch from one party leader to the other.
The vice president arrives in his convention city Wednesday, hours
before his formal nomination by delegates won in the primaries of
winter and spring.
</P>
<P>
   He delivers his acceptance speech Thursday, and he and Lieberman
depart shortly afterward for their first post-convention campaign
stop in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   From the convention podium, Democrats lost little time in
beginning their counter-argument to claims posted by Bush in his
Republican convention address.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore have led the nation to its ''longest and
strongest economic boom'' in history, said Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman in remarks prepared for delivery. Referring to claims that
Democrats had ''squandered'' their opportunity to lead, she said,
''Opportunities lost? Try memories lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy was ''on its knees'' when Democrats moved into the
White House in 1993, she said. The only regret, she added, was they
didn't take over sooner.

<HEADLINE> New York delegation can't get enough of the Clintons  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - New York's corner of the Democratic
Convention hall was the place to be Monday night as the state's
U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton took center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Roaring wildly during the first lady's speech, several New
Yorkers then wiped away tears as President Bill Clinton wound up
his own farewell address.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a lot of wet eyes, mine among them,'' said state
party leader Michael Schell. ''We all hate to see him go. He's been
a good friend to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   But New Yorkers raved that though they were losing one Clinton
they were gaining another.
</P>
<P>
   Waving navy placards that read ''New York Loves Hillary'' and
''Give 'em Hill'' the 294 delegates from the first lady's adopted
home state used just about any pause in the first lady's speech to
cheer and chant her name.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was magnificent. She is a New Yorker through and
through,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, the dean of the state's
Congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Media also swarmed the New Yorkers to gather reaction. One
television camera angling for a shot on the crammed floor knocked a
female spectator in the head. She watched the rest of the speeches
with an ice pack nearly the size of a basketball balanced on her
head.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've almost been knocked out by the media, I am not giving
interviews now,'' she said, declining to provide her name.
</P>
<P>
   Supermodel and New York delegate Christie Brinkley roamed about
with a hand-held video camera capturing the goings on for Good
Morning America.
</P>
<P>
   And there was dancing in the aisle when Clinton took the stage
to the strains of ''New York, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, hoarse from a day of speeches, lauded the
first lady for staying focused on the issues and shying away from
direct attacks on her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was both a valedictory, saying goodbye as first lady, and
the passing of the torch to the Senate campaign,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Other delegates agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought the first lady's speech was very clear. She's not
the first lady any more, she's a candidate for the United States
Senate from New York,'' said Louis Thompson, a delegate from
Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> Little movement in talks to end strike  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Mandatory overtime and the ability of workers
to transfer jobs are taking center stage as the protracted labor
dispute between Verizon Communications and thousands of phone
workers wears on.
</P>
<P>
   The unions say the latest management proposal fails to address
their concerns about the amount of overtime employees work.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the company can require employees to work 10 extra
hours a week during seven months of the year, and 15 extra hours a
week during five months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say that provision was intended to give the
company flexibility during emergencies or periods of heavy traffic,
not to allow Verizon to demand that employees work to these limits
each week. They seek to scale back the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two hours every day is just a little bit too much for a
working mother,'' said Verizon worker Lisa Charles of Newark, N.J.,
who says she typically works 10 hours of mandatory overtime a week.
''You're exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says the mandatory overtime is part of its
multipronged strategy to meet customer demand in a tight labor
market while minimizing employee stress.
</P>
<P>
   Other components of this approach include limiting the monthly
transfers of customer service representatives, particularly in call
centers with heavy volumes, and being able to distribute work such
as incoming calls to centers throughout the company's region,
Verizon officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we have fairly addressed the issues,'' said Eric
Rabe of Verizon, the nation's largest local and wireless telephone
company formed from the summer merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   But these interconnected management techniques have prompted
other concerns by the unions. CWA leaders say a company proposal
that would limit to 1.5 percent the number of workers that can
transfer each month would trap workers in high-pressure jobs. The
unions also fear that the company will reassign work to areas in
their merged territory where labor is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Some unions leaders suggested that the company, now facing a
strike that has dragged on 10 days, may have underestimated the
importance of concerns raised by employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the company misjudged the solidarity of the workers,
and I think they misjudged the seriousness of the issues that the
workers were trying to emphasize during negotiations,'' AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney said in an interview in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The strike of 87,000 employees for the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers and CWA affects Delaware, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Sub Accident Highlights Russia Woes  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The accident that sent one of Russia's newest
nuclear subs to the sea bottom was the latest proof of how deep its
once-powerful military had sank since the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of resources and motivation, delayed wages, corruption,
draft-dodging, hazing and other woes have plagued the poorly
financed army for years since the empire that fed it fell into
pieces in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's continuing economic disarray has only added to the army
miseries while the long-awaited military reform remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian army was humiliated by Chechen separatists in the
1994-96 war and its current campaign in Chechnya, a tiny southern
republic in the Caucasus Mountains, shows no signs of a quick
ending.
</P>
<P>
   That should not come as a surprise. Cut down from some 5 million
to about 1 million servicemen, the Russian military has to operate
on an annual budget of $5 billion, compared to the U.S. defense
spending of $280 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Air Force says it had not received a new plane since
1992 and does not expect any new aircraft until 2001. Some experts
warn that even the 6,000 nuclear warheads, Russia's primary claim
to the status of a world power, might soon become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The navy, now in the focus of attention over the Kursk submarine
accident, has mostly sent its ships on short training runs near
their bases due to the lack of funds to buy fuel. It also had
decommissioned hundreds of ships in the 1990s because it couldn't
afford repairs and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Russian reports say 70 percent of navy ships need repairs. The
cash-poor navy is said to keep only three nuclear submarines on
patrol at any given time out of a force that numbered more than 100
vessels a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian navy commander, Rear Adm. Nikolai Konorev, even said
in a recent newspaper interview that if the funding shortages
continue at the current level, the navy could go out of existence
by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The navy, and the military in general, are pinning their hopes
on President Vladimir Putin, a former Soviet KGB operative who has
insisted repeatedly on the need to restore Russia's global clout
and military might.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has reportedly boosted military spending, and has approved
a program to develop and purchase sophisticated weaponry so as to
revive conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army has been underfinanced for several years, which has
entailed negative consequences for the nation's defense
potential,'' Putin said at the time. ''It has raised doubts about
the very possibility for Russia to have a modern army equipped with
state-of-the-art weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The encouraged navy chief, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, last month
announced plans to send Russia's only aircraft carrier and several
other ships to the Mediterranean in the largest such deployment
since the Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, which went down to the Barents Sea floor during major
exercises of Russia's Northern Fleet, was to be part of the
Mediterranean grouping along with five other submarines, according
to the Internet newspaper Vesti.Ru.
</P>
<P>
   ''The maneuvers, planned as a gala report to the president about
the navy's readiness to resume combat patrols in the Mediterranean,
ended with a submarine accident,'' Vesti.Ru said gloomily.

pepper-spray balls, rubber bullets and finally a charge on horseback. Police
herded the demonstrators to the far end of a designated protest area, pushing
them away from the convention hall. The confrontation originally involved about

Russians Trying To Rescue Sub

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian navy is trying to find a way to rescue more than

early Tuesday, about a dozen military ships including a nuclear-powered cruiser
were at the site, Russian reports said. The chance of a happy ending was ''not
very high,'' the navy chief conceded. The Kursk, one of Russia's biggest nuclear
submarines, was apparently involved in a collision before it plunged hundreds of

<HEADLINE> US Warms to N. Korea Relations Bid  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration says it is willing
to upgrade relations with North Korea if the long-reclusive
Communist country ends its support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will hold more talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope they will be prepared to take the necessary steps to
allow us to then remove them from the list,'' Philip Reeker, a
State Department spokesman, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. official referred to a list of seven countries,
including North Korea, branded by the department as sponsors of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were held last week in Pyongyang between Michael Sheehan,
U.S. coordinator for counterterrorism, and Vice Minister of Foreign
Affairs Kim Gye Gwan.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il was quoted as
saying ''the U.S. is putting a cap of a terrorist nation on us. As
soon as they remove it, we would open ties with the U.S. -- even
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, all but humanitarian aid to a branded country is
prohibited but that does not bar diplomatic relations. The United
States has ties to Syria, for instance, and President Clinton met
with the late President Hafez Assad to try to generate a peace
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Further talks with North Korea on terrorism are planned, but no
date has been set, Reeker said,
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials reportedly are demanding that North Korea
publicly renounce terrorism and expel all terrorism suspects before
it can be considered for removal from their list.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has normalized ties with Italy, Australia and the
Philippines this year in gestures apparently aimed at easing
international concerns over the country and facilitating outside
economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are prepared to improve relations with Pyongyang as North
Korea addresses the areas of concern that we've had,'' Reeker said.

<HEADLINE> US, Russia To Meet on Arms Control  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American and Russian negotiators will meet
this week to try to conclude modest arms-control agreements that
could strengthen cooperation between the two countries, despite
sharp differences over a missile-defense program.
</P>
<P>
   The potential agreements also could give President Clinton
somewhat of a legacy in reducing nuclear dangers that has eluded
him over two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is weighing a limited anti-missile system that could
defend all states against a small-scale attack. Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush would go all-out with an
extensive defense against missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Russia objects to any system on the grounds it would violate
treaty restrictions against anti-ballistic missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, every president has made big moves to reduce the
nuclear weapons danger. But Clinton has come up short. A skeptical
Republican-controlled Congress and delay in Moscow in approving the
landmark START II treaty are among the problems he has faced.
</P>
<P>
   A global treaty to ban nuclear weapons tests was rejected by the
Senate last November, and the Foreign Relations Committee chairman,
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has said any arms-control pact Clinton
negotiated in his final months would be ''dead on arrival'' in his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, last spring, the Senate amended a defense
spending bill to deny Clinton authority to make unilateral
reductions in nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday, and with the clock ticking, U.S.
disarmament specialist John Holum and Yuri Kapralov, head of the
Russian arms-control directorate, will meet in Geneva, Switzerland,
on ways to improve strategic cooperation between their two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Even while disagreeing on a missile defense system, Clinton and
Russian President Vladimir Putin decided in June at a summit in
Moscow to find ways to cooperate to lower nuclear tensions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the projects to be taken up in Geneva is sharing
techniques to provide early warning of missile attack, with a joint
center to be established in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia gave its approval to the proposition at the Moscow summit
and the aim now is to implement the program.
</P>
<P>
   A second project, proposed by the Clinton administration, would
devise ways to warn each other that a test missile or a space
rocket has been launched. The objective is to allay
misunderstanding and concerns and to avert a dangerous response.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the table for consideration at Geneva is a joint
U.S.-Russian project known as Ramos, which is designed to improve
sensors in early warning satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Joint exercises in missile defenses also will be discussed, two
U.S. officials said in describing the Holum-Kapralov meetings. And,
they said, the administration had proposed working in Geneva on
parts of a text for a new START III treaty to reduce U.S. and
Russian long-range nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The START II treaty, concluded in January 1993 by President
Bush, established reductions to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads on each
side. Ratified by the Senate and finally, this year, by the Russian
parliament, it has yet to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Putin held a pivotal defense meeting in Moscow on Friday.
According to Russian press reports, he decided to shrink the
Russian arsenal to 1,500, a level proposed by Russia for the START
II treaty but rejected by the Clinton administration as too low.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has suggested a ceiling of 2,000 to 2,500
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they were unable to
confirm the press reports, which if accurate would mean Putin had
sided in a policy dispute with the chief of the Russian general
staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, and against Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   The cash-strapped Russian government apparently is unable even
to build up to the ceilings imposed for some weapons in the START
II treaty while dismantling the powerful missiles outlawed by the
pact.
</P>
<P>
   Money saved by unilateral reductions could be used to build up
conventional land, sea and air forces, as urged by Kvashnin.

<HEADLINE> Freight Train Derails in Montana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALTA, Mont. (AP) -- Six tanker cars of a westbound Burlington
Northern Santa Fe freight train, three of them containing a
poisonous chemical, derailed east of Malta on Monday night, closing
U.S. Route 2 and forcing evacuations of up to 400 residents, a
railway official said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports were that none of the chemicals leaked from the
100-car train traveling from Memphis, Tenn., to Pasco, Wash. Sparks
from the derailing trail created small fires for several miles.
</P>
<P>
   BNFS spokesman Gus Melonas said three of the tankers contain
carbon disulphide, a poisonous, highly flammable chemical used in
making solvent and cellophane.
</P>
<P>
   Two other tankers contain titanium dioxide and pose no threat to
the environment, Melonas said. The sixth car, containing glue,
remained upright, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malta, in north-central Montana, is about 50 miles south of the
Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Melonas said the requested evacuation was a precaution and
involved from 200 to 400 people. A railroad emergency team rushed
to the site and a special hazardous-materials firm was en route
from Helena, about 290 miles to the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if they're releasing any fumes,'' Phillips
County Fire Chief Clark Kelly said of the derailed tanker cars.
</P>
<P>
   He said the train set fires along the right-of-way as far away
as 20 to 30 miles to the east, toward Saco, and train personnel
were fighting them.

<HEADLINE> West Nile pellets applied in Broome County  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - Broome County health officials launched
an assault on the larvae and mosquitoes carrying the West Nile
virus by planting bacteria-laced pellets in about 800 storm drains.
</P>
<P>
   Two-gram granulated doses of a bacterium known as Bacillus
Sphaericus, were applied Monday in the sewer systems to kill the
larvae of two species of mosquitoes that have the potential to
harbor the virus, which can cause encephalitis and meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   The Broome County Health Department contracted Acme, a Tompkins
County-based company, to drop the larvicide into 1,200 sewers in
parts of Binghamton, Johnson City and the Town of Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   The use of pellets is considered less toxic than spraying.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in upstate communities have begun looking at organic
pesticide options.
</P>
<P>
   The Town Board in West Seneca near Buffalo is trying to come up
with alternatives to Scourge, Anvil and Malathion, chemical
treatments used to kill adult mosquitoes that can carry the
potentially fatal virus.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes through bites.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Illegal Lottery  </HEADLINE>
By AYE AYE WIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- From the third to the ninth of every
month Myanmar takes an unofficial holiday. Businesses halt and
office work slackens as people indulge in what has become a
national pastime, even obsession: the ''two-digit lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get rich quickly in one of the world's poorest
countries, more and more people are turning to the hottest -- and
illegal -- game of chance. Hundreds of thousands of people pay
clandestine visit to roadside food-stalls, coffee shops, betel-nut
shops and markets where the tickets are sold under the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Before putting their money on line, many visit temples to
consult Buddhist monks on lucky numbers; others try to predict the
jackpot number by interpreting dreams and incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the lottery is simple: punters have to bet on a
two-digit number of their choice. They win 80 times their
investment if the number tallies with the last two digits of the
winners in the official lottery run by the Finance Ministry every
month from the third to ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Myint Aung, a major operator of the two-digit lottery, said he
hires ''several boys'' to sell tickets. Sales remain open until
8:30 a.m., thirty minutes before the results of the official
lottery are announced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My man waiting at the state lottery office in downtown Yangon
calls my mobile phone as soon as the results come out,'' said
Myint, a 51-year-old ethnic Chinese man.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was started last year by a few enterprising
businessmen, the two-digit lottery, or ''na lone ti'' has gained
immense popularity. It is cheaper, promises a quicker payoff and
offers better odds than the official lottery, where the winning
ticket has to match a long number with two alphabets followed by
six digits.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional police raids on ''na lone ti'' dens, the risk of
arrest and potential three-year jail sentence has failed to deter
operators and bettors alike. Prizes are collected from the seller's
shop, or in the case of bigger pay-outs, delivered to the winner's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The official lottery holds draws every day for seven consecutive
days, announcing regular small prizes before revealing the jackpot.
The ''na lone ti'' follows the draws and hands out prizes
corresponding to the winning official lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple winners are possible since the last two digits could
have been picked by many people.
</P>
<P>
   The government lotteries cost 14 cents. The ''na lone ti'' can
be bought for as little as one penny. The most expensive ticket is
for $857, which promises a possible prize money equivalent to
$68,560, a big fortune for most people. A mid-ranking government
employee earns about $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The ''na lone ti'' tickets are 2-by-3 inch pieces of white, blue
or pink paper with the bettor's number scribbled on it. The seller
keeps a carbon copy of the ticket for verification later.
</P>
<P>
   Nyunt Lwin, a bus driver, who earns $28.57 a month, said he won
$57.14 this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will continue to bet. It is fun as well as profitable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many ardent bettors flock to monasteries, famous for pointing
the believers in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Khin Hla, a woman in her late 40s, said she consults a monk the
first week of every month, at a monastery in Hlegu, 20 miles north
of Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The monk does not give the number directly. We have to watch
the gestures of the monk closely. Correct interpretation of the
monk's movement is the key,'' she said. ''If the monk shows a
thumbs-up gesture, the winning number for the day could be 41 or 14
-- thumbs denoting number one and the remaining four fingers
representing number four.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked if she has ever won the clandestine lottery, Khin Hla
replied dejectedly that luck has not been on her side yet.

<HEADLINE> Delegates From 1960 Return  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- One was a delegate, another the daughter of a
delegate. There was a politician's wife, and a Cabinet member's
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   They had gathered in Los Angeles to bear witness to history: a
raucous Democratic convention with no clear front-runner, no
scripted schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A few had seen it before; others were newcomers to the
rough-and-tumble of politics. But when John F. Kennedy stepped up
to accept the nomination and lay the 1960 Democratic National
Convention to rest, it was a moment seared in the memories of those
who were there.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, wrinkled and graying, they've returned to Los
Angeles for the encore. The scene is more sedate, the process less
spontaneous -- but these delegates will always have 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a new world,'' says former Rhode Island Gov. Bruce
Sundlun, 80, who in 1960 served as special assistant to the U.S.
attorney general. His job at the convention was ''principal
gofer,'' until he was unexpectedly recruited for another task.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting quietly in my seat when some young man came up
to me and said, 'Is your name Sundlun? Are you a pilot?'''
</P>
<P>
   The stranger produced a walkie-talkie -- fairly sophisticated
technology in those days -- and frantically asked whether Sundlun
could untangle the garble coming across. When Sundlun assured him
he could, the man said: ''Well, Bobby Kennedy sent me for you. He
needs you right away. Come on!''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Sundlun went from flunky to Kennedy fix-it guy. He
spent the next few days adjusting frequencies and schooling
Kennedy's floor managers on how to use the radios. And, yes, he
even met Bobby Kennedy, who was managing his brother's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sundlun, Bethine Church was an insider from the start.
She was sitting front and center when her husband, then-U.S. Sen.
Frank Church, delivered the keynote address at the 1960 convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so exciting all the time, but also very
nerve-racking,'' says Church, who at 77 has returned this year as
chairwoman of the Idaho delegation.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, she'll be at the microphone at the Staples
Center -- to cast Idaho's 23 votes on nominating night. She's still
working on her speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want it to be good,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Aasen wasn't even a delegate, only the daughter of a
delegate, when she happened to see John F. Kennedy in a parking lot
at the 1960 convention -- lobbying Wyoming's delegates for their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That wasn't a contest, it was a battle,'' Aasen recalls of the
nomination tug-of-war among Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Adlai
Stevenson. ''It was a war, and you had people fighting hard for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 70, Aasen is the Democratic town committee chairwoman in
Westport, Conn., and experiencing her first convention as an
official delegate. The only thing she expects to outdo the
intensity of 1960 is security.
</P>
<P>
   What Aasen witnessed behind-the-scenes, Mike Vinich experienced
firsthand. Vinich, one of 15 Wyoming delegates in 1960, will never
forget the night his state cast the votes that put Kennedy over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all split up,'' Vinich, now 76, recalls. ''There were
Kennedy delegates and Johnson delegates and Adlai Stevenson men. We
were all over the board.''
</P>
<P>
   As they called the roll of the states, several passed. When they
finally got to Wyoming, Kennedy needed 13 votes to win the
nomination, but the delegation was undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our guys ran around and talked to everybody. Then the chairman
got up and said, 'Wyoming gives its 15 votes to the next president
of the United States, John Kennedy.' And down came all the
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The convention just went wild. What a moment!''
</P>
<P>
   This is Vinich's first convention since.
</P>
<P>
   Sundlun, a veteran of more conventions than he can remember,
responds with a resounding ''No!'' when asked whether the 2000
Democratic convention could possibly compare with 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all a package,'' he says. ''I think the Kennedy era,
short as it was, was the last time there was any real respect for
government. It's a new world; let's move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Sundlun admits: ''Oh, sure, it's fun to remember.''

<HEADLINE> 15 Injured in Baltimore Bar Crash  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNEY, Md. (AP) -- A speeding car slammed into the side of a
crowded Baltimore County bar Monday night, sending at least 15
people to the hospital, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The car lost control, struck another vehicle and crashed into
the wall of the Firehouse Tavern about 10:30 p.m. The bar, in a
northeastern suburb of Baltimore, was packed with patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The car's three occupants and 12 bar patrons were taken to the
hospital, said Lt. Minda Foxwell of the Baltimore County Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Four with more serious injuries were taken to University of
Maryland Shock Trauma, including two of the car's occupants, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the vehicle matched the description of one they had
been chasing moments earlier following a shooting at Skateland, a
roller-skating rink in the nearby suburb of Towson. The brief
pursuit had been called off because the fleeing car was going too
fast, Foxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mack was stopped outside the Firehouse Tavern en route to
work when he saw the speeding car, its lights off, ''literally
airborne.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of froze because he was heading directly for my
vehicle,'' Mack told WJZ-TV. The oncoming vehicle skidded, hit the
back of Mack's car and spun left, heading for the bar. ''Within a
split-second it went right through the building,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Lieberman Campaign in Midwest  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) -- In the heartland city where Medicare
became law, Vice President Al Gore used the words of Franklin
Delano Roosevelt to accuse Republican opponent George W. Bush of
''smooth evasion'' in his promises to safeguard both Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people deserve to know the specifics of how the
American people would be affected if the other side won,'' Gore
told a forum of senior citizens Monday at the Roger T. Sermon
community center.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Democratic presidential candidate watched President
Clinton's valedictory to the Democratic National Convention and
said he was grateful for Clinton's ''generous and kind words.''
</P>
<P>
   Joined in front of a St. Louis hotel TV by wife Tipper, running
mate Joseph Lieberman and his wife Hadassah, Gore looked ahead to
Tuesday's joint rally with Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton as
symbolic, ''a hand-off, a passing of the torch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also placed a congratulatory telephone call to Clinton just
after the speech, and the two spoke for about five minutes, the
White House said. Lieberman also spoke with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores and Liebermans had stormed into St. Louis for a rally
with several thousand people beside the city's soaring, stainless
steel Gateway Arch.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention opened in Los Angeles, Gore gave his St. Louis
supporters a speech laden with policy detail -- smaller classrooms,
more community policing, no more racial profiling, universal
preschool, universal child health insurance, racial harmony -- just
as he has promised to do in his Thursday-night convention address.
</P>
<P>
   ''This battle's going to rage all the way 'til November!'' he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lieberman headed to the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles, where he planned to meet with members of the
Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, acknowledging there are questions in the
black community about Lieberman's stance on affirmative action, has
designated Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and Del. Eleanor Holmes
Norton of Washington, D.C., to act as liaisons
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lieberman supported California's Proposition 209, which
banned state-funded affirmative action programs, and he has opposed
what he describes as racial quotas.
</P>
<P>
   In Independence, Gore wasn't wrestling for the spotlight with
his blandly set (no music or campaign posters) and studious
discussion of plans for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and
additional Social Security savings.
</P>
<P>
   One elderly woman reluctant to speak into Gore's microphone
nonetheless fit perfectly into his script. Responding to Bush's
plan to let workers divert some of their payroll taxes from Social
Security into the stock market for potentially bigger retirement
nest eggs, the woman protested in a quavery voice:
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's going to take care of me? I don't know about investing
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, teasing, said, ''Well, couldn't you get on the Internet
... don't you think that would be fun to try to follow that every
day?''
</P>
<P>
   The woman replied, ''I've tried to study stocks and it's like a
foreign language to me. I need to keep my Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   A splashier spectacle -- but no national headline-making news --
was in the works for his St. Louis appearance with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore invoked the image of President Truman, who was from
Independence and also battled Republicans over health and
retirement programs, to cast himself as another champion of issues
that affect real people.
</P>
<P>
   As tribute to Truman's battles, President Johnson came here to
sign the Medicare law 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't stop fighting until all our families have the quality
health care and the secure retirements they deserve,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested Republican Bush had glossed over the details of his
plans for Social Security and Medicare in order to create a false
impression of caring about the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore quoted an undated speech by former President Roosevelt
accusing the Republicans of trying to cash in on the popularity of
New Deal programs:
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me warn the nation against the smooth evasion which says,
'Of course we all believe these things. We believe in Social
Security. We believe in work for the unemployed. We believe in
saving homes -- cross our hearts and hope to die -- we believe in all
these things but we don't like the way present administration is
doing them. Just turn them over to us. We will do all of them, we
will do more of them and we will do them better and, most
important, the doing of them will not cost anybody anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuckled Gore, ''Well, he had their number, didn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer counters that Bush has given plenty
of specifics on his agenda and Gore's contention otherwise ''once
again shows why the vice president has a problem with
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's prescription-drug plan provides government subsidies to
the poorest senior citizens and promises to give the rest the right
to sign up for a plan that offers coverage. But there's no
guarantee for most that those plans would be affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's more ambitious proposal -- and more costly, at $253
billion over 10 years -- would add a Medicare prescription drug
benefit, offering free coverage for low-income recipients, a
monthly premium arrangement for others and catastrophic coverage
for all.
</P>
<P>
   On retirement savings, Gore has proposed tax incentives for
investors building nest eggs over and above a guaranteed Social
Security benefit.

<HEADLINE> Japan Remembers WWII Surrender  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Throughout most of the year, Tokyo's Peaceful
Country Shrine remains true to its name; it is a quiet, wooded
sanctuary that offers respite from the crowds and concrete of
Japan's bustling capital.
</P>
<P>
   But every summer, this shrine honoring Japan's war dead --
including World War II leaders -- becomes a battlefield for those
who claim it symbolizes the desire to placate the souls of fallen
soldiers, and those who see it as proof of the country's refusal to
own up to its brutal past.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan observed the 55th anniversary of its World War II
surrender on Tuesday, the battle raged once more.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the anniversary, nearly a dozen members of Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori's Cabinet and scores of conservative
lawmakers visited the Yasukuni Shrine, bowing deeply before its
curtain-obscured altar to offer their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   In either public or private capacities, Japanese politicians
have made similar trips for decades to Yasukuni, where the names,
dates and place of death in battle are preserved on record books
for 2.5 million war dead dating back to the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, the visits have met a barrage of criticism because
among those enshrined are Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other
World War II war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the visits say it is no more appropriate for
Japan's leaders to offer prayers there than it would be for German
leaders to pay respects at a Nazi graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say that to not offer prayers at Yasukuni, built in
1869 at the order of Emperor Meiji, would be an insult to all of
those who died in the war -- and the powerful political lobby made
up of their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently under fire for hawkish statements since assuming
office in June, Mori chose to stay away from the shrine altogether
Tuesday, and his office said he had no plans to do so later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Though politically expedient, Mori's choice was not likely to
ease concerns from Japan's neighbors that this country's leaders
are trying to whitewash, if not glorify, the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan has ceaselessly committed crimes of adding pains to the
wounds of the Korean people by scheming cunningly and shamelessly
to avoid responsibility for apology and compensation,'' said an
article Monday in North Korea's Rodong Sinmun, the official
newspaper of its ruling Worker's Party.
</P>
<P>
   China and South Korea have also strongly protested past Yasukuni
visits.
</P>
<P>
   Emperor Akihito, Meiji's great-grandson, has not made a Yasukuni
visit. On Tuesday, he and Mori paid their respects at an official
memorial ceremony held at a hall just down the street from the
shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Akihito's father, the late Emperor Hirohito, was not so
squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Hirohito, in whose name the war was waged, visited the shrine
eight times, the final visit being in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of just how difficult it remains for many Japanese
to face the past, Hirohito's wartime role remains an almost taboo
issue, even though more than a decade has passed since his death in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general consensus in Japan that Hirohito was removed
from the day-to-day affairs of the wartime government, a book due
out later this month by Herbert Bix, a respected American
historian, claims Hirohito knew of Pearl Harbor in advance and took
a far more active interest in how the war was waged than previously
believed.
</P>
<P>
   The book further contends that Hirohito and leaders of the U.S.
Occupation forces worked together to shelter him from being held
accountable for the war. That legacy continues to cloud Japan's
ability to accept its responsibility for the war, the book
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Though previews of the book have been out for three months, it
has received virtually no coverage here.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a noted Japanese historian at Tokyo's Chuo
University, said he has heard of Bix's book, but has not yet read
it.
</P>
<P>
   The topic is not one the Japanese media generally likes to
explore, Yoshimi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do not want to talk about that kind of thing because it
leads to the question of war responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while many Japanese may prefer not to look at the former
emperor in a critical light, for the younger generation the problem
is increasingly a simple lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I think that if someone wants to visit the shrine,
let him,'' said 28-year-old Rei Aritake, who works at a Tokyo
publishing house. ''I was born after the war, and it just doesn't
interest me.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Fund Raising Nears $100M Mark  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George W. Bush is the first $100 million man
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor will report to the government later this
month that he has moved within reach of that fund-raising mark, one
that was unimaginable a quarter century ago when Congress enacted
donor limits in the aftermath of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Making it all the more impressive, Bush reached the figure on
the strength of 350,000 different donors to his presidential
campaign in all 50 states -- three quarters of whom gave $100 or
less, his campaign told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''That really exceeds anything we've ever seen, even if you were
to put two or three presidential campaigns together,'' said Herb
Alexander, a professor emeritus at the University of Southern
California who has studied political fund-raising for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it shows an immense ability by Bush to raise money. It
also is evidence of the prosperity that is here now. And it shows
the desire of Republicans to win back the White House,'' Alexander
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan told AP that Bush
finished July having raised:
</P>
<P>
   --About $95 million from individuals and PACs for his primary
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   --More than $2.5 million from individuals and PACs for a special
fund he is permitted to create to pay for legal and accounting
costs in the fall election. His campaign has added to that total
this month.
</P>
<P>
   --About $2.3 million in transfers from other political
committees, interest and dividends and other sources of income.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to raise money for his legal and accounting fund,
all but assuring he'll surpass the $100 million mark by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''In building this unprecedented support, Governor Bush has
reached out to new faces and new voices who previously have not
supported Republicans or who have not participated in the political
process,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stopped raising money for his primary campaign in late July
when, like Vice President Al Gore, he accepted full taxpayer
financing for the fall election, and he already has received a
check from the U.S. Treasury for $67.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The past record for fund raising in a single presidential race
belonged to Ross Perot, who took in $72.8 million in 1992. Nearly
all of that money, however, came from his own pocket instead of
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's watershed fund raising can be traced to a decision he
made early in the 1999-2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a self-financed challenge from Republican millionaire
Steve Forbes, Bush declined the partial federal aid he was entitled
to during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he was exempted from the spending limits imposed on
other candidates and free to raise as much as he could.
</P>
<P>
   The only restriction was he could accept no more than $1,000
from each individual and no more than $5,000 from political action
committees, the donating arms of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   There were no six-figure donations from corporations, labor
unions or wealthy executives
</P>
<P>
   Bush's take far surpasses the performance of President Clinton,
the Democrats' most prolific fund-raiser. In his two elections
combined, Clinton raised only about $66 million in individual and
PAC donations while accepting federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   It also triples Vice President Al Gore's fund raising. Gore
raised $34 million in donations through June 30 for his primary
campaign, but got another $14.6 million from the government because
he agreed to the spending limits and was eligible for partial
federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush will be on even ground in the fall because each is
limited to spending the $67.6 million in federal aid they accepted
to take them through Election Day.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Clash With L.A. Police  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A festive protest concert outside the
Democratic convention turned violent Monday night as demonstrators
threw rocks and fired steel balls from slingshots at police who
answered with pepper spray, rubber bullets and finally a charge on
horseback. At least four people were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Police herded the protesters to the far end of a designated
protest area. Officers in riot gear and carrying shotguns loaded
with rubber bullets then swept toward the crowd, pushing them down
a boulevard under a freeway overpass and away from the convention
hall.
</P>
<P>
   Gates on one side of the convention complex were closed as the
Democrats' opening night ended and delegates began heading out.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, most of the protesters had dispersed, making their
way down side streets where they stood in small groups talking. In
front of the main police line, 200 to 300 people remained, some
standing at the front of the group and waving peace signs at
police.
</P>
<P>
   The altercation began in an area designated for demonstrations
near the Staples Center convention hall as thousands began to leave
after a concert by the edgy rock band Rage Against the Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Speeches by Hillary Clinton and then President Clinton continued
inside with delegates generally unaware of the trouble outside.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters threw pieces of concrete and water bottles, sprayed
police with ammonia and fired steel balls and rocks from
slingshots.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're deploying en masse,'' said California Highway Patrol
Assistant Chief Stan Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and the ACLU said police overrreacted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that Los Angeles is extremely fortunate in escaping
the danger the police department created tonight,'' said Dan
Tokaji, staff attorney for the ACLU of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   One convention delegate, Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer
of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, was caught in the
melee as police cleared the protest area. He said officers shoved
him and refused to let him through the line although he identified
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters with bandannas over their faces lit several fires in
the concert area. The ground around the officers was littered with
rocks, broken bottles and sticks thrown over the fence from the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation originally involved about 300 people out of
the crowd of 8,000 but then spread as more officers rushed to the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   One of the protesters, holding a black flag in one hand, clung
to the fence about 8 feet up as police barraged him with balls of
pepper spray, some striking him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   A second man made it to the top of the fence, grabbed the large
black flag and waved it. Both men waved the flags from the top of
the fence, pelted continually with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation took place beneath a huge TV screen outside of
the Staples Center carrying live video from the speeches inside.
Mrs. Clinton had just finished speaking, and the president was
starting.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Robson, a public school teacher, was shot with a rubber
bullet in her right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were walking away with our hands in the air, our backs to
police, saying please don't shoot when I was hit,'' she said as a
fire crew bandaged her back.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour after the scuffles started at Staples,
hundreds of officers surrounded more than 100 protesters who
blocked a major street through a neighborhood north of the
convention center. When they refused to disperse, police rushed
from behind, pushing and shoving them with nightsticks.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters saw at least one man handcuffed and police pinned more
than a dozen people against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rage Against the Machine, known for its hard-driving sound, is
anti-authoritarian and has campaigned in support of such figures as
Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former radio reporter on death row for killing a
Philadelphia police officer in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trouble, the mood had been festive, with the Fire
Department spraying a cooling shower of water over appreciative
crowd members.
</P>
<P>
   People in the audience threw empty water bottles and fake dollar
bills -- left over from a protest against corporate greed -- into the
air. Some near the stage jumped up and down to the music and others
carried upside down American flags. Marijuana smoke wafted
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, police confronted demonstrators upset by Vice
President Al Gore's family's ownership of stock in Occidental
Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That group stopped at a busy intersection about six blocks from
the convention hall. Police warned them to leave and then, minutes
later, charged with batons and pushed back about 200 protesters.
About 400 others watched from up the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what a police state looks like!'' a protester shouted
at the police.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: US Vessel Didn't Hit Sub  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is no evidence that an American ship or
submarine was involved in the Russian submarine accident in the
Arctic waters of the Barents Sea, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. Navy submarines were operating in the area at the time
of the accident, and one reported having heard an explosion at the
site Saturday, a Clinton administration official said late Monday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, is familiar with
U.S. intelligence reports on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the incident happened Sunday, but the
U.S. official said it was Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were some U.S. submarines in the area,'' the official
said. ''All indications are that there was no U.S. involvement (in
the accident). We know the U.S. units are OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy surveillance ship, the USNS Loyal, was monitoring
submarine movements in the vicinity of the Barents Sea at the time
of the accident but was far from the scene of the accident,
Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials initially said their sub was in a major
collision, although the circumstances of the accident remained
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no indication that a U.S. vessel was involved in this
accident,'' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, with President Clinton at
the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, said the
administration ''made clear to the Russians that any assistance we
can offer is available.'' He said national security adviser Sandy
Berger reiterated this in a telephone conversation with Russian
officials. ''At this point there's been no request for our
assistance,'' Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also said there was no indication Monday that a U.S.
vessel was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the major role submarines play in gathering foreign
intelligence, the Navy usually is reluctant to discuss details of
their movements.
</P>
<P>
   The Barents Sea is often patrolled by U.S. submarines. In 1993,
a U.S. submarine, the USS Grayling, collided with a Russian
ballistic missile submarine, causing slight damage to both vessels.
A year earlier, also in the Barents Sea, the USS Baton Rouge sub
hit a Russian sub, also causing minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. John J. Grossenbacher, commander of the Navy's
Submarine Force Atlantic, issued a statement Monday expressing
sympathy for the Russian submarine crew and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Submarining is inherently dangerous,'' Grossenbacher said.
''The undersea environment is very unforgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy has a rescue vessel designed to bring the crew of
a U.S. or allied submarine to safety, even at depths far beyond
that where the disabled Russian submarine rested. But U.S. military
officials said they were not certain whether the rescue vessel is
compatible with Russian submarines hatches.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. vessel, known as a Deep Submergence Rescue Vessel, is
designed for quick deployment in the event of a submarine accident.
The rescue vessel is transportable by truck, aircraft, ship, or by
a specially configured attack submarine. The only two such vessels
in the Navy's inventory are based in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. rescue vessels are used frequently in
training, they have never been used in an actual rescue.
</P>
<P>
   At the accident site, the 49-foot rescue vessel dives, conducts
a sonar search, and attaches to the disabled submarines hatch. The
rescue vessel can take aboard up to 24 personnel for transfer to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue vessels were developed as a result of the USS
Thresher submarine accident in the North Atlantic in April 1963, in
which all 129 aboard were lost. At the time, submarine operating
depths greatly exceeded the capabilities of rescue vessels. The
Deep Submergence Systems Project contracted with Lockheed Missiles
and Space Co. to produce a deep-diving rescue submarine, the first
of which was launched in 1970.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Produce Nerve Cells  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Scientists have been able to produce nerve cells in
the lab by
using stem cells drawn from bone marrow, a breakthrough that could
help people with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or
spinal-cord injuries.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the findings are borne out, they might one day enable doctors
to take cells from a patient's bone marrow, turn them into nerve
cells and then inject them into patients' brains and spinal cords,
replacing injured cells.
</P>
<P>
   The research, conducted at the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey and MCP Hahnemann University in
Philadelphia, was funded in part by the Christopher Reeve Paralysis
Foundation. An account of the research was published Monday in the
Journal of Neuroscience Research, based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It could be years before the technique is tested in humans,
however, since studies and tests in animals will be needed first.
Still, other researchers were excited by the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly it is important to generate neurons from other
tissues,'' neuroscientist Ronald McKay told The Philadelphia
Inquirer in Tuesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to demonstrate that these cells will perform ...
specific functions'' in the brain and spinal cord, and not behave
like stem cells only in the lab, said McKay, of the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really beautiful,'' Dr. William Greenough, a
neuroscientist at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign,
told The New York Times. ''I see this as a truly significant step
along the way toward developing new technologies for the repair of
the damaged brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells are stored in various organs and grow naturally into
the specific types of cells needed by those organs. Stem cells from
fetal tissue can grow into any type of cell; the latest study
suggests that the same might be true for adult stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ira Black of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey reported the stem cells, treated with growth factors and
antioxidants in tissue culture experiments, quickly divided into
two cells -- another stem cell and a nerve cell.
</P>
<P>
   By tinkering with the chemical signals he used to stimulate the
conversion, Black and his colleagues were able to turn 80 percent
of the bone marrow cells taken from rats and humans into nerve
cells. He said he transplanted rat nerve cells to the brains and
spinal cords of rats and found that they formed connections with
other neurons and survived.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells could be drawn from the patient being treated,
eliminating the problem of adding tissue the immune system might
attack, said Darwin Prockop, of Tulane University's medical school,
who co-authored the research.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Howley, director of research at the Christopher Reeve
Paralysis Foundation, cautioned that many questions still surround
the new technique.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Opportunists'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTY LEMIRE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you get the opportunity to see ''The Opportunists,'' you may
want to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The film features some strong performances and a detailed sense
of place, but it's slow and based on a hackneyed premise.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Walken plays an ex-con named Vic Kelly, who's trying
to go straight as an auto mechanic in Queens, New York. All he
wants to do is provide a decent life for his grown daughter (Vera
Farmiga) and elderly aunt (Anne Pitoniak).
</P>
<P>
   Vic's not doing a very good job, though. He writes bad checks
all over town and he's about to get evicted for failing to pay the
rent on his garage, where he's not exactly the world's greatest
mechanic. His girlfriend Sally (Cyndi Lauper, looking surprisingly
subtle with only hair color and natural makeup) offers to lend him
the money she's saved to renovate the bar she owns, but Vic's too
proud to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   But when a fresh-faced young man named Michael (Peter McDonald)
shows up at his front door, claiming to be his cousin from Ireland
and fawning over Vic's reputation as an expert safecracker, it's
hard not to get sucked back into the life.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, along with two of Vic's buddies from the neighborhood
(Donal Logue and Jose Zuniga) who are stuck in low-paying jobs as
security guards, persuade Vic to perform the infamous ''one last
heist.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this idea isn't terribly original -- we've seen it three
times this year alone. Nicolas Cage played an ex-con forced to pull
off one last car heist in ''Gone in 60 Seconds.'' Paul Newman
played an ex-con forced to pull off one last armored car heist in
''Where the Money Is.'' Ben Affleck played an ex-con forced to pull
off one last casino heist in ''Reindeer Games.''
</P>
<P>
   It's familiar territory, for sure, but first-time
writer-director Myles Connell's pacing is so slow it seems to take
forever to reach our destination. Once we get there, he creates
little suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Connell, a Dublin native who says the Michael character is
semi-autobiographical, does get the details right in the
blue-collar Queens setting. The modest row houses, Vic's run-down
garage and Sally's neighborhood tavern have an authentic feel. It
helps that Walken and Lauper are originally from Queens -- they show
a comfort with the location and the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Opportunists'' is a good chance for Walken to play the
lead once again after years of supporting roles in films including
''Batman Returns,'' ''Pulp Fiction'' and ''Blast from the Past.''
The film is boring at times, but his performance never is. He is
totally believable as a man torn between an honest life and the
temptation of quick, easy cash.
</P>
<P>
   As Vic's daughter, Farmiga also is a joy to watch. She brings a
sweetness and naturalness to her role.
</P>
<P>
   But no one in the cast can keep Logue from stealing every scene
he's in. Logue was so good recently as a chubby Casanova in the
indie hit ''The Tao of Steve,'' and again shows charm and ease on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Opportunists,'' a First Look Pictures release, appeared at
this year's Sundance Film Festival. Jonathan Demme is one of the
five executive producers. The film is rated R for language. Running
time: 89 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Fox Drops 'American High'  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Call ''American High'' the overachiever of
reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   In two short weeks, the Fox series that put students at a
suburban Chicago high school in the spotlight showed how engaging
real-life television could be.
</P>
<P>
   We saw teen-agers fumble through relationships, stumble through
dance class and spar with parents, all without a hint of the cheap
voyeurism and ersatz drama that pervades ''Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks, it turns out, was all ''American High'' got. The
series was flunked by Fox for low ratings; in its place Wednesday
night is a rerun of the animated comedy ''Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of ''American High'' brings to mind ''My So-Called
Life,'' the acclaimed 1994 drama that died young. When so many
banal and exploitive shows about kids thrive, it's juvenile
delinquency to dump shows like these.
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck and a shaky network contributed to the show's
cancellation. The series debuted shortly after CBS expanded ''Big
Brother'' to a sixth night, Wednesday, placing the two reality
shows in competition.
</P>
<P>
   With CBS' hit ''Survivor'' as its lead-in, ''Big Brother'' had
the clear advantage. And without a strong schedule, Fox couldn't
give ''American High'' the time and patience it needed to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Cutler, the filmmaker responsible for ''American High,''
said he was disappointed the 13-episode summer run was cut short on
Fox but optimistic that the series would resurface elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just been a day (since the cancellation) but there are
all sorts of conversations going on,'' Cutler said Monday. ''We're
very confident we'll find a very healthy home and that it can
become a franchise for a network or cable outlet that is in a
position to give it a chance to build its audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My surprise is going to be if we're not in production for a
second season very, very soon,'' said Cutler, an Oscar nominee for
the Clinton campaign documentary ''The War Room.''
</P>
<P>
   If Internet traffic is any indication of fan support, then
''American High'' has its share: A Fox Web site for the series
quickly sprouted ''save our show'' messages.
</P>
<P>
   But could Cutler be misjudging TV viewers? Maybe his cinema
verite series about students at Highland Park High School wasn't
the right kind of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Although ''American High'' was designed to be entertainment and
not a dry sociological study, Cutler refused to pander to the
audience -- or betray his subjects -- by exploiting areas that
presumably could have boosted ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap sex was not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't ask me to do this kind of work and encourage me to
go for the emotional power our shows go for and then say, 'Please,
treat these kids like they're objects of our most base voyeuristic
desires,''' Cutler said. ''That's not what this is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's disheartening to speculate that the show's refusal to sink
to the lowest common denominator contributed to its loss.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that wasn't it; maybe it was just the fault of a weak
network. Wouldn't teen-agers be eager to tune in and measure their
experience against others? Why would parents miss a chance to peek
into the secret world of adolescence?
</P>
<P>
   Answers to those questions are especially vital to Arnold
Shapiro, producer of the groundbreaking ''Scared Straight'' and
other worthy shows about American youth.
</P>
<P>
   His current project is UPN's ''The Teen Files,'' an Emmy-winning
series that has tackled drinking, drug abuse and bigotry. The next
segment, ''Surviving High School'' on Sept. 19, explores harassment
and other afflictions of contemporary life with students from
Northern California's Yuba City High School.
</P>
<P>
   The series aired on UPN mostly through the good graces of Tony
Cassara, the former head of Paramount's TV station group. He is the
rare television executive who ''believes in giving back to the
community,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   More typical are the executives governed strictly by the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a network head, you wouldn't say I'm going to keep
doing 'American Highs' because that's what should be on television.
You're going to keep doing more 'Survivors' because that's what
makes you No. 1,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of ''American High'' to find an audience on Fox has
hurt Shapiro's efforts to sell a teen-oriented reality series that
would bring students from different backgrounds together.
</P>
<P>
   Giving customers what they want is good business. But Shapiro
wonders about the lessons we're learning about ourselves and
teaching our children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public is flocking to a series which has everything to do
with competition, conflict, greed and financial gain. That's what
'Survivor,' the No. 1 show, has to do with every week,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 76; Nasdaq Adds 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were on Tuesday as investors sold off
blue chips after three straight winning sessions. The Nasdaq inched
up slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 75.72 to 11,099.41, after a 148-point
surge yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.92 to 1,488.64. The
Nasdaq composite index was up 3.68 to 3,853.37.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were focusing on a host of retail companies that were
reporting earnings. Those included Dow component Home Depot, which
met Wall Street forecasts. The stock which had risen 6 percent
earlier this week, fell $4.50 to $55.
</P>
<P>
   Drugmakers, which have benefitted from many investors' turn
toward defensive stocks that can better withstand an economic
downturn, were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb, which made a legal maneuver Tuesday which
seems to temporarily preserve its patent protection on its
blockbuster cancer drug Taxol, rose $2.75 to $55.375. Generic
drugmaker Ivax, which was poised to start making a cheaper, generic
Taxol, plunged $9.375 to $33.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, the Federal Reserve said industrial
production rose 0.4 percent in July, in line with analysts'
expectations. The report contained little sign of inflation, which
should make investors more confident the central bank will leave
interest rates unchanged when it convenes next week.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 115.12 million
shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 0.93 to 513.55.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.89 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.33 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.54 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.54 percent.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Cops Blow Up Abandoned Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUESCA, Spain (AP) -- Spanish police used a robot Tuesday to blow
up a car that had been packed with 220 pounds of explosives and
abandoned on a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the vehicle may have been intended for use in a car
bomb attack. Police said they had no suspects, but have blamed the
Basque separatist group ETA for several car bombs. Last week, four
suspected ETA members died when explosives blew up in their car.
</P>
<P>
   Police sealed off a 12-mile stretch of highway near Huesca at
the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains before blowing up the Renault on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had received calls from motorists about an abandoned
car and decided to blow it up after they discovered it had stolen
license plates. An investigation wreckage determined the car had
been loaded with explosives, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ETA's armed drive for an independent homeland carved out of
parts of northern Spain and southern France has claimed nearly 800
lives since it began in 1968. ETA is the acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom in the Basque language.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Frees 3,586 Prisoners  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea freed 3,586 inmates from
prisons across the country Tuesday in a sweeping amnesty ordered by
President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   They included Chung Soo Il, 63, a North Korean spy who had posed
as a college professor. Chung was arrested in 1998 and sentenced to
12 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Those freed Tuesday were among 30,647 people who benefited from
the amnesty, which marked the anniversary of Korea's liberation
from Japan's 35-year colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 23,730 people, who were already out of prison after
serving time for minor offenses, had their civil rights reinstated,
which means they can run for election and vote again, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Kim Hyun-chul, 41-year-old son of former
President Kim Young-sam, who served six months in prison in 1996 on
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hong In-kil, an aide to the ex-president arrested on corruption
charges in 1997, was also freed Tuesday. He was serving a six-year
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Several human rights activists protested Hong's release,
engaging in a shoving match with Hong's followers outside the
prison north of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Activists complained the government was releasing corrupt
politicians while about 120 ''prisoners of conscience,'' mostly
student and labor activists convicted of violent protests, remained
in prison.

<HEADLINE> Russians Criticize Missionaries  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Orthodox Church criticized the Roman
Catholic Church on Tuesday for sending missionaries to Russia,
claiming they used promises of material wealth to tempt potential
converts, a news report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Bishops, the church's highest ruling body, said
non-Orthodox churches recruited believers from traditionally
Orthodox areas using ''destructive missionary activity,'' the
Interfax news agency quoted a church statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of Catholic proselytizing was included in a
resolution on Orthodox relations with other faiths. Orthodox
leaders frequently have criticized other churches for their
missionary work in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The document said Catholic and other foreign missionaries
recruit in Russia ''with the use of material wealth.'' It didn't
elaborate on the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic Church spokesman in Russia said Tuesday the
church disagrees with the Orthodox contention and denies recruiting
with promises of material well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not true that our attendance is increased at the expense
of the Orthodox Church,'' the priest, known only as Father Bagdan,
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a few cases when people come to Catholicism from
Orthodoxy, but it is very rare and you have to respect the decision
of the individual person.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution said the Russian Orthodox Church respects freedom
of worship for foreign churches in Russia, but only among ''those
groups which traditionally belong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has many religious minorities, including Catholics and
other Christian faiths, but only a few are characterized as
traditional under a 1997 Russian law on religious activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic church rejects the argument that ethnic Russians
have a ''traditional'' religion. ''If a person is not baptized, why
should we consider his national background?'' Bagdan asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution Tuesday called for forming ties between
individual Orthodox and Catholic congregations, rather than among
church leaders in Moscow and Rome, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   The two churches split in 1054 in the Great Schism. Current
talks between Orthodox and Catholic officials have focused on
resolving a dispute over churches in Western Ukraine that profess
loyalty to the Pope but practice an Orthodox liturgy. That dispute
dates to the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Bishops opened Sunday in Moscow's Christ the
Savior Cathedral, and was to consider key church business for the
new millennium throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   In a historic decision, the council Monday canonized Russia's
last czar Nicholas II and six members of his family as martyrs for
their death by a communist firing squad in 1918.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Vote Boycott Criticized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The opposition candidate for
Yugoslavia's presidency said Tuesday that the Montenegrin
government's decision to boycott the September vote plays into
hands of President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling parties in Montenegro -- the independence-minded
republic which makes up Yugoslavia together with Serbia -- have
cited recent constitutional changes which weaken the republic's
political clout as the reason for boycotting the Sept. 24 election.
</P>
<P>
   Vojislav Kostunica, believed to be Milosevic's main challenger
in the election, said that Montenegro's pro-Western ruling parties
have ''voted for Milosevic'' by refusing to take part in
parliamentary and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Running away from elections is certainly not a characteristic
of a democratic society,'' Kostunica was quoted by the Beta news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
   But a chief Milosevic ally accused the opposition of working to
break up Yugoslavia, and said the elections will be a referendum on
whether the country will remain ''free'' or be turned into a
colony.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are no ordinary elections,'' said Serbia's prime
minister, Mirko Marjanovic. ''History teaches us that our people
never backed down when faced with such a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That is why they will choose Slobodan Milosevic ... and elect
those who want to preserve Yugoslavia ... not those who want to
destroy it,'' Marjanovic added, according to the official Tanjug
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his allies have sought to portray the pro-Western
opposition and Montenegro's government as traitors serving NATO in
its bid to destroy Yugoslavia. Anti-Western sentiments in
Yugoslavia remain strong, following the 78-day NATO bombing last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic told the Pobijeda daily on
Tuesday that taking part in the elections would amount to ''giving
up state identity and sovereignty and giving legitimacy to efforts
by the Belgrade dictatorship to prolong its political survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's boycott call is expected to allow pro-Milosevic
parties to easily take control of the 50 seats Montenegro holds in
the Yugoslav parliament.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears that tensions between Montenegro and Milosevic
could lead to clashes between a strong police force controlled by
Djukanovic and units of the pro-Milosevic Yugoslav army stationed
in the republic.

<HEADLINE> New Track Coming From the Beatles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Soon making another bid for the charts: The
Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney announced Tuesday that he plans to
release a new dance track next week featuring outtakes from
original recording sessions by the Fab Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free Now,'' a club mix made by McCartney with the help of the
Welsh band Super Furry Animals, will be featured on the new CD
''The Liverpool Sound Collage.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney described the track as a ''manic Beatles single.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a new little piece of Beatles,'' he said. ''It's more
underground than what you usually hear from me, but I like to be
free enough to do this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The track mixes recordings of the Beatles chatting during studio
sessions between 1965 and 1969 with previously unreleased
guitarwork by the group.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney created ''The Liverpool Sound Collage'' to accompany
an exhibition at the Tate Liverpool gallery by artist Peter Blake.
It takes the form of an ambient soundtrack of life in the northern
city, featuring everything from interviews with local shoppers to
quotes from students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free Now'' will not be released as a commercial single. It
will be available to the public only in album form.

Assembly would allow the armed forces to retain their 38 seats in
the 700-member body until 2009. The full assembly is expected to
pass the measure Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid diluted his promise to put Vice President Megawati
Sukarnoputri in charge of day-to-day operations in the Cabinet,
saying she could only make decisions in consultation with him and
two senior ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Following an impeachment threat by legislators angered at the
disarray in his 10-month-old government, Wahid last week announced
he would surrender domestic administrative duties to his vice
president, who heads Indonesia's largest political party.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he told the assembly he would henceforth
concentrate on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how Wahid's reversal would be
greeted by lawmakers, who have proposed codifying the vice
president's new authority. Assembly members have severely
criticized the president's administrative style and the lack of
progress in reviving Indonesia's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the assembly effectively postponed consideration of
constitutional amendments until next year. These include proposals
to introduce Islamic law for Indonesia's Muslims and to allow
direct presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 Muslim protesters rallied outside the assembly
building Tuesday to demand the imposition of Muslim law.
</P>
<P>
   The full assembly seems virtually certain to approve a continued
role in politics for the military, which underpinned the 32-year
dictatorship of former president Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Accused of widespread human rights abuses, the army's top brass
had seen a steady decline in influence since the legislature last
year elected Wahid, the country's first freely chosen leader in
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators have justified the military's role by saying that
the 500,000-strong armed forces had a right to representation,
although it was not allowed to vote in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real setback for Indonesia's transformation to
democracy,'' said Smita Notosusanto, a political science professor
and analyst at the non-governmental Center for Electoral Reform.
''All members of the legislature have to be elected, not
appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators have said they are being railroaded by powerful
generals who threaten to foment trouble in strife-torn Aceh, Maluku
and West Papua provinces unless they are allowed to retain a
political role.

<HEADLINE> Court Starts Hearing Sharif Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- Deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif
began an appeal of his hijacking and terrorism conviction Tuesday,
saying Pakistan's military rulers had intimidated witnesses against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif was sentenced to two concurrent life terms on the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif was convicted in April by an anti-terrorist court for
preventing the landing of a passenger plane that was returning Army
Chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf to Pakistan from Sri Lanka as
Musharraf's soliders were conducting a coup Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was eventually allowed to land after the army took
control of the airport. When it landed there was barely seven
minutes of fuel remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's lawyer Azizullah Sheikh told the Sindh High Court on
Tuesday that there were glaring contradictions in the testimonies
of the three key witnesses against Sharif. He said that the
witnesses had been intimidated by the military.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal had been delayed for weeks while Sharif's lawyers
filed a motion to dismiss over legal jurisdiction -- an argument
they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's six co-defendants were acquitted in the original trial.
Sharif has also been disqualified from politics for 21 years and
last month was sentenced to 14 years in jail last month for tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   If he loses this appeal, Sharif can make a final appeal to the
Supreme Court. The prosecution also is appealing, demanding Sharif
be given the death penalty instead of life in prison.

<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Without explanation, China has unexpectedly
knocked 20 months off a pro-democracy campaigner's 10-year jail
term and released him, a human rights group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Wensheng, 32, was freed Aug. 9 from a prison in the
northwestern Chinese province of Gansu and has returned home to the
city of Yinchuan in the neighboring province of Ningxia, the
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong-based group said Liu was arrested in April 1992
and sentenced to 10 years for organizing the Social Democratic
Party of China, a dissident group opposed to the ruling Communist
Party's monopoly on power.
</P>
<P>
   Liu was not due for release until April 2002. Prison authorities
did not tell Liu why they were releasing him early, the center
said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Families Are Reunited  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A graying son knelt before his mother,
but she barely recognized him. Wailing brothers and sisters
clutched each other. After a half century of Cold War separation, a
wife held her husband's hand while he extolled the virtues of the
world's most isolated communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Tears streamed down cheeks and cries filled a cavernous
convention center in Seoul on Tuesday as 100 North Koreans embraced
South Korean relatives they hadn't seen for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   The live broadcast of the two-hour reunions opened a rare window
on the anguish and hopes of millions of Koreans who were separated
by the 1950-53 Korean War. Many people died without making contact
with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mother, please forgive me,'' said Li Chun Myong, 70, a college
professor in North Korea, taking off his shoes, kneeling on the
carpeted floor in front of her wheelchair and bowing deeply to his
mother, Choi In-chang. He buried his tear-streaked face in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Stricken with Alzheimer's disease, his 91-year-old mother seemed
to hardly recognize him and showed little emotion. Only once did
she say: ''My boy, I missed you so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Duk-man, 87, who has cancer, met her 65-year-old son, Ahn
Soon Hwan. They last saw each other during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The frail woman wiped tears from her son's face. She placed a
bouquet of red roses before him, put her wrinkled hand on his lap,
and said softly: ''Did you eat today? I must prepare some food for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions are one of the most emotional issues that have
defined the long-running standoff between the two Koreas, who have
made great strides toward reconciliation in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean visitors arrived in Seoul on a passenger jet
after a 50-minute flight from Pyongyang. The plane then picked up
100 South Koreans and ferried them to the North.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions in Seoul were televised live in South Korea and the
reunions in Pyongyang were aired with a slight delay.
</P>
<P>
   In a hotel dining room in Pyongyang, 56-year-old Kim Byung Kil
collapsed in his mother's lap. ''Mother, where have you been?'' he
cried. ''I am sorry,'' whispered 82-year-old Suh Sun-hwa.
</P>
<P>
   Suh, who lives in Seoul, lost her son in huge crowds of refugees
scrambling to cross a wrecked bridge near the North Korean capital
of Pyongyang during U.S. air raids at the start of the Korean War
in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Suh kept asking her son where he went after they were separated
and where he has been living. The rugged-looking son abruptly sat
up and declared in a raised voice: ''I have been living comfortably
under the benevolent care of great General Kim Jong Il.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapprochement between the communist North and the democratic
South accelerated after their leaders held a summit in June and
pledged to work toward eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Events like the family reunions -- the first since 1985 -- are
likely to help dissipate some of the animosity that has flourished
since the war. Both sides said more reunions would follow those
held this week.
</P>
<P>
   Many aging family members have only a few years left to see
relatives. There is no mail, telephone or other direct means of
communication between private citizens in the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   ''You must have blamed me a lot. But I have never stopped
thinking about you,'' Ryu Yol, 82, North Korea's best-known
linguist, told his daughter. Wiping her father's tears and holding
his hands, Yoo In-ja, 59, said: ''I don't blame you for anything.
.... All I want is for you to live long enough so that we can meet
again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mother, be calm. Your son is here,'' a 68-year-old man told
his 95-year-old mother, who was so overcome with emotion that a
nurse rushed to take her blood pressure. A son communicated by
writing messages to his 91-year-old father, who could not speak.
</P>
<P>
   The reunions revealed the divide deepened by living in two
sharply different regimes.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean critics said loyalty to the communist system
appeared to be the most important criterion for the North in
selecting 100 family members for reunions. The South chose its 100
finalists by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the North Koreans visiting Seoul wore pins with the
image of their revered late leader, Kim Il Sung, who for decades
had been vilified in the South. Kim's son, Kim Jong Il, now rules
the North with the help of a personality cult.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I have this emotional reunion, I cannot help thinking about
the generosity of our Great Leader Comrade Kim Jong Il,'' said Li
Bok Yon, 73, as his two South Korean sons listened awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the war, Li told his wife, Lee Choon-ja, to
take their two sons -- one and four at the time -- to his hometown.
Li said he would follow soon, once he got a bicycle. Li instead
joined the North Korean army and married in the North. He has five
more children.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Lee, now 70, never remarried and raised her two
children in the democratic South.
</P>
<P>
   ''What made you take so long to buy a bicycle?'' she asked her
husband.

<HEADLINE> Many Homeless Year After Turk Quake  </HEADLINE>
By LOUIS MEIXLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   IZMIT, Turkey (AP) -- It has been a year since Ayse Karatas
grabbed her 3-year-old granddaughter, wrenched open a window and
jumped out of her apartment building to escape a shattering
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Since surviving the quake, Karatas and her family have been
living in a tent donated by the U.S. government and using a nearby
garden hose to fill jugs with water for drinking and washing.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some 26,000 survivors of the Aug. 17, 1999, quake that
devastated Turkey's industrial heartland are living in tent cities.
An additional 150,000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes
that are oppressively hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing,'' said Karatas, as she sat outside her green
tent sucking on an ice cube in the stifling heat. ''The state
doesn't care about us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude
earthquake destroyed poorly built apartment houses, crushing some
17,000 people as they slept. The quake virtually leveled parts of
Izmit, 60 miles east of Istanbul, and other towns in western
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But anger is fading toward a government that at first appeared
ineffective and slow to react. People no longer question whether
the state is still there to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of rescue efforts led by the military, the most
respected Turkish institution, is dissipating and the Turkish press
rarely mentions the thousands of people like Karatas, the wife of a
retired baker, who are too poor to find their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad, but it seems that they are an afterthought,'' said
Alan Makovsky, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Turkish response to the disaster was so
disorganized that foreign rescue teams had to ask civilians for
advice on where to go. But Turks feel their government has handled
the post-quake cleanup well.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people in tent cities has fallen from some 120,000
after the quake to 26,000 today and the government expects that
number to decline sharply in the coming months. The cash-strapped
state gives some 56,000 families $155 a month in rent subsidies and
has provided free meals to some 195,000 survivors for most of the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   When a second, much smaller quake struck in November, the
government and the military reacted quickly. Relief teams were
dispatched and, although almost 1,000 people died in that quake,
the rescue efforts appeared to be well coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to be a statement that the government has learned
its lesson,'' Makovsky said. ''I think that the government has
recouped its honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also received a boost when the European Union in
December agreed to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership,
bringing the country one step closer to its long cherished goal of
integration with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The government has taken extensive measures to prepare for a new
quake, which seismologists warn could happen at any time.
</P>
<P>
   In Izmit, the hard-hit town where Karatas lives, mobile rescue
teams are prepared for deployment within four hours of a disaster.
A quake coordination headquarters has been built in a field, far
from any tall buildings. Government officials have walkie-talkies
in their offices so that they can be reached if phone lines are
cut.
</P>
<P>
   For new buildings, inspections and insurance will be required,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready,'' says Muhammet Uygun, deputy disaster area
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   But that news is of little help to Karatas. Although the state
gives rent credits to people whose apartments were destroyed,
Karatas had no lease and was unable to prove that she had been
renting an apartment in the quake zone.
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband receives a pension of $155 a month, rents
have skyrocketed since the earthquake, which damaged more than
100,000 homes in her home province of Kocaeli alone. A small
apartment would cost the family's entire monthly income.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state doesn't care about us,'' Karatas said as her eyes
turned red and swelled with tears. ''They would rather we die.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an anger that newly confident officials dismiss with
disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our citizens are a bit ungrateful,'' Uygun said. ''They always
want something else no matter what you give them.''

<HEADLINE> Guidelines Changed for Giving CPR  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medical experts say people giving emergency
CPR should skip taking the pulse of heart attack victims -- since
they often get that wrong anyway. They recommend chest compressions
to clear an unconscious choking victim's airway.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were included in a new set of cardiopulmonary
resuscitation guidelines announced Tuesday by the American Heart
Association inan effort to speed help for heart attack victims by
streamlining emergency procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are lifesaving measures and we wanted them to reflect
the most up-to-date science,'' said Dr. Rose Marie Robertson of
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   She said the new procedures, the first change in AHA guidelines
since 1992, were developed in 18 months of international scientific
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines drop the requirement that the layperson
providing emergency CPR check for a pulse, said Mary Fran Hazinski,
also of Vanderbilt, in Nashville, Tenn. She said studies found that
some 35 percent of the time people were wrong about whether the
victim had a pulse. The result could be not giving aid to someone
who needs it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that it is very difficult for the layperson to
assess whether a patient has a pulse within the first few seconds''
of an emergency, said Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people assisting victims are urged to check for other
signs of circulation such as breathing, coughing or movement when
deciding whether to perform CPR.
</P>
<P>
   To treat an unconscious adult choking victim, rescuers who are
not medical professionals can begin standard CPR with chest
compressions under the new guidelines, rather than using abdominal
thrusts or blind finger sweeps in the mouth to clear the airway.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is evidence that chest compression in CPR creates enough
pressure in an unconscious person to eject a foreign body from the
airway,'' explained Dr. Vinay Nadkarni of the Alfred I. DuPont
Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The use of abdominal thrusts -- better known as the Heimlich
maneuver -- will still be taught for use on conscious victims.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes to the guidelines included:
</P>
<P>
   --Lay rescuers giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation should
provide 15 chest compressions alternating with two rescue breaths.
The old guidelines had differing ratios of breaths and compressions
depending on the number of persons assisting in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   --In giving CPR to an infant, the two-thumb method with the hands
encircling the chest is much more effective than the previously
suggested two-finger method.
</P>
<P>
   --Use of new clot-busting drugs is recommended once professional
medical care is available, including recommendations for which
drugs to use. These drugs were not widely available when the
guidelines were last updated.
</P>
<P>
   --Setting a goal of cardiac defibrillation within five minutes
for persons not in a hospital and within three minutes for victims
in a hospital. The old guideline was merely early defibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the association is pressing a campaign to get
automatic heart defibrillators installed in sports stadiums,
airports and other public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the heart begins fibrillating -- beating randomly --
and needs an electrical shock to restore normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   These machines can automatically assess whether a victim's heart
needs to be shocked and provide that shock if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attack survival chances fall by 7 percent to 10 percent
for every minute between collapse and defibrillation, Hazinski
said, so having these machines widely available can save many
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, she said, as a national average only 5 percent of the
victims of sudden cardiac arrest survive, but rates vary widely
from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson had high praise for places that have pioneered in
providing defibrillators, singling out Chicago's O'Hare Airport
where, she said, the machines are never more than one minute away.
</P>
<P>
   One of the machines was demonstrated during the briefing, with
its electrical pads attached to a test dummy. The machine checked
for a heart rhythm and, finding none, recommended that the victim
be shocked. That is done simply by stepping back and pressing a
button on the machine.
</P>
<P>
   It then rechecks to see if the heart has started to beat or
another attempt is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Stapleton of the State University of New York at Stony
Brook said the new guidelines will be taught to people taking the
CPR courses designed by AHA as well as people getting a refresher
course. The changes cut the time needed for such a course from 3&AMP;frac12;
to 4 hours down to 2 hours, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostages May Meet Gadhafi  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Libya, which is paying millions of
dollars to free nine Westerners held hostage by Muslim rebels for
four months, wants the captives to meet with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi on their release.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the nine from remote Jolo island had been
expected on Wednesday, but ''minor hitches'' forced a delay until
at least Thursday, Philippine negotiator Roberto Mananquil said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A chartered plane from Libya was waiting in Manila to pick up
the hostages, who were part of a group of 21 people kidnapped in
April from Malaysia's Sipadan diving resort by Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Planes chartered by Libya were ferrying officials and scores of
journalists from Lebanon and South Africa to Tripoli, where the
hostages were to be flown after their release to meet with Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Former Libyan Ambassador Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a member of the
Philippine negotiating team, denied reports that as much as $25
million in cash was going to the Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Azzarouq insisted, the money will fund development
projects. ''We are sticking to our offer of livelihood projects,''
he said. ''We're offering projects that would benefit the community
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Libya has mediated between Muslim guerrillas and the
Philippine government and helped build schools and mosques in the
impoverished southern Philippines, home to the heavily Roman
Catholic country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   Libya also has been accused of training rebels from the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, which has been fighting for years for an
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine negotiators have not announced how much Libya is
paying for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf has demanded $1 million for each Westerner: two South
Africans, three French citizens -- including one with a Lebanese
background -- two Germans and two Finns.
</P>
<P>
   The nine were among 21 people kidnapped April 23 from the
Sipadan diving resort. Their freedom would leave three Malaysians
and two Filipinos in captivity from the Sipadan group.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Abu Sayyaf, a group of several hundred heavily armed
rebels, is holding 29 hostages, including three French journalists
and a dozen Christian evangelists who came to the rebels' camp to
pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about $5.5 million has been paid for the release of six
Malaysians and one ailing German woman from among the Sipadan
hostages, and a German journalist and two Filipino TV journalists
who were kidnapped later, military officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Tharwat Moarbes, mother of Lebanese-French hostage Marie
Moarbes, said thoughts of her daughter's expected release kept her
awake Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been waiting for four months to see Marie again. I am
very happy that she will be released,'' she told Lebanon's
state-run television just before boarding a plane to Libya.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower Tuesday, as investors sold
off blue chips after three straight winning sessions. Technology
issues slipped.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 75.45 to 11,100.69, after a 148-point
surge on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.57 to 1,486.99. The
Nasdaq composite index was down 3.24 to 3,846.45.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformers Protect Free Press  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- In a daring move after an order from Iran's
supreme leader to drop a debate on press freedoms, reformist
lawmakers presented a bill Tuesday that aims to block the hard-line
judiciary from closing reformist newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators submitted an ''extremely urgent'' motion to the
parliament, or Majlis, seeking a debate on whether it was legal to
close newspapers under the Security Measures Law, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted a lawmaker as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several courts have closed the dailies on the basis of this
law ... and clarification in this case would remove many
ambiguities, including those involving the press,'' IRNA quoted
legislator Gholam Heidar Ebrahimbai Salami as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Salami said speaker Mahdi Karrubi refused to acknowledge receipt
of the bill, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The reformist-dominated parliament vowed top pursue reforms in a
letter Sunday addressed to the nation and signed by 161 members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reforms are not the monopoly of anybody. It is a national
demand,'' Abbas Abdi, a leading reformist journalist, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''And reforms are meaningless without press freedoms. Reformists
should employ a new method to deal with the illegal closure of
newspapers by the judiciary in order to fulfill their promises,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers were to discuss a bill last Sunday to lift
restrictions imposed on the press by their hard-line predecessors.
But supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei intervened and instructed
the deputies not to amend the press law, causing scuffles, shouts
and a fight in open session.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners suffered their worst political defeat in February
legislative elections, when they lost control of the house for the
first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hard-liners' last undertakings in the previous
session was to push through a press law that has been the basis for
a ban on 25 publications -- all but one of them pro-reform
newspapers -- and the arrest of two dozen writers.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners have lost considerable power since President
Mohammad Khatami, a reformist, was elected in 1997. But they retain
control of the judiciary, the military and the broadcast network.
They are backed by Khamenei, who has the last say on all matters.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians May Not Proclaim State  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinians dropped new hints that Yasser
Arafat may not proclaim a state Sept. 13, even as the Palestinian
leader continued his world tour Tuesday with stops in the Far East
to gauge support for such a unilateral move.
</P>
<P>
   Taking no chances, Israel's top diplomats, including Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Shimon Peres, stayed on Arafat's trail to try to
blunt his message.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, Peres told Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan that
peace talks may break down if Arafat declares Palestinian
independence on Sept. 13, the deadline for an Israeli-Palestinian
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's aides have said a peace deal remains his preferred
choice. Talk about proclaiming independence without Israel's
blessing appears to be mainly an attempt to create leverage in
negotiations. A disjointed state in parts of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip would not be viable, even if recognized by some countries.
</P>
<P>
   The PLO Central Council, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
129-member policy-making body, is to convene Sept. 8 or 9 in Gaza
City to discuss a date for independence. In July, the council told
Palestinians to prepare for independence by Sept. 13, but did not
require Arafat to issue a proclamation on that date.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming meeting, council members ''will evaluate the
situation ... and decide what is suitable for the Palestinians,''
said Palestinian peace negotiator Ahmed Qureia, who is close to
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia, the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, made no
reference to the Sept. 13 date, saying only that ''I don't imagine
that we will pass this year without a declaration of state which we
hope will deserve the recognition of all the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arafat's three-week diplomatic offensive -- he has visited 18
countries on three continents -- Arafat failed to win broad backing
for a unilateral declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Most European Union countries have advised the Palestinian
leader not to do anything to endanger negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, who spoke by phone with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak about Mideast peacemaking on
Tuesday, has also counseled Arafat not to make a unilateral
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has picked up some support in the Far East. In Beijing,
he was told Monday that China would support any Palestinian
decision, and in a Tuesday stopover in Kuala Lumpur he was assured
that Malaysia would recognize a state declared Sept. 13. The next
stops on his itinerary are Japan and Indonesia, where Peres has
already briefed leaders on the Israeli position.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid said Tuesday that the
deadlock over Jerusalem, which led to the breakdown of the Mideast
summit at Camp David, could be resolved by rethinking the concept
of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Israel should be given administrative sovereignty, while a
seven-member committee with representatives from Egypt, Jordan,
Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the United Nations and the Palestinians
would have political sovereignty, Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unlikely the proposal will be considered because
both Israel and the Palestinians are reluctant to share control
over the city with others.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli peace negotiator Shlomo Ben-Ami, who returned to Israel
on Tuesday after a tour of European capitals, said Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators are now trying to lay the groundwork for a
second summit.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators first will have to put together a U.S.-backed
''pre-agreement'' that will include understandings reached in the
previous two-week round of talks at Camp David, Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
   If everything falls into place, a summit can be held in
September, the negotiator said, adding that no date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Pope Draws 600,000 Young People  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II gazed out happily Tuesday
at a good part of the future of his church -- hundreds of thousands
of exuberant young people who poured into Rome for six days of
prayerful pep talk and camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   A shower of white flower petals tossed by his young fans rained
down on the ''popemobile'' as John Paul was driven down Rome's
cobblestone boulevards to St. John's Lateran Basilica as World
Youth Day events officially began.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of appreciation, the pope stood on the steps
outside the basilica to embrace the two young Italians who greeted
him. Usually, the pope stays seated while participants at papal
ceremonies kneel before him to kiss his ring.
</P>
<P>
   So many young pilgrims turned up for the events this week that
they all couldn't fit into St. Peter's Square, forcing the Vatican
to stage two welcoming ceremonies, the first with some 300,000
pilgrims in front of St. John's Basilica. Volunteers hosed down
another 300,000 youths who waited for hours in the broiling
afternoon sun at the Vatican for the second ceremony, which began
in early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old pope also seemed to feel the heat, asking an
aide to take off the colored stole around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding his young listeners that this week's gatherings come
at ''the start of a new century and a new millennium,'' he told
them to ''rejuvenate your faith and bear witness to it without
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crowd started shouting joyfully ''Viva il papa!'' and
even added a few soccer cheers, the pope, looking delighted,
quipped: ''I'm already 80 years old.'' When the young people
laughed, John Paul said: ''The young people want him (the pope)
young. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul views young people as key instruments to reach his
goal of shoring up sometimes flagging faith in the Roman Catholic
church's third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   World Youth Days, a tradition he began 15 years ago, have drawn
huge crowds around the world, including the biggest ever of his
papacy, a turnout of 4 million in the Philippines in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican put the number of young pilgrims in Rome this week
at more than 600,000 and has said at least another 600,000 were on
their way for Saturday, when the pope holds a late night vigil
session of prayer under the stars on the fields of a Rome
university campus.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, ailing health, with symptoms of Parkinson's
disease such as slurred speech and shuffling steps, has robbed John
Paul of much of the physical vitality once so present in his
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But while he often cuts short greetings to adult pilgrims, he
still sometimes lingers to banter with young crowds. Tuesday's
appearance ran overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always like meeting with young people,'' the pope said
during a pilgrimage to Sicily a few years ago. ''I don't know why,
but I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone in Tuesday's crowd held up a white sheet with a
whimsical drawing of John Paul and the words: ''The pope is young
like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Rome's 3 million people fled the city for summer
vacation, but the city's ambulance services were kept busy with
calls for first aid from pilgrims, the ANSA news agency reported,
citing sprained limbs and scrapes from falls as well as
heat-related distress.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 police, some of them reportedly dressed as pilgrims,
handled security.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Groups Reject U.S. Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN PABLO TORO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian human rights groups have
rejected offers to take part in a U.S.-financed plan to fight drug
production, saying it envisions spending too much on the military
and not enough on social problems.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of rights groups turned down U.S. appeals to support
President Andres Pastrana's ''Plan Colombia,'' which is being
partially funded with $1.3 billion in aid from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said last week
that the anti-drug plan would rely on Colombian human rights and
other non-governmental organizations for advice on how to spend
millions in aid money.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives from 37 human rights and other
non-governmental organizations on Friday signed a statement in
which they rejected Pastrana's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have ethical and political difficulties receiving aid from
this program,'' said Fernan Gonzalez, director of the Jesuit-run
Center for Investigations and Popular Education. ''Under these
conditions, we would not accept the resources the program will
provide.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's statement said the aid ''will not resolve Colombia's
drug problems'' because it assumes Colombia's ''national security
is based exclusively on a strategy to fight drugs and not on this
country's social and armed conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizations faulted Plan Colombia because its total
projected $7.5 billion-budget earmarks a little less than $2
billion for social and economic development in areas where the
economy depends on cocaine production -- not enough, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came a week after about 100 elite U.S. troops
arrived in Colombia as part of the plan and began training an
anti-narcotics battalion near guerrilla territory.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the U.S. funds will go toward providing 60 combat
helicopters, which are to be used to ferry U.S.-trained troops into
drug-producing areas where leftist rebels and right-wing
paramilitary groups are active. The troops are to seize the areas
and allow planes to destroy drug crops by aerial spraying without
being shot down.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is also dedicating some $51 million to
strengthening Colombia's democracy and improve human rights, $13
million to improving Colombia's judicial system and $3 million to
further the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   European countries and international institutions are also
pledging to add more money for the plan, though the amount remains
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Rojas, director of the Consortium for Human Rights and the
Displaced, said Plan Colombia jeopardizes hopes that the Colombian
government and leftist guerrilla groups will reach an accord to end
a 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   He said his organization would reject any money offered by
Washington as part of the plan.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 73; Nasdaq Rises 33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday, as investors sold
blue chips after three straight winning sessions and bought some
beaten down technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 73.16 to 11,103.62, after a 148-point
surge on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 0.21 to 1,491.35. The
Nasdaq composite index was up 33.36 to 3,883.05.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said profit-taking was largely responsible for Dow's
drop. The Dow had risen in recent days amid optimism that the
Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's profit-taking on the Dow and a resurgence in the tech
sector due to relative opportunities in semiconductors, which have
been devastated in the past month,'' said Barry Hyman, senior
equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, which would gain from a stable interest rate
environment, helped pull the market down.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Home Depot, which met Wall Street forecasts, fell
$5.50 to $54.25 after a big run-up the past two weeks. Some
analysts were concerned the retailer did not beat their estimates.
</P>

second-quarter operating profit dropped 90 percent due to lower
sales and price cuts.

<P>
   Drugmakers, which have benefitted from many investors' turn
toward defensive stocks that can better withstand an economic
downturn, were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb, which made a legal maneuver Tuesday that
seems to temporarily preserve its patent protection on its
blockbuster cancer drug Taxol, rose $3 to $53. Generic drugmaker
Ivax, which was poised to start making a cheaper, generic Taxol,
plunged $13.688 to $29.
</P>
<P>
   Among technology stocks, JDS Uniphase fell $1.75 to $118.50 and
Radio Shack dropped $3.50 to $65.50.
</P>
<P>
   But semiconductor and chip issues pushed the Nasdaq higher, led
by Applied Material, up $3.75 to $78.934 and Texas Instruments, up
$2.375 to $66.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, the Federal Reserve said industrial

<HEADLINE> U.N. Report: Sanctions Ineffective  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Economic sanctions aimed at changing government
policy are usually ineffective and often illegal under
international law, according to a U.N.-commissioned report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theory behind economic sanctions is that economic pressure
on civilians will translate into pressure on the government for
change. This theory is bankrupt both legally and practically,''
said the report by Belgian law professor Marc Bossuyt.
</P>
<P>
   The worst case is Iraq, where 10 years of U.N. sanctions driven
by the United States and Great Britain has led to ''a humanitarian
disaster comparable to the worst catastrophes of the past
decades,'' Bossuyt said in his report for the U.N. Subcommission on
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bossuyt said the Security Council's decision to continue
sanctions while knowing they caused an untold number of Iraqis to
die was ''unequivocally illegal'' under international humanitarian
law.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year U.S. trade blockade on Cuba, which caused its people
to suffer, was also illegal on humanitarian grounds, Bossuyt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said sanctions should carry a time limit to achieve an aim,
and should not be targeted at civilians. Alternatives include
freezing the foreign assets of the ruling elite, and bans on
imports of luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   Bossuyt's report comes amid a growing movement to end the
sanctions in Iraq on moral grounds. Varied calls to end the
sanctions have come from the Vatican, U.S. peace activists,
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, former weapons inspector Scott
Ritter, and two former U.N. humanitarian coordinators, Denis
Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, who resigned in protest of the
sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the current head of U.N. humanitarian programs in
Iraq, Benon Sevan, said an oil-for-food program that allows Iraq to
sell limited amounts of oil for some humanitarian goods and to fund
Gulf War reparations and U.N. operations can never be a substitute
for normal economic activity in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more critical.
</P>
<P>
   In the May/June 1999 issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, American
political scientists John Mueller and Karl Mueller said economic
sanctions in Iraq, which they call the true ''weapons of mass
destruction,'' are far more deadly than the nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons that the sanctions are aimed at eradicating.
</P>
<P>
   Strict trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait are being kept in place until U.N. inspectors certify that
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Aid distribution under the oil-for-food program has been plagued
by delays as members of the Security Council, particularly the
United States, raise questions about whether items ranging from
sprinkler parts to agricultural chemicals could have military uses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some medicines and basic equipment such as
chlorinators to purify drinking water are forbidden by the
sanctions. Bad water has created an epidemic of dysentery and
infectious diseases, resulting in thousands of child deaths.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF said the number of child deaths has doubled since the
sanctions.

   DENVER (AP) -- Rock star and gun enthusiast Ted Nugent suggests
in his new book that students could have stopped last year's
Columbine High massacre by rushing one of the two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, a director of the National Rifle Association, also wrote

   Nugent, 51, autographed copies of his book, ''Gods, Guns and
Rock N' Roll,'' Monday at a bookstore as two police officers stood

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Taliban jet fighters dropped several
bombs Tuesday in the northern rebel-controlled Takhar province,
killing seven people, an opposition spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs hit the center of Taloqan, the capital of Takhar,
destroying houses and killing residents who had returned to their
homes believing the fighting had moved away from the city, said
opposition commander Saeed Hussain Anwari.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan's Taliban, who rule more than 90 percent of
Afghanistan, have been battling for several weeks to push the
opposition out of its stronghold in the northern province. The
intense fighting had forced tens of thousands of civilians to flee
the area.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days the fighting on the outskirts of Taloqan had
subsided, encouraging some people to return, said Anwari.
</P>
<P>
   No comment was immediately available from the Taliban, who has
wrested control of four key towns in Takhar province in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are battling the opposition forces, comprised of
religious and ethnic minorities, for control of the entire country.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Churns Toward Baja  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tropical Storm Ileana churned past the
southern tip of the Baja California peninsula Tuesday and headed
out to sea, while tropical storm Beryl moved inland, dumping rain
on Texas and northern Mexico as it weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Ileana doused the Baja resort towns of Los Cabos with rain, but
''nothing too severe,'' said Randy Lehr, the American manager of
the Hacienda Beach Resort in Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like we got lucky, and the storm passed by to the
south,'' Lehr said in a telephone interview. Guests at his hotel
were warned to stay out of the ocean, and some whiled away the time
playing pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government declared a hurricane warning for Los
Cabos and areas slightly north, as the storm's center whirled past
about 50 miles south of the peninsula.

   ''There hasn't been any damage so far, and the communications
systems are working fine,'' Baja California state spokesman Juan
Antonio Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   Ileana, currently with winds of 70 mph, may strengthen to reach
hurricane status, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense authorities in Los Cabos met to monitor the storm
as it brushed by, moving west at about 12 mph. They had previously
reported some outages in local telephone service due to the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Beryl lumbered ashore on Mexico's
northeast coast Tuesday, swirling into land over a sparsely
populated stretch of coast about 110 miles south of the border
cities of Brownsville, Texas, and Matamoros in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The storm quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it
dropped rain over northern Mexico, and the Mexican government
discontinued most storm warnings for coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane center reported Beryl could cause rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, but predicted the system would probably dissipate by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl's winds had fallen to about 35 mph, and the weakening
system was moving roughly west at about 9 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were evacuated from two low-lying fishing villages in
the Gulf coast state of Tamaulipas and taken to improvised shelters
at schools and a sports complex, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service canceled hurricane and tropical
storm warnings for South Texas, where some heavy showers were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in Texas said they hoped the thunderstorms would weaken
the chokehold of a lingering drought. Showers were to continue
throughout the day Tuesday and bring several inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The storms also promised to refill dwindling reservoirs along
the Rio Grande, National Weather Service forecaster Tim Speece
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to go out on a limb and say it'll end the
drought, period,'' Speece said. ''But it'll definitely have an
effect.''

<HEADLINE> Oldest in German Parliament Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Fred Gebhardt, Germany's oldest member
of parliament, who left the Social Democrats to protest their move
to the center and joined the former East German communist party,
has died at 72.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of Democratic Socialism's branch in Hesse state said
Tuesday that Gebhardt had died the previous night after a long
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt left the Social Democrats, the party of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, in 1998 after 52 years in protest against the
left-wing party's shift toward the center, which he termed a change
in course ''from an employees' to a neo-liberal business party.''
</P>
<P>
   He had also served as Hesse's Social Democratic chairman, based
in Frankfurt, where he headed an adult education school.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, he was elected to the Bundestag, or lower
house, for the former communists and gave the speech opening
parliament, traditionally delivered by the oldest legislator. He
also served on the human rights committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt is survived by two daughters. Funeral plans were not
immediately announced.

<HEADLINE> Brothel Is Torched in Tel Aviv  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA BLIJDENSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP)-- Four prostitutes died Tuesday when a Tel Aviv
brothel was torched, the latest attack in what police suspect is
the work of a serial arsonist.
</P>
<P>
   The four unidentified women apparently tried to escape from the
apartment that served as a brothel but found the front door locked,
Tel Aviv police said. The women inside a second brothel also set
ablaze Tuesday managed to escape without harm.
</P>
<P>
   The fires Tuesday follow similar attacks on two other brothels
in the Tel Aviv area last week, said police commander Shlomo
Aharonishky.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pursuing a number of courses of inquiry, both the
possibility of a dispute between operators of these businesses and
also the possibility that extremist ultra-Orthodox Jews are
responsible,'' Aharonishky told Israel Channel Two news. ''Every
possibility is being examined.''
</P>
<P>
   A gang of ultra-Orthodox Jews was behind a wave of arson attacks
on erotica shops in Jerusalem in the 1970s, and in the mid-1980s,
another gang set fire to billboards they consider offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's attack, one woman was found in the hallway, another
in the bathroom and two others died while hiding in a bedroom
closet. The women died of smoke inhalation and burns, the police
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The sex trade in Israel has boomed in recent years as thousands
of women have flooded into the country, many lured from the former
Soviet Union with false job promises as waitresses or dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Israel they are locked up in brothels, where they are
forced to work as prostitutes. Tel Aviv has an estimated 100-150
brothels known to police, most of which are located in private
apartments, Aharonishky said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian-based crime gangs have used the influx of immigrants as
a cover for sneaking in an estimated 10,000 prostitutes over the
past decade.

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Implants forv Deaf Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A cost-benefit analysis of cochlear implants in
deaf children indicates they are well worth the $40,000 expense.
</P>
<P>
   The small, snail-shaped electrical devices are surgically
implanted in the cochlea, the inner-ear organ that contains nerve
endings needed for hearing. While the implants do not restore
normal hearing, they bypass defective parts of the ear and send
auditory signals to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   About 14,000 such operations have been performed nationwide
since the implants became available a decade ago, nearly half of
them in people under 21, according to the Deafness Research
Foundation, which helped fund the study.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery accompanied by therapy to help patients learn to use the
devices in conjunction with lip-reading costs about $40,000, but
some insurance companies have been reluctant to pay because of a
lack of data on the benefits, said Elizabeth Foster, director of
the foundation's National Campaign for Hearing Health.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time we actually have information that shows
that there's a cost savings,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   The Johns Hopkins University study, published in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association, is based on surveys of
78 parents who were asked to assess the benefits to their deaf
children.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Dr. Andre Cheng, estimated that the
benefits to society amount to a lifetime savings of $53,198 per
child. The estimate is based on the costs of the procedure,
including any complications, with savings that included less
special education for children with the implants.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also took into account parents' needing less
time off work to take their children to and from special classes,
and estimated that children with implants would have better future
earnings because they would be eligible for better jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cochlear implant is extremely cost-effective, generating
important health benefits in children at reasonable direct costs
and providing a net savings to society,'' the researchers wrote.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Quality Sleep Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Here's some news that could keep middle-aged men
awake nights: A lack of quality sleep may contribute to love
handles and double chins.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Chicago found what appears to
be a link between middle-age spread and men's sleep patterns as
they get older.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the quality of men's sleep decreases with age
along with the body's production of growth hormone. The drop in
growth hormone, in turn, is thought to lead to flab.
</P>
<P>
   Now the researchers are working to see if new types of sleeping
pills or hormone injections can slow signs of aging.
</P>
<P>
   ''We actually know that if we increase deep sleep, we can
increase growth hormone,'' said Eve Van Cauter, a professor of
medicine who led the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study of beauty sleep was limited to healthy men, and it is
not clear whether the findings apply to women.
</P>
<P>
   Van Cauter and her team looked at sleep studies conducted on 149
men from 1985 to 1999. They found that by the time men reach age
45, they have nearly lost the ability to fall into deep sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Men produce growth hormone primarily during that kind of sleep.
In studies of the elderly, growth hormone deficiency has been
connected to obesity and the loss of muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   The men involved in the sleep studies were of normal weight and
ranged in age from 16 to 83. Researchers found that as the men
moved into mid-life, from ages 35 to 50, their total amount of
sleep remained fairly constant.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of deep, or slow-wave, sleep, however, decreased from
nearly 20 percent of a normal night's sleep for men 25 or younger
to less than 5 percent for those over 35. Growth hormone secretion
declined by nearly 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that after age 50, men's total amount of
sleep declined by about 27 minutes a decade. They awoke more
frequently during the night and stayed awake longer.
</P>
<P>
   REM sleep, associated with dreaming, also declined after age 50
to about 50 percent of a young man's level.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Marc R. Blackman of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore said researchers
do not know for certain whether sleep quality influences the
production of hormones or if the change in hormone levels itself is
responsible for changes in sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Cauter said it is clear that more deep sleep produces
more growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   The research could be used to examine whether growth hormone
injections could slow signs of aging in men during early mid-life,
she said. Currently, such therapy is used mostly for men 65 or
older.

<HEADLINE> Study Warns of Early Birth Risks  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Babies born even just a few weeks prematurely run
a significantly higher risk of death in their first year,
suggesting that inducing early labor is more dangerous than many
obstetricians might think, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born before
37 weeks are considered premature. The risks faced by very
premature babies -- those born before 32 weeks -- are
well-documented.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past decade, doctors have begun using drugs more
and more to induce labor a few weeks early for reasons of
convenience rather than the health of the mother or child.
</P>
<P>
   The new study on the risks of slightly premature births was
published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association. It was led by Dr. Michael Kramer of McGill University
in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an examination of 4.5 million births in the United
States and Canada in the 1990s, the researchers found that compared
with U.S. babies born full-term in 1995, those born at 32 weeks to
33 weeks were about six times more likely to die within their first
year. Babies born closer to term but still early -- at 34 through 36
weeks -- were nearly three times more likely to die than full-term
infants.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of death included infection, breathing problems,
various birth defects and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Obstetricians ''may perceive the induction as risk-free and
therefore not adequately balance the risks and benefits,'' Kramer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the estimated 250,000 U.S. infants delivered prematurely
each year are born after the 32nd week. With medical advances in
the past decade, about 98 percent of these slightly premature
babies survive.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dan Polk, a neonatologist at Children's Memorial Hospital in
Chicago, said his wife's obstetrician wanted to induce labor early
because he feared she would need a Caesarean section and he wanted
to avoid having to come to the hospital at night to perform the
emergency surgery. Ultimately, she underwent a C-section on her due
date.
</P>
<P>
   Though that doctor wanted to induce labor at 38 weeks -- early
but not technically prematurely -- it is not uncommon for others to
induce labor even earlier -- at 35 or 36 weeks, for example -- for
the convenience of the mother or the doctor, Polk said.
</P>
<P>
   Polk said that the advent of medical treatment for inadequately
functioning lungs -- a common complication in premature infants --
has created the misperception that labor can be induced early with
few risks.
</P>
<P>
   The lung treatment ''doesn't do anything for their kidneys,
their hearts or skin, all of which have problems involved in
preterm births,'' Polk said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer L. Howse, president of the March of Dimes, said the
study shows that ''every day of development during pregnancy is
precious to the health of an unborn baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The study ''gives even greater urgency to our efforts to find
ways to prevent preterm birth from occurring,'' Howse said.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyz Military Pushes Back Rebels  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) -- After five days of fierce fighting in
the mountains along the border with Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan's troops
pushed Islamic rebels out of the country Tuesday, the presidential
press service said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said eight German mountaineers who had been taken
hostage by the rebels were released Tuesday and taken to the
regional center of Batken. No further details were immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged area where the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan meet has been the scene of frequent fighting between
soldiers and rebels who want to carve out an Islamic state. The
latest fighting began Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Kyrgyz artillery shelled about 50 militants
along the border and the government said 600 more rebels were
moving in to support the small band.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday evening, the presidential press service said most
of the rebels had been eliminated and the rest had entered
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyz Security Council Secretary Bolot Dzhanuzakov said earlier
Tuesday that about 40 militants had been killed since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight soldiers from Uzbekistan have been killed fighting the
rebels, the Uzbek Defense Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign regional leaders consider the incursion a serious
threat, Uzbek President Islam Karimov said Tuesday he will not
attend a summit with leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent
States in Ukraine this month because of the fighting, a
presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest fighting took place in the Turo Pass, about three
miles from Kyrgyzstan's border with Tajikistan, where mountains
reach about 13,000 feet above sea level, Dzhanuskakov said.
</P>
<P>
   The military has claimed that some of the fighters are
mercenaries from Middle Eastern countries and Russia's rebellious
province of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan has fueled fears
that similar Islamic groups could flourish in the former Soviet
republics on its borders.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Protest NATO Smelter Takeover  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of Serbs marched
Tuesday to protest NATO's takeover of a metal smelter, a move U. N.
officials said was to meant to shut down a major polluter.
Yugoslavia and Russia described it as a blow to Kosovo's Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mine is our destiny, the foundations of our lives and
security and no one has the right to gamble with it,'' said Oliver
Ivanovic, a leader in the Serb half of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to up to 3,000 Serbs who marched through the streets
after assembling in their part of the industrial city, 30 miles
north of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The protest came a day after NATO-led peacekeepers moved in to
halt production at the plant, which U.N. officials here say pumps
toxic waste into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Serb workers infuriated by the takeover had massed at
the gates of the mining complex in Zvecan, near Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty employees remained inside throughout the day, insisting
they wanted to work, U.N. spokesman Michael Keats said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the danger of resistance from the local, predominantly
Serb community, 900 soldiers from Britain, France, Belgium and
Denmark took over the plant Monday and secured the facility at the
Trepca mining complex, seen by some as the economic linchpin of
Kosovo's economy.
</P>
<P>
   British soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse
those who tried to interfere in the pre-dawn raid. Four soldiers
and at least one Serb civilian were injured, NATO said. Serb media
said as many as six were injured.
</P>
<P>
   French and Danish peacekeepers also blocked the main entrance
and stationed vehicles along the road connecting Zvecan with
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Keats said the plant's Serb manager -- barred from the province
on the eve of the takeover -- would not be permitted to return.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally later in Mitrovica, the plant's chief Serb
engineer, Dragisa Djokovic, accused the barred manager of ''selling
out'' the complex and working for President Slobodan Milosevic's
regime suspected by Mitrovica Serbs of betraying them.
</P>
<P>
   Before dispersing peacefully Tuesday, Serbs announced new
protests outside the plant's gates for Wednesday morning and
pledged to ''keep fighting for their jobs and livelihoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fear the NATO takeover means they have lost their jobs --
the plant was the region's dwindling Serb community's primary
source of income -- and that the peacekeepers would bring Albanian
workers into the Zvecan plant instead. Kosovska Mitrovica is
divided into Serb and ethnic Albanian sections, and has been the
site of frequent ethnically motivated clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government protested the Trepca takeover at the
U.N. Security Council, calling the move an ''illegal and violent
act'' and demanding it be revoked, the state Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's U.N. representative Vladislav Jovanovic called the
health-related explanation for the takeover by Bernard Kouchner,
the top U.N. administrator for Kosovo, ''cynical.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a traditional Serb ally, also rejected the U.N.
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if we talk about the alleged ecological catastrophe ...
this in no instance can justify forceful actions by the
international presence, which cannot be evaluated other than as an
attempt to seize property which doesn't belong to them,'' said a
statement from the Foreign Ministry.

</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is hoping for a strong showing by

   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge has dismissed a lawsuit by a
man who claims that he was defamed when former Mayor Edward I. Koch
called him a ''kidnapper'' on ''The People's Court'' television
show.
</P>
<P>
   Civil Court Judge Norman Ryp said state law makes Koch, as the
show's ''judge'' in an arbitration the parties agreed to in
writing, ''absolutely immune from liability for all acts within the
arbitral process.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, at least the second against Koch while he was on
the show, was filed by Idris Kabia, a native of Sierra Leone,
Africa, who appeared on the program that was videotaped Feb. 9,
1999, and televised in March.
</P>
<P>
   Ryp said he viewed edited and unedited versions of the show and
read transcripts of the programs but could find no reference to
Idris's alleged kidnapping of his then-young son fron Sierra Leone
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The show arose from a Small Claims Court lawsuit for $2,000 that
Kabia had filed against his son, Ahmed Kabia. The elder Kabia had
accused his son of failing to return some photos of the two of them
together.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show was taped, parties on both sides signed a
contract with Ralph Edwards Productions, the show's producers. They
agreed that the production company - not the loser - will pay the
winner. If no award is made by the show's judge, then each party
gets $250 just for appearing.
</P>
<P>
   The parties also agreed that Koch and the producers are released
from liability for remarks during the show that either side
believes to be ''derogatory, defamatory or in some other way
injurious to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At the show's conclusion, Koch found in favor of the son but
awarded neither side any money. Kabia received, and deposited, a
$250 check from the producer and an edited version of the show
aired nationally in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, Kabia sued, alleging Koch said things that
''defame, libel and slander'' him. Ryp said the only issue for
trial was whether Koch said the words ''kidnapped'' or
''kidnapper'' with reference to Kabia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no recollection of saying that,'' Koch said when
reached at his office. ''But even if it (the videotape) contained
the commentary that he alleged, he still couldn't sue, by
agreement''
</P>
<P>
   Ryp suggested that even if he had been able to find a reference
to Kabia as a kidnapper, he had signed a contract releasing Koch
and the program's producers from anything said on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Koch left the show in 1999, replaced by retired State Supreme
Court Justice Jerry Scheindlin. Koch recalled that he appointed
both Scheindlin and his wife, ''Judge Judy'' Scheindlin, to their
first judicial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing terrific jobs and I enjoy watching them,'' Koch
said.

<HEADLINE> Losing thoroughbred Zippy Chippy takes his act to the baseball field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Zippy Chippy has a 50-50 chance of
actually winning a race this week. The competition: a fleet-footed,
minor-league baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   The losingest horse in the recorded history of U.S. thoroughbred
racing will line up for a 40-yard dash against Jose Herrera, the
base-stealing center fielder for the Rochester Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   The ''2000 Red Wings Derby'' was set for Thursday evening before
the Red Wings' game against Scranton/Wilkes Barre. Herrera, 27, has
stolen 155 bases in his 10-year professional career, including 10
for the Red Wings this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old gelding, 0-for-86 in his career, has been banned
from competition at the Finger Lakes racetrack in nearby Farmington
and, because of reciprocal agreements, just about everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Zippy Chippy set the record with his 86th loss last September
when he came in third in a field of six at a county fair in
Northampton, Mass.

<HEADLINE> American To Get Tests in Russia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian doctors have agreed to perform
additional tests on an imprisoned American at the request of the
doctor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the State Department said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American, Pennsylvania businessman Edmond Pope, has bone
cancer that is in remission. He was arrested four months ago on
charges of stealing military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the additional testing, department spokesman Philip
Reeker said, the administration remains very concerned about Pope's
health. He said Pope's condition appears to have deteriorated
sharply during his incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials have requested approval for a consular visit
this week, Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a finalized date, and we are still insisting
that the embassy doctor accompany the consular officials to see Mr.
Pope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have thus far refused such requests.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Virus Found in R.I.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARWICK, R.I. (AP) -- Environmental officials announced plans
Monday to spray insecticide in a two-mile radius where researchers
found a dead crow with West Nile virus, the first time the virus
was detected in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Four trucks will spray more than 200 miles of streets in Warwick
and Cranston starting Tuesday night at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental officials said they expected to find the
virus in Rhode Island because it already has been detected in
Connecticut and Massachusetts. It has also been found this year in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Rhode Island has been infected. Three New York City
residents contracted the illness this summer and have been
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is commonly carried by bloodsucking mosquitoes, which
transmit the virus through bites. Infection may result in
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an
inflammation of the brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, during the first known appearance of the West Nile
virus in the Western Hemisphere, seven people died and 62 others
were infected in the New York metropolitan area.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Top Show Again  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Survivor'' remained the top prime-time show
again last week as college student Colleen Haskell was voted off
the island, according to Nielsen Media Research figures released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's been the same success story since June for CBS'
island-castaways competition. And odds are, viewership will only
build as the 13-week summer series heads toward the finish line
next Wednesday, when the world learns who won the million-dollar
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of million, the Tuesday, Sunday and Thursday editions
of ABC's ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' ranked second through
fourth. This red-hot game show helped ABC to win the week overall
with an average 9.94 million viewers (a 6.9 household rating and a
13 share).
</P>
<P>
   Next was CBS, with 8.87 million viewers (6.2 rating, 11 share),
followed by NBC with 7.75 million viewers (5.5 rating, 10 share).
</P>
<P>
   Fox had 5.77 million viewers (3.8 rating, 7 share). UPN had 3.42
million viewers (2.2, 4), the WB had 2.66 million viewers (1.7, 3)
and Pax TV had 1.33 million viewers (1.0, 2).
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ''Big Brother'' nabbed fifth-place with its Wednesday live
edition, but the voyeur-vision series wasn't so big in its other
installments, which ranked 30, 40, 42 and 73.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening news derby, NBC's ''Nightly News'' won with 9.29
million viewers (6.9 household rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World
News Tonight'' had 8.58 million viewers (6.5 rating, 15 share),
while ''The CBS Evening News'' had 7.30 million viewers (5.6
rating, 13 share).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Aug. 7-13, the top 10 shows, their networks and
household ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 17.4; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Tuesday), ABC, 14.7; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday),
ABC, 14.2; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 13.5;
''Big Brother'' (Wednesday), CBS, 11.3; ''20/20 Downtown,'' ABC,
9.4; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 9.0; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS,
8.3; tied: ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, and ''Vanished: Object of Desire,''
ABC, both 8.2.

<HEADLINE> Russians Consult NATO On Sub Rescue  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- A group of Russian military officers
went to NATO headquarters Tuesday night to determine what
assistance the Western defense alliance could provide in rescuing a
disabled Russian nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had earlier refused offers from the United States and
Britain to send trained rescue personnel and equipment. Apparently,
Russian authorities chose to go through NATO rather than deal
directly with Washington or London.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO source, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
the Russian officers came to NATO headquarters from the Russian
Embassy in Brussels at about 7:30 p.m. and spoke via teleconference
with alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide in the effort to rescue 116 sailors aboard the submarine
Kursk in the Barents Sea, the source said. He said the meeting was
initiated by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference, the NATO source said. On the basis
of this information, Russia will decide whether to make an official
request.
</P>
<P>
   The source said he had no information about the technical
details discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is located on the south coast of England
and could be ready to move in a matter of hours, according to Paul
Beaver of Jane's Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Mermansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ''They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and
Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and
arrive in about the same time frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea oil
field experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of expertise in NATO already in using
submersibles at depth,'' Beaver said.

<HEADLINE> 49 Hospitalized in Russian Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A week after a bomb ripped through a crowded
underground passageway in central Moscow, 49 victims remain
hospitalized and a search for the bombers has yielded no
breakthroughs, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The blast killed seven people outright and the death toll later
rose to 12 as victims died from wounds, mostly severe burns. In
all, 108 people were hospitalized after the explosion and nine
remained in critical condition Tuesday, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the bomb was equivalent to about one pound of TNT,
and are still trying to determine whether the blast was the work of
gangsters or Chechen rebels. Rebel groups have denied
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Officials quickly blamed the explosion on Chechens, who are
fighting a guerrilla war against Russia, but provided little
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow police said Tuesday they had arrested a man from the
Caucasus region, where Chechnya is located, because he had traces
of explosives on his hands. He will be held three days for
questioning, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous arrests related to the bombing have not resulted in
charges being filed.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment bombings in Moscow and other cities last fall killed
about 300 people. Officials blamed Chechen rebels, and dozens of
ethnic Chechens were detained in Moscow, only to be released later.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAK RIDGE, N.J. (AP) - Lakeland Bancorp on Tuesday announced a
new flood disaster loan program aimed at residents of northwestern
New Jersey whose properties were damaged by recent heavy rains and
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The Oak Ridge-based corporation is the holding company for
Lakeland Bank and The National Bank of Sussex County, which
together operate about two dozen bank branches in Sussex, Morris,
Passaic, Hunterdon and Bergen counties.
</P>
<P>
   The banks will offer reduced-rate home equity loans with no
fees. Interested homeowners should contact the local branch of
either bank for details.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Bosma, president and chief executive officer of Lakeland
Bancorp, said the special loans will be offered through Oct. 15 to
those whose homes sustained damage from the rain and flooding since
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   WAYNE, N.J. (AP) - In an effort to cut costs, struggling
supermarket chain Grand Union Co. is eliminating about 170 jobs,
effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest food retailers in the Northeast, Grand Union
said the cuts announced Monday primarily involve jobs at its
headquarters here and its administrative offices in upstate New
York. In addition, some positions will be cut from its
approximately 220 supermarkets in New York, New Jersey, Vermont,
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Union president Gary M. Philbin said the reductions were
''economically necessary'' and should reduce annual costs by $8
million to $12 million while increasing operating cash flow. The
company, which had fiscal 2000 sales of $2.2 billion, said the job
cuts will result in a charge of about $2 million for the fiscal
2001 second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The chain, which once had more than 900 stores from Florida to
Canada and west to Texas, entered bankruptcy protection twice
during the 1990s, most recently in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ROSELAND, N.J. (AP) - Automatic Data Processing Inc. said

</P>
<P>
   EarthLink members also will receive a trial offer to use ADP's

   MADISON, N.J. (AP) - The American Heart Association has added a
new heart medication to the treatments included in its guidelines
for advanced cardiac life support, according to the drug's
manufacturer, American Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Tuesday that the guidelines, which were last
revised in 1992, will call for use of Cordarone I.V., its
medication for abnormal heart rhythms. The new guidelines are to be
published in next Tuesday's issue of the medical journal
Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   According to American Home Products, the guidelines will
recommend physicians consider giving the drug to patients whose
hearts are beating rapidly and ineffectively but do not respond to
cardiopulmonary resuscitation or defibrillation shocks - before
giving the patient another heart drug called lidocaine. Lidocaine
for years has been given to nearly every patient suffering cardiac
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study, Cordarone I.V., made by AHP's Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories division, was shown to increase by 29 percent the
number of heart attack patients who survived until they reached the
hospital, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Long Island man accused of making death threats against Lieberman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Long Island man was charged Tuesday with
calling ''The Howard Stern Show'' and making death threats against
U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Lawrence Franco, 23, told Stern in a conversation
heard by radio listeners Monday morning that the Democratic vice
presidential candidate ''is gonna take my bullet,'' court papers
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Stern asked him if he was making a threat, Franco - calling
himself ''Nazarene'' - allegedly replied, ''I'm telling you right
now. ... You got the killer on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service traced the call to Franco's Farmingdale, N.Y.
home. Agents arrested him late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   During arraignment in Brooklyn federal court, Magistrate Joan
Azrack released Franco on $200,000 bond, but put him under house
arrest and ordered him to undergo a psychiatric exam. Outside
court, a man identifying himself as Franco's uncle described the
incident as ''a joke gone wrong.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Consider Research Finance Rules  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Prompted by the death of a teen-ager in a
medical trial last year, federal health officials are investigating
whether lush financial rewards earned by some researchers may
affect patient safety and public health.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference at the National Institutes of Health, officials
said Tuesday that a new era of biotechnology economics, in which
researchers may earn millions through stock deals with drug
companies, has raised serious questions about scientific integrity
and threatens public confidence in medical research.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a crisis in confidence develops, if research subjects no
longer feel safe, then medical research will grind to a halt,''
said Jane Henney, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   She said the death last September of 18-year-old Jesse
Gelsinger, a test subject in a gene therapy trial, caused the
government and research institutions to take a close look at the
highly profitable arrangements that some researchers have with
companies that are financing their research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Questions were raised about financial interests of
investigators and whether these interests clouded their judgment in
decisions that were made,'' said Henney.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger died in an experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania's gene therapy program led by Dr. James Wilson. It
later was learned that a company founded by Wilson funded part of
the Penn research. The company, Genovo Inc., later was sold to a
bigger company and Wilson got a reported $13.5 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Penn's gene therapy research has been suspended by the FDA, in
part because the agency found that researchers did not report two
other serious reactions from it.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has not commented publicly on violations cited by FDA,
but will have an opportunity to challenge the agency's findings. He
did say of Gelsinger: ''We may have activated his immune system
very early.''
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed that there was a swift rise of immune system
proteins, just as there were with other patients who had been
involved in the therapy. But for Gelsinger, the proteins never
receded.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, a clinical professor at the University
of California, San Francisco, said financial conflict of interest
among researchers risks scientific misconduct that can ''impact the
practice of tens of thousands of physicians'' who are guided by the
research in treating millions of patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Investigators who allow bias or error to infect their work are
practicing scientific misconduct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer said such bias includes reporting only good results
in a drug trial, making claims not justified by the evidence and
''outright fraud with fabrication of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Most drug trials, he said, are paid for by drug companies. Other
trials are conducted by researches with a financial interest in the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, said Bodenheimer, an analysis of 70 studies on the
safety of a heart drug found that 96 percent of authors who had
drug company ties found the drugs to be safe, while among experts
with no drug company connections only 37 percent said the drugs
were safe.
</P>
<P>
   When drug companies pay for research into the effectiveness of
their own pain relievers, said Bodenheimer, 100 percent find their
drug superior to a competitor's.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of company-funded studies published in peer-reviewed
journals found that results of the studies favored the company's
products 98 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The take-home message of these studies is that company-funded
trials have a high likelihood of favoring the company's products,''
said Bodenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Among other examples of conflict of interest cited by
Bodenheimer:
</P>
<P>
   --Private physicians may be paid $1,000 to $5,000 for each
patient recruited for a drug trial. This leads to doctors sometimes
enrolling patients who don't belong in the drug trials. Some
doctors have even enrolled patients who don't even have the disease
being studied.
</P>
<P>
   --Up to 75 percent of people enrolled in cancer studies are
younger than 65 because older people respond more poorly to
chemotherapy. Yet, 63 percent of cancer patients in the United
States are over 65. Excluding older people can make it appear that
a drug works better than it really does.
</P>
<P>
   --Drug companies own the data from drug trials. Bodenheimer said
in some cases companies release only results that make their drug
look good ''and bury data on less favorable'' results.
</P>
<P>
   --In at least two cases, said Bodenheimer, drug companies
threatened researchers who attempted to publish company-paid
studies that put their drug in a poor light.
</P>
<P>
   --Many research studies are written by ''ghost'' authors, usually
hired by a drug company. The company then pays a prominent
researcher to be named as the author ''though they contributed
nothing except their prestige,'' said Bodenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   And, yet, said Bodenheimer, thousands of doctors rely upon the
results of these studies to make treatment decisions for their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   He said the data show ''that scientific misconduct does take
place in clinical drug trials, that conflict of interest is a risk
factor for scientific misconduct and that something must be done
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials called the conference to gather information
that may later be used to write new federal regulations controlling
oversight of conflict of interest in medical research.

By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Buffeted by storms, Russian rescuers repeatedly
tried Tuesday to lower an escape capsule to 116 sailors trapped in
a crippled nuclear submarine sitting on the floor of the Barents
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. government officials said Tuesday in Washington that a
Navy submarine in the area detected the sound of an explosion and
it was the ''working assumption'' that the noise was related to the
sinking of the submarine Kursk. The officials, who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition they not be named, said the sound was
not a missile being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Navy Chief Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov said earlier Tuesday
that there appeared to have been an explosion in the torpedo
compartment in the nose of the submarine, sending it crashing to
the sea bottom. He said earlier that the Kursk had likely collided
with something and it wasn't clear why he had changed his
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to rescue the Kursk were hampered most of Tuesday by
high winds and strong currents.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no communication with the submarine since it went
down, and conditions inside were not known. It wasn't clear how
much air the crew had left and water appeared to be leaking in,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on a break in the weather late Tuesday, rescue ships
resumed efforts to lower the escape capsule, but rough weather was
frustrating the operation. The situation, Kuroyedov said, was
''extremely grave.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescue operation faced severe difficulties. The bell-shaped
capsule was to try to latch on to a cargo hatch on the submarine, a
precision maneuver made even more challenging because the Kursk was
reportedly leaning at a sharp angle.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the capsule successfully docks with the sub and sailors
can enter it, the capsule can hold only 20 people at a time and
officials say bringing it to the surface could take up to seven
hours. The slow rise is necessary to prevent decompression sickness
-- the potentially crippling or fatal condition known as ''the
bends.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a laborious and nerve-fraying process under the best
of circumstances, and weather forecasts indicated conditions in the
disaster area would be rough for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Russia refused offers from the United States and Britain to send
trained rescue personnel and equipment even though the Russian navy
lacks sophisticated rescue gear. Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo
said coordinating the rescue with other countries would take too
much time and ''we cannot afford to waste it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a group of Russian military officers went to NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday night to see what
kind of assistance the alliance could offer, a NATO source said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. officials said Tuesday that the sound of the explosion
was detected Saturday. The Russian government has said the accident
that brought down the Kursk happened Sunday during military
exercises. The discrepancy could not be explained.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley declined to say what,
if anything, U.S. vessels may have heard from their position ''a
couple of hundred'' miles away from the place the sub went down.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion inside the submarine's torpedo chamber, which
contains warheads, would probably have caused extensive casualties,
analysts said. Navy officials said casualties could not be ''ruled
out,'' Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   While immediate concerns focused on the crew, there was also
worry over whether the accident would result in a leak of
radioactive material. The prospects of such a leak were difficult
to assess because it is not known what befell the Kursk, one of the
Russian navy's most modern ships.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the Kursk's two nuclear reactors had been
switched off and it was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Several compartments inside the submarine were flooded,
officials said. Submarines are divided into compartments that can
be sealed in case of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something extraordinary beyond the imagination of an
engineer'' had happened, the chief designer of the submarine, Igor
Baranov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western submarines sometimes play cat-and-mouse
games in the area and have scraped each other in the past. The U.S.
Navy said Monday it had a monitoring ship in the area, but Quigley
said there was no evidence that any U.S. vessel was involved in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear submarines have been involved in a string of
accidents in recent decades. The navy, like the rest of the Russian
military, is desperately short of money and performs almost no
maintenance on its ships.

<HEADLINE> Gibraltar Nuclear Sub Protested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBRALTAR (AP) -- More than 1,500 people marched and sailed
toward a nuclear submarine Tuesday to protest the British vessel's
presence for repairs in a Gibraltar harbor.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 sailboats and motorboats sailed to within a few hundred
yards of the docked submarine HMS Tireless while crowds rallied on
land close by. Police blocked protesters from moving closer.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd sang ''Tireless Out'' -- a song written for the
demonstration -- and waved signs demanding that British authorities
tow the submarine to England for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters fear a radiation leak and say Gibraltar is not
equipped to handle such an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   British officials say the submarine has a very small coolant
leak in its propulsion system but insist there is no danger of a
radiation spill from the nuclear-powered engines.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no safety concerns,'' said ministry spokesman Jim
Jenkin. ''The level of radiation is being monitored and there has
been no increase whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The HMS Tireless has been docked in Gibraltar since May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''The British Ministry of Defense has not given any optimism to
dispel fears,'' said Levi Attias, a protest organizer and Gibraltar
resident. ''This is not the end of our campaign and we're
considering legal action to remove the submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the protest -- coming as Russian rescuers struggle
to save 116 sailors trapped in a nuclear submarine on the ocean
floor above the Arctic Circle -- is pure coincidence, said Attias.
</P>
<P>
   However, the incidents ''show that nuclear submarines are not
toys and malfunctions are not to be played with,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, protesters gathered several thousand
signatures for a petition asking the Gibraltar government to push
for the submarine's removal.

<HEADLINE> Lazio stumps for votes on the No. 7 train, Queens  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - No, that wasn't John Rocker riding the No. 7
train on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trailed by a throng of media, Republican Senate candidate Rick
Lazio rode the subway from Manhattan to Queens for a campaign trip
through Flushing. He greeted well-wishers along Roosevelt Avenue
and later threw a few ''knock-down'' pitches at his Democratic
opponent -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who had no speaking role and made a one-day cameo at the
Republican National Convention two weeks ago, jabbed at the first
lady's speech Monday night at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that she had the opportunity to focus on New York a
little bit and New York's issues and it just seemed like she was
more interested in running for national office than senator from
New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added later, ''I just think she's out of touch with what
regular New Yorkers feel and experience and need.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Levine, a Clinton spokeswoman, countered that had the
congressman spent more time at the GOP convention,''I'm sure Rick
Lazio would have made a very different kind of speech, one that
obscures his record of voting for a real and enforcible Patient's
Bill of Rights and against putting 100,000 new teachers in our
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Clinton ''chose to talk about the importance of
electing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, the progress the administration
has made over the last eight years and the works she has done on
behalf of children and family for the past 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   On the trip to Flushing, however, Lazio hardly could be mistaken
for Rocker, the notorious Atlanta Braves relief pitcher who bashed
New York City and its residents -- specifically foreigners and gays
who take the 7 train -- in a 1999 Sports Illustrated article.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, few people aboard the sparsely populated midday train
even knew who the Long Island congressman was. He received a much
more enthusiastic greeting on Roosevelt Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's loved,'' said Mary Anderson of Bayside. ''He's a suburban
man, he's a city man, he's a family man. He knows New York. He's
fought for the people ... he's down to earth and he'll buck anybody
that does not do good for his people in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Antosh conceded that Lazio has an uphill fight against
Clinton because Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has to penetrate the Democratic Party,'' she said. ''And I
think he can because he's an honest man and his principles are good
and he's genuine. He's not a phony, Hollywood person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was trailed through Flushing by a number of protesters
--one group questioned his commitment to legalized abortion and
another repeated calls for him to release his tax returns --
something he has said he'll do by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be willing to release, in the next 15 minutes, all of my
New York state tax returns if she's willing to do the same,'' he
smirked and then he walked away.

<HEADLINE> Yale poll to track attitudes about political ads on TV  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - They scream out at you from the TV:
political attack ads that try to paint candidates as two-faced
liars, cheats and villains.
</P>
<P>
   Such ads have become a mainstay in politics, but do they really
matter? Who pays attention? Do they affect how anyone actually
votes?
</P>
<P>
   That's what a Yale University study is trying to find out, using
an Internet-based polling system that can track the way attitudes
of respondents change over time.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale study will track the presidential race and the New York
Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The polling system allows respondents to watch political ads and
answer to a series of questions about the election. Other people
will answer the same questions but will not see the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think campaign commercials are highly effective, but we
don't have any research to show how effective they are,'' said Yale
political science Professor John Lapinski said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski also wants to see if they can measure the effect of ads
on certain demographic groups to see if ads have more impact on
some people than on others.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say about $600 million will be spent on political ads
nationwide for the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Some research has shown that the ads help little-known
candidates get name recognition, but do little to sway voters, said
Doug Schwartz, pollster at Quinnipiac University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great idea because it is so hard to test the
impact of campaign ads in the real world,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Some ads do stick in people's minds: the Willie Horton ads that
attacked 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis as
soft on crime; the spot from the 1996 Connecticut congressional
race in which a rat crawled across the screen while U.S. Rep. Gary
Franks was attacked as a slumlord.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard for people to see a rat going across the screen
while they are eating their dinner and not say, 'Boy, that guy must
be terrible,''' Franks said in conceding defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The first poll results came in this week, after Vice President
Al Gore picked Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman to be his
running-mate, but before the Democratic National Convention got
underway.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 903 registered voters conducted between Aug. 9 and
Aug. 11 found Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush in a statistical
tie in a four-way race. Bush got 41 percent and Gore got 38 percent
- within the margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Three percent of those polled supported Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader, and less than 1 percent picked Reform Party candidate
Pat Buchanan. Seventeen percent said they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   These results will be used as a benchmark for future surveys,
Lapinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents to the poll were chosen by random telephone dialing.
People who agreed to participate were given a free Web TV account
with a hard drive so they can download commercials.
</P>
<P>
   They will receive questionnaires and other information by
e-mail. Respondents also can access the Web TV for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Some people already were regular Internet users, while others
were not.
</P>
<P>
   The free Internet access ensures a broader sample of people, but
researchers will be looking to see whether the new presence of the
Internet changes the views of people who previously did not use
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of respondents is changed from time to time so that
they do not get sick of being polled and to prevent them from
becoming, in effect, professional poll responders, Lapinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, the director of the Pew Research Center in
Washington, said this type in Internet-based polling will be better
for political analysis than the surveys usually done by telephone
to get a snapshot of who is leading in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The downloading of political commercials is an artificial way to
get results, since this is not something most people would probably
do on their own, Kohut said.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman choice praised by black scholar  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman will be
popular among black voters, despite some misgivings among blacks
about Lieberman's position on affirmative action, a prominent black
scholar predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Jew ever chosen for a major national
ticket, is ''a person of integrity'' who has ''brought a certain
dignity to the ticket'' that will be attractive to all types of
voters, said Julius Lester, a professor of Judaic and Near Eastern
studies at the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Lester, who is both black and Jewish, said the media has
overstated the impact of Lieberman's religion on the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jewish and black voters will support the Democratic ticket
''overwhelmingly'' this fall, Lester said, disputing reports that
blacks tend to hold more anti-Jewish views than the population as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to remember that blacks and Jews have continued to
vote very similarly on both national and state elections around the
country, so I would certainly not expect that to change in any
way,'' Lester said.
</P>
<P>
   Lester made the comments as Lieberman and Vice President Al Gore
sought to allay concerns among some black leaders about Lieberman's
stand on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman supported a 1998 California proposition that banned
state-funded affirmative action programs and has opposed what he
describes as racial quotas.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman told about 300 black delegates to the Democratic
National Convention that he supports affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have supported affirmative action. I do support affirmative
action. And I will support affirmative action,'' said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane told reporters that Lieberman has a
strong civil rights record and pointed out that Lieberman traveled
to the South in the 1960s to help register blacks to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lester praised Lieberman's decision to meet with the black
delegates and said it showed he does not take black support for
granted. While acknowledging that most blacks disagree with
Lieberman's views on affirmative action, Lester said it would be a
mistake to assume that disagreements extend to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the perception of the black community as being
ultraliberal is mistaken,'' Lester said, calling black voters
liberal on race but moderate or even conservative on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's ''social conservatism and his emphasis on family
values and religiosity will play very well with the black
community,'' Lester said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's selection of the Connecticut senator has been hailed by
black leaders from Jesse Jackson to Al Sharpton. Even Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who once called Judaism a ''gutter
religion,'' has tempered criticism of Lieberman to make clear that
his religion should not be an issue for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Lester, the son of a Methodist minister, converted to Judaism in
1982. He said Lieberman's selection has justifiably stirred
euphoria among many Jews - including himself - but has also sparked
some fear, particularly among older Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The selection is less controversial than it would have been a
decade or even five years ago, Lester said, but added, ''We're
certainly going to find out how much latent anti-Semitism there is
in America.''

<HEADLINE> Cuomo says he's made decision on governor's race, McCall works crowd </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - The road to the New York governor's mansion
goes through Los Angeles this week.
</P>
<P>
   Two potential Democratic rivals, state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall and U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, are fervently
courting New York delegates and attacking Republican Gov. George
Pataki at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Both men used their breakfast speeches to the delegation to
attack state Republicans, but after his on Tuesday, Cuomo revealed
that he has made up his mind on whether to run for governor in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   However, he won't say what he decided. Instead, he says he wants
to keep the focus on Hillary Clinton and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But he did lead off his speech with a tribute to his home state
and then focused heavily on how upstate New York has been left
behind the nation's economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no state in the nation like New York,'' the eldest
son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo said. ''Imagine when we bring this
great economy to all the places that are untouched. When we bring
it to upstate New York ... and we reverse what the Republicans have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall was unperturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good for him,''' he said. ''It sounds like he's planning to
run for something. I wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCall has not said publicly what his plans are,
supporters said he has told them privately he is running. McCall,
the first black elected to statewide office in New York, has
already raised $1.4 million. As trustee of New York's $122 billion
fund he is viewed as the largest investor in the world and is
expected to have little trouble raising the $20 million his camp
estimates he would need to make the race.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been busy lining up union support.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I make an announcement about what I'm going to do, I
think the kind of overwhelming support that I have will make it
clear that anyone who wants to take me on is in for one heck of a
battle, and if they want to have that battle I'm ready,'' McCall
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall attacked Pataki by name on Monday morning, also accusing
him ignoring the upstate economy and cutting funding for education
even as New York racked up record budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats have been a bit like Clark Kent and Superman
at the convention. Both appear to be everywhere but never seem to
be in the same place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Both men been fixtures in the palatial lobby of the Century
Plaza hotel where the New York delegation is staying but have never
been seen together. McCall also was nowhere to be seen during
Cuomo's speech and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo will go Hollywood Wednesday night. Actor Bill Baldwin and
his Creative Coalition will honor him with a public service award
at a reception at the Los Angeles Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Cuomo is reaching out even to those in McCall's
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gregory Meeks of Queens said he met with the housing
secretary about a month ago and they would likely talk again.
''Although he didn't declare that he was running it was clear that
he was feeling his way around,'' Meeks said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like Andrew personally but if the election were held today I
would have to climb on board with Carl McCall,'' Meeks said.
''Whether it's Carl McCall or Andrew Cuomo what the Democratic
Party is doing is lining up a strong Democratic candidate and that
can only be good.''

<HEADLINE> At Least 4 Killed in Colombia Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian students on a field trip were
caught in a crossfire between government troops and leftist rebels
Tuesday and at least four children were killed, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Jairo Franco, an official from the nearby town of
Pueblorrico, said four children were killed. But Dr. Helena
Restrepo of Pueblorrico's hospital, said six had died.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of fierce combat. They walked right into it,''
said Martin Morales, director of the San Juan de Dios Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were from the National Liberation Army, or ELN,
Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group, said Alfredo Salgado,
assistant director of Colombia's national police force.
</P>
<P>
   The group of children was on a trip with two of their teachers
in the mountain municipality of Pueblorrico, 150 miles northwest of
the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said the two teachers escaped unharmed. How many
children were on the trip and their ages were not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
   Combat between Colombia's two leftist rebel armies, government
troops and police has been intense. At least 27 people have been
killed over the past day in bloody clashes between Colombian
security forces and rebels from ELN and FARC, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 109; Nasdaq Gains 2  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow's three-day winning streak ended Tuesday
amid a downturn among retail, brokerage and health stocks.
Meanwhile, a strong session by semiconductor issues failed to give
the lethargic Nasdaq Stock Market much of a charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 109.14 to 11,067.00. That
wiped out much of the Dow's 148-point surge on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 1.97 to
3,851.66. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index slipped 7.13 to 1,484.43.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blamed profit-taking for the Dow's drop. The Dow had
risen in recent days amid optimism that the Federal Reserve would
leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's profit-taking on the Dow and a resurgence in the tech
sector due to relative opportunities in semiconductors, which have
been devastated in the past month,'' said Barry Hyman, senior
equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Gains on the tech sector remained limited to a handful of
familiar names. ''People want the safety of big-cap tech stocks and
they're not fiddling with mid-tier companies,'' Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel was up 93.75 cents to $67.875 and Sun jumped $3.312 to
$117.375.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers, which have largely done well in recent weeks due to
the stabilizing interest rate environment, helped pull the market
down on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Home Depot, which met Wall Street forecasts, fell
$5.938 to $53.75 after a big run-up the past two weeks. Some
analysts were concerned the retailer did not beat their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney dropped $1.438 to $16.50 after reporting that its
second-quarter operating profit dropped 90 percent due to lower
sales and price cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Drugmakers, which have benefitted from investors' turn toward
defensive stocks that can better withstand an economic downturn,
were mostly lower.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb, which made a legal maneuver Tuesday that
seems to temporarily preserve its patent protection on its
blockbuster cancer drug Taxol, rose $1.875 to $52.50. Generic
drugmaker Ivax, which was poised to start making a cheaper, generic
Taxol, plunged $13 to $29.375.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of HMOs, which have soared this summer, came back to
Earth. Those included WellPoint Health Networks, off $5.187 to
$85.938 and PacifiCare Health Systems, down $2.25 to $54.25.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest losers in financial services, was Lehman
Brothers, off $6.625 at $130.75, and Schwab, down $2.25 at $37.75.
</P>
<P>
   Among technology stocks, JDS Uniphase fell $2.062 to $118.188
and Radio Shack dropped $2.937 to $66.063.
</P>
<P>
   But semiconductor and chip issues helped the Nasdaq, led by
Applied Materials, up $3 to $77.813 and Texas Instruments, up $3.25
to $67.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, the Federal Reserve said industrial
production rose 0.4 percent in July, in line with analysts'
expectations. The report contained little sign of inflation, which
should make investors more confident the central bank will leave
interest rates unchanged when it convenes next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.09
billion shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 4.55 to 509.93.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.89 percent,
Germany's DAX index was down 0.33 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.87 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.41 percent.

<HEADLINE> $7M Awarded in DNA Sample Backlog  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department awarded more than $7
million in grants Tuesday to seven states to begin clearing a large
blacklog of DNA genetic samples obtained from convicted criminals
but never analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The grants from the department's National Institute of Justice
will allow these states to analyze 145,783 backlogged samples, out
of a nationwide backlog that a national commission recently
estimated at 750,000 unanalyzed samples. The money also will pay
for entering the analysis results on the FBI's Combined DNA Index
System (CODIS), a computer network that allows comparisons with
samples in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA from convicts can be compared with DNA found on evidence
at crime scene and has helped convict, and in some cases clear,
suspects. Like fingerprints, DNA genetic material is specific to
each individual.
</P>
<P>
   The seven states also will use the money to enter DNA analyses
of evidence from unsolved crimes to CODIS.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many cases, investigators are working hard to solve cases
where a perpetrator has been apprehended for another crime and is
already incarcerated,'' said Julie Samuels, acting institute
director. ''These grants will help link cases to convicted
offenders and help investigators devote their energy to cases where
the perpetrator is still at large and a threat to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence
recommended that the Justice Department help states analyze
existing DNA samples that had not been analyzed or entered into
CODIS.
</P>
<P>
   California, Florida, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas
and Washington will share the first $7 million. The department
expects to distribute another $7 million soon to 14 additional
states to work on their backlogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Increasing law enforcement's ability to use DNA evidence in
the fight against crime makes sense and, ultimately, gets violent
offenders off our streets,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno.

<HEADLINE> US Mint Gets 105 Capitol Coin Ideas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Mint announced Tuesday it has
received 105 design concepts for the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center
Commemorative Coin, to be released next January.
</P>
<P>
   All the designs, including some submitted by sculptors and
engravers who work for the Mint, depict the first convening of
Congress in the Capitol in 1800.
</P>
<P>
   The designs will be reviewed by a citizen advisory committee.
The treasury secretary will select the winning design in
consultation with the U.S. Capitol Preservation Commission and the
U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the revenue from sales of the dollar and half-dollar
coins will go to the new Capitol Visitor Center, which will provide
an educational experience for the 5 million or so people a year who
visit the historic building.

<HEADLINE> Haddonfield teen pledges not to speak for a year  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   HADDONFIELD, N.J. (AP) - It started as a matter of idle
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Banfe wondered aloud to a friend what it would be like not
to talk for a day. Then the 18-year-old said he could go a whole
year without speaking. The next thing he knew, he had committed to
do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 6 p.m. Sept. 1, the Haddonfield teen will stop
talking. He'll let himself make noises, but utter no words.
</P>
<P>
   Staying silent will be a big adjustment for Brett, a talkative,
friendly, outgoing kid. ''I babble,'' he said after giving a
long-winded answer to a reporter's question Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But while he's talkative, he is also contemplative. He sees the
adventure he's about to take as more about commitment than silence,
more about listening than not speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm embarrassed to say, almost, that I wouldn't listen to
people if they talked. I'd wait for them to stop talking, then I'd
start talking. Because ... my opinion was the right one anyway. It
was like, 'Thanks a lot for your input, but here's how it really
happened.' So I think the one area that I'll transform is how I
listen to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett also acknowledges that he's had a problem in the past
seeing things through and achieving goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a 1300 on my SATs, and I failed a class. It was stupid.
And I realize why. It's because there's a difference between
wanting to get an A and being committed to getting an A,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ''I understand commitment to the 'nth' degree. It
doesn't matter what you want. It's what you're committed to. You
have to stick to what you're committed to.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to use his experience to inspire people to
appreciate life.
</P>
<P>
   ''We go through our life like it's business as usual,'' said
Brett, a tall, thin, dark-haired teen with pierced ears and a
pierced tongue. ''It doesn't even occur to us that all we have is
this moment, right now, right here.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can take a day to stop speaking, you can really get
focused and in tune with everything that's around you, all your
surroundings. If you really get in tune, it's stopping and taking
in what actually you are doing. And that's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after he stops talking, he will start his freshman year
at William Paterson University in Wayne. He'll be able to e-mail
his family and friends at home and communicate in chat rooms, but
just how he will handle classes and new friends remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Brett and his mother, Sharon Banfe, are e-mailing his professors
this week to ''try to get a feel for how much of a problem this
will or won't be in class,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some professors might be very happy to have someone who just
wants to pay attention and listen,'' she said. ''Others might
require more interaction. We don't know what's in store there.''
</P>
<P>
   For group-discussion classes, Brett said thinks he can manage by
typing on his laptop computer or writing his thoughts on paper.
</P>
<P>
   As for socializing, ''I guess I'll just make friends silently,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site, Dare for Dollars, has promised to pay Brett $20 for
every day he does not talk, plus a $5,000 bonus if he makes it the
whole year, for a total of more than $12,000. Brett said he'll give
the money to a charity for underprivileged inner-city kids.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knows people will try to get him to talk, but doesn't
think he'll fall for it. ''If I had a friend who wasn't speaking,
I'd try and mess him up, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett's also not worried about any physical problems from not
talking. He checked with his family doctor, who said he'll use the
same muscles chewing, coughing and grunting as he would have by
talking.
</P>
<P>
   He admits a little fear about what he's attempting. ''Sometimes
I get nervous about what I'm doing, and then I recommit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be a journey that I have no idea where it'll end up. I
know that it'll be an incredible learning experience,'' he said.
''I don't know exactly what I'm going to learn.''

<HEADLINE> Park Avenue gynecologist asks court to let him resume medical practice </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Park Avenue gynecologist who is charged with
fraud, negligence and incompetence, has asked the court to lift the
suspension of his medical license so he can resume his
celebrity-studded practice.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Niels Lauersen, 63, said the state Health Department
violated his due process rights when it suspended his license on
Aug. 9 without a complete hearing after declaring that he posed an
''imminent danger to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed Monday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court,
Lauersen, dubbed the ''Dyno Gyno'' by tabloid newspapers, asked the
court to bar the state from acting until ongoing hearings in his
case are complete.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob is to hear oral
arguments at 2 p.m. Wednesday on Lauersen's petition to resume his
practice. The state Attorney General's office will represent the
Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   State Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello suspended Lauersen
on the basis of a report detailing numerous charges involving seven
patients, including a delivery in which a baby allegedly was brain
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Smith, spokeswoman for the Health Department, said
Lauersen's arguments for the stay ''are without merit. We have
provided compelling evidence (for the suspension) and are prepared
to proceed with our case.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith denied that Lauersen's due process rights were violated.
''He was receiving the hearing he was entitled to under the law,''
she said. ''That same law allows for summary suspension if they
(the hearing officers) feel he poses a risk to his patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the hearing officers - two doctors and a layman
knowledgeable about misconduct law - found Lauersen ''confused and
incoherent'' during the hearing and said that sometimes he seemed
to be lying.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen's lawyer, Robert Deutsch, did not return a call for
comment. He reportedly has called the agency's charges against his
client a ''vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lauersen, whose patients have included singer Celine
Dion and actress Liv Ullman, faces retrial on federal charges that
he stole more than $2 million from insurance companies over a
10-year period by falsely billing for fertility surgeries that the
companies did not cover.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen's first trial ended in March with a deadlocked jury.

<HEADLINE> Judge decides Harry Potter case can be decided in New York  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A dispute between the creators of the popular
Harry Potter children's book series and a Pennsylvania woman who
says she owns the rights to the ''Muggles'' trademarks will be
decided in Manhattan, a judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The decision filed Monday by U.S. District Judge Allen G.
Schwartz was a legal victory for the book's author, J.K. Rowling,
who lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, the book series' publisher,
Scholastic Inc., as well as Time Warner Entertainment Co., which
owns film and merchandising rights.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz declined to dismiss the lawsuit brought by Rowling and
the companies against Nancy Stouffer of Camp Hill, Pa. They sought
a court declaration that they have not infringed on any of
Stouffer's copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Stouffer initially responded to the lawsuit with one of her own,
filed in Philadelphia, and sought to have the Manhattan lawsuit
thrown out or transferred to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz ruled that Stouffer, by having her own books
published and asserting her claims against the Harry Potter books,
had engaged in enough business in New York City to cause the case
to be litigated there.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Casey, a lawyer for Stouffer, said he was unlikely to
appeal Schwartz's ruling because he was eager to prove the
similarities between the Harry Potter books and the creations of
Stouffer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy the judge has ruled one way or the other
because now we can get on to the substance of this thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Rowling, Scholastic and Time Warner referred
questions in the case to Scholastic, which forwarded a statement
issued in late March saying that Stouffer's ownership claims to the
word ''muggles'' were absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Rowling's creative mind works in a world filled with myths
and legends, but let there be no doubt that these books are her
unique creations. Unfortunately, nowadays, success seems to breed
not only imitation but also litigation,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the ''muggles'' in a book Stouffer published
in the mid-1980s entitled ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles''
were tiny and hairless creatures who live on the continent of Aura
in a post-nuclear holocaust world set hundreds of years in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone even vaguely familiar with the Harry Potter books, and
the use of the term 'Muggle' to describe any person who does not
have magical powers, will recognize the absurdity of Ms. Stouffer's
claims,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Diplomats Visit 4 Detainees  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Dutch diplomats on Tuesday visited
four countrymen for the first time since their arrest on
allegations of planning to assassinate President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The detainees were very glad to see us, it's for the first
time in almost four weeks that they had the opportunity to talk to
someone from their own country,'' Dutch charge d'affaires, Kees
Klompenhouwer, told reporters
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been going through a very difficult time,''
Klompenhouwer said.
</P>
<P>
   The four -- Jeroen van Lersel, Bas van Schaik, Sander Zeitsen and
Godfrid de Rie -- were arrested last month on suspicion of plotting
to kill Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities had not allowed Dutch diplomats to visit
their countrymen until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The four were sentenced Friday to 30 days in jail for illegally
entering the country, while remaining under investigation on other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Klompenhouwer said that the four were allowed on Tuesday to
appoint their own attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's information minister, Goran Matic, has said that
the men were detained in July in southern Yugoslavia, attempting to
enter Kosovo province from Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in
the two-state Yugolslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   Matic exhibited footage allegedly showing an interrogation of
the four, dressed in military uniforms, with one of them admitting
on tape to wanting to abduct Milosevic or former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic ''if we come across them'' and ''surrender
them to The Hague.'' Both have been indicted by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague about atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The video also showed maps, pocket tools, knifes and cameras
allegedly used by the Dutch. Another unidentified captive told the
camera that if the abduction of Milosevic failed, one of them ''had
the idea to kill the president, to decapitate his head, to put it
in the box and to send it home'' to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Belgrade supreme military court completed its
investigation of two Britons and two Canadians arrested by the
Yugoslav Army on suspicion of terrorism. The military prosecutor is
expected to decide within a week whether to bring charges or drop
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the arrests of foreigners follows allegations
that NATO has hired mercenaries to snatch fugitive war crimes
suspects on Yugoslav territory.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the arrests are part of a government campaign meant
to strengthen Milosevic ahead of presidential and parliamentary
elections next month.

<HEADLINE> For pheasant love, the Bronx can't match Borneo  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A rare female pheasant at the Bronx Zoo has
decreed two suitors too foul for mating - though they're OK for
casual dating.
</P>
<P>
   ''She spends time with the males,'' an ever-hopeful John Rowden,
assistant curator for ornithology, said Tuesday of the Bulwer's
wattled pheasant. But ''we haven't seen her mate yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for many years, anyway. The unnamed female laid and hatched
eggs back in 1986, but for whatever mysterious reason, she's been
spurning the mating call since then.
</P>
<P>
   She's 16 - clearly no spring chicken, since pheasants of this
species are believed to live only into their 20s. The fellows are 9
and 17, and she mothered chicks with the older male back in the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had the magic and they lost it,'' says Rowden.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma has led to extraordinary efforts to reproduce their
natural habitat - the rainforests of Borneo, a Southeast Asian
island - in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The trio lives away from public scrutiny in an aviary densely
planted with bamboo under a canopy of leaves, ''to give the female
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The males perform a spectacular courtship dance, fanning their
white tails and engorging their blue facial ''wattles'' with blood
as they extend them for the female to admire. She can hear their
stiff quills rattling as they touch the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The display is accompanied by loud vocalization - taped by
Rowden.
</P>
<P>
   The two-note call is played at one-minute intervals in the
morning and late afternoon, to create the illusion that there are
many birds around. ''That gives the males the impression that they
have to display vigorously, and the female that there are options,
that the males are competing for her attention,'' the ornithologist
said.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Rowden: ''I'm working pretty hard on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, wattled pheasants rarely breed in captivity. Even in
Borneo, ''they're pretty rare,'' said Rowden, noting that the
species is declining because of rainforest logging.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio zoo has a mother-and-son pair, and there are
three males in San Diego, in addition to some in captivity in Asia
and Europe. ''We've talked about trying to bring them together,''
said Rowden.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, experts must figure out exactly what might be
missing in captivity, including possibly lots of rain and a
protein-rich diet.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the brown female's feathers have yet to be ruffled
by the black-and-blue males' mating program.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rowden: ''Here are two great males to partake of, and so
far, it hasn't had the ultimate effect we're striving for.''

<HEADLINE> Judge admits to confrontation but denies she shouted profanities  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - As the public trial over her private life
continued, a judge admitted to an angry confrontation with a former
boyfriend but denied shouting profanities at his female companion.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rosemarie Williams was the final witness Tuesday, the
third day of testimony in this first-ever public disciplinary
hearing for a state Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 48, is accused of posing as a police officer after a
series of public disputes she had with Alfred ''Wes'' Bridges, 27.
The judge met Bridges, a sheriff's officer, while serving at the
Mercer County courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The charges could ultimately force Williams, a judge since 1993,
off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14, Williams said she spotted Bridges entering the
Ewing Township restaurant where she and a lawyer from the public
defender's office were eating.
</P>
<P>
   Both Williams and her dining companion told the Supreme Court
Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct Bridges' appearance made the
judge angry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walked up to him and said 'Hello, Wes,' and he laughed. I
said, 'One of us should leave and I'm in the middle of my
dinner,''' Williams testified.
</P>
<P>
   She then followed Bridges as he headed to the men's room, she
said. Minutes later there was another confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Williams told the panel headed by retired Supreme Court
Associate Justice Alan Handler she had problems recalling exactly
what was said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a lot of things said. It was a very, very heated
moment,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge helped Bridges get into law school and she continued
to help him with homework, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges pushed her and she grabbed at his shirt, Williams said.
Among the 25 items logged as evidence against Williams is a blue
shirt with a torn right sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Williams claimed Bridges used her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that he once again exploited me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the restaurant, Williams confronted Bridges and
companion Tami DeVitas of Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, DeVitas testified that Williams was ''loud and
boisterous'' and she used profane language to ask if she was having
sex with Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The judge denied ever using foul language in public that night,
including a common vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   ''No. I know that in our private lives we all use different
language and that is a word that is well known to me. Yes, I use
it,'' Williams said, but ''never in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she drove to Trenton after Bridges left, instead
of heading to her Hopewell Township home. Bridges told her he and
the woman were going to another restaurant there, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In Trenton she saw Bridges and DeVitas outside a popular Market
Street bar and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams talked to her secretary on a cell phone, Bridges
approached.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard Mr. Bridges come in yelling, 'You're going to lose
your job,''' secretary Pam Fruscione testified.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she put the telephone down and approached Bridges,
who said he planned to call police.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the restaurant, a worker called police. Others have
testified that Williams also called police in an attempt to
undercut their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One witness told the panel that after she left the Trenton bar,
a woman called claiming to be a Hopewell Township police officer
and demanded to talk to Bridges. The state claims that was
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is likely to be the final witness. The proceeding is
scheduled to continue Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department awards $7 million to help clear test backlog  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department awarded more than $7
million in grants Tuesday to seven states - including New York - to
begin clearing a large blacklog of DNA genetic samples obtained
from convicted criminals but never analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The grants from the department's National Institute of Justice
will allow these states to analyze 145,783 backlogged samples, out
of a nationwide backlog that a national commission recently
estimated at 750,000 unanalyzed samples.
</P>
<P>
   The money also will pay for entering the analysis results on the
FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), a computer network that
allows comparisons with samples in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA from convicts can be compared with DNA found on evidence
at crime scene and has helped convict, and in some cases clear,
suspects. Like fingerprints, DNA genetic material is specific to
each individual.
</P>
<P>
   The seven states also will use the money to enter DNA analyses
of evidence from unsolved crimes to CODIS.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many cases, investigators are working hard to solve cases
where a perpetrator has been apprehended for another crime and is
already incarcerated,'' said Julie Samuels, acting institute
director. ''These grants will help link cases to convicted
offenders and help investigators devote their energy to cases where
the perpetrator is still at large and a threat to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence
recommended that the Justice Department help states analyze
existing DNA samples that had not been analyzed or entered into
CODIS.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to New York, California, Florida, Minnesota,
Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington will share the first $7 million.
The department expects to distribute another $7 million soon to 14
additional states to work on their backlogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Increasing law enforcement's ability to use DNA evidence in
the fight against crime makes sense and, ultimately, gets violent
offenders off our streets,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno.

<HEADLINE> Poor Sleep Erodes Middle-Aged Men  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Here's some news that could keep middle-aged men
awake nights: A lack of quality sleep may contribute to love
handles and double chins.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Chicago found what appears to
be a link between middle-age spread and men's sleep patterns as
they get older.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the quality of men's sleep decreases with age
along with the body's production of growth hormone. The drop in
growth hormone, in turn, is thought to lead to flab.
</P>
<P>
   Now the researchers are working to see if new types of sleeping
pills or hormone injections can slow signs of aging.
</P>
<P>
   ''We actually know that if we increase deep sleep, we can
increase growth hormone,'' said Eve Van Cauter, a professor of
medicine who led the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study of beauty sleep was limited to healthy men, and it is
not clear whether the findings apply to women.
</P>
<P>
   Van Cauter and her team looked at sleep studies conducted on 149
men from 1985 to 1999. They found that by the time men reach age
45, they have nearly lost the ability to fall into deep sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Men produce growth hormone primarily during that kind of sleep.
In studies of the elderly, growth hormone deficiency has been
connected to obesity and the loss of muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   The men involved in the sleep studies were of normal weight and
ranged in age from 16 to 83. Researchers found that as the men
moved into mid-life, from ages 35 to 50, their total amount of
sleep remained fairly constant.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of deep, or slow-wave, sleep, however, decreased from
nearly 20 percent of a normal night's sleep for men 25 or younger
to less than 5 percent for those over 35. Growth hormone secretion
declined by nearly 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that after age 50, men's total amount of
sleep declined by about 27 minutes a decade. They awoke more
frequently during the night and stayed awake longer.
</P>
<P>
   REM sleep, associated with dreaming, also declined after age 50
to about 50 percent of a young man's level.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Marc R. Blackman of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore said researchers
do not know for certain whether sleep quality influences the
production of hormones or if the change in hormone levels itself is
responsible for changes in sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Cauter said it is clear that more deep sleep produces
more growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
   The research could be used to examine whether growth hormone
injections could slow signs of aging in men during early mid-life,
she said. Currently, such therapy is used mostly for men 65 or
older.

<HEADLINE> Legal Maneuver Delays Cancer Drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A legal maneuver by Bristol-Myers Squibb on
Tuesday is likely to delay the launch of a less expensive, generic
form of Taxol, the world's top selling cancer drug.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers listed a new patent on Taxol in response to a
court order in its patent infringement suit initiated by American
BioScience Inc. The listing with the Food and Drug Administration
could delay the agency from granting final approval for Ivax Inc.'s
generic version of Taxol for up to 2&AMP;frac12; years.
</P>
<P>
   Taxol, which had $1.5 billion in sales last year, was expected
to lose its patent protection later this year, opening the way for
Miami-based Ivax Inc. to be the first generic drugmaker to produce
a cheaper, copy cat version.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said New York-based Bristol-Myers is interested in
doing anything to delay a generic Taxol from coming to market.
Generics, which usually cost less than half the price of brand
names, can erase about 80 percent of a brand's sales within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bristol-Myers on Tuesday rose $1.875 to $52.50, and
Ivax plunged $13 to $29.375, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
	   WAINSCOTT, N.Y. (AP) - A blue and green BMW once owned by
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is to be auctioned for an estimated
$35,000 to $75,000, the auctioneer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Onassis drove the car, a Bavaria 3.0S four-door sedan with
a tan interior, from 1974 to 1992, said Xavier Meignan, president
of Finest Auctions, which will sell the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   She often used it to get to a country estate she shared with her
husband, Aristotle Onassis, in New Jersey's horse country. Tom
Rossiter, a neighbor there, bought the car in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Meignan will sell the car Aug. 31 at the LTV studios in
Wainscott, in the chic Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Onassis died of cancer in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Peru Fines Mine For Mercury Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The Peruvian government fined Latin America's
largest gold mine $500,000 for a mercury spill in June that
poisoned dozens of Andean villagers.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was announced Tuesday in a legal notice in the
government's official newspaper, El Peruano.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Yanacocha gold mine had already pledged to
pay all costs for medical treatment and environmental cleanup.
Company officials last month cited 70 confirmed cases of mercury
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   A local midwife was the only person to fall gravely ill, lapsing
into a coma, said Andres Vargas, associate director of the Regional
Hospital of Cajamarca, 350 miles north of the capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, a truck carrying mercury from the Yanacocha gold mine
spilled about 3 gallons of the toxic liquid metal in the village of
Choropampa, according to the Newmont Mining Company of Denver,
which has a 51.4 percent stake in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury leaked onto a road near the village, 53 miles
southwest of the mine, while it was being transported by a private
trucking firm, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury, a byproduct of the mining operation, is sold to a
Lima-based firm that uses it for medical equipment.

<HEADLINE> 'Potter' Case To Be Decided in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A dispute between the creators of the popular
Harry Potter children's book series and a Pennsylvania woman who
says she owns the rights to the ''Muggles'' trademarks will be
decided in Manhattan, a judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The decision filed Monday by U.S. District Judge Allen G.
Schwartz was a legal victory for the book's author, J.K. Rowling,
the book series' publisher, Scholastic Inc., as well as Time Warner
Entertainment Co., which owns film and merchandising rights.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz declined to dismiss the lawsuit brought by Rowling, who
lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the companies against Nancy
Stouffer of Camp Hill, Pa. They sought a court declaration that
they have not infringed on any of Stouffer's copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Rowling, Scholastic and Time Warner referred
questions in the case to Scholastic, which forwarded a statement
issued in late March saying that Stouffer's ownership claims to the
word ''muggles'' were absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Rowling's creative mind works in a world filled with myths
and legends, but let there be no doubt that these books are her
unique creations. Unfortunately, nowadays, success seems to breed
not only imitation but also litigation,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the ''muggles'' in a book Stouffer published
in the mid-1980s entitled ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles''
were tiny and hairless creatures who live on the continent of Aura
in a post-nuclear holocaust world set hundreds of years in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone even vaguely familiar with the Harry Potter books, and
the use of the term 'Muggle' to describe any person who does not
have magical powers, will recognize the absurdity of Ms. Stouffer's
claims,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Stouffer initially responded to the lawsuit with one of her own,
filed in Philadelphia, and sought to have the Manhattan lawsuit
thrown out or transferred to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz ruled that Stouffer, by having her own books
published and asserting her claims against the Harry Potter books,
had engaged in enough business in New York City to cause the case
to be litigated there.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Casey, a lawyer for Stouffer, said he was unlikely to
appeal Schwartz's ruling because he was eager to prove the
similarities between the Harry Potter books and the creations of
Stouffer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy the judge has ruled one way or the other
because now we can get on to the substance of this thing,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Oyster Creek nuclear plant shut down for repair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORKED RIVER, N.J. (AP) - Operators shut down the reactor at the
Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station on Tuesday to investigate
malfunctioning valves, said AmerGen, its new owner.
</P>
<P>
   There was no release of radiation above normal operating
conditions, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The reactor was shut down at 6:20 a.m. so operators could
investigate why two isolation valves were not working properly, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Operators were performing a test on the system that filters and
removes radioactive materials that may be present in the reactor
building, the company said. The system is only required during an
emergency condition.
</P>
<P>
   The system was shut down so it can be repaired before the plant
is returned to operation, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   AmerGen, a joint venture between PECO Energy Co. and British
Energy Co. of Scotland, bought Oyster Creek Aug. 8 from
Morristown-based GPU Inc.

<HEADLINE> Rash of burglaries linked to escape of burglar from Middlesex Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OLD BRIDGE, N.J. (AP) - Thomas J. Robinson, serving a 10-year
term at the Middlesex County Jail for burglaries here and awaiting
sentencing for other burglaries he committed after escaping last
year, is again at large.
</P>
<P>
   He walked away in mid-July from ''some kind of workshop'' that
he was permitted to attend during the day, police Lt. William
Volkert said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police think about a half-dozen burglaries here since then are
no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the jobs are committed resembles the things he's done
in the past,'' Volkert said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to give specifics, but said that jewelry and cash
was taken and no one was at home during the entries.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 52, should not have been given privileges, given his
prior escape, Volkert said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We locked the guy up twice, we put him away twice, and they
let him out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left late Tuesday afternoon for officials at the jail,
in North Brunswick, were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson lived in Old Bridge, is originally from the Atlantic
Highlands area in Monmouth County, and has family in Wayne, Passaic
County, Volkert said.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Suspends Concordes  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Warned of new official doubts about the Concorde's
tires, British Airways grounded its supersonic fleet in dramatic
fashion Tuesday, pulling a New York-bound plane off the runway.
</P>
<P>
   With the French Concordes -- the only other fleet -- already
grounded, the British decision halts all remaining flights of the
sleek luxury jet that is preferred by many of the world's rich and
famous.
</P>
<P>
   The airline was told that British and French officials looking
into last month's Air France Concorde disaster intended to revoke
the jet's airworthiness certification. Later, the French Transport
Ministry said the safety concerns focused on the plane's tires and
that a formal recommendation that all Concorde flights be suspended
was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The move raised questions about the future of Concorde, which
safely carried passengers through the sound barrier for a
quarter-century before 113 people died in the July 25 crash near
Paris. Air France grounded its Concordes immediately after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the ''initial cause'' of the Air France
crash was a metal strip that punctured a tire, sending huge chunks
of rubber into the area of the fuel tanks. The French Transport
Ministry said it would be premature to resume Concorde flights
given the number of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways' decision to ground its Concordes apparently was
done with some haste. Tuesday morning's Concorde flight to New York
from Heathrow was recalled to the airport gate, rolling back with
37 passengers aboard. The passengers were transferred to other
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Following a series of discussions in recent days, we have
become aware of the likely interim finding of the joint accident
investigators that a single tire burst was the cause of the
accident,'' Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency added: ''We now take the view that the certificate of
airworthiness should be suspended to enable further measures to be
considered to ensure that a satisfactory level of safety exists
with regard to the risks associated with tire bursts on Concorde.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the French ministry on the plane's tires did
not elaborate on the eventual risks. But the head of the country's
Accident and Inquiry Bureau, Paul-Louis Arslanian, said, ''We must
guarantee a satisfactory level of security.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This level of security must be guaranteed, and it is not
today,'' Arslanian told France 3 television.
</P>
<P>
   Arslanian told France 3 the recommendation to suspend all
Concorde planes was likely to be signed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Paris crash, British Airways defended the Concorde's
safety record and resumed service with its seven aircraft after a
one-day pause. In contrast, Air France decided its remaining five
Concordes would not fly.
</P>
<P>
   BA's chief executive, Rod Eddington, said Tuesday that he did
not regret the earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked closely with the investigators and regulators on a
daily basis,'' Eddington said. ''We have been flying this aircraft
in commercial service for 25 years. It's done 50,000 flights with
us and it has a terrific record.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the one Concorde crash gave the airliner one of the
worst safety records among commercial aircraft -- in contrast to
jets such as the ubiquitous Boeing 737 which has had more crashes,
but vastly more flights.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways was operating only one Concorde flight per day
each way between London and New York during August, citing a normal
summer reduction in demand for premium air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions from Concorde users -- often celebrities -- were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm unhappy. I was booked to go on it a week from today to
London. I've flown that maybe 20 times,'' said U.S. film director
Robert Altman. ''I still think it's the safest and most efficient
way to travel. It's safer than getting in your car and going to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabaret singer-pianist Bobby Short said he took the jets to save
time and avoid jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't say I was desolated by the cancelation but I am
sorry about it. It's certainly going to alter my options for travel
abroad quite a lot,'' Short said.
</P>
<P>
   At the airline's Terminal Four at Heathrow, reaction among
passengers boarding other flights was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure today's decision was done because of safety reasons
and because of that I'm happy they have made it,'' said Thomas Lee,
63, at the airline's Terminal Four at Heathrow. Lee was heading for
New York.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy To Seek New Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the deadline for a Mideast settlement
less than a month away, top U.S. mediator Dennis Ross leaves
Wednesday to sound out Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on prospects for another summit.
</P>
<P>
   Ross will be in the region about two weeks, partly on vacation
but also trying to find out if options that were on the table at
Camp David last month can be revamped to produce an agreement, a
senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is prepared to hold a second summit meeting
with Barak and Arafat if they are ready to make decisions on key
issues, including the future of Jerusalem, said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The first summit collapsed primarily over Jerusalem, with Arafat
demanding sovereignty over the eastern portion of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But the official said there could be new formulations of last
month's positions that now might be acceptable. And Arafat, in a
tour of Arab capitals since the breakdown, has gained backing for
any formula he considers honorable, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, many Arab leaders take a tougher stand. President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has said no Arab or Muslim state could
relinquish claims to Jerusalem and holy sites in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has said there
can be no peace until Israel relinquishes East Jerusalem, which was
held by Jordan from 1948 until Israeli troops reunited the city in
the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Barak offered to place the Muslim and Christian
quarters of the old Walled City under Palestinian administration
along with two other Palestinian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Arafat would have had the right to fly the Palestinian
flag on the Temple Mount, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims in
the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   According to well-placed Israeli sources, Palestinian
negotiators informed their Israeli counterparts that Arafat was
under threat of death from Arab extremists and that settling for
anything less than Palestinian control of East Jerusalem could have
cost Arafat his life.
</P>
<P>
   Barak took his proposals off the table and quit the summit over
the sovereignty issue.
</P>
<P>
   However, the idea of reshaping the structure of the city is
under consideration again, diplomatic sources said Tuesday.
Palestinians would gain some local control, with the explosive
sovereignty issue put off for future consideration.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement also would give the Palestinians a state on more
than 90 percent of the West Bank and in Gaza. And most of the
Jewish settlements in the territories would be uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat last year fixed Sept. 13 as the deadline for an
agreement. It remains a spur to an accord, but the Clinton
administration considers reaching an agreement far more important
than any deadline, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But time could be running out. Barak is in political peril,
mostly over the concessions he is willing to make, and Arafat is
confronted with Palestinian impatience.

<HEADLINE> Mondale: Gore Needs To Be Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Vice President Walter Mondale says Al
Gore must ''look within himself and be the best Al Gore he can be''
in his acceptance speech Thursday night -- and not try to outdo his
boss.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a night he should try to be a Clinton or somebody
else, but be confident in his own skills, his own directions,''
Mondale said in an interview on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the star of the Democrats' opening night with a
speech that brought the delegates to their feet cheering. And
Mondale said, ''I have never seen anybody better than Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the former veep to Jimmy Carter said Gore must leave his
own impression.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is his party and he can be himself,'' Mondale said. ''I
would play, if I were he, on my own strengths. Let the American
people see who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondale lost his own presidential bid to Ronald Reagan in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Massive Radio Merger Cleared  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators cleared the merger between
radio giants Clear Channel Communications Inc. and AMFM Inc. on
Tuesday, subject to the companies shedding 122 radio stations to
satisfy federal ownership limits and antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the businesses will create the nation's largest radio
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission approval comes weeks after
the Justice Department signed off on the deal, after seeking
divestitures to address competition concerns.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy both agencies, the companies proposed to divest,
concurrently with the merger, 122 stations, in 37 areas. These
would be sold to either third-party buyers or to an insulated
trust.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, agreed to buy AMFM in
October for $16.6 billion in stock. AMFM has headquarters in
Dallas.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Usually by mid-August, NFL teams can't wait to get
the regular
season started. The Green Bay Packers wouldn't mind if time stood
still for a while.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Packers could be without two of their most important players
when they open the season on Sept. 3 against the New York Jets.
Running back Dorsey Levens underwent arthroscopic knee surgery
Tuesday to remove scar tissue from his left knee. Star quarterback
Brett Favre has a sore throwing arm.
</P>
<P>
   Favre has been told he needs more rest following an examination
that confirmed tendinitis in his right arm. A test showed no tendon
or ligament damage, but his availability for the rest of the
preseason and the first game that counts is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers were worried about more damage to Levens' knee.
Surgery revealed no damage, and coach Mike Sherman said Levens
won't miss more than 3-4 weeks of work.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean he wouldn't be back for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Levens carried five times for 68 yards in Green Bay's 26-20
preseason loss to Denver on Sunday. After the game, he had pain in
the knee, and tests determined surgery was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Levens has been hampered by injuries the last two seasons. Last
season, he rushed for 1,034 yards and nine touchdowns despite
missing two games with a rib injury. He missed nine games in the
1998 season with an ankle sprain and a broken fibula.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Packers receiver Corey Bradford will miss from 6-8 weeks
with a broken left ankle. Running back Ahman Green, Levens' primary
backup, is out for four weeks with a sprained right knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves second-year running back Basil Mitchell as the
Packers' top running back, with undrafted rookie Herbert Goodman
behind him on the depth chart.
Redskins:
</P>
<P>
   Center Cory Raymer, who has started 37 consecutive regular-
season and playoff games, is on crutches with two partially torn
ligaments in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in about a month we'll have an idea of how it's coming
along,'' trainer Bubba Tyer said. ''The hope is getting him back on
the field in six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he has not healed by mid-September, Raymer might need
season-ending surgery.
Jets:
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde's sore toe is healing much quicker than
anticipated. Hurt in last Saturday night's loss at Baltimore,
Testaverde was expected to miss at least a week. But he was back on
the practice field Tuesday and looked fine.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Testaverde was forced to reset his feet before
throwing a pass, and he didn't hobble a bit while doing so.
Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   After spending the last month deciding whether he still wanted
to play football, tackle Erik Williams rejoined the Cowboys on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to leave on top and I was going to leave with a Pro
Bowl,'' said Williams, a four-time Pro Bowl player. ''But I
thought, 'Why not get another one and keep getting them and let
them add up.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not ready to move on yet. I still have a lot to give to
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas won't push Williams, 32, in the preseason, aiming to have
him ready for the opener against the Eagles.
Bengals:
</P>
<P>
   Greg Myers, who signed a two-year contract with Cincinnati in
March, is negotiating an injury settlement with the club. He
suffered a serious knee injury in the Bengals' preseason opener at
Buffalo on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals officials plan to waive Myers, 27, and said an injury
settlement was imminent. Myers started 34 of 58 games for the
Bengals since being drafted in the fifth round out of Colorado
State in 1996.
Steelers:
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to Jerome Bettis, Richard Huntley, Chris
Fuamatu-Ma'afala and rookie Destry Wright leaves Amos Zereoue and
two newcomers as the only Pittsburgh running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to get a good bit of the work, there's no doubt
about it,'' coach Bill Cowher said.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Carolina Panthers last week, Zereoue played halfback
on all three downs in the first half and on third downs in the
second half. Zereoue also played on every special teams play.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pepe Pearson and Lloyd Clemons were signed last week to
take up the injury slack.
</P>
<P>
   Cowher said Bettis and Fuamatu-Ma'afala will return to practice
next week.
Browns:
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Johnson's strained right hamstring isn't fully healed, and
he will sit out Saturday's home exhibition game against Washington.
The second-year wide receiver also missed last weekend's game in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was Tim Couch's prime target last season, catching 66
passes for 986 yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Couch threw three interceptions in the 19-6 loss to the Bears
and admitted that he was pressing.
Buccaneers:
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jerry Ellison, sidelined since hurting an elbow in
the first preseason game, reached an injury settlement with Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, a sixth-year pro, chipped a bone in his right elbow
during Tampa Bay's preseason opener against Washington. He appeared
in 64 consecutive games, mostly on special teams, for the Bucs from
1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His 75-yard run against Detroit in 1995 is the second-longest in
franchise history.
Jaguars:
</P>
<P>
   Still unable to go full speed because of a nagging foot injury,
safety Carnell Lake will miss the season opener and maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   Lake played in pain last season, with a broken bone in his left
foot. He made the Pro Bowl, despite playing with an injury that
made his every motion painful.
</P>
<P>
   With Lake out, the Jaguars will move fifth-year safety Rayna
Stewart into the starting lineup when they play at Cleveland on
Sept. 3.

<HEADLINE> Many DNC Sponsors Remain the Same  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Over roast beef and fried chicken strips,
with singer Al Green providing the entertainment, the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce rented a hotel ballroom with an intricately carved
gold-leaf ceiling to honor Tennessee Rep. Harold Ford Jr. He's a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is clearly the location where there are the most
significant policy makers gathered in one place, along with 15,000
media representatives, so the U.S. Chamber is going to be there to
get its pro-business message out,'' chamber spokesman Frank Coleman
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, dozens of corporations and trade groups, who were as
much a part of the scene in Philadelphia as the Republican
convention delegates and the red, white and blue balloons, have set
up shop 3,000 miles away to sponsor parties for the Democrats in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They are underwriting receptions for the party's biggest donors,
sponsoring bashes for state delegations and having parties to honor
the lawmakers who sit on congressional committees that oversee
their issues.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has drawn the wrath of some Democrats who support
changing the way campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can't the Democratic convention once again be a place where
grass-roots Americans can play at least an equal role with the
well-to-do and well-connected,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin, lead Democratic sponsor of legislation to overhaul
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Business political action committees have given around $65
million to Republican candidates, much more than the $34 million
for Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, DaimlerChrysler, which held several receptions for state
delegations in Philadelphia, has a similarly busy schedule in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, which co-sponsored a Mardi Gras party for Rep. Billy
Tauzin, R-La., in Philadelphia, co-sponsored a similar
Louisiana-themed affair for Democratic Sen. John Breaux Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deal with politicians on both sides of the aisle,'' said
Bill McCloskey, a spokesman for BellSouth, which has given more
than $6 of every $10 of its PAC money to Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth was one of 18 corporate sponsors that took over Dodger
Stadium Tuesday morning to honor the Democratic members of the
House and Senate commerce committees.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sponsors were telecommunications companies that come
under the jurisdiction of the powerful panel, including AT&AMP;T,
Worldcom, Sprint and the United States Telecom Association, which
represents phone companies. Another co-sponsor, News Corporation,
which owns the Dodgers, is awaiting Federal Communications
Commission approval of its proposed purchase of Chris-Craft
Industries Inc., the owner of eight TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Guests got autographs from several former Dodgers, including
outfielder Lee Lacy and pitcher Roger McDowell, took batting
practice, timed their pitches on a radar gun and received bags of
goodies.
</P>
<P>
   So there should be no doubt about the benefactors, the souvenir
T-shirts included the sponsor logos. Some corporate banners also
were strung over the railings of the second deck of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The master of ceremonies was Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., the
top Democrat on the telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Even groups absent from the festivities are making their
presence known here.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Independent Business, the
small-business lobby that has given 93 percent of its PAC money to
the GOP, ran a hospitality suite at the Pennsylvania Convention
Center, opening it to fete GOP lawmakers. There are no NFIB
receptions in Los Angeles, but the organization is still running a
hospitality suite at a Santa Monica hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't look at whether the person has a 'D' or an 'R' beside
his or her name,'' spokeswoman Angela Jones said. ''We look at how
the person votes. We have a lot of people going out to L.A. who are
pro-small business.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber, which has its president, Tom Donohue, and
chief lobbyist, Lonnie Taylor, making the rounds here, generally
supports Republicans. The chamber's PAC has given the GOP $8 of
every $10 it contributes. At the recently concluded Republican
National Convention, the business lobby used two vintage train cars
and a 165-foot yacht to throw parties in honor of GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, business is nurturing its relationship with conservative
and moderate Democrats, whose votes are crucial to getting its
agenda through Congress, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need some Democratic votes to get anything passed,''
Coleman said. ''There is a small and apparently growing group in
the Democratic Party who have a more sympathetic understanding of
the importance of business' contribution to America's prosperity.''

<HEADLINE> Some Wildfire Evacuees Return Home  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON DININNY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- Hundreds of people were allowed to return
to their homes in Montana's charred Bitterroot Valley Tuesday, but
were warned to keep their bags packed just in case.
</P>
<P>
   As they moved in, other people were moving out under a new
evacuation order for the valley's south end.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fires in your mountains will continue to burn until we
have significant rain or snow,'' said Sheriff Perry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Wilma Andrews were two evacuees allowed to return home.
A 9,100-acre fire drove them out a week ago and came within 10
yards of their house near Pinesdale, a community of about 850.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their neighbors' homes are ashes, and charred metal
bands are all that remain of old wagon wheels that once decorated
their yard. Their trees are blackened sticks. But amazingly, their
vegetable garden survived, its leaves not even wilted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll tell you, here's two old people who are glad to be
home,'' Wilma Andrews, 74, said Tuesday as she sat on her back
porch with its dusting of ash.
</P>
<P>
   The Bitterroot burning continues, covering more than 200,000
acres around the valley, as does wildfire activity throughout the
West. On Tuesday afternoon, Ravalli County officials ordered the
evacuation of an area 50 miles south of Hamilton, almost in Idaho,
as an 111,000-acre complex of fires accelerated. The order covered
about 100 homes scattered across a large area.
</P>
<P>
   In what has been described as the nation's worst wildfire season
in a half century, 85 large fires were reported burning on nearly
965,000 acres in the West. Montana's 25 largest fires had burned
more than 385,460 acres, the most of any state, according to the
National Interagency Fire Center.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho was second, with 22 major fires burning over 293,000
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Federal land managers said they are closing the Salmon River and
the 2.4 million-acre Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in
Idaho to public use. Fires were burning over 182,000 acres in the
protected area.
</P>
<P>
   The closure, effective Thursday morning, includes 2,000 miles of
trails, all backcountry air strips and 80 miles of the river, which
is a classic whitewater rafting route. The closure is expected to
remain in effect until fall.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho also announced its state colleges would extend enrollment
deadline to mid- to late-September so students fighting fires can
remain on the lines. Montana took similar action last week.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne said he did not know how many Idaho
students would be affected, but estimated as many as 9,000 of the
20,000 people on fire lines in the West are college students.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of the fire season showed in Yellowstone National
Park, where park managers said they will not fight a 90-acre blaze
deep in the park backcountry because of a lack of firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, former presidential candidate Sen. John McCain of
Arizona canceled a campaign bus tour that he planned next week on
behalf of fellow Republicans running for Congress and governor,
citing the state's fires.

<HEADLINE> Sanchez Has New Fund Raiser Site  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif.,
left open the possibility Tuesday of holding a future fund-raiser
at the Playboy Mansion after party leaders blocked a planned event
there during the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be two years from now, it could be 10 years from now,
it could be 15 years from now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez reluctantly moved the Hispanic Unity event after heavy
pressure from fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez made clear she is unhappy with the attention the episode
has generated. Asked whether she was fueling it by leaving open the
possibility of a Playboy Mansion event, Sanchez said no.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go find another story,'' she said. ''Write a story about
what's going on. Democrats are talking about what we plan to do
with the next four years, and that's what's important, not some
party, not where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez rescheduled the fund-raiser for Hispanic Unity's voter
registration drive for Tuesday night at B.B. King's Blues Club in
Universal City.
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan group, headed by Sanchez, was a key factor in
her close 1996 victory over Republican Rep. Bob Dornan. The victory
got her noticed within the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But party leaders threatened to remove her as party
co-chairwoman and cancel her convention speaker's slot if the
fund-raiser went ahead as first scheduled. Later, Sanchez declined
her invitation to speak at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Although convention and party officials disavowed any connection
to the planned event at the Playboy Mansion, Republicans criticized
it just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy's Hugh Hefner, appearing on CBS, accused the Democratic
Party in this case of ''behaving like right-wing Republicans, and
in a brutish way.'' Still, he said, he planned to vote for Vice
President Al Gore as the ''lesser of two evils.''

<HEADLINE> Kennedy's Appear at DNC Convention  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- She was a child of 8 when her uncle John F.
Kennedy was nominated for president here, only 12 when he was
killed. At age 17, she experienced the awful pain of having her
father murdered while he campaigned for the Democratic nomination
for president.
</P>
<P>
   With the July 16, 1999, airplane death of a cousin, John F.
Kennedy Jr., not far from memory, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, 49,
was one of four Kennedys to appear before the Democratic National
Convention on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Her purpose: to speak out for sharing technology with rich and
poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   Using a figure of speech that would ring true in coastal
Maryland, where she is lieutenant governor, she said:
</P>
<P>
   ''We've established America as a lighthouse of prosperity and
peace. But this didn't happen automatically and there's no
guarantee it will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Kennedy to take the podium Tuesday was her brother,
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 46, an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with the cadence and the urgency that were his father's
hallmark, he argued that -- contrary to what he called the
Republican view -- ''good economic policy is identical to good
environmental policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, who will be the Democrats' presidential nominee,
understands that American cannot afford ''to lose touch with the
seasons and the tides and the wilderness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And Al Gore knows that nature connects us to God as it
connects us to our communities,'' he said. ''It is the way that God
communicates with us most forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy, 42, and her uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, 68,
also were scheduled speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's opening session heard from a fifth Kennedy, Patrick
Kennedy, 33, son of Edward and a Rhode Island congressman. He
invoked the names of Democratic heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to make this country the kind of place that lives up
to its principles of fairness and justice for all,'' Patrick
Kennedy said, ''we need to carry on the fight of John Kennedy, we
need to carry on the fight of Robert Kennedy, we need to carry on
the fight of Martin Luther King, we need to carry on the fight of
Cesar Chavez,'' the farm workers' union leader who died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend, the oldest child of the late Robert and Ethel Kennedy,
urged the country to ensure everyone shares in the benefits of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''While our economy offers unprecedented opportunities, to many
Americans, the Information Age is a distant blur,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must not let it be that our wealth merely affords more
powerful computers to connect us to other elites, but sever us from
the poor in our hometowns.''
</P>
<P>
   She also encouraged government to work with labor and management
''to ensure that people of all ages and incomes have the skills the
marketplace demands.'' She urged that ''the best ideas of our
universities'' be used to create jobs. And she called for
government to undergo ''revolutionary changes'' to keep pace with
business.

<HEADLINE> Crocker Makes U.S. Swim Team  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Seventeen-year-old Ian Crocker completed the
improbable trip from Maine to Sydney, claiming a spot on the U.S.
Olympic swim team by winning the 100-meter butterfly Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker, the first Maine-based swimmer to even qualify for the
trials, was the latest evidence of a youth movement in the men's
program. The Portland native was the eighth teen-ager to make the
Olympic team; only one male teen, Tom Malchow, went to Atlanta four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hannan, 20, of Baltimore was ahead of the world record
pace through 50 meters before Crocker caught him at the end,
touching in 52.78 seconds. Hannan, who attends the University of
Texas, was a surprising second in 52.81.
</P>
<P>
   Hannan ranked 70th in the world last year and his only major
international experience came at the 1999 World University Games.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Atkins became the third University of Georgia swimmer to
make the women's team when she came from behind to win the 200
backstroke in 2:12.97.
</P>
<P>
   Lea Maurer, a 29-year-old high school English teacher who made
the team in 1992, led through 150 meters but apparently went out
too fast. She faded on the final lap and was passed by four other
swimmers, including Lindsay Benko of Los Angeles, who claimed the
second Olympic berth in 2:13.19.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer, of Winnetka, Ill., slipped to fifth in 2:15.12.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, cheered on by the chant of ''It's great to be a Georgia
Bulldog,'' joined college teammates Kristy Kowal and Courtney
Shealy on the Olympic team. Together, the threesome led the Dawgs
to consecutive NCAA championships.
</P>
<P>
   A weary Dara Torres was still better than everyone else in
preliminaries of the 50 freestyle. She breezed through the
preliminaries in 25.23, putting her in the evening semifinals at
the Indiana University Natatorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little bit tired,'' Torres, 33, said. ''I didn't think
it would be this tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Van Dyken, defending Olympic champion in the 50, trailed
Torres in 25.45. The top eight from the semifinals advanced to
Wednesday night's final.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do feel I can win it,'' Van Dyken said. ''This race is my
baby. It's been my baby for a long time. Dara is ahead of me right
now. But I enjoy being the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who came out of retirement in June 1999, was swimming
her fourth event of the eight-day trials, having finished second to
Jenny Thompson in both the 100 butterfly and 100 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Torres also competed in the prelims of the 200 free, but was
forced to drop out because of uterine cramping. She wonders now why
she even tried that event.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was really ridiculous,'' Torres said. ''I thought about
scratching but, no, I had to be some kind of wonder woman. I should
have taken the day off. That took a lot out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 100 free, Torres crawled from the pool with severe leg
cramps, nearly collapsing on the deck. Returning to the pool
Tuesday morning, the pre-meet advice from coach Richard Quick was
ringing true.
</P>
<P>
   ''Richard told me, 'It's a long meet. You need to know it's
going to take a lot out of you,''' Torres recalled. ''I said,
'Right, whatever.'''
</P>
<P>
   The last full day of the trials was highlighted by Gary Hall Jr.
in the men's 50 free.
</P>
<P>
   The silver medalist from the Atlanta Games eclipsed 22 seconds
in both the prelims and semis, sending him to the eight-man final
with a shot at breaking the decade-old American record of 21.81
held by Tom Jager.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, suspended for a positive marijuana test in 1998 and
diagnosed last year with diabetes, was being challenged by
defending world champion Bill Pilczuk, Neil Walker and Anthony
Ervin, who became the first swimmer of black heritage to make the
team as part of the relay team.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Bennett of Plant City, Fla., and Diana Munz of Chagrin
Falls, Ohio, were expected to battle in the women's 800 free, the
event Bennett won at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   The trials conclude Wednesday with the women's 50 free and the
marathon of swimming, the men's 1,500 free.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Thompson, bronze medalist at the 1999 Pan Pacific
championships, was fastest qualifier in the 1,500. The 21-year-old
from Roseburg, Ore., finished in 15:21.71 and hopes to break George
DiCarlo's 16-year-old American record of 15:01.51.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been slowly improving every year -- 10 seconds here, 20
seconds there,'' Thompson said. ''I'm not a superstar who came out
of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also would like to end the U.S. drought in the 1,500.
The Americans haven't won an Olympic medal since Mike O'Brien and
DiCarlo went 1-2 at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't count because the Russians weren't there,''
Thompson said. ''The mentality of a lot of an Americans is the
quick, easy thing. They like being the fastest. They don't want to
put in the hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Thompson, Jenny, dropped out of the women's 50 free
after qualifying for Sydney in at least four events. Also absent
was Angel Martino, second to Van Dyken in the 1996 trials. Martino
left this year after failing to make the 100 free final.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always want the best swimmers in there,'' Torres said,
''but you've got to do what's best for you.''

<HEADLINE> Nurses at Virtua's Mount Holly hospital approve 37-month contract  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Registered nurses employed by
Virtua/Memorial Hospital of Burlington County voted Tuesday to
approve a 37-month contract addressing some of the industry's
thorniest issues.
</P>
<P>
   The union nurses, who work at the Mount Holly hospital or for
its home care service, won a contract that boosts wages
substantially, provides bonuses for increasing their skills and
sharply limits forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Jeanne Otersen said about 75 percent of the 650
nurses voted. The contract was approved by 98.5 percent of those
who voted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses' union, the Emerson-based Health Professionals and
Allied Employees, recommended approval of the contract after
reaching an agreement Monday, according to Otersen. The deal offers
an average wage increase of 14 percent over its three years.
</P>
<P>
   It also limits mandatory overtime - a serious problem for the
many nurses with children - to two extra four-hour shifts each
month, and only when an emergency exists. Nurses at many hospitals
complain that tight staffing routinely forces them to work long
hours when co-workers are ill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the contract, the nurses must get an hour's notice before
any overtime begins, plus time to arrange child care or to pick up
and drop their children off with a babysitter, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Management at Virtua/Memorial really listened to the
experiences of nurses and our concerns over staffing, overtime, and
recruitment and retention of qualified nurses,'' said Joan Johnson,
president of the HPAE local at the hospital. ''This contract
reflects the commitment of both the RNs and the hospital to nursing
excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract runs from Aug. 27, when the current one expires,
until Sept. 27, 2003. It includes provisions to give bonuses for
continuing education or earning new certifications, and gives
cumulative raises as big as 25 percent to the most experienced
hospital nurses and those in the hospital's Community Nursing
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patients are leaving the hospital more quickly, meaning that
their needs for home care have increased dramatically,'' said Patty
Nelson, who handles grievances for nurses in the home care service.
''With this contract, we can attract and keep skilled nurses in
home care.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurses and union activists say limited salary increases,
staffing shortages and increased patient loads have been driving
experienced nurses out of the business, contributing to the growing
national shortage of nurses and threatening the quality of patient
care.
</P>
<P>
   Even executives at New Jersey hospitals - most of which are
losing money because of slashed reimbursements from the government
and insurers - seem to accept the view that contracts addressing
such concerns are key to retaining good nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ''A big part of Virtua's present and future is in nursing
excellence, and certainly this type of contract creates that type
of partnership with our nurses,'' said Ed Dunn, vice president of
human resources for Virtua Health, which operates the Mount Holly
hospital and others in Berlin, Camden, Marlton and Voorhees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it's a fair contract for the nurses, for the
organization, and it will help us serve the community,'' Dunn said
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts recently negotiated at Robert Wood Johnson University
Hospital in New Brunswick and Cooper Hospital/University Medical
Center in Camden included provisions limiting forced overtime and
floating of nurses to unfamiliar units.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HPAE, other nursing unions and the statewide Patients
First Coalition have been urging Gov. Whitman to sign legislation
limiting the use of mandatory overtime in hospitals and nursing
homes. The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Vitale and
Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, was passed and sent to the governor
in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ''HPAE and Virtua/Burlington are ahead of the curve,'' said
Vitale. ''I congratulate them, and hope their achievements can be
duplicated statewide.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Jumps off SFC Bridge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The boyfriend of a woman whose body was
found along a remote coastal highway killed himself Tuesday by
jumping off the Bay Bridge, shortly after the body was identified,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Darion Sable jumped off an approach to the San Francisco-Oakland
Bay Bridge Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Dewayne Tully said.
He fell about 100 feet, landing on pavement in a fenced-in area.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes earlier and five blocks away, Sable had been
released on his own recognizance after being jailed overnight on a
drug charge, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide Inspector Tony Casillas wouldn't say whether police
told Sable he was a suspect in his girlfriend's death before
letting him go.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation is still in its primary stages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sable told police that Jerusha Briley, 20, disappeared Saturday
morning while going to buy groceries for her 23-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Sable called police Saturday to report Briley missing, saying
she wasn't the type to leave the house, let alone her toddler, for
more than a few hours without letting people know where she was.
</P>
<P>
   Briley's body was found Monday. Police haven't determined the
cause of death.

Russia Lowers Capsule To Sunken Sub
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian rescuers lowered a bell-shaped capsule early Wednesday
to a nuclear submarine lying on the Arctic Sea floor, but there was no immediate
word that it had docked. Oxygen for the vessel's 116 crewmen was expected last
just two more days, Russia's navy chief said. It was the first word that the
escape apparatus had reached the vicinity of the sunken submarine -- which U.S.
officials said might have gone down following an explosion -- since repeated
efforts that began Tuesday were foiled by storms on the Barents Sea.

nation. ''We're going forward, to even better times,'' the vice president
declared to a cheering crowd after Clinton left the lectern that bore his
presidential seal. ''Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy right. And I'm
pledging to you here today, I am not going to let the other side wreck it and

Lieberman Favors Affirmitive Action

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman
allayed the concerns of some prominent blacks -- an important Democratic
constituency -- by telling them today he would stand with them in support of
affirmative action and civil rights. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who had been
the most vocal in expressing doubts about Lieberman, said afterward that she
would campaign for him. The senator from Connecticut reminded about 300 members
of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Democratic National Committee's Black
Caucus and others that in 1963, he marched on Washington with Martin Luther King
Jr. and went into Mississippi to register black voters.

Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on prospects for
another summit. Ross will be trying to find out if options that were on the
table at Camp David last month can be revamped to produce an agreement, a senior
U.S. official told The Associated Press. President Clinton is prepared to hold a
second summit meeting with Barak and Arafat if they are ready to make decisions
on key issues, including the future of Jerusalem, said the official, speaking on

<P>
   Remarks by Caroline Kennedy to the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Remarks are as prepared for
delivery:
</P>
<P>
   Thank you. Thank you all very, very much. It's an honor to be
here with you.
</P>
<P>
   I feel a special sense of kinship here tonight - You see, in
more ways than one, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the Gore
family.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half a century ago, when my father and mother were
first getting to know each other, two of the helpful matchmakers
were Al Gore's parents, Albert and Pauline. Al Gore and I share
something more than that happy circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Both of us were raised to believe that we can make the world new
again - if only we try.
</P>
<P>
   That is what my father sought to do 40 years ago, in this city,
when he stood before you and declared the opening of the New
Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a set of promises, he said, but a set of challenges -
challenges of the mind and heart and spirit - the challenge of
giving of ourselves, of giving to our country.
</P>
<P>
   I know that when my brother John and I were growing up, hardly a
day went by when someone didn't come up to us and say: ''Your
father changed my life. I went into public service because he asked
me.''
</P>
<P>
   I take great pride in knowing that one of those he inspired to
enter public life is the next vice president of the United States -
Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   So as I look out across this hall, and across this country, I
know that my father's spirit lives on - and I thank all of you.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time but a timeless call.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are the New Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   And now, when many of us are doing so well, it is time once
again to ask more of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   As much as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a
prosperity of kindness and decency.
</P>
<P>
   We need a president who will work to create an America where our
parents and grandparents feel secure, our children are cared for,
and Americans grow up believing that each one of us is necessary to
make our democracy work.
</P>
<P>
   We need a President who is not afraid of complexity, who
believes in an open and tolerant society, and who knows that the
world can be made new again - and that president is Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When I was writing a book on the Bill of Rights, I spoke with a
woman who had spent 15 years fighting for the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked her why she had given up so much of her life to do
this, she said, ''It's up to each of us to create a government that
is close to our heart's desire. ... Because, if we don't do it,
somebody else will.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up to every single one of us to leave this convention and
work as hard as we can to help Al Gore create the America of our
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Because, let me tell you that somebody else's government is not
what we want.
</P>
<P>
   If we believe in civil rights and human rights - and closing the
racial divide - then it is up to us.
</P>
<P>
   If we believe in clean air and clean water - then it is up to
us.
</P>
<P>
   If we want a Supreme Court that will protect the freedoms in the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights - including the right to
privacy - that will keep our personal financial and medical
information from being up for grabs - and will guarantee our right
to make our own reproductive decisions - then it is up to us.
</P>
<P>
   If we believe that we have seen enough gun violence in our land
and in our lifetimes - that guns should no longer take the lives of
those we love - then it is up to us.
</P>
<P>
   If we believe in these things, then it is up to us to elect Al
Gore and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   I was lucky enough to grow up in a world where adults taught by
example.
</P>
<P>
   They dreamed impossible dreams, yet they fought hard each day to
make those dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
   They taught us the importance of faith and family, and how these
values must be woven together into lives of purpose and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   That is what my husband Ed and I want for our three children.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Al and Tipper Gore want for their children.
</P>
<P>
   That is what we all want for America's children.
</P>
<P>
   And, I believe that is what my father wanted for us, as he stood
here four decades ago - not only to make better the world that
surrounds us, but to dream of something more.
</P>
<P>
   I thank all Americans, for making me and John, and all our
family, a part of your families - for reaching out and sustaining
us through the good times, and the difficult ones, and for helping
us dream my father's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our call is to the young at heart, regardless of age,'' he
said. ''A whole world looks to see what we will do. We cannot fail
their trust; we cannot fail to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it gives me great pride to introduce to you a man who has
never stopped trying, who has worked harder than anyone for the
world my father envisioned, whose public service is an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The nation knows him as a courageous fighter for working
families; a voice for the elderly; a champion of all who have been
left out, or locked out, of America's promise.
</P>
<P>
   For his mother, his brothers and sisters, his children, for me
and my cousins, he has always been there when we needed him.
</P>
<P>
   My father was his godfather, and he is godfather now to my
daughter Rose. To all my children, he's like a godfather and
grandfather rolled into one. So much so, that the stuffed bear Rose
sleeps with at night is not called Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Uncle Teddy. No uncle could be better.
</P>
<P>
   No senator has ever achieved more.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Netherlands' U.N. ambassador charged
Monday that Bosnia's loss of $500 million in revenue to smugglers
is so large that high-level government officials must be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bosnian authorities must redouble their efforts to stamp
out crime and corruption,'' Ambassador Peter van Walsum told the
Security Council, calling current government efforts insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's deputy U.N. ambassador Milos Prica agreed that the
struggle against corruption and smuggling must be on the agenda
every day, but countered that these activities are diminishing
every month.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly unhappy with van Walsum's allegations, he challenged the
ambassador to provide names, dates and places of corrupt activities
by government officials. ''I think he has to bring evidence,''
Prica said after the Security Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Prica noted that a former Bosnian interior minister and
part-owner of a bank in which the U.S. government lost $900,000 was
arrested Aug. 5, reportedly on charges related to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has concluded that corruption is impeding
economic, political and judicial reform in Bosnia, which has
received $4 billion in outside help since 1996. In May, 46 nations
on Bosnia's Peace Implementation Council said democratic reforms
and the rule of law were starting to take root, but complained that
corruption was running rampant.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, which ended the 3&AMP;frac12;-year war in
Bosnia, effectively split the country into a Muslim-Croat
federation and a Bosnian Serb republic and put them under
international supervision.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's open Security Council meeting, members praised the
sharp increase in refugee returns and the expansion of the
multiethnic State Border Service, but called for greater efforts to
build common state institutions, reform the judiciary and police,
and tackle corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Van Walsum said the budgets for both the Muslim-Croat federation
and the Bosnian Serb republic are facing a revenue shortage of
almost 30 percent -- which he said was the result of a weak system
of collecting duty and taxes, corruption and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been estimated that every year $500 million of domestic
revenue is lost into smuggling, particularly of cigarettes,'' he
told the council.''Without this loss of revenue, there would be no
budget deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Walsum warned that crime and corruption threaten full
implementation of the Dayton peace accord, future World Bank
funding, and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Prica, the Bosnian envoy, called corruption a legacy of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very hard to fight in a short period of time,'' he said,
''but I think there is a significant step forward in terms of
seeing diminishing corruption and smuggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia needs widespread privatization to promote better jobs and
higher salaries coupled with a new tax and banking system and
better duty collections to increase the current tiny budgets and
bring in more revenue, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Rookie Charged With Misdemeanor  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Utah Jazz rookie DeShawn Stevenson was
charged with a misdemeanor Tuesday for throwing punches in a high
school brawl on the night he was drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, 19, and Fresno State football recruit Christopher Lee
Sims, 18, were charged with fighting in a public place, according
to a complaint by the Fresno County District Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Sims also was charged with misdemeanor counts of resisting
arrest and possessing a deadly weapon, a razor knife, on school
property.
</P>
<P>
   The fight broke out June 28 after Stevenson, who was selected in
the first round by Utah, attended a high school all-star basketball
game as a spectator and signed autographs at Buchanan High School
in nearby Clovis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess there were some dudes there who didn't like me,''
Stevenson said later. ''I got done signing autographs and five guys
jumped me.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 20 people were involved in the melee, and Sims and
another man were arrested. Stevenson was listed as a suspect in
police reports but was not charged until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Richard Berman said Stevenson was attacked by two
men on what should have been the greatest day in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''DeShawn is an innocent man,'' Berman said. ''He's someone
Fresno can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed Tuesday against Calvin John Howell, 20,
the other man arrested for fighting and disturbing the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson was practicing in the area Tuesday, but has kept a low
profile since the incident and has refused to comment on the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sims, who played in the all-star game, told police that
Stevenson and his friends started the fight. He did not immediately
return calls for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In results of a lie-detector test that Berman said vindicates
his client, Stevenson said Sims charged him and threw the first
punch. He said he only returned blows in self-defense as he
retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told investigators the fight was spurred by jealousy
over a woman both men had dated, a police report said.
</P>
<P>
   An arraignment was scheduled Monday in Fresno Superior Court,
but Berman said he would appear in court for his client as early as
Wednesday. Berman does not expect Stevenson to appear in court in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the maximum penalty for fighting is 90 days in
jail and a $400 fine. The additional charges Sims faces carry up to
a year in prison each and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, a 6-foot-5 guard who averaged 30.4 points, 9.7
rebounds and 6.2 assists as a senior last season at Washington
Union High School in Easton, was the 23rd overall pick in the NBA
draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz said it was standing by Stevenson and the fight
wouldn't affect his role with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see DeShawn entirely as the victim so we support him,''
said Jazz spokesman David Allred.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson originally committed to play college basketball at
Kansas, but entered the NBA draft in May when his SAT score was
questioned after a dramatic improvement.

<HEADLINE> Expos' Irabu Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal Expos pitcher Hideki Irabu had a bone
spur removed from his right elbow Tuesday during season-ending
surgery performed by orthopedic specialist Dr. James Andrews in
Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, acquired from the New York Yankees last Dec. 22, was
placed on the 15-day disabled list for the second time this season
on July 28, one day after making his first start in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was 2-5 with a 7.24 ERA in 11 starts for Montreal this
season.
</P>
<P>
   His recovery will take 2-3 months. Irabu is expected to be ready
for the beginning of training camp next February.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, who had arthroscopic surgery on May 28 to repair torn
cartilage in his right knee, allowed five hits and three earned
runs in six innings in a 4-3 loss to the New York Mets at Shea
Stadium July 27.

Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Transcription by

<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, I'm speaking about an issue of paramount importance to
every family in America - our right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   I won't mince words. This election will determine whether Roe v.
Wade continues to be the law of the land or whether we return to
the days of illegal abortion when thousands of women died.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the right to choose has been under assault by our
opponents in Congress. They have forced almost 150 separate votes
to roll back our freedoms and impose government's will on women and
their families. They have pushed outright bans on medical
procedures, cuts in family planning and gag rules on doctors. And
they held our UN dues hostage to their extreme anti-choice views.
</P>
<P>
   At every turn, even when we try to reduce the need for abortions
through better access to contraception, they stand in the way. Only
the firm pro-choice commitment of this administration has kept the
right to choose intact.
</P>
<P>
   In this election, we risk losing a generation of progress, so we
owe it to the American people to be perfectly clear - make the
right choice today, or there's no choice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, Joe Lieberman and the Democrats trust America's women
to make decisions for themselves. The Republican platform does not,
even in the wrenching case of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Make the right choice today, or there's no choice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The next president will appoint as many as three or four Supreme
Court justices. It takes only one to tip the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Make the right choice today, or there's no choice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   When we work together to improve access to contraception and
encourage responsible choices through education, Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman will stand proudly on that common ground. Our opponents
have not and will not.
</P>
<P>
   Make the right choice today, or there's no choice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Joe Lieberman trust women, and they have a vision of
a world where every child is wanted, cared for and loved, where
women's lives matter, where the right to choose is safe and
accessible, where we focus on parenting, family planning and
halting the spread of HIV and STDs, and a world where women get the
reproductive health care they need without violence or harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Together, we will elect Al Gore, Joe Lieberman and a Democratic
Congress to keep faith with America's women and America's values.
</P>
<P>
   Together, we will make the right choice today and preserve our
choice for tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Celebrities Talk About Arts, Music  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Talk about music and arts education and
celebrities will listen.
</P>
<P>
   Actors Christopher Reeve and Hector Elizondo, star of the TV
hospital drama ''Chicago Hope,'' headlined a celebrity-studded
panel Tuesday that discussed the benefits of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears,'' Elizondo said.
</P>
<P>
   But it might just have since the panel -- sponsored by the
Creative Coalition and VH1's ''Save the Music'' -- was preaching to
the choir. The audience included comedian Tom Arnold, actors Peter
Boyle of ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and Cary Elwes of ''The
Princess Bride'' and film producer Lawrence Bender. Screenwriter
Steve Sunshine also attended.
</P>
<P>
   What was really needed, according to Creative Coalition
president William Baldwin, was a televised panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's televised we could get the message out across the
country instead of to a room of 250 people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve said studies show that music and arts education helps
students perform better in school and work environments.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have to do is convince these (politicians) that music
and arts education ... is good for the economy,'' Reeve said. ''The
Republicans are reasonable people. They just need to know what the
benefits are.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Mixing politics with music, two of Al Gore's daughters visited
the legendary House of Blues on Tuesday and announced their father
will do an MTV town hall meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to tell you that my father is extremely tuned into
the issues facing this generation,'' Kristin Gore told about 700
young people attending MTV's ''Choose or Lose 2000'' party
featuring R&AMP;B singer Kina Cosper.
</P>
<P>
   Kina performed her latest single, ''Girl from the Gutter,'' from
her self-titled album, as well as an upcoming single, ''Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before taking the stage, the gold and glitter-bedecked
Kina said she didn't consider herself political until very
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel a need to get involved,'' said the singer, explaining
that there were many issues facing the black community that have to
be addressed, from poverty to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Gore and sister Karenna Gore Schiff told the crowd their
father would appear for an MTV town hall meeting on Sept. 26.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman: Faith May Halt Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman
said Tuesday that his devotion to Orthodox Judaism would keep him
off the campaign trail on several crucial days before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just going to do what I've always done and work extra hard
on the days that I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman last week was chosen as Al Gore's Democratic running
mate, the first Jew ever selected for a major party national
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, falls on Sept. 30 and Oct.
1. Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, falls on Oct. 9. Sukkot, the
Jewish harvest festival, arrives Oct. 14 and 15. Simchat Torah, an
annual celebration of finishing reading the Torah -- the word of God
-- and beginning again comes on Oct. 22. Election Day is Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore is a man of faith and he respects my faith and my
observance and he's been very clear that he doesn't want me to vary
from my traditional practices and I won't,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman suggested that his faith won't sway him from defending
U.S. interests over Israel concerns, if it came to that.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Middle East matters, in most cases over time, American
policy has been quite similar to Israeli policy. But if they ever
diverge, as they have occasionally, my record shows that I've
supported obviously the U.S. position,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as an example a plan by Israel to sell a
quarter-billion-dollar advanced airborne radar warning system to
China. The Clinton administration opposed it and so did Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first and only loyalty is to the United States of
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish holidays fall mostly on Saturdays and Sundays.
Lieberman also observes the Jewish Sabbath, the traditional day for
worship and rest that stretches from sundown Friday to sundown
Saturday. On the Sabbath, Jews are prohibited from working, driving
operating mechanical devices or even using electricity.

<HEADLINE> Man Jumps Off S. Francisco Bridge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The boyfriend of a woman whose body was
found along a remote coastal highway killed himself Tuesday by
jumping off the Bay Bridge, shortly after the body was identified,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Darion Sable jumped off an approach to the San Francisco-Oakland
Bay Bridge Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Dewayne Tully said.
He fell about 100 feet, landing on pavement in a fenced-in area.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes earlier and five blocks away, Sable had been
released on his own recognizance after being jailed overnight on a
drug charge, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide Inspector Tony Casillas wouldn't say whether police
told Sable he was a suspect in his girlfriend's death before
letting him go.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation is still in its primary stages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sable told police that Jerusha Briley, 20, disappeared Saturday
morning while going to buy groceries for her 23-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Sable called police Saturday to report Briley missing, saying
she wasn't the type to leave the house, let alone her toddler, for
more than a few hours without letting people know where she was.
</P>
<P>
   Briley's body was found Monday. Police haven't determined the
cause of death.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Arizona pitcher Geraldo Guzman mildly
sprained his left knee while stepping on a ball in Tuesday night's
game against Philadelphia and had to exit in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Bobby Abreu hit a hard grounder back to the mound
that knocked Guzman's glove off. The ball caromed toward the first
base line and Guzman appeared to step on the ball with the back of
his left foot. The injury forced him to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman will be reevaluated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman had allowed just three hits in four shutout innings
before getting into trouble in the fifth when he surrendered four
hits and four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan relieved and surrendered three straight RBI singles
to Scott Rolen, Travis Lee and Pat Burrell as the Phillies took a
5-3 lead.

<HEADLINE> INS Honors Elian Gonzalez Agents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) -- Scores of agents who had roles in the
seizure of Cuban Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives were
honored Tuesday by INS Commissioner Doris Meissner.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center,
Meissner praised more than 100 Immigration and Naturalization
Service workers for their long hours of work in bringing
''Operation Reunion'' to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The operation ended April 22 when eight heavily armed Border
Patrol agents took the boy from the Miami home.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said the seizure was necessary and that all agents
''did an outstanding job under some of the most trying
circumstances imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans who opposed Elian's court-ordered return to Cuba
with his father protested his seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Many objected to the display of force captured in an Associated
Press photograph that showed a goggled agent holding an MP-5
submachine gun as he took 6-year-old Elian, who had been rescued
five months earlier after a boat carrying him from Cuba wrecked at
sea, killing his mother and others.

British Airways Suspends Concordes

that all Concorde flights be suspended was imminent.

U.N. Envoy Charges Bosnian Officials
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Netherlands' U.N. ambassador charged Monday that
Bosnia's loss of $500 million in revenue to smugglers is so large that
high-level government officials must be involved. ''The Bosnian authorities must
redouble their efforts to stamp out crime and corruption,'' Ambassador Peter van
Walsum told the Security Council, calling current government efforts
insufficient. Clearly unhappy with van Walsum's allegations, Bosnia's deputy
U.N. ambassador Milos Prica challenged the ambassador to provide names, dates
and places of corrupt activities by government officials.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Favors Affirmitive Action  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph
Lieberman allayed the concerns of some prominent blacks -- an
important Democratic constituency -- by telling them Tuesday he
would stand with them in support of affirmative action and civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who had been the most vocal in
expressing doubts about Lieberman, said afterward that she would
campaign for him.
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Connecticut reminded about 300 members of the
Congressional Black Caucus, the Democratic National Committee's
Black Caucus and others that in 1963, he marched on Washington with
Martin Luther King Jr. and went into Mississippi to register black
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say a word to you particularly about the rapport
that I have felt over my life with the African American community
in my commitment to civil rights,'' said Lieberman, an Orthodox
Jew. ''It honestly begins with my religion because I believe as a
matter of faith, not just that God created all of us, ... I believe
that every human being is created in God's image.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who was concerned about Lieberman's stances on
affirmative action and school vouchers, earlier had threatened to
''do nothing'' -- neither campaign nor speak -- on behalf of the
ticket led by Al Gore unless Lieberman addressed her concerns.
After meeting privately with Lieberman on Tuesday, she told
reporters she was behind the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has said enough, he has done enough and he has demonstrated
his willingness to deal with issues of concern to the black
community,'' Waters said. ''I feel comfortable in campaigning for
him. I was not going to do it and lose credibility if these issues
had not been clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic convention speakers' podium, meanwhile,
Lieberman got the backing of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who
applauded Gore for placing Lieberman on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Jackson said, ''Al Gore has brought the sons and
daughters of slaves and slavemasters together with the sons and
daughters of Holocaust survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time afterward, Lieberman swept through the convention
hall, where he was greeted by throngs of delegates who rose to
their feet, gave him high-fives and called out, ''Joe! Joe! Joe!''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's embrace of affirmative action comes after years of
skepticism about such programs as well as his continuing opposition
to what he regards as racial quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Not all prominent blacks were completely sold, however.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's selection makes it harder to energize blacks to go
the polls, said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the House Judiciary
Committee's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lieberman has to indicate he's going to be a positive part of
the team in the Gore administration and we're not going to have to
be attacking him,'' Conyers said, adding that blacks, among
themselves, ''say things we never say to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman started the day by surveying the podium in the Staples
Center where he will give his acceptance speech Wednesday night.
Gazing at the expansive arena with a look of awe, he called it an
''only-in-America moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm thankful for the chance of a lifetime that Al Gore has
given me and I want to make it work,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Lieberman and Waters became friendly during their
private talk. At the beginning of his remarks, he disclosed that it
was Waters' birthday and led the crowd in singing ''Happy
Birthday.'' She is 62. After his speech, the two hugged.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-minute speech to the audience, Lieberman acknowledged
the doubts about his voting record but said they were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have supported affirmative action. I do support affirmative
action. And I will support affirmative action,'' he said to
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has criticized efforts to roll back affirmative action
programs aimed at helping blacks gain entrance into schools and
jobs where they've historically been underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also sought to reassure black leaders about his
support for Proposition 209, a 1996 California proposition that
banned state-funded affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the mid-1990s, a reporter had read the
proposition to him and that he responded favorably, saying it
sounded like a basic human rights policy.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, he never campaigned for it even though he was
asked to do so. He added that he made crucial votes in the Senate
in favor of affirmative action in 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding school vouchers, Lieberman said he has only wanted to
test such a system and that his vote in favor of that test did not
draw money away from public schools.

<HEADLINE> 45 DNC Protesters Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Animal rights activists opposed to the fur
trade protested in front of clothing stores and banged on windows
Tuesday as demonstrations continued outside the Democratic National
Convention. Police arrested about 45 people.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds also marched in support of women's rights, labor
unions, education and other causes in spirited but largely peaceful
protests one day after violent clashes with police.
</P>
<P>
   Groups orchestrated everything from their messages to their
outfits. Teachers wore red; labor wore green. Impromptu rallies
sprang up around the well-planned protests and quickly died. Small
groups of people often taunted the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Police, including some in riot gear, met the animal rights
activists about eight blocks from the Staples Center, where the
convention is being held. They also kept the public and the media
out of a two-block area around a California Federal bank while they
made arrests.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people gathered on the periphery, clapping, banging
drums and shouting for the streets to be re-opened before police
ordered them to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were peaceful demonstrators. It was a lawful assembly. This
is an unlawful arrest,'' Geoff Kerns said as he and others were
handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   At Edward Borovay Furs, where protesters banged on the windows,
workers spray painted over the business's name on a green awning
within 90 minutes and prepared to take down a larger sign.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested were charged with conspiracy to commit a felony
based on items found in their backpacks, including flammable
liquids and small fireworks, said Cmdr. David Kalish, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In other protests, demonstrators carrying dove puppets made of
shredded white cloth marched from the abandoned $170 million
Belmont Learning Center to the nearby office of California Gov.
Gray Davis. Some chanted, ''Schools not jails!''
</P>
<P>
   Belmont, built in one of the city's poorer neighborhoods near
downtown, has become a symbol of failure for the nation's
second-largest school system. The district stopped work on the
school after learning it was being built on contaminated land.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a separate demonstration in support of unions and
women's rights moved from Pershing Square -- a center of protest
activity at the convention -- to the Roybal Federal Building, where
two lines of U.S. marshals and police in riot helmets blocked them
from entering.
</P>
<P>
   ''LAPD, go away! Racist, sexist, anti-gay!'' a crowd of hundreds
chanted.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening about 1,500 Service Employees International Union
members, marching to another downtown hall for a strike vote,
stopped for a brief rally in the protest area.
</P>
<P>
   And separately, about 1,000 people rallied against U.S. support
for sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the standoffs and arrests, Tuesday's protests were
without violence.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier outside the Staples Center, hundreds of
demonstrators threw rocks and fired steel balls from slingshots at
police, who answered by firing rubber bullets and beanbags from
shotguns, swinging batons from horseback and unleashing pepper
spray.
</P>
<P>
   The clash Monday night after a free concert by the
anti-authoritarian band Rage Against the Machine came as President
Clinton addressed the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were arrested and at least four were slightly injured
as police chased the crowd, as large as 8,000 at one point, from a
fenced protest.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates inside the arena were generally unaware of the trouble
outside, and debris left from the clash -- rocks, smashed plastic
water bottles and sticks -- was removed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department, which had kept a high profile
on downtown streets throughout the day, defended its actions and
promised an equally strong response to any further trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, state Sen. Tom Hayden, a veteran of
protests at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, and the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California accused
police of unnecessary brutality.

<HEADLINE> Boxing promoter faces sanctions under settlement  </HEADLINE>
By TOM TAIT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Promoter Bob Arum would have his boxing license
restricted for six months and pay a $125,000 fine for making a
payoff to IBF founder Robert W. Lee under a proposed settlement to
be considered by the Nevada Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Under settlement terms, Arum would be banned for six months from
attending weigh-ins and entering dressing rooms and boxing rings at
matches in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Arum's Top Rank company would be forced to open its books to the
Nevada Athletic Commission, share all communications with
sanctioning organizations and provide evidence on payments of any
sanctioning fees during the six-month probationary period.
</P>
<P>
   Arum's lawyers negotiated the settlement with Marc Ratner,
executive director of the state Athletic Commission and the state
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner directed questions to the attorney general's office. A
spokesman for Arum said he was advised by his attorneys not to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement agreement, Arum admits to using poor judgment
when he made an improper $100,000 payment to the IBF's Lee to
sanction the April 22, 1995, fight between heavyweight champion
George Foreman and Axel Schulz, which Foreman won.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a way of saying, you, Robert Arum, have brought discredit
to the sport of boxing,'' said Chief Deputy Attorney General Kirk
Hendrick, who helped negotiate the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick said it was more important to have Arum admit
wrongdoing and impose license restrictions that it was to seek the
maximum fine of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our biggest concern has been that Mr. Arum admit that what he
did was wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern is that his license is now on probation,''
Hendrick said, explaining that the agreement spells out any further
violations would cost Arum's company its license immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is now going to be put on a probationary status that will
have him under a microscope,'' Hendrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement forces Arum to accept a lower public profile but
allows him to continue to direct Top Rank.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's be honest,'' Hendrick said. ''He is Top Rank.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick said Nevada authorities didn't think they could
separate Arum from Top Rank and still allow the company to fulfill
its obligations to fighters. To do otherwise would have jeopardized
the livelihood of innocent people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic commission, sitting as a judicial body, will
consider the nonbinding 10-page agreement Wednesday, according to
Hendrick. He said the commission may accept it, amend it or reject
it and set a full hearing during which witnesses would be called
and evidence presented.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada Athletic Commission filed a complaint against Arum in
July after he testified at Lee's racketeering trial in New Jersey.
Testifying without immunity, Arum admitted during four days on the
stand that he paid Lee $100,000 above the standard sanctioning fee
to win the IBF's blessing for the little-known Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings and sanctions granted by the IBF, as one of the
world's three major sanctioning bodies, play a big role in what
fights and purses a boxer gets. The groups now get 3 percent of a
boxer's title fight purse in return for their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he volunteered the information and cooperated with
federal authorities in their case against Lee and his son.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some reports, Arum has not acknowledged bribing Lee.
Rather, he contends the extra payment was extorted.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his son, Robert Jr., 38, are the only defendants on
trial in a case that alleges IBF officials took $338,000 to rig
rankings and grant favors. They face multiyear prison terms if
convicted of conspiracy, racketeering, fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   The jury has deliberated 13 days and is expected to resume
meeting Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Russia 1, United States 1, Tie  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Two days after blowing out Russia
before an electric crowd a few miles away, the U.S. women's Olympic
soccer team settled for a 1-1 tie with the Russians in a subdued,
closed-door match Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Natalia Barbashina and Joy Fawcett scored the goals, but they
were overshadowed by a scary moment early when Michelle Akers, who
doggedly worked through months of painful rehabilitation to make
the Olympic roster, reinjured her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Akers landed on the shoulder when she was taken down on a foul
tackle from behind near midfield. She stayed in the game, but was
barely able to lift her right arm and was taken out in the 28th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took a fall, and when I braced myself to land, I jammed up
my shoulder on one of the spots that's still tender,'' Akers said.
''It hurts, but it'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers said she will be able to play Sunday when the pre-Olympic
tour continues with a game against Canada at Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of injury was the No. 1 concern of coach April
Heinrichs going into the low-key match, which followed a rousing
7-1 victory over the same team at Annapolis on Sunday. The
Americans would have preferred some rest during their buildup to
the Olympics, but they were obligated to give two games to a
Russian team that had made such a long trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a little tired, and it is tough to get up,'' Heinrichs
said. ''But they're professionals. I think we can do a better job
of that when we have such beautiful surroundings to play in.''
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people, mostly from the University of Maryland, were
in the stands, and the event and the quality lacked the usual
energy of a full international match.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs experimented with her lineup, starting Sara Whalen and
Cindy Parlow at forward, backup Briana Scurry in goal, and resting
Mia Hamm, Tiffeny Milbrett and Kristine Lilly until the start of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen had three successive shots stopped by a defender in the
early minutes before Barbashina, one of the few experienced
Russians who made the trip, scored from 12 yards on an assist from
Olga Letushova in the 28th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The American attack was more spirited in the second half as the
Russians packed their end of the field and played defensively. The
reward came when a hand ball was called in the penalty box after a
corner kick, and Fawcett left-footed the penalty kick to tie the
score in the 72nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett appeared to have the winning goal on her foot when she
charged into the box to chase a cross in the 85th minute, but she
volleyed the ball over the crossbar with only the goalkeeper to
beat. Parlow had a similar, though more hurried, chance in the 88th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   For Heinrichs, the solid finish somewhat mitigated her concern
after a lifeless first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, it's a reminder that we have to play first with our
heart,'' Heinrichs said. ''It's a reminder that there needs to be
an urgency, and it's a reminder that possession's a really nice
thing, but you don't score based on how many passes you get. We've
got to have urgency to get shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers, who has made 151 U.S. team appearances -- including games
in all three World Cups and the 1996 Olympics -- had surgery on her
shoulder in April. The 34-year-old midfielder, who has also had at
least a dozen knee surgeries and suffers from chronic fatigue
syndrome, has said next month's Sydney Games will be her final
international tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Akers returned to the team for a trip to Europe last month and
played parts of three games. She also played the second half of
Sunday's game against Russia and scored her first goal since July
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just trying to manage the pain and strengthen within the
limitations of the injury,'' Akers said. ''Unfortunately I dinged
it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender Marina Burakova earned her 100th cap for Russia.

<HEADLINE> Broward woman, 83, survives 3 days in crashed car  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - For three days 83-year-old Tillie
Tooter survived.
</P>
<P>
   First, a thicket of mangrove and willow trees cushioned her fall
when her Toyota Tercel plummeted 40 feet off an Interstate 595
bridge after being struck from behind by a hit-and-run driver.
</P>
<P>
   The trees then kept her car suspended inches above a snake- and
alligator-infested swamp, saving Tooter from the reptiles and from
possibly drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter stuck an aluminum steering wheel cover outside her broken
windshield to collect rainwater from several storms. That prevented
her from dying of thirst in the 100 degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday morning, dehydrated and covered with insect bites,
she began to lose hope, and wrote a farewell letter to her family.
</P>
<P>
   At about that moment, 15-year-old Justin Vannelli was collecting
trash on the bridge - his father's company has a state contract to
cleanup road debris. He was collecting a bumper when he noticed
some of the trees below were mangled. He looked down and saw
Tooter's car.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Fort Lauderdale Fire and Rescue firefighters were
rappelling from the bridge. Just over an hour later, Tooter was at
Broward General Medical Center, where she is expected to recover.
She was listed in serious condition late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 83-year-old lady had it all together,'' Fire-Rescue
Division Chief Stephen McInerny said. ''That may have made a
difference between surviving and dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Tooter's ordeal began with a late airline flight.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 a.m. Saturday morning, a Continental Airlines plane
carrying Tooter's granddaughter, Lori Simms, and Simms' boyfriend,
Steven Poulos, arrived at Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International
Airport, 3&AMP;frac12; hours late from Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Simms, a Marlboro, N.J., resident, called her grandmother to say
they would rent a car or catch a cab and head to her Pembroke Pines
condominium, about 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said 'Don't be silly. I'm awake. I'll come get you,'''
Simms said. Despite her age, Tooter is mentally sharp and
frequently plays cards into the wee hours, Simms said. Putting
aside her misgivings, she agreed to wait for her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Worried, Simms and Poulos rented a car and drove to her condo.
Tooter wasn't there. They called the police.
</P>
<P>
   A condominium surveillance tape showed Tooter leaving the
complex at 2:54 a.m. Saturday, but now no one knew where she was.
</P>
<P>
   For three days, Pembroke Pines police officers, assisted by
other law enforcement agencies, drove the highways to the airport
and checked the nearby lakes and canals. They found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Simms, Poulos or others, who also searched the area.
Frustrated, the family called a psychic.
</P>
<P>
   ''She didn't know if (Tooter) was dead or alive, but said she
was by a tree or under a fluffy tree, right near a lake,'' Simms
said.
</P>
<P>
   The psychic, by skill or luck, was almost right.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter was stuck inside her car, which was stuck in the trees in
a swamp. She was just one mile west of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. John Bagnardi, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol,
said investigators believe Tooter's car was struck from behind by a
car or truck that did not stop.
</P>
<P>
   The force propelled Tooter's Toyota up a three-foot concrete
barrier, where it slid along the top for 60 feet before tumbling
straight down into the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The car stopped on its side, the driver's door facing down.
Tooter unbuckled her seat belt and made herself as comfortable as
possible. Somehow, she suffered no broken bones or internal
injuries, just numerous cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter told her relatives that her thoughts weren't mostly about
herself, but her family and how they were coping.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is a very strong woman,'' Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   But by Tuesday morning, that strength was waning and she penned
her family a note.
</P>
<P>
   They won't say what it said, saying that's personal.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after she penned the note, a Fort Lauderdale
Fire-Rescue team arrived. They used chain saws to clear away trees,
cut the top from her car with hydraulic tools and hooked Tooter up
to IVs.
</P>
<P>
   On the bridge, another 18 firefighters hoisted her to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Moshe Stav, who treated Tooter in the emergency room, said
her lack of traumatic injuries in the initial collision allowed
Tooter to survive. But there was also something else.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had to have the will to fight,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- J.T. Snow homered twice, including his seventh
career grand slam, and had a career-high six RBIs Tuesday night to
lead the San Francisco Giants over the Montreal Expos 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero also homered twice for Montreal as the teams
combined for eight home runs, tying the record for a game at
Olympic Stadium, set by the Expos and Colorado on April 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Snow hit his second grand slam of the season in the first inning
off Mike Johnson, a solo homer in the sixth off Felipe Lira (3-2)
that put the Giants ahead 8-7 and a sacrifice fly in the eighth. It
was his 10th career two-homer game, his second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The slam was the 11th allowed by the Expos this season, which

<HEADLINE> Appeals court upholds lighter sentence for anti-nuke protesters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld lighter
sentences than the government sought for two anti-nuclear
protesters who broke into a missile silo and did $21,000 in damage.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
issued the ruling in the case of Daniel Harris Sicken of
Brattleboro, Vt., and Oliver Sachio Coe, also known as Oliver
Hydon, of Ridgewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The two, members of the group Plowshares Movement, waited at the
missile silo in Weld County for authorities to arrest them on Aug
6, 1998. They said they were marking the 53rd anniversary of the
atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury in Denver convicted the two of conspiracy to
destroy national defense materials, sabotage and destruction of
U.S. property.
</P>
<P>
   Sicken was sentenced to 41 months in prison and Coe got 30
months. They were also sentenced to three years of supervised
probation and were ordered to pay $21,299 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors appealed the sentences, arguing federal
guidelines called for Sicken to get up to 71 months, and Coe up to
57 months.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge said the sentencing guidelines did not take into
consideration the seriousness of the offense and said there was a
clear difference between ''an act of protest, which this clearly
was, in peacetime as opposed to an act of sabotage during war.''
</P>
<P>
   Sicken and Coe broke into an unmanned silo containing a
Minutemen III intercontinental ballistic missile, according to
court records. They said during their trial they were protesting
nuclear weapons by ''disarming nonviolently and symbolically.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the two cut barbed wire around the silo, used
sledgehammers and chisels to damage an electrical box, the concrete
door to the silo and the rails on which the door moved.
</P>
<P>
   Sicken and Coe also poured water into a circuit and security
pit, hung banners and used spray paint mixed with blood to paint
slogans and designs.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the lack of adjustment in the sentencing
guidelines for the crime's seriousness was a valid reason for not
following them.
</P>
<P>
   The court didn't agree with basing the lighter sentences on the
fact that it was peacetime. But the judges upheld the sentences
because the trial court also considered the risk of death or injury
and threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed analysis ''indicated that the court gave greater
weight to these factors than to the impermissible peacetime
factor,'' the judges wrote.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Knoblauch Still on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- New York Yankees second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch, on the 15-day disabled list for the first time in his
career, won't return to the lineup this week.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is eligible to come off the DL on Friday, but reported
soreness in his right elbow after throwing Monday. He has been on
the DL because of tendinitis in that elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not too good. It's still sore,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said Tuesday. ''I'm certainly concerned because the result of
all the tests have been that it can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre gave no indication as to when Knoblauch might return, if
at all this season.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, batting .291 this year, had never been on the DL in
his 10 major-league seasons until Aug. 7, a move retroactive to
Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   In Knoblauch's absence, Luis Sojo and Jose Vizcaino are
splitting time at second base.

<HEADLINE> OJ Simpson Tries To Stop TV Movie  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson sent his lawyers to court
Tuesday seeking to halt production of the first television movie
dealing with his murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   A judge, however, refused to issue a restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, ''American Tragedy,'' is based on the best-selling
book of the same title by Lawrence Schiller and James Willwerth.
Simpson said it reveals inside secrets of his defense team and
violates his attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names Schiller and former Simpson lawyer Robert
Kardashian as well as Project 95, the company producing the movie
for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge David Yaffe set another hearing for Sept. 6
and said he would read the script in the interim to see if it
discloses any information not already in the book. By the time the
hearing is held, filming on the miniseries is expected to be
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller's lawyers said the challenge comes four years too late,
that Simpson never pursued litigation when the book was published
and that he can't show that the movie will cause him any harm.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of murder in the 1994 slayings of his
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. He
was subsequently found liable for the killings in a civil trial and
ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries, starring actors Christopher Plummer, Ron Silver,
Ving Rhames and Bruno Kirby, is being directed by Schiller. The
script was written by Pulitzer Prize winner Norman Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Gary Bostwick, representing Schiller, said in his brief
that Simpson has been threatening to sue since 1996 when the book
was published. It was republished in paperback in 1997, but he
still took no action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Simpson chose to sleep on his purported rights, waiting until
defendants were in the middle of filming the multimillion-dollar
television miniseries on a tight production schedule to seek
extraordinary injunctive relief,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   Bostwick argued that stopping production would violate free
speech rights and cause millions of dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's lawyers, Adam Belsky and Terry Gross of San Francisco,
filed affidavits from eight members of the defense team who claimed
they were misled into talking to Schiller during preparation of the
book.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were told Schiller was helping Kardashian with a
book and that anything they said would not be published unless
approved by Simpson. Schiller and Kardashian said they made no such
promises.
</P>
<P>
   In his own declaration, Simpson said he sent a letter to all
members of his defense team while jurors were deliberating his case
in October 1995, warning that communications they had about his
trial were privileged.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is permitted to divulge any of our privileged
communications unless and until you receive a written authorization
signed by me,'' Simpson stated in the letter, which was quoted in
his brief.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Survivors Recall Sub Ordeal  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY R. WEBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- When Dan Persico heard that a Russian
submarine manned by more than 100 sailors had sunk in the Barents
Sea, his thoughts flashed back more than six decades, to when he
endured a similar ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brought back instant, unpleasant memories,'' said Persico,
now 82, of Amsterdam, N.Y., one of the survivors from the USS
Squalus, which went down 13 miles off the New Hampshire coast in
1939.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 33 survivors of the Squalus tragedy are still alive.
Twenty-six crewmen died when the sub sank in about 240 feet of
water during its trial run.
</P>
<P>
   Persico and several of the other survivors held out little hope
Monday for the trapped Russian sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say these boys are in some real trouble,'' said Gerald
McLees, 85, of Portsmouth, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The drama of the Russian sub also kindled memories for another
former submarine crewman. Kimo Ward, a retired sonar technician,
helped search for a pair of U.S. nuclear subs lost at sea -- the
Thresher in 1963 and the Scorpion in 1968. No one survived either
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, from Montville, Conn., served aboard the Thresher until
1962 and was scheduled to be on the sub during its last voyage in
April 1963 -- but had been delayed. He knew half the men on the
doomed sub.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wake up and 60 of my shipmates that I had been with for
two years, all of a sudden they were gone,'' he said. All 129 men
aboard perished.
</P>
<P>
   The Squalus sank when water inlet valves opened without tripping
alarms in the control room. Investigators later blamed a mechanical
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The crew waited 23 hours before a Navy tugboat arrived carrying
a nine-ton diving bell. The bell was lowered to a hatch on the
Squalus to rescue the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   McLees was one of the first to ride up; Persico and Allen
Bryson, then a 21-year-old machinist's mate second class, were in
the last group. The other remaining living survivors are Carlton
Powell of Lompoc, Calif.; Carol Nathan Pierce of Louisville, Ky.;
and Warren Smith of Livingston, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the initial hustle and bustle of activity, you don't
have time to think, you have to stop the water from coming in,''
recalled Bryson, 82, of New London, Conn. ''Then you have to worry
about air.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have enough,'' Bryson said. ''We had very little
oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were given orders to lay down and take it easy on the
oxygen,'' added McLees, then a 25-year-old chief electrician's
mate.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of oxygen was not the only menace they faced on the
Squalus.
</P>
<P>
   Water had shorted out one of the ship's two batteries, creating
a rapid voltage drain. One crew member wedged himself into a narrow
crawl space to shut off the power.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably a little colder out there (in the Barents Sea)
than what we had, but we had no lights,'' McLees said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing doubt that the Russians can be rescued, Persico,
a seaman first class aboard the Squalus, offered reason for
optimism. Despite being one of the last seaman rescued, ''I never
gave up hope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All submariners are like a brotherhood,'' said Ward. ''We're a
very small group. Even though we were enemies at one point, we all
share something most people don't.''

<HEADLINE> Light Rail Train Crashes at BWI  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL CUSICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- A light rail train carrying passengers to
Baltimore-Washington International Airport slammed into a steel
safety barrier outside the airport's International Pier on Tuesday,
injuring 22 people.
</P>
<P>
   The 7:15 a.m. accident was the second this year involving a
light rail train approaching the stop at the busy airport.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not know how many passengers were on the train,
but said most of the 22 injured were in the front car with the
operator, identified as Dentis David Thomas. Passengers were
treated mainly for bruises, back and neck pain and contusions.
</P>
<P>
   A federal investigator said Tuesday night that the accident was
a ''carbon copy'' of a February crash that sent 24 people to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The driver in the earlier accident admitted using cocaine and
prescription drugs before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''We view it as a very serious accident, especially in light
that it's essentially the same accident that occurred on Feb. 13,''
said John Hammerschmidt of the National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   He said a preliminary investigation showed no signs that the
brakes had been applied and found the track signals had worked
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who has driven light-rail trains since 1994, told police
that he ''blacked out'' while pulling into the station, according
to a police report. He was treated for minor injuries and submitted
to drug and alcohol tests immediately after the accident, officials
said. Results of those tests were not available.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck left the front of the train crushed and ridden up onto
the abutment at the end of the line, damaging the roof of the
terminal, Mass Transit Administration spokesman Frank Fulton said.
Investigators had not ruled out mechanical failure as the cause of
the crash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Allen, chief of the airport fire and rescue department,
said when firefighters arrived, there were people both inside and
outside the train, with some laying on the ground outside.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Davis, a passenger who injured his shoulder, said he had
to manually open a door on the train to leave the car after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''The train started to slow down, I got up to get off, and it
sped back up,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a 26-year veteran of the MTA, has had his driving record
come under scrutiny after three minor accidents in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Transit Administrator Ronald Freeman said Thomas was
cleared in two of the incidents where motor vehicles ran into his
train at rail crossings. But in July 1999, Thomas was suspended for
three days after a car he was driving derailed in a railyard.
</P>
<P>
   A similar light-rail crash at the BWI terminal in February
injured 24, and led to the firing of the train's driver, who was
accused of using prescription and illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The rail line connects the airport and Baltimore's Penn Station.
The first leg of the light rail system, which also serves other
points, opened in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Officials start cleanup efforts in northwestern New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKETTSTOWN, N.J. (AP) - Emergency officials nervously eyed
water levels at several rivers and dams Tuesday as residents
cleaned up from drenching rains that damaged thousands of homes,
wiped out dozens of bridges, roads and dams, and forced hundreds of
people to flee rising waters.
</P>
<P>
   The downpours Saturday and Monday caused many rivers and lakes
in northwestern New Jersey to rise far above normal, and
temporarily devoured Newton's water supply system.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she would ask the Clinton
administration to declare Morris and Sussex counties disaster
areas. She put both counties under a state of emergency, allowing
the state to order evacuations and activate New Jersey National
Guard units to help residents.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Warren County also were inundated.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli on Tuesday asked Clinton to
support the governor's request.
</P>
<P>
   The damage cost will surpass $100 million, Whitman spokesman
Peter McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a kayaker who went onto the Musconetcong River,
which is swollen due to the heavy rains, Tuesday afternoon is
missing. Crews were searching for the man on the river between
Holland Township, Hunterdon County and Pohatcong, Warren County,
according to the Hunterdon County dispatch center. An official said
the area being searched is near where the Musconetcong goes into
the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the kayaker was called off at about 8 p.m.
Tuesday and is scheduled to resume about 10 a.m. Wednesday,
officials said. The Express-Times of Easton reported for
Wednesday's edition that the missing man is Charles Weaver, 48, of
Riegelsville.
</P>
<P>
   An early estimate of flood-related damage in Morris County was
about $12 million, said Rick Loock, county deputy emergency
management coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Sussex County officials did not release estimates Tuesday. Phil
Morlock, the county's health and public safety administrator, said
earlier that the storm caused about $166 million worth of damage -
$80 million of which was to bridges and roads.
</P>
<P>
   State Office of Emergency Management officials said damage
assessments of homes, business, roads, bridges and dams in Sussex
County were complete Tuesday afternoon, but estimates were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County officials said there was no structural damage
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas such as Jefferson Township were still under water and
damage could not be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   State Police spokesman John Hagerty said 2,700 residences and
businesses in Sussex and Morris counties reported flood-related
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Mount Holly said Tuesday morning
that there is a possibility of a quarter-inch of rain Tuesday night
into Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be pretty much dry Wednesday and Thursday,''
meteorologist Dean Iovino said. ''Whatever falls (Tuesday night)
shouldn't create a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the floodwater subsided Tuesday in the hardest hit areas
of Sparta in Sussex County and Jefferson Township in Morris County.
</P>
<P>
   Eskil ''Skip'' Danielson, Sussex County's emergency coordinator,
said Byram and Stanhope still have floodwaters running through
streets, and Lake Hopatcong is still 20 inches above the spillway.
</P>
<P>
   Hagerty said the Musconetcong, which flows out of Sussex County
and borders Morris and Warren counties, remained the biggest
concern Tuesday because its water level has not receded yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're watching that with a cautious eye,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred homes in Byram and Sparta remain evacuated Tuesday
afternoon after Monday's precautionary evacuations, said Sergeant
Rick McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents spent Monday night at a shelter at the Helen
Morgan school in Byram, said Red Cross spokeswoman Cathy
Derechailo. The shelter is scheduled to remain open Tuesday night,
Derechailo said. The other five shelters were closed.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 homes in Sussex County were evacuated since
Saturday, McDonnell said. And 500 residents were evacuated at some
point, Danielson said.
</P>
<P>
   About 51 homes in Sparta suffered some flood damage, township
manager Henry Underhill said Tuesday. At least three of the homes
are probably a total loss, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State emergency workers said 11 bridges in Sussex County
remained closed Tuesday due to water damage, flooding and erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't foresee any quick fixes,'' McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Three bridges and parts of three roads were swept away in
Sparta, where Main Street residents were evacuated Sunday because
fire officials feared a mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   Newton's water supply was restored late Monday night by
connecting its pipeline with Sparta's line, Danielson said. Another
water line was scheduled to be added Tuesday afternoon, but
Danielson said residents should still boil water for drinking and
cooking as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   In Morris County, up to 1,000 single family homes and 200
businesses suffered some flood-related damage, Loock said Tuesday.
He said 400 people were asked to evacuate their homes over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Five roads remained closed in one of the hardest hit area of
Jefferson Township, Loock said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything seems to be holding.'' he said. ''We're keeping our
fingers crossed with the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers were grateful that an additional downpour
Monday night did not add to the problem because it only lasted
about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had continued, it probably would have given us some
problems,'' Danielson said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of northern New Jersey was hit with a half-inch to an inch
of rain Monday, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people were evacuated in Hackettstown Monday amid
concern that upstream dams could burst, according to Gary Wassel,
deputy coordinator of emergency management in Warren County.
</P>
<P>
   Derechailo said the Hackettstown residents were back in their
homes Monday night after being sheltered at Hackettstown High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they get the word they can go back, they run out of
there,'' she said. ''It's not The Ritz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Musconetcong River rose a foot an hour Monday before
cresting in mid-afternoon, Derechailo said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few Warren County residents who lived along the
Musconetcong River were evacuated Monday, said Patrick Rivoli,
county emergency management coordinator. He said damage was limited
to flood water in basements and back yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fared very well,'' Rivoli said. ''God smiled on us Sunday,
and let's hope he's in a good mood the rest of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivoli said a few small bridges on Route 57 near the
Musconetcong River were closed Tuesday as a precaution as workers
continue to monitor the river's level.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't say when it'll surge,'' he said. ''It's a
wait-and-see game.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state is investigating claims that 14 inches of
rain fell Saturday in Sparta when a storm system stalled over the
hilly region. A better estimate is 8 inches to 10 inches, said
David Robinson, state climatologist at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit said bus and rail service out of Hackettstown is
scheduled to resume Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The dam on Seneca Lake in Sparta burst over the weekend,
emptying it and leaving a 25-acre patch of mud.
</P>
<P>
   The floods also destroyed the Tomahawk water park in Sparta
where earthen dams burst and emptied Seneca and Tomahawk lakes,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other dams that have failed include those at Hawthorne Lake in
Sparta, Shawnee Lake in Jefferson, and Lake Tomahawk in Byram,
state officials said.

   Text of Caroline Kennedy's speech at the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Transcription by
eMediaMillWorks Inc.:
</P>
<P>
   It's an honor to be here with you. I feel a special sense of
kinship here tonight. You see, in more ways than one, I wouldn't be
here if it weren't for the Gore family. For nearly half a century
ago, when my father and mother were first getting to know each
other, two of the helpful matchmakers were Al Gore's parents,
Albert and Pauline.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and I share something more than that happy circumstance.
Both of us were raised to believe that we can make the world new
again if only we try.
</P>
<P>
   That is what my father sought to do 40 years ago in this city
when he stood before you and declared the opening of the new
frontier. It was not a set of promises, he said, but a set of
challenges - challenges of the mind and heart and spirit, the
challenge of giving of ourselves, of giving to our country.
</P>
<P>
   And I know that when my brother, John, and I were growing up,
hardly a day went by when someone didn't come up to us and say,
your father changed my life. I went ... I went into public service
... I went into public service because he asked me. I take great
pride in knowing that one of those that he inspired to enter public
service is the next vice president of the United States, Joe
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   So as I look out across this hall and across this country, I
know that my father's spirit lives on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time, but a timeless call.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we are the New Frontier. And now when many of us are doing
so well, it is time once again, to ask more of ourselves. As much
as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of
kindness and decency.
</P>
<P>
   We need a president who will work to create an America where our
parents and grandparents feel secure, our children are cared for,
and Americans grow up believing that each one of us is necessary to
make our democracy work.
</P>
<P>
   We need a president who is not afraid of complexity, who
believes in an open and tolerant society, and who knows that the
world can be made new again. And that president is Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When I was writing a book on the Bill of Rights, I spoke with a
woman who has spent 15 years fighting for the First Amendment. When
I asked her how she had given up so much of her life to do this,
she said, ''It is up to each of us to create a government that is
close to our heart's desire, because if we don't do it, somebody
else will.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up to each and every single one of us to leave this
convention and work as hard we can to help Al Gore create the
America of our ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Because let me tell you, that somebody else's government is not
what we want.
</P>
<P>
   If we believe in civil rights and human rights and closing the
racial divide, then it is up to us. If we believe in clean air and
clean water, then it is up to us.
</P>
<P>
   If we want a Supreme Court that will protect the freedoms in the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights, including the right to
privacy, that will keep our personal, financial and medical
information from being up for grabs and will guarantee the right to
make our own reproductive decisions, then it is up to us.
</P>
<P>
   And if we believe - if we believe that we have seen enough gun
violence in our land and in our lifetimes, that guns should no
longer take the lives of those we love, then it is up to us.
</P>
<P>
   If we believe in these things, then it is up to us to elect Al
Gore and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   I was lucky enough to grow up in a world where adults taught by
example. They dreamed impossible dreams, yet they fought hard each
day to make those dreams come true. They taught us the importance
of faith and family and how those values must be woven together
into lives of purpose and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   That is what my husband Ed and I want for our three children.
That is what Al and Tipper Gore want for their children.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what we all want for America's children.
</P>
<P>
   Now I believe - I believe that is what my father wanted for us
as he stood here four decades ago; not only to make better the
world that surrounds us but to dream of something more.
</P>
<P>
   I thank all Americans for making me and John and all our family
a part of your families ... for reaching out - for reaching out and
sustaining us through the good times and the difficult ones, and
for helping us dream my father's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our call is to the young at heart regardless of age,'' he
said. ''The whole world looks to see what we will do. We cannot
fail their trust. We cannot fail to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it gives me great pride to introduce to you a man who has
never stopped trying, who has worked harder than anyone for the
world my father envisioned, whose public service is an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The nation knows him as a courageous fighter for working
families, a voice for the elderly, a champion of all who have been
left out or locked out of America's promise. For his mother, his
brothers and sisters, his children, for me and my cousins, he has
always been there when we needed him.
</P>
<P>
   My father was his godfather and he's godfather now to my
daughter, Rose. To my children, he's like a godfather and a
grandfather rolled into one, so much so that the stuffed bear my
daughter sleeps with at night is not called Teddy, his name is
Uncle Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   No uncle could be better. No senator has ever achieved more.
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.

Kennedys Appear at Convention
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, 49, was one of four Kennedys
featured tonight before the Democratic National Convention. Townsend, the
lieutenant governor of Maryland, spoke out for sharing technology with rich and
poor alike. Before that, her brother, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an
environmentalist, urged Democrats to back Al Gore. Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg,
the daughter of President Kennedy, and her uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, his
brother, also were to speak.

Lieberman: Faith May Affect Campaign
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman said today
that his devotion to Orthodox Judaism would keep him off the campaign trail on
several crucial days before the election. ''I'm just going to do what I've
always done and work extra hard on the days that I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman
said in an interview with The Associated Press. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New
Year, falls on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1. Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, falls on
Oct. 9. Sukkot, the Jewish harvest festival, arrives Oct. 14 and 15.

Clinton Passes Leadership To Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONROE, Mich. (AP) -- Al Gore stepped out of President Clinton's bear hug and
claimed front stage in the Midwest today, a grateful understudy, ''partner and
friend'' promising not to let Republicans undo what Clinton had built for the
nation. ''We're going forward, to even better times,'' the vice president
declared to a cheering crowd after Clinton left the lectern that bore his
presidential seal. ''Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy right. And I'm
pledging to you here today, I am not going to let the other side wreck it and
take it away from us.''

Russia Lowers Capsule To Sunken Sub
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian crews lowered a bell-shaped rescue capsule early
Wednesday to a nuclear submarine lying on the Arctic Sea floor, but strong
currents blocked initial attempts at docking. Oxygen for the vessel's 116
crewmen was expected to last just two more days, Russia's navy chief said. It
was the first word that the escape apparatus had reached the vicinity of the
sunken submarine -- which U.S. officials said might have gone down following an
explosion -- since repeated efforts that began Tuesday were foiled by storms on
the Barents Sea.

Six Kids Killed in Colombia Clash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) -- Six schoolchildren hiking in the mountains were
killed Tuesday when they were apparently caught in a firefight between
government troops and leftist rebels, authorities said. But an adult who was
with the children said that troops opened fire without provocation and there
were no guerrillas in the area. Colombia's army chief, Gen. Jorge Mora, said the
children were caught in the crossfire of a battle with rebels outside the
village of Pueblorrico, 40 miles southwest of the city of Medellin.

British Airways Suspends Concordes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Warned of new official doubts about the Concorde's tires,
British Airways grounded its supersonic fleet, even pulling a New York-bound
plane off the runway. The airline was told that British and French officials
looking into last month's Air France Concorde disaster intended to revoke the
jet's airworthiness certification. Later, the French Transport Ministry said the
safety concerns focused on the plane's tires and that a formal recommendation
that all Concorde flights be suspended was imminent.

U.N. Envoy Charges Bosnian Officials
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Netherlands' U.N. ambassador charged Monday that
Bosnia's loss of $500 million in revenue to smugglers is so large that
high-level government officials must be involved. ''The Bosnian authorities must
redouble their efforts to stamp out crime and corruption,'' Ambassador Peter van
Walsum told the Security Council, calling current government efforts
insufficient. Clearly unhappy with van Walsum's allegations, Bosnia's deputy
U.N. ambassador Milos Prica challenged the ambassador to provide names, dates
and places of corrupt activities by government officials.

Mets Defeat Rockies 7-5 in Game 1
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Todd Helton went 2-for-4 to inch closer to .400, but control
problems did in the Colorado Rockies as they lost the opener of a doubleheader
7-5 to the New York Mets tonight. The Rockies walked eight batters -- including
two with the bases loaded in the seventh inning -- as the Mets broke a 4-4 tie
on a run-scoring wild pitch to win for the 17th time in 21 games.

<HEADLINE> Skaneateles resident finishes Finger Lakes' row  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA, N.Y. (AP) - A 44-year-old Skaneateles resident ended the
last of his guide boat row across each lake in the Finger Lakes
region on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I worked out in the lawn all day,'' Dave Petters
said upon reaching the shore of Seneca Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Petters, a chiropractor who enjoys long-distance
hiking, biking and now rowing, decided to row across Otisco,
Skaneateles, Owasco, Cayuga, Keuka, Canandaigua, Honeoye, Canadice,
Hemlock, Conesus and Seneca lakes.
</P>
<P>
   He would row solo across each one, meeting his family at the end
of a different lake at the end of each row.
</P>
<P>
   He used his last row on Seneca Lake to raise nearly $500 for the
SAVES ambulance service in Skaneateles.
</P>
<P>
   Adirondack Guide Boat Co. in Vermont loaned him a guide boat for
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   After 36 miles and 11 lakes, Petters said he's developed an
affection for the boat,'' which he says ''bobs like a cork and goes
like an arrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Each lake, Petters said, has a message. Seneca's, the longest,
was perseverance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was waiting for the lightning bolt or a revelation,'' he
said. ''But I ended up thinking about how much my butt hurt or
about that mosquito that wouldn't go away. The simple things took
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaneateles is 16 miles southwest of Syracuse.

	   OTTAWA (AP) - Talmadge Nunnari drove in three runs to lead the
Ottawa Lynx to a 5-4 win over the Buffalo Bisons in International
Baseball league action Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> A parade of Kennedys -- Kathleen, Caroline, Robert and Uncle Ted  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Caroline Kennedy, standing figuratively where
her father stood, paraphrased John F. Kennedy's challenge 40 years
ago and summoned her generation ''once again to ask more of
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   After so much Kennedy tragedy, it was a rare appearance Tuesday
for an intensely private person and an emotional return to Los
Angeles, where she was a tot when her father was nominated in 1960
- a happy triumph that was followed first by his murder in 1963 and
then by the slaying of her uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful were all in the jammed convention hall of the most
recent Kennedy tragedy, the airplane death on July 16, 1999, of her
younger brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy's task was to introduce her uncle, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, the liberal warhorse of Democratic conventions, who
delivered a more traditional political speech, but started with a
gem of family history.
</P>
<P>
   So close was the 1960 presidential election, Edward Kennedy
recalled, that John F. Kennedy went to bed on election night
uncertain whether he or Republican Richard Nixon had won. The news
was delivered the next morning, when 3-year-old Caroline jumped on
JFK's bed and shouted, ''Good morning, Mr. President!''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy's long ties to the Democratic Party were captured
by the music that accompanied his entrance and departure - ''You're
Still the One.''
</P>
<P>
   When Caroline Kennedy spoke, she faced a whirl of blue signs
that said, simply, ''Caroline.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not need to remind anyone who she was quoting. It was
her father. In his inauguration, he implored: ''And so my fellow
Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you
can do for your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy's rendition took account of America's
prosperity. ''Now, when many of us are doing so well, it is time
once again to ask more of ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her uncle said Al Gore's election would result in ''the greatest
chance of my lifetime and the lifetime of our nation to secure the
promise of health care for all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been only three times in my life that I have
supported candidates for president as early and as enthusiastically
as I have supported Al Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two of them were my brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Kennedys were preceded to the podium by two others -
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant governor of Maryland, and
Robert Kennedy Jr., whose urgent voice echoed his father's as he
made a case for saving the environment. While Ted and Caroline
Kennedy spoke, their spouses sat nearby on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Determinedly private and nonpolitical, Caroline Kennedy is a
lawyer and co-author of a book on privacy and another on the Bill
of Rights. She is married to Edwin Schlossberg, a museum and theme
park designer.
</P>
<P>
   Embracing the Democratic ticket of Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman,
she recalled her father's nomination and speech in which he called
for courage and sacrifice on a ''New Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time but a timeless call,'' she said. ''Now we are the New
Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Kathleen Townsend, 42, spoke out for sharing
technology with rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   Using a figure of speech that would ring true in coastal
Maryland, she said:
</P>
<P>
   ''We've established America as a lighthouse of prosperity and
peace. But this didn't happen automatically and there's no
guarantee it will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kennedy Jr., 46, in his speech argued that - contrary to
what he called the Republican view - ''good economic policy is
identical to good environmental policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's opening session heard from a fifth Kennedy, Patrick
Kennedy, 33, son of Edward and a Rhode Island congressman. He
invoked the names of Democratic heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to make this country the kind of place that lives up
to its principles of fairness and justice for all,'' Patrick
Kennedy said, ''we need to carry on the fight of John Kennedy, we
need to carry on the fight of Robert Kennedy, we need to carry on
the fight of Martin Luther King, we need to carry on the fight of
Cesar Chavez,'' the farm workers' union leader who died in 1993.
