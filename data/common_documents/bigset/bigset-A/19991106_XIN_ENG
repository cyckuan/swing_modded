<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Turkey initialed a
declaration on joint efforts against terrorism here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the document, initialed by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Bulent Ecevit, the two sides
expressed their "contempt of international terrorism and the
common wish to fight this evil that has affected a significant
number of countries," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn terrorism in any manifestations," Putin said.
"Russia did not and will not support any terrorist aspirations
against Turkey, wherever they come from."
</P>
<P>
During the Ecevit's visit, several bilateral accords were also
signed. They covered media cooperation, visa-free travel by people
with diplomatic passports and collaboration in the veterinary
field..
</P>
<P>
The two sides had planned to also sign a deal on a gas project
code-named Blue Stream, but the signing was postponed to a later
date so that the two sides could work out some remaining technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
Putin played down the postponement, saying the media "should
make no tragedies of the fact that something has not been signed
today," the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we have not broken anything from the
perspective of the previous accords on the Blue Stream project,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, for his part, said the implementation of the project
agreement signed in December 1997 is going at full swing.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who is scheduled to conclude his Russia visit on
Saturday, will also have talks with Russian Federation Council
speaker Yegor Stroyev and State Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House to Vote on Compromised Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congressional
leaders Friday began pushing a foreign aid bill for the fiscal
year 2000 through the House after the Clinton administration and
the Republicans reached a compromised deal.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, negotiators from the two sides agreed to
increase the funding from 12.7 billion U.S. dollars to 15.3
billion U.S. dollars for the bill.
</P>
<P>
Saying it's far from adiquate, President Bill Clinton vetoed the
bill which was approved by Congress last month. Clinton indicated
the cutback of funding for foreign operation is an evidence of
"new isolationism" in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats seemed likely to join Republicans in supporting
the compromised bill as Republicans agreed to add nearly three
billion U.S. dollars to the original bill.
</P>
<P>
Republicans agreed to add the full 1.8 billion U.S. dollars
Clinton requested for implementing the Middle East peace agreement
to the package.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides also agreed to add 75 million U.S.
dollars for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations,
170 million U.S. dollars for overseas economic aid, and 104
million U.S. dollars for former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The new package also include a total of 90 to 123 million U.S.
dollars for international debt relief.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens to Withdraw from ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
Friday threatened to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty if Russia keep opposing amending the pact signed in 1972 by
Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"If they persist absolutely in that position, then the United
States...will have to face a very difficult question, which is
whether to withdraw from the treaty," said U.S. Defense
Undersecretary Walter Slocombe.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe made the remarks at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) here when talking about the U.S. plan
to develop a national anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to reassure Russia, China and other critics of missile
defense, the official said that such an anti-missile system would
protect the United States and its allies would not undermine
global security.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe added that President Bill Clinton would make a
decision next summer at the earliest whether to order the
deployment of a limited national missile defense. A bill for the
move has been approved by Congress and signed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration hopes to win Russia's agreement to
modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which prohibits the
kind of defensive system the Pentagon is proposing at a cost of
about 11 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Strongly opposing the amendment of the treaty, Moscow warned
Washington that U.S. deployment of an anti-missile defense system
will result in dangerous consequences.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe stressed that the Clinton administration would prefer
to preserve the ABM treaty but will not let Russian objections
stand i-Russia-Missile

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday was re-elected as one of the members on the U.N. budget
committee.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions has 16 members. It met this morning to consider five
candidates for as many vacancies, with only five candidates in the
running.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, the United States earlier
persuaded New Zealand to drop its bid for re-election to the
committee so that the United States is assured of a place.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said New Zealand, the United States, Canada,
Australian and European nations belong to a group called Western
Europe and Others.
</P>
<P>
The United States lost its seat on the budget committee in 1996
and was defeated against last year for its failure to pay tis dues
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Since U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrook took up his post at the
United Nations in September, he has focused on regaining the seat.
</P>
<P>
The United States faces the loss of its vote in the General
Assembly unless it pays at least 350 million U.S. dollars of
arrears by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> GA Committee Calls for Strict Compliance With ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The First Committee of
the 54th General Assembly (GA) Friday adopted a resolution on the
preservation of and compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty (ABM Treaty), calling for renewed efforts by each of the
State parties "to preserve and strengthen the ABM Treaty through
full and strict compliance."
</P>
<P>
Fifty four countries voted in favor of the draft resolution,
sponsored by Russia. China and Belarus later joined Russia as
co-sponsors. Four countries, including the United States and
Israel, voted against, and 73 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for "continued efforts to strengthen the
ABM Treaty and to preserve its integrity and validity so that it
remains a cornerstone in maintaining global strategic stability
and world peace and in promoting further strategic nuclear arms
reductions."
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly called for "renewed efforts by each of the
States parties to preserve and strengthen the ABM Treaty through
full and strict compliance," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly also called on "parties to the ABM Treaty,
in accordance with their Treaty obligations, to limit the
deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems and to refrain from
the deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems for a defence of
the territory of its country and not to provide a base for such a
defence and not to transfer to other States or to deploy outside
its national territory, ABM systems or their components limited by
this Treaty," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly considered that "the implementation of any
measure undermining the purposes and the provisions of the Treaty
also undermines global strategic stability and world peace and the
promotion of further strategic nuclear arms reductions," said the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the General Assembly "supports further efforts by
the international community in the light of emerging developments
with the goal of safeguarding the inviolability and integrity of
the ABM Treaty in which the international community bears strong
interests," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
On May 26, 1972, the United States and then the Soviet Union
signed the ABM Treaty as a cornerstone for maintaining global
peace and security and strategic stability, and reaffirmed its
continual validity and relevance, especially in the current
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Many representatives took the floor to say that the ABM Treaty
is still viable against the backdrop that the United States is
developing the National Missile Defence (NMD) system in violation
of the ABM Treaty.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Former President Francesco
Cossiga Friday founded a new party for the second time in two
years.
</P>
<P>
The new party is similar in name and political aspiration to
the one he founded last year, the Democratic Union for the
Republic (UDR).
</P>
<P>
This time the new "reformist center-left" party is simply
called the Union for the Republic (UPR).
</P>
<P>
Party members including Italian Defence Minister Carlo
Scognamiglio and the minister for relations with parliament, Giudo
Folloni.
</P>
<P>
The UPR is expected to team up with three other tiny government
parties, the Socialists, the Republicans and the Liberals, in
Cossiga's so-called "Shamrock" alliance intended as a
counterweight to the main center-left alliance within the
majority, the resurgent Olive Tree.
</P>
<P>
Last year the UDR collapsed when Cossiga resigned from it but
it was carried on, minus the Cossiga loyalists, by another
centrist former Christian Democrat, Clemente Mastella, who later
renamed it the UDEUR.

HARARE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has been ranked in one
of the most corrupt nations in the world, anti-corruption task
force coordinator of National Economic Consultative Forum Phillip
Chiyangwa said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told a forum meeting that corruption was rampant in
economic, political and social activities of both central and
local governments, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic emancipation as a nation lies with the effort we
will direct towards crushing corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the forum was proposing for an act of parliament that
would enable the government to forfeit assets obtained through
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Transparency International Zimbabwe John Makumbe
told the meeting that there was need to eradicate corruption from
the top politicians who ranked high on lists of corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
He said there was lack of political will as there was no
deliberate move to investigate or prosecute corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
He said outputs from the task force should be used to translate
 into policy formulation and anti-corruption programs.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the media for lacking capacity to sustain stories
on corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said there was need to train journalists on how to report
and sustain stories on corruption issues.
</P>
<P>
Police Deputy Commissioner Godwin Matanga said there was need
for legislation to facilitate handling of cases of corruption.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- President Jerry John Rawlings
of Ghana on Friday urged South Africa to play a more active role
in resolving conflicts in Africa, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
South Africa under apartheid was responsible for most of the
wars in southern Africa, such as Mozambique, Namibia and Angola,
Rawlings said in meeting with Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General
of the Organization of African Unity, in Accra.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the problems in that region were either started or
complemented by the apartheid regime. It is morally right for the
South African government now to contribute more to stop the
destabilization it started," Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the conflicts have been raging for so long
that diplomacy might not resolve them. Therefore, South Africa
should move more forcefully into those conflict areas.
</P>
<P>
Salim said Africa is facing enormous economic challenges
brought about by an unfavorable international economic climate.
"We can only face these challenges when we are united."
</P>
<P>
Salim is attending the 10th anniversary of the Pan African
Writers Association (PAWA), the continental union of writers,
which has its headquarters in Accra.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Giant Panda Cubs Arrive in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Two giant panda cubs from China
-- Jiu Jiu and Hua Hua -- arrived safely in Atlanta, Georgia
State, USA, from Beijing Friday after a 17-hour-long journey, and
will spend the text 10 years in their new home at the Atlanta Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Zoo Director Terry Maple "signed" for the special
delivery during a welcoming ceremony at Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport with more than 200 dignitaries and
elementary school children looking on.
</P>
<P>
The United Parcel Service (UPS) took the responsibility for
carrying the two panda cubs from China to the city, the first time
since 1996 that giant pandas made the trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two pandas will join four others of their species in the
United States, three at the San Diego Zoo and one at the National
Zoo in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The UPS financed the design and building of containers to house
the pandas during their journey in the specially equipped Boeing
767.
</P>
<P>
To ensure safety of the pandas, the company also arranged three
veterinarians and fresh bamboo to accompany the pandas on their
flight.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival at the airport, the pandas traveled to the
Atlanta Zoo in a UPS "Panda-cade," with police escorting four
uniquely wrapped UPS package cars.
</P>
<P>
Born September 9, 1997, Jiu Jiu is male and has a good
disposition, while the female Hua Hua, six months older, is more
active and aggressive. Both pandas are in excellent health.
</P>
<P>
The two pandas were both born in the breeding center for pandas
in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province in southwest China, known
as the home of pandas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Coca-Cola Co., Chinese and American scientists are
working together to develop an international breeding program to
protect the endangered pandas, and the arrival of the two cubs,
part of the program, is aimed to provide research opportunities
for U.S. zoologists.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Zoo has spent seven million U.S. dollars on a
luxurious habitat for the cubs, including three indoor apartments,
two outdoor air-conditioned playgrounds, and plenty of bamboo.
Caca-Cola Co. has donated 500,000 U.S. dollars for the
construction of the habitat.
</P>
<P>
The zoo has announced that the giant pandas will go on public
display at the Atlanta Zoo starting November 20.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is now facing extinction. There are about 1,000
pandas in the world now, most of them living in the mountains of
the Sichuan Basin. The number of artificially-bred pandas is 120.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Needs 300 Wagons for New Trade Rail Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean National Railways
needs 300 coaches and wagons to effectively exploit new regional
markets specially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy Minister Enos Chikowore said
this Friday when he toured the mechanical workshops of the
loss-making parastatal in Bulawayo, the second biggest city of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on the National Railways to speed up the
refurbishment of wagons and locomotives needed to service the
recently opened trade route to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we have a fleet of about 140 wagons that have
been completed and this has not enabled us to meet all our
commitments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opening up of new trade corridors in and outside the
country, such as the Bulawayo-Beitbridge Railway line, the Beira
Corridor and now the rail links between Lubumbashi, Ilebo,
Kinshasa and Matadi in western DRC, required the Zimbabwean
National Railways to mobilize more resources to meet targets, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that 75 percent of the spares needed in assembling of
the wagons are found locally and I hope our skilled manpower will
be able to speed up the process of refurbishment," he added.
</P>
<P>
With the current restructuring and commercialization thrust,
the workshops are positioned to offer engineering and production
services to the whole southern Africa region, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> UN Says NIDs Successfully Completed in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- More Children in
Afghanistan were covered during the latest round of National
Immunization Days (NIDs) than in May and June this year, U.N. said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The immunization campaign aims to eradicate polio from
Afghanistan by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to observation of the monitors, who include senior
staff from the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the World
Health Organization (WHO), there was a very good turn out of
children under five.
</P>
<P>
The increase may be due to increased out-reach activities,
house to house visits in several locations and extensive use of
megaphones for social mobilization.
</P>
<P>
To reach more children, supplementary immunization programs
in the form of NIDs are held to provide oral polio vaccine to all
children under five years of age in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Besides special emphasis on NIDs for polio eradication, UNICEF
and WHO also support the Expanded Immunization Program (EPI) in
Afghanistan to protect children against six preventable diseases
-- diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, polio and
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
To implement the regular immunization program successfully,
UNICEF provides technical, managerial and operational support to
EPI's Regional and Provincial Management Teams, UNICEF also
supports the non-governmental organizations for the same
objective.
</P>
<P>
Polio eradication in Afghanistan will largely depend on the
rapid acceleration and sustained efforts to increase immunization
coverage among infants to increase the chances of their survival.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Talks at "Critical Phase": Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's republican
Sinn Fein party warned on Friday that time was running out to
break a deadlock in the British province's tortuous peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Martin McGuinness, senior Sinn Fein negotiator at the
long-running talks, said the process of trying to revive last
year's Good Friday peace accord had reached "the most critical
phase of negotiations".
</P>
<P>
The latest round of talks has been adjourned until Monday, when
U.S. mediator George Mitchell returns to Belfast after briefing
the leaders of the United States, Britain and Ireland on the state
of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, and
the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party are at loggerheads over
guerrilla disarmament and a provincial executive set to assume
some home-rule powers from London.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists refuse to share power with Sinn Fein until
the IRA hands in the weapons it used to wage a 30-year campaign
against British rule. Sinn Fein says it cannot force the
guerrillas to turn over their guns.
</P>
<P>
The warning from McGuinness came as Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble met U.S. officials at the White House, which has
been a strong supporter of the quest for a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who left the peace talks last week to fly to
Washington, said he was not contemplating failure even though the
core issues that produced the deadlock had not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he understood the fears of republicans but
stressed that a weapons handover by the IRA was vital.
</P>
<P>
"There must be movement. There must be change," he said. "If
the paramilitaries are unable to move at the moment then we are
prepared to be patient to see if there are ways of helping them."
</P>
<P>
Trimble plans to return to the peace talks on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday began another closed-door session to consider the
latest report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who asked the
15-member Council to authorize military observers for the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Friday is the continuation of the closed meeting Thursday
by the 15 Council members to discuss the Congo (K) issue.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to adopt a draft resolution,
which may okay the extension of the mandate of the military
liaison officers in and around Congo (K), U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
While noting the economic difficulties facing any United
Nations operation in Congo (K), Annan, in his Tuesday report to
the Security Council, asked the Council to authorize the
deployment of U.N. military observers to the central African
country.
</P>
<P>
The experience gained so far in the preliminary deployment of a
small number of liaison officers in and around the country "has
only served to deepen our appreciation of the difficulties," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to support the peace process must continue, he
said, adding that the suffering in Congo (K) has persisted for far
too long to miss the chance offered by the Lusaka Ceasefire
Agreement, which was signed on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan recommended that the Security Council extend
the mandate of the U.N. personnel currently serving in the
Democratic Republic of Congo until January 15. By then, he said,
based on the conclusions of a technical survey team, it should be
possible to provide the Council with further details of the
possible establishment of a U.N. peacekeeping operation in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan also asked the Council for prior authorization to set up
a U.N. Observer Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(MONUC) and the deployment of up to 500 military observers.
</P>
<P>
The operation would absorb the existing initial deployment and
would be led by a soon to be appointed Special Representative,
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of military observers would constitute the
second phase of U.N. involvement in the country. A third phase
would be the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping operation to
assist the parties implement the Lusaka ceasefire agreement and
strengthen the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Congo (K) was backed by Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Angola, while rebels were supported by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Down to 4.1 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
dipped to 4.1 percent in October as 310,000 workers found jobs,
the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the gain in payroll jobs followed a
revised gain of 41,000 jobs in September, better than previously
estimated.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in October, which followed September's
4.2 percent rate, is the best performance during the nation's
economic expansion which began in March 1991. The 4.1 percent rate
is the lowest since a 3.9 percent rate set in January 1970. That
keeps the unemployment rate at a 29-year low.
</P>
<P>
U.S. employers, recovering from the effects of the hurricane in
September, added 310,000 jobs in October as many analysts
predicted. October's gain was the largest since July when 373,000
jobs were added to business payrolls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation
pressures, grew by a tiny 0.1 percent to 13.37 dollars in October,
compared with a sharp 0.5 percent gain in September.
</P>
<P>
Economists worry that strong jobs growth could be a recipe for
sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve policy-makers meet next on Nov. 16 to decide
whether to boost interest rates for a third time this year.
Although many economists said the probability of the Fed raising
rates has declined from a few weeks ago when it seemed a sure
thing, there is still a 50 percent chance the Fed will pick up
rates again in November, they said.
</P>
<P>
Even though the big gain in payroll jobs, manufacturing sector
continued its decline and lost 15,000 jobs in October. However,
government analysts said the job loss in manufacturing is slowing.
Since June, the number of factory jobs has fallen by an average of
12,000 per month, compared with an average declined of 36,000 per
month during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers have seen foreign demand for their products
rebound somewhat from a global financial crisis that began in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Construction added 28,000 jobs in October. Some of that growth
reflects the cleanup and rebuilding after the storm.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the
United States, rebounded in October, adding 293,000 jobs. Business
services led that growth with a gain of 215,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Retail businesses, however, cut 30,000 jobs, its third
consecutive monthly decline after a large increase in July. There
were large job declines in bars and restaurants, down by 28,000.
Food stores lost 13,000 jobs and employment at general merchandise
stores fell by 8,000.
</P>
<P>
Those losses were partially offset by jobs gains at building
supply and garden supply stores and car dealerships.

sovereignty from external aggression.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Death Toll In Cyclone-hit East India Rises To 1,361 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A week after the fierce
cyclone hit India's east coast, the official death toll went up to
1,361 Friday in the 12 affected districts in the state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
An eight-member inter-ministerial team, which carried out an
extensive survey of the cyclone-ravaged areas, found no reports of
outbreaks of any epidemic nor shortage of food but said the
situation continued to be far from normal.
</P>
<P>
The Orissa government said Thursday 904 people were killed and
104 others were still missing while nine million more were yet to
get any relief in the 10 coastal districts.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that the extensive air dropping of food
supplies had been carried out to various destinations while
communication links had been restored in 27 of the 30 district
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Giving figures for the first time about the extensive damage,
the officials said the cyclone had affected over 12 million people
in 66 blocks in 12 districts along the coast.
</P>
<P>
They put the crop area affected at 323,000 hectares and cattle
deaths at about 25,000, adding that some 276,000 houses had
collapsed or were damaged, and 600 government buildings and 1,200
school buildings were hit besides widespread cracks on several
roads and highways.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Friday that 282 tons of
food had been air-dropped and additional 260 tons of food supplies
were airlifted to Bhubaneswar, 1,745 km southeast of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
To ensure an adequate supply, 15,800 tons of food were being
sent by rail and another 917 tons by road from neighboring states
like Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.
</P>
<P>
Amid reports of diarrhea from almost every household in Soro in
Balasore district, the central government rushed additional
supplies of 500,000 packets of oral dehydration salt besides 3,000
doses of anti-snake venom to the state.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and paramedical personnel had been sent to aid the
medical teams from the armed forces who had been working
round-the-clock to provide medicare to the affected people.
</P>
<P>
The state government has launched a massive vaccination drive
in the affected areas to insulate people against any outbreak of
epidemics, PTI reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian experts ruled out mass inoculation with typhoid
or cholera vaccine which would be ineffective at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry officials had no exact number of diarrhea
cases, but said they were on the rise. Many people had been
admitted to hospitals, but no deaths due to diarrhea had been
reported so far, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry organized an international experts'
committee meeting here Thursday, which was attended by Indian
medical research institutions and organizations of the United
Nations including the U.N. Children's Fund, the Population Fund
and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has asked international agencies and
non-governmental organizations to coordinate relief and
rehabilitation efforts with Indian health authorities and to pool
in their resources including manpower and relief materials.
</P>
<P>
Several countries and the U.N. bodies have announced assistance
of some five million U.S. dollars to support relief and
humanitarian activities in Orissa.

<HEADLINE> UN Climate Meeting Pledges to Finalize Kyoto Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 5 (Xinhua)--Delegates from more than 160
governments Friday in Bonn concluded a UN conference on climate
change, passing a timetable for completing the details of the
Kyoto protocol by November 2000 but leaving special difficulties
for future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth Session of the Conference of the Parties of UN
Climate Change Framework Convention (COP5),ministers and officials
also agreed to empower the conference President, Jan Szyszko, to
take necessary steps to intensify the negotiating process on all
issues during the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, some industrial countries expressed their
readiness to ratify the Protocol quickly so that it can enter into
force by 2002.
</P>
<P>
"The Bonn climate change conference has confirmed that there is
still enormous political support for achieving the Kyoto target of
cutting greenhouse gas emissions in industrialized countries by 5%
by the period 2008-12," said Szyszko at the press conference
following the conference.
</P>
<P>
"The conference has also set us on a good course for finalizing
the many rules and mechanisms required for making the Protocol
operational," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto protocol, passed in 1997 in the Japanese city, will
commit the industrial countries to cut their emissions of
greenhouse gases. The protocol will become effective only after it
has been ratified by more than 55 countries that account for at
least 55 per cent of the total emissions of the world.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for completing the Protocol is the COP6 scheduled
for 13 - 24 November 2000 in The Hague. Kofi Annan, U.N. secretary
general, has demanded the protocol to be effective no late than
year 2002,ten years after the Climate Change Convention was signed
at the Rio Earth Summit.
</P>
<P>
But so far only 16 countries, all from the developing world,
have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
A number of decisions made in Bonn settled important technical
issues. Agreement was reached on how to improve the rigor of
national reports from industrialized countries and strengthen the
guidelines for measuring their greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
But Szyszko acknowledged the Bonn conference failed to make
breakthrough in some key issues as the U.N had hoped. The
difficulties included non-compliance, capacity building,
emissions trading, joint implementation(JI), and Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM).
</P>
<P>
"The special difficulty lies in JI and CDM," said Szyszko,
while stressing the two mechanisms were "political issues" that
the COP5 had not been ready to discuss.
</P>
<P>
"We focused on more technical issues but less political ones,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the JI mechanism, two or more developed countries are
allowed to cut their emission in joint projects, while under CDM,
industrial countries are allowed to build climate friendly
projects in developing countries as a partial substitute for
cutting their domestic emissions.
</P>
<P>
The two, together with emissions trading that allows developed
countries to trade their emissions capacity with each other, were
the major mechanisms set in Kyoto protocol.
</P>
<P>
Szyszko and other conference officials hoped industrial
countries would settle their wrangle over the three mechanisms in
the next year and then ratify Kyoto protocol "as soon as
possible."

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Global Campaign to Foil Effects of  Tobacco Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
health agency has launched an unprecedented campaign to counter
tobacco industry deception around the world, U.N. officials said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Called "Tobacco Kills, Don't Be Duped," the campaign brings
together senior health and medical activists from 20 countries to
join forces with tobacco industry whistle-blower Dr. Jeffery
Wigand and California's successful anti-smoking program to expose
big tobacco's worldwide campaign of deception and lies.
</P>
<P>
"Every sleeping and waking hour from billboards, television
screens, movies, radios and now the Internet, the tobacco industry
beckons our children with messages that, whichever way you
interpret them, say 'give us your daily breath,'" said Dr. Derek
Yach, head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tobacco Free
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
WHO Director-General Dr. Gro Hartlem Brundtland has called
tobacco a communicated disease -- communicated through
advertising.
</P>
<P>
The "Don't Be Dupe" campaign, which was launched in Geneva and
San Francisco, will strengthen the ability of broadcast and
newspaper journalists and other health health communicators
worldwide to sift facts from fiction about tobacco use, its spread
and promotion.
</P>
<P>
Learning from California's successful counter-advertising
campaigns and community-based actions, the campaign will make the
case for health, enhance population health literacy, promote
healthy choices, and most importantly, influence public policy so
that robust tobacco control measures and strict regulation of the
tobacco industry become a global reality.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, WHO is leading an U.N.-wide effort to
ascertain the level of tobacco industry influence on global health
and development policies.
</P>
<P>
WHO has also begun work on the Framework Convention on Tobacco
Control, the world's first public health treaty. Last week, more
than 100 countries representing 93 percent of the world's
population met in Geneva and called for strong global action
against tobacco to complement national legislation.
</P>
<P>
Who, set up in 1948, is the premier United Nations institution
working in the field of health. Its objective is the attainment
by all peoples of the highest possible level of health.

<HEADLINE> Over 700 S.Lankan Soldiers Killed or Wounded in Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry
said Friday that more than 700 soldiers had been killed or wounded
this week in the fierce fighting against Tamil rebels in the north
of the country.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said 89 soldiers had been killed and 645
others wounded during the confrontations that took place from
midnight Monday till Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the ministry had corrected the figure of
soldiers killed in action as 89 from 107 a day before.
</P>
<P>
It said soldiers who had been missing in action were gradually
coming back to the government-controlled areas in small numbers
but so far there were still 122 soldiers missing.
</P>
<P>
Government troops who have regrouped in areas south of
Oddusuddan and Nedunkerni were continuing to engage the separatist
rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), causing heavy
damages to the rebels, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say how many LTTE rebels had been killed or
wounded in the week-long fighting.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said Friday that they had overrun three key military
bases of Oddusuddan, Nedunkerni and Ampakamam in the northern
Wanni region, killing more than 1,000 troops this week.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a 16-year-old separatist war against
the majority Sinhalese-dominated troops to demand a homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.

<HEADLINE> FAO Completes Major Project to Help Farmers in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has reported an early
completion of a major project to assist farmers in Kosovo, the
Serbian province, U.N. officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based agency said Thursday that the project of 6.7
billion U.S. dollars to supply seeds and fertilizers to help
farmers restart agriculture in Kosovo had been completed ahead of
the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
Some 14,500 metric tons of winter wheat seeds and 9,000 tons
of fertilizers have been handed out to more than 70,000 farming
families.
</P>
<P>
"The distribution of seeds is the first step for farmers and
their families in Kosovo to become self-sufficient again. This
will finally start to reduce the dependence on external aid," said
Daniele Donati, FAO emergency coordinator for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
FAO said strengthening agriculture is one of the best options
for a quick recovery in rural areas of Kosovo. "We expect the
number of farmers in need to be reduced by half of 35,000 in a
year's time," Donati said.
</P>
<P>
FAO will establish a laboratory for seed quality control and
plans a vaccination campaign in order to reduce and limit further
losses of livestock. In addition, the agency will start a program
to renovate and repair agricultural machinery in Kosovo and has
launched an emergency appeal for 25 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of the tractors in the province were
stolen or destroyed during the 78-day NATO air strike on
Yugoslavia, beginning on March 24.
</P>
<P>
FAO acts as the lead agency for rural development in the United
Nations system. It works to alleviate poverty and hunger by
promoting agricultural development, improved nutrition and the
pursuit of food security -- the access of all people at all times
to the food they need for an active and healthy life.

<HEADLINE> Blind Population Increases Sharply in Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of blind people is
expected to reach 90 million in developing countries by the year
2020 unless preventive measures are put in place, the Sight Savers
International said in Lusaka Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of blindness is increasing by more than two
million people annually, Moses Chirambo, chairman of the
sight-saving organization, disclosed at a workshop of consultants
for eastern, central and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chirambo said that blindness cases are increasing at an
alarming rate and that the number of blind people would reach 90
million by the year 2020 if nothing was done.
</P>
<P>
He explained that there are over 45 million blind people today
and 135 million visually disabled people in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the types of blindness are treatable and
preventable but the lack of commitment and public education has
caused a big problem, Chirambo pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said it is for that reason his organization has decided to
join the 2020 vision campaign to eliminate blindness.
</P>
<P>
The vision campaign will need over 25 million U.S. dollars. If
implemented, it would reduce avoidable blindness from 40 million
to eight million.

<HEADLINE> Results of UK Lords Elections Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Seventy five of Britain's
hereditary peers will stay on in a "transitional" House of Lords
until longer-term reform is completed,it was announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hereditaries were chosen in an election, the first in the
Lords' history.
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to 92 out of more than 750 hereditaries
remaining in the Lords, despite Labour's manifesto pledge to end
their right to sit and vote in the upper House.
</P>
<P>
The 75 hereditaries were elected by their fellow-peers over two
days this week, prior to the results being read out by the clerk
of the Parliaments on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The peers will represent their parties in the reformed chamber,
and include 42 from the Conservatives, 28 from the crossbenches,
three Liberal Democrats and two from Labour.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the approximately 750 hereditary peers
will lose the right to sit and vote from the end of next week
under a reform bill pushed through by Prime Minister Tony Blair's
government.
</P>
<P>
The lucky 75 chosen by their fellows will join a further 17
office-holders and a handful of other hereditaries who have been
offered the chance to stay on as life peers.
</P>
<P>
There are about 500 other life peers, appointed by governments
over the last 40 years, whose position is unaffected.
</P>
<P>
Blair has appointed a Royal Commission to look into its future
of the upper house, which reports in December.

biotechnology sectors -- that strictly controlled farm-scale
trials would last until the harvesting of crops planted in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no...unrestricted cultivation of GM crops in the
UK until the farm-scale evaluations are complete," he said.
</P>
<P>
Plantings for farm trials would be limited to 20-25 fields per
crop per year, he said, and none of the produce would be used in a
way that would commercially benefit growers.
</P>
<P>
"The government has said all along there will be no general
cultivation of GM crops until we are satisfied there will be no
unacceptable effects on the environment," Meacher said.
</P>
<P>
The trials aim to assess potential damage to normal crops
through cross-pollination with GM produce but green activists were
immediately up in arms.
</P>
<P>
GM crop trials operate with only a 200-yard (metre) buffer
zone. The Soil Association says six miles (10 km) is the minimum
needed to guarantee no contamination of normal crops.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken a battering on GM food over the last
year with Prime Minister Tony Blair apparently in favour of
remaining at the cutting edge of the biotechnology industry at all
costs while Meacher and others have been more cautious.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Meacher admitted that produce grown
during the trials would not necessarily be destroyed as it had in
the first year of trials. It could, possibly, enter the food chain
through cattle feed.

concentrated on purchases by India of military hardware and
ammunition, in addition to spare parts for 130-mm artillery guns

LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) - America's Nasdaq stock exchange
announced here Friday to launch a London-based technology market
next year.
</P>
<P>
The news comes just one day after the London Stock exchange
Launched its own technology index (Techmark) to compete with
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
Nasdaq-Europe, to be launched by the end of next year, will aim
to attract some of the Continent's fastest growing companies, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Nasdaq said the new market would offer European investors an
internet-accessible, high performance, low cost trading platform
linked to Nasdaq markets in the US and Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Nasdaq-Europe is an important step in creating an electronic
global stock market for the benefit of companies and investors
around the world," said Frank Zarb, chairman of the NASD, at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Like its counterparts in the U.S. and Asia we expect
Nasdaq-Europe to be the IPO market of choice and an important
contributor to job creation and economic growth for the region,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
UK Chancellor Gordon Brown denied the new market would
undermine Techmark - which he launched on Thursday - saying it
would be "good for competition".
</P>
<P>
"Nasdaq's decision to locate its European exchange here
represents a massive vote of confidence in the City," Brown said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
Friday accused Japan, Thailand and Argentina of dumping steel in
the United States and indicated it would impose heavy duties on
these countries.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, under pressure from U.S.
steelmakers and labor unions, has made more than 16 investigations
into cold-rolled steel imports, and the three countries were
included in a preliminary ruling of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
The ruling targets cold-rolled, flat-rolled carbon quality
steel, which is used in products ranging from automobiles to
household appliances.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission
will issue final decisions to impose heavy duties on these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Shipments from Argentina would face 24.53 percent duties.
Duties would average 67.97 percent but run as high as 80.67
percent for products for the imports from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, Nippon Steel Corp., Kawasaki Steel Corp., Kobe Steel
Ltd. and Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd. would face duties of 53.28
percent. All other Japanese producers would face margins of 39.28
percent.

<HEADLINE> Rabin's Assassination Should be Re-examined: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Friday that every question over thresponding to demands by Rabin's fa
mily that the
government reopen the investigation into the case. Rabin, who
negotiated the first agreements with the Palestinians, was gunned
down by a ultra-nationalist Jew on November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the fourth anniversary of the assassination, Rabin's family
said there are still many unresolved questions regarding the
incident.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister said he had not received any direct
request for the appointment of a new commission of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the women's magazine La'isha published
early this week, Rabin's daughter Dalia Rabin-Pelosoff listed a
series of questions which she said trouble her and which she
believes the inquiry commission led by former Chief of Justice
Meir Shamgar failed to answer.
</P>
<P>
She said she did not understand why someone yelled "blanks,
blanks" after Yigal Amir shot her father and why the security men
told her mother that the killing was an exercise. "Why didn't they
shoot the killer immediately? How come they didn't open fire?" she
asked.
</P>
<P>
Rabin's widow, Leah Rabin, and his son, Yuval Rabin, echoed the
doubts and demanded the case be reopened.
</P>
<P>
Since the assassination, there have been rumors that the
General Security Service (GSS) had planned to carry out a fake
assassination by a nationalist Israeli to discredit the
opposition, all with Rabin's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Avishai Raviv, an undercover GSS agent, is on trial on charges
that he had known about Amir's plan but did not take any action to
prevent it. Raviv's case has lent weight to the conspiracy rumors.
</P>
<P>
Rabin-Pelosoff dismissed the conspiracy theories in an
interview with Israel Radio Thursday, but she said she could
understand why these theories abound.
</P>
<P>
"Such an idea is horrible. However, it is legitimate that it
should arise, in view of all the unanswered questions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who succeeded Rabin,
expressed support Friday for the demands by Rabin's family, saying
the case must be investigated again "so that everyone is convinced
matters were looked into properly."
</P>
<P>
Right-wing groups, who claim Rabin was killed as a result of a
conspiracy aimed at defaming the nationalist front, also voiced
their support for the Rabin family's demand.
</P>
<P>
Shamgar Friday denied that his report, which found no evidence
of a conspiracy, failed to provide answers to all key questions.
</P>
<P>
But he told Israel Radio that the Rabin family has the
legitimate right to ask for an additional investigation.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs to Meet to Discuss Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states will meet in the
Saudi capital of Riyadh on Sunday to prepare for the alliance's
next summit due on November 27.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi issue and Gulf security and stability are likely to
dominate the discussions of the ministerial meeting, GCC
diplomatic sources were quoted by Kuwait News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Specifying the agenda of Sunday's meeting, the sources said
the ministers will reassess the extent of Iraq's implementation
of the United Nations resolutions related to Baghdad's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since 1990 and the
U.N. Security Council insists that the embargo not be lifted until
Iraq get rid of all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the GCC's stand on the Iraqi issue was
unified and based on the need to ensure stability and security for
all peoples of the region including the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers will also discuss the dispute between the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran over the strategic and
potentially oil-rich islands of Abu Moussa and Greater and Lesser
Tunbs, which are located near the mouth of the Hormuz Strait in
the Gulf, the GCC sources said.
</P>
<P>
Both UAE and Iran claim sovereignty over the three strategic
islands, which have been controlled by Tehran since Britain
withdrew from the region in 1971.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting held in the Saudi Red Sea port city of Jeddah
early July, the GCC foreign ministers established a tripartite
committee comprising Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia to work out a
proper mechanism for a peaceful solution to the UAE-Iranian
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional and political alliance set up in 1981,
groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Farm Minister Paolo De
Castron Friday blocked three genetically modified (GM) crops -
maize, soya and chicory - that had completed testing and were
ready to proceed to field planting.
</P>
<P>
De Castro said he had stopped the modified plants from being
registered as field crops pending "a collegial decision from the
government."
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had written to Italian Premier Massimo
D'Alema to urge the cabinet to decide.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has already approved the crops, as has
the Italian ministry of health.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, De Castro has also halted all new GM testing
programs. He said he wanted responsibility for the schemes to be
shared by regional governments before giving the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
De Castro's decision was welcomed by the Italian Green party,
whose Lower House whip Mauro Paissan said the experimental growing
of GM crops in Italy was being carried out without the necessary
precautions or controls.

<HEADLINE> SADC Considers Buying Anti-AIDS Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Southern African
Development Community (SADC) health ministers said on Friday that
they will consider buying anti-AIDS drugs in bulk and compulsory
licensing of such drugs to make them more affordable.
</P>
<P>
The SADC ministers met at Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital in
Soweto, south of Johannesburg, to find ways of tackling the
spiralling HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The ministers noted scientific evidence indicating that
anti-retroviral drugs such as Zidovudine (AZT) and Nevirapine
could decrease the chances of babies born to HIV-positive mothers
being infected by about 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
They said, however, although they were encouraged by the
results of the drugs, they were concerned about the toxicity of
such drugs.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Health Minister Nkandu Luo said the SADC was grateful
to scientists for the research they had done on anti-retroviral
drugs, but the body wanted to be certain of the safety of such
drugs before making set decisions.
</P>
<P>
South African Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang
defended President Thabo Mbeki's stand on AZT, saying Mbeki chose
not to make the drug freely available to pregnant women until he
was satisfied there had been enough research done on the drug.
</P>
<P>
She said the country's Medicines Control Council was
conducting its own investigation into AZT and a decision on the
drug would only be taken once all research areas had been
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said co-ordinated action by scientists was
needed to speedily develop effective and affordable vaccines to
provide some protection against HIV strains common in the region.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to work together and share information on blood
safety legislation and to support the World Health Organization
Collaboration Centre on Blood Transfusion Technology in Harare,
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Italian Foreign Ministry Reform Moves Into High Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The reform of Italy's Foreign
Ministry moved into high gear Friday with the appointment of 12
new directors general for the five new geographic divisions and
the seven multi-lateral or subject ones.
</P>
<P>
The five geographic divisions are Europe, the Americas, the
Mediterranean and the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
They will work to generate new synergy through the development
of "nation programs" that set up a framework for political,
economic, cultural and social initiatives.
</P>
<P>
At the same time they will be responsible for Italians, in
particular businessmen, working in foreign countries and assist
them with their political and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The Italian communities abroad will also be more involved, now
that they have won the right to vote in home elections, with
direct channels of communication with the offices of the directors
general.
</P>
<P>
The new multilateral or subject divisions are: multilateral
political affairs and human rights; European integration;
multilateral economic and financial cooperation; cultural
promotion and cooperation; Italians abroad and migration;
personnel; and administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
The departments will handle Italy's participation in
international organizations, the European Union first of all,
promote Italian culture abroad, develop ties with Italian
communities abroad and define strategies for foreign aid to
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the Foreign Ministry, the final stages of which
must still be approved by the Senate, also involves boosting the
number of diplomats and reforming career scales taking into
account the need for "permanent training" and professional
updating.

NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is to open Mombasa
airport to international-scheduled flights in an effort to boost
the country's flagging tourism sector, a government minister said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to lift the ban on scheduled flights
to Moi International Airport, said Tourism, Trade and Industry
Minister Nicholas Biwott at a seminar in the Indian Ocean port
city.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the only international flights serving Mombasa have

Kenya's tourism industry has been in a depression since 1997
when ethnic clashes at the coast killed more than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Kenya's tourism industry has registered a
slight upturn in bookings but occupancy rates at hotels in Mombasa
remain low.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Navy Declines to Join Exercise With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli navy has
declined to participate in a joint naval exercise on Monday with a
NATO flotilla visiting Israel's northern seaport of Haifa, the
local daily Jerusalem Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) officials said the
invitation had been given in advance to the Israeli navy. However,
NATO was informed that the Israeli navy will be involved in its
own maneuvers at that time and that none of its vessels will be
available to take part in the search-and-rescue exercise.
</P>
<P>
Officers of the Israeli Defense Force told the daily that
Israeli naval officers are scheduled to go with the NATO's
vessels to observe the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The flotilla, comprising six frigates from Turkey, Greece,
Spain, Holland, Germany and Italy and two destroyers from the
United States and Britain, arrived in Haifa on Wednesday, and is
due to remain until Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, known as NATO's Standing Naval Force Mediterranean,
is commanded by R.-Adm Feyyaz Ogutcu from aboard his flagship, the
Turkish frigate TGG Bararos.
</P>
<P>
Ogutcu told the daily that the flotilla was activated in
1992 to serve primarily as an immediate-reaction force for
NATO's southern region.
</P>
<P>
It also involved in the enforcement of the U.N. embargo on the
former Yugoslavia. More recently, it operated in the Adriatic as
part of NATO's efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, comprising 1,600 personnel, makes goodwill visits
to countries in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea to promote
so-called peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
It previously visited Israel in 1994 and has also been to
Egypt, Tunisia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> L.America Denounces "Piracy" of Genetic Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The "piracy" of the genetical
resources of the Latin American campesino (peasant) and Indian
communities was denounced Friday here in the final statement of a
regional forum on the access to biological resources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the Cambios (Changes) Foundation of
the National University of Costa Rica, gathered here 41
representatives of campesino, academic and environmentalist
organizations of 11 Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the forum underscored in their statement that
"the basis of life," as well as "the biological and
microbiological processes are not merchandise, and cannot be
monopolized," and in consequence, they cannot be patented.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the "Protocols of Access" to the biological
resources that are negotiated now at an international level
"cannot be a simple tool that will facilitate and legalize this
plundering."
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed in this way its concern for the rising
trend of the big transnational firms to appropriate the natural
resources and patent the processes for their use, taking advantage
of popular knowledge about these resources.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this forum is to analyze the proposals of these
sectors to the Protocol of Access to the Genetic and Biochemical
Resources that the Central American governments will discuss next
November 16 and 17 in San Jose, director of Cambios Silvia
Rodriquez told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who was recently awarded a prize here for her
struggle to defend the biological resources and the interests of
the local communities, reaffirmed the opposition of the group to
the patenting of life forms.
</P>
<P>
The people attending the meeting said that the Protocol of
Access to the Genetic and Biochemical Resources that the Central
American governments will analyze this month do not reflect the
principles defended by the communities, nor the integrity of the
principles of biological and cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
For this reason they asked to make a reference in the Protocol
to the local communities, and to regulate the access of external
agents to our resources and the way they will be used.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Threatens to Withdraw From ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
Friday threatened to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty if Russia keeps opposing the amendment of the pact
signed in 1972 by Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"If they persist absolutely in that position, then the United
States... will have to face a very difficult question, which is
whether to withdraw from the treaty," said U.S. Defense
Undersecretary Walter Slocombe.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe made the remarks at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies here when talking about the U.S. plan to
develop a national anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to reassure Russia, China and other critics of missile
defense, the official said that such an anti-missile system would
protect the United States and its allies and would not undermine
global security.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton would make a decision next summer at the
earliest whether to order the deployment of a limited national
missile defense. A bill for the move has been approved by Congress
and signed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government hopes to win Russia's agreement to modify
the 1972 ABM Treaty, which prohibits the kind of defensive system
the Pentagon is proposing at a cost of about 11 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Strongly opposing the amendment of the treaty, Moscow warned
Washington that U.S. deployment of an anti-missile defense system
will result in dangerous consequences.
</P>
<P>
Slocombe stressed that the Clinton administration would prefer
to preserve the ABM Treaty but will not let Russian objections
stand in the way of U.S. national security needs.
</P>
<P>
"It is not at all clear to me... that Russia would gain
anything from the destruction of the arms control framework,"
Slocombe said. "The consequences would be difficult for Russia."
</P>
<P>
The official insisted that "the limited system we have in mind
is fully compatible with the basic purpose of the ABM Treaty,"
which is to "ensure that each party's strategic deterrent is not
threatened by the missile defenses of the other side."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the treaty can be modified to permit the
deployment of a limited national missile defense while preserving
that fundamental purpose," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the real threat to the viability of the ABM Treaty in
contemporary conditions comes not from efforts to modify it to
reflect current reality -- that is, the growing threat from rogue
missiles; to reflect, in the treaty's own term, the strategic
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that "the threat would come from a fixed refusal to
modify it to permit the United States or, for that matter, Russia,
which potentially faces the same problem, to build effective
defenses against those threats."
</P>
<P>
In June, Clinton and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin,
agreed to begin discussions to address both updating the ABM
Treaty in light of U.S. national missile defense plans and further
reductions in strategic offensive arms, Slocombe said.
</P>
<P>
"We've judged it right to leave to President Clinton's
successor and the successor of President Yeltsin the longer-term
issue of follow-on negotiations on further changes to the treaty
required to permit deployments to meet larger and more complex
threats," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed his confidence that Russia will be
finally persuaded to agree to amend the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we can persuade them that we are serious about
holding on to the structure of the ABM Treaty but that it needs to
be modified to give us this protection for our own country," he
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
However, he threatened to pull out of the treaty if Russia
fails to agree. "If, in the end, we are unsuccessful in these
negotiations, the president would have to decide whether to
withdraw from the ABM Treaty under the supreme national interest
clause."
</P>
<P>
"That right of withdrawal is expressly provided for in the
treaty, and it always remains an option," he added.

LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ended
higher Friday on strong gains in drug stocks and an early rally on
Wall Street triggered by U.S. jobs data which reduced the prospect
of a near-term interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
London's benchmark FTSE 100 climbed 25.3 points, or 0.4
percent, to 6,356.6, a two-month high. The index briefly breached
the psychologically important 6,400 mark earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
Drugs stocks were the flavor of the day, lifted by a near 80
billion U.S. dollar bid from Pfizer Inc for Warner-Lambert Co. and
American Home Products Corp's plans for a friendly 70.5 billion
U.S. dollar merger.
</P>
<P>
The drugs stocks contributed as much as 50 points to the
blue-chip index at one point in the session.

Frankfurt's electronically traded Xetra Dax marched up 0.4

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Compromised Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Friday approved a compromised foreign aid bill for
the fiscal year 2000 through the House after the Clinton
administration and the Republicans reached a compromised deal.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by a vote of 316-100 and will be sent to
the Senate for a quick vote.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, negotiators from the two sides agreed to
increase the funding from 12.7 billion U.S. dollars to 15.3
billion U.S. dollars for the bill.
</P>
<P>
Saying it's far from adequate, President Bill Clinton vetoed the
bill which was approved by Congress last month. Clinton indicated
the cutback of funding for foreign operation is an evidence of
"new isolationism" in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats seemed likely to join Republicans in supporting
the compromised bill as Republicans agreed to add nearly three
billion U.S. dollars to the original bill.
</P>
<P>
Republicans agreed to add the full 1.8 billion U.S. dollars
Clinton requested for implementing the Middle East peace agreement
to the package.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides also agreed to add 75 million U.S.
dollars for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations,
170 million U.S. dollars for overseas economic aid, and 104
million U.S. dollars for former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The new package also includes a total of 123 million U.S.
dollars for international debt relief for the poorest countries.

<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Friday it would
urge Russia to make a greater effort to avoid civilian casualties
in Chechnya and seek a political solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook would be telephoning his Russian
counterpart, Igor Ivanov, Saturday to urge restraint in Chechnya,
a Foreign Office statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He will express grave concern at the situation in Chechnya, in
particular the mounting civilian casualties, the plight of the
refugees and the risks to the stability of the region," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He will urge the Russian government to do more to avoid
civilian casualties and to keep open the Ingush-Chechen border. He
will press for a political solution," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees reportedly streamed into neighboring
Ingushetia from Chechnya Friday as Russian warplanes launched more
raids in a six-week-old campaign against Moslem rebels there.
</P>
<P>
Russia says its attacks are directed at terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Cook's telephone call was intended to reinforce Britain's
concern to the situation in Chechenya.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a letter to his
Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. That was his second letter
about Chechnya in a month.
</P>
<P>
In that letter, Blair expressed concern about civilian
casualties and the plight of refugees and urged Russia to give
free access to humanitarian relief organizations.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Nuclear Reactor for Turkey Safe: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian High Commissioner
Alexandra Bugailiskis Friday claimed that a nuclear reactor Canada
bid to build in southern Turkey is one of the safest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Bugailiskis, who is based in Syria, said after a meeting with
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides that Canada commissioned many
studies before putting forward its tender for the construction of
the nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
"The reactor which we are hoping to sell is one of the safest
in the world," even under very difficult conditions, including an
earthquake, she said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, however, Canadian lawmaker Jim Karygiannis and
David Martin, research director of the Nuclear Awareness Project,
a Canadian environmentalist group, warned that a nuclear accident
in Turkey would make the Chernobyl accident seem trivial.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the earthquake or an accident at the nuclear
plant to be built in Turkey's Akkuyu, the Chernobyl accident will
seem like a car accident involving four or five cars," they said.
</P>
<P>
The two men, who concluded a six-day visit to Cyprus on
Friday, called upon Cypriot government and the parliament to
protest this project to their Canadian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The said they will pay similar visits to Israel, Lebanon and
other Middle Eastern countries in an effort to inform governments
and public opinion of the grave dangers involved in building a
nuclear reactor in an area where the risk of earthquakes is high.
</P>
<P>
Canada's state-owned nuclear company, Atomic Energy of Canada
Limited (AECL), is widely considered to be the leading contender
for the Turkish nuclear plant project.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday unanimously adopted a resolution on the extension
of the mandate of the U.N. military liaison personnel deployed in
and around Congo (K) until January 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called on all parties to the Ceasefire
Agreement to continue to abide by its provisions, the resolution
said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reaffirmed the sovereignty, territorial
integrity, and political independence of the Democratic Republic
of Congo and that the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement "represents a
viable basis for a resolution of the conflict" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged all parties to the Ceasefire Agreement to
"cooperate fully" with the technical survey team dispatched to the
central African country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted in accordance with a recommendation
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was also present at the
open session Friday to vote on the draft resolution. But the
council withheld action for the time being on another
recommendation by Annan for standby authorization for a 500-member
U.N. military observer mission as the forerunner to a much bigger
peacekeeping force of around 10,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Government of President Laurent Kabila, which is
backed by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, signed the peace agreement
on July 10 with Congolese rebels, whose allies include Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The agreement called for a ceasefire, the disengagement of
forces and the withdrawal of foreign troops, who were to be
replaced by the U.N. peacekeepers.

PANAMA CITY, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Panama faces serious public
security problems of which some U.S. sectors could take advantage
to try to justify the extension of the U.S. military presence in
this country.
</P>
<P>
The forces that maintain the public order in Panama were put to
a test in the last days by a wave of assassinations, businessmen
kidnappings, armed attacks in the border with Colombia, corruption
acts, and the hijacking of two civilian helicopters by alleged
Colombian rebels.
</P>
<P>
News reports from the United States revealed the concern in the
Senate, led by conservative leader Jesse Helms, who demands
President Bill Clinton have new negotiations with the Panamanian
government to guarantee the security of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
These agreements, which Helms calls "of security," would
include a new pact to guarantee the extension of the U.S. military
presence after the year 2000 in an open violation of the
Torrijos-Carter Treaties.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso said that her country will
not permit in any circumstance the extension of the presence of
U.S. troops after December 31, at midday, when the United States
must revert the canal to the Panamanian sovereignty and withdraw
its last soldier.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso announced more firm measures against this kind of
organized crime to deprive the United States of excuses about the
lack of public security that could affect the operation of the
interoceanic waterway.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso said she will use a strong hand against criminals and
kidnappers, and also ordered the public security organizations to
make a more selective screening of foreigners who enter Panamanian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Panama has registered this year 11 kidnappings, the last two of
them occurring last weekend, according to Technical Judicial
Police reports.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, November 2, a commando made up of five Colombian
guerrillas kidnapped six persons: two pilots, and four tourists,
to hijack the two helicopters they were riding in.
</P>
<P>
National Police director Carlos Bares has kept in contact with
the Colombian authorities to study the case and establish its
possible links with other crimes in that country.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government has deployed more than 2,000 members
of the Public Force to protect its border zone with Colombia,
which was recently invaded by Colombian paramilitary forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Some of Britain's best-known
charities said on Friday they were joining forces to launch an
appeal next week for victims of the devastating Indian cyclone.
</P>
<P>
The Disasters Emergency Committee(DEC), which groups 11 British
charities, said it would launch its appeal in London on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It reported an urgent need for food, clean water, shelter and
medicines.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of people have been made destitute overnight and left
without livelihoods. Crops have been destroyed and livestock
killed. Britain's major charities are now appealing for money to
help people cope with this dreadful catastrophe," a spokesman for
DEC said.
</P>
<P>
About 7.5 million survivors of the cyclone which devastated the
east India state of Orissa last week are still marooned by
floodwaters despite frantic rescue operations.

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqis Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilian were injured
on Friday in U.S. and British warplanes attacks on service
installations in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:35 (0735 GMT) nine formations of
U.S and British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
violated southern Iraqi airspace over Basra, Thi-Qar, Qadissiya,
Wasit, Muthana and Najaf.
</P>
<P>
These planes bombed some service facilities in this region and
injuring two civilians, said the spokesman, who was not identified.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the planes
and repulsed them.
</P>
<P>
He said that 10 formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming
from the Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over
Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva provinces, and were also fought back by
Iraqi air defenses.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's air strike against Iraq, U.S. and British
warplanes have made 15,079 sorties over the two no-fly zones in
Iraq and have targetted regularly Iraqi civilian and military
targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S.-led western allies
following the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of protecting
the Kurds in northern Iraq and the Shiite Muslims in the south
from Iraqi government troop attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iraq refused to recognize these restricted zones, regarding
them as illegal U.S. and Britain move not covered by any
U.N. resolution.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Continue Investigate Missing Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government on Friday
refuted Turkish Cypriot claims that there were no missing persons
in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou pointed out that the
remains of 17-year-old Andreas Kasapis, a U.S. citizen listed as
missing, were discovered by U.S. investigators last year.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the Cyprus government is ready to continue
with the process of exhumation and identification of remains in
southern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus government, there have been 1,619
persons listed as missing since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Cyprus
started in May to exhume and examine remains of the victims to
find out their identities.
</P>
<P>
An agreement clinched by Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, on July 31, 1997, provides
for a full investigation into the fate of missing persons and the
exhumation of graves, in order to put an end to the suffering of
the relatives of Greek and Turkish Cypriot missing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Cyprus government announced that the
remains of 16-year-old Zenon Zenonos, killed during the first few
days in 1974 war, were exhumed and identified by forensic experts
from the U.S. and Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Britain Offers Pinochet Medical Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain has offered former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet, who is currently under house
arrest near London, a medical check-up after he suffered a third
minor stroke, a report said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The British government has asked if the general would undergo
a medical examination," a Reuters report quoted "a source close to
Pinochet" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source, who asked not to be named, said Pinochet had the
third stroke two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested a year ago in London and is now
suffering from depression and diabetes and has a pacemaker. His
supporters kept on arguing that the retired general should be set
free on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
A British court ruled last month that Pinochet, who suffered
two minor strokes in September, could face extradition to Spain on
torture charges.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was house-arrested in a London hospital in
October,1998 while he was recovering from a minor back operation.
A Spanish judge accused him of responsibility to the deaths and
disappearances of thousands people and wanted to try him in a
Spanish court.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw, who will have the final say on
whether Pinochet should be extradited, said last month the
government would not intervene until court proceedings, which
could go on for months, were over.

<HEADLINE> Deforestation Blamed for Hyacinth's Rampant Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Deforestation could be the root
cause for the rampant growth of the killer weed hyacinth, which is
threatening the ecosystem of Lake Victoria, researchers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists working on the shores of Africa's biggest lake
accidentally discovered a nutrient which is feeding the water
hyacinth whose tentacles have suffocated much of the lake's
aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
"We noticed a dramatic plume of nitrogen and phosphorous-rich
sediments that are feeding the water hyacinth,'' said Pedro
Sanchez, director general of the Washington based International
Center for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF).
</P>
<P>
ICRAF officials said that the deforestation around the lake
meant rain could sweep topsoil containing the nutrients more
easily into the water.
</P>
<P>
Scientists had previously believed that the nutrients were the
result of runoff from farmland on the shores of the 69,500 square
kilometre lake, the second largest freshwater lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
The water hyacinth, an aggressive floating weed that has
carpeted large areas, has starved fish and plankton of oxygen and
sunlight and reduced the diversity of important aquatic plants,
the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Hyacinth also has a serious negative impact on shipping, which
has become a chronic headache for the governments of the
countries surrounding the lake, they said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Bill for Medicare Payment Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Friday approved a legislation that will return
billions of dollars previously trimmed from Medicare payments to
hospitals, nursing homes and other caregivers.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was passed by a vote of 388-25, will provide a
Medicare cash relief of 11.5 billion dollars over five years.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was passed following strong lobbying by the
health care industry, which has complained it is struggling
financially because of 1997 Medicare cuts, even as government
surpluses grow.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money in the House bill would go to hospitals,
especially teaching hospitals, those located in rural areas, and
those that care for large numbers of uninsured patients.
</P>
<P>
Nursing homes and home health care companies also would get a
boost in their fees.
</P>
<P>
Health Managed Organizations (HMOs), which have quit serving
Medicare beneficiaries in many counties during the past two years,
would get bigger payments and additional cash bonuses if they
venture back into unserved areas.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to pass in Congress this fall though some
differences remain to be resolved between the House bill,
legislation pending in the Senate, and the Clinton administration,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Explosive Growth Expected in E-Commerce Sales, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Most U.S. policy makers,
company executives and association heads expected online retail
sales to grow by 500 percent in the United States over the next
two years, according to a recent survey by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and KPMG LLP.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted during a conference on
E-Commerce Taxation at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce/National
Chamber Foundation and Sponsored by KPMG LLP, involved 150 policy
makers, company executives and association heads.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three percent of the survey respondents predicted
Internet sales, estimated to be 8 billion U.S. dollars last year,
would reach 50-100 billion dollars by 2001, with nineteen percent
projecting it would top 100 billion dollars. Only 7 percent
thought that Internet sales would remain lower than 25 billion
dollars over the two-year period and 21 percent thought sales
would reach 25-50 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The conference explored the global implications of E-commerce,
state and local impacts of the tax moratorium on Internet sales,
and examined how Internet taxation might affect businesses and
customers, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Graham, a partner with KPMG's Financial Services
Consulting practice, said that "we are in a transitionary period
right now, one in which there is heightened interest in adopting
fair policy."
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of the survey respondents said a sensible
legal, fiscal and regulatory framework that minimized government
regulation could be adopted for the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) Friday signed an agreement to support use of
environmentally friendly liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in
Kazakhstan through a loan of up to 20 million U.S. dollars to
Alautransgas, a leading LPG distributor.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's investment consists of a loan of 20 million dollars
with a conversion option of up to 2 million dollars. Alautransgas
will use the loan to refurbish transport and industrial equipment,
tanks and cylinders, modernize eight regional gas distribution
centers, and expand operations into three new regions of
Kazakhstan, said the IFC, part of the World Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
As part of the project, Alautransgas will work with an
international LPG distributor to raise safety features to World
Bank Group standards, including investing in fire protection
equipment and automatic alert systems and by instituting industry
best-practice.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Khalil, regional director of the IFC's Central Asia,
Middle East and North Africa Department said that the project
supports a modernization program that will more than double the
company's LPG production and provide a reliable supply of LPG
across the country.
</P>
<P>
LPG is mainly used as a fuel for cooking. It is attractive to
use because it is more convenient than other fuels and is cleaner
than wood, coal or oil.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Defends Government's Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami Friday defended the government's decision
on a mosque building in Nazareth, the town of Jesus' boyhood,
saying the government has handled the Nazareth issue correctly.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said the Muslims and Christians in the northern Israeli
city have reached an agreement on issue.
</P>
<P>
A dispute erupted after a government committee gave permit to
the Muslims in the city to build a mosque on a piece of land just
meters from the Basilica of Annunciation, which Christians said
was the place where Angel Gabriel told Virgin Mary that she would
give birth to the Son of God.
</P>
<P>
Vatican had reportedly asked the Israeli government to
reconsider the issue, indicating that if the mosque were built at
that place, Pope John Paul II would cancel his planned trip to
Israel next March.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said, however, that the Christians in Nazareth have no
objections themselves to the mosque construction project and that
the issue had been blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he will seek a meeting next week with
Christian leaders of the country to "tell them the truth about the
so-called mosque dispute."
</P>
<P>
Christian leaders issued a statement here Thursday, saying they
will close their churches for two days to protest against the plan.
</P>
<P>
"All Sanctuaries of the Holy land (Israel) will be closed on
November 22-23, 1999, to express disapproval of the plan for a
mosque near Nazareth's Basilica of the Annunciation," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that we do not need to take any further steps in the
future," the statement added, apparently asking the Israeli
government to cancel the plan.
</P>
<P>
Clearly aiming at a global audience, the statement, which was
signed by the patriarchs of the Greek Orthodox, Latin and Armenian
Churches, was addressed to all ambassadors, local Christians,
Christian pilgrims and travel agents all over Israel.
</P>
<P>
The possible closure of the churches would also affect Israel's
hopes for a millennium tourism boom.
</P>
<P>
Israel expects 3 million foreigners to visit the country, where
the birthplace of Jesus the Christ was located, next year to
celebrate the start of the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> India, Russia Reiterate Strategic Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- India and Russia reiterated
Saturday their commitment to further promote and strengthen
bilateral strategic partnership oriented into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued Saturday at the end of a visit by
an official Russian delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Isifovich Klebanov, New Delhi and Moscow expressed satisfaction
with the state of affairs and the pace of development of the
Indo-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
It said the two countries' relationship was "characterized by
mutual respect, trust and mutual understanding and based on a
national consensus existing in both countries for further
promotion of fruitful cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The two countries Friday signed a protocol on
military-technical cooperation, under which Russia agreed to
supply military hardware to its traditional ally.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, basically the agreed minutes of the meeting of
the Indo-Russian Joint Working Group held here earlier this week,
was signed by the visiting Russian First Deputy Defense Minister
N. V. Mikhailov and Indian Defense Secretary T. R. Prasad.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation arrived here Thursday night for talks
with Indian leaders on military-technical cooperation between the
two countries as well as sale of ammunition and defense equipment.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailov said after signing the protocol that "a whole package
of initiatives on military-technical cooperation has been signed
... and all initiatives are inter-related."
</P>
<P>
The protocol, the Russian official said, "meets the accepted
political decisions" and will "strengthen the potential of
national security of both countries."
</P>
<P>
The seven-member Russian delegation and the Indian side had
"gone into considerable details of military-technical cooperation
and identifying areas of further cooperation," Indian Defense
Secretary Prasad said.
</P>
<P>
During their four-day visit, Klebanov and the delegation met
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh and Defense Minister George Fernandes.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that during his 45-minute meeting with
Vajpayee here Saturday, Klebanov gave to Vajpayee messages from
Russian President Boris Yelsin and Prime Minister V. Putin.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had wide-ranging discussions on bilateral issues,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Russian delegation to visit New Delhi after
the Kashmir conflict in June and July between India and
neighboring Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources here said talks between the two sides
concentrated on issues including purchases by India of military
hardware and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation is scheduled to conclude its India visit
on Sunday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft Corp. has used its unparalleled dominance in the
computer industry to bully rivals and squelch competition, a
federal judge ruled Friday in a stinging decision that lays the
foundation for a final judgement that could fundamentally realign
the multibillion-dollar technology industry.
</P>
<P>
-- The American campaign to develop a protective shield against
ballistic nuclear missiles is provoking serious alarm among the
European allies, who fear that it could weaken the political and
military links between the United States and Europe and trigger a
dangerous arms race with Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The government of President Slobodan Milosevic dismissed a
new American proposal to partly suspend sanctions if free
elections were held soon. Citing U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright's statement that Milosevic could not win a fair
election, a government spokesman and media outlets asserted that
the United States would recognize only a vote that his government
lost.
</P>
<P>
-- A remote-controlled submarine tethered to a Navy salvage
ship in the Atlantic off Nantucket in the United States closed in
on two pinging sounds that operators hope it would lead them to
the two flight recorders from EgyptAir Flight 990. The sounds are
coming from 250 to 270 feet of water, among small pieces of the
aircraft's wreckage, and may be covered by a fine silt on the sea
floor.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Says Will Strengthen Economic Ties With China, India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid said here Saturday that his country will
strengthen economic ties with China and India.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon for some 600 local and international
businessmen, Wahid said: "In future, Indonesia would like to
develop economic ties with the People's Republic of China as well
as India with the help of the technology, the contacts, the
capital and the managerial skills of the people from Singapore and
Japan."
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that Indonesia will promote relations
with China, India, Singapore and Japan not by sacrificing
relations and interests with other countries, noting that he will
go to the United States to meet President Bill Clinton after the
ASEAN informal summit in Manila later this month.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the economic policy of his government, Wahid said
Indonesia will let the market forces decide prices and everything
without government interference although the government can play
an important role.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia has the ability and resources to go forward
in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said that in his meeting with Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong earlier in the day, he asked for Singapore support
and advice on how to make Batam, an island of Indonesia, a free
trade zone and Goh suggested that Indonesia should look at making
Bintan and Karimun Islands free trade zones as well. He expressed
his interest and welcome to Goh's idea.
</P>
<P>
He also said Goh will lead an investment mission to Indonesia
after the informal ASEAN summit.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would ask Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew to be part of the International Advisory Board for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie said at the luncheon that he expected the
Indonesian economy to grow by about two percent next year, adding
that the International Monetary Fund would resume lending to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Wahid met with his Singapore counterpart S.
R. Nathan, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew.
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, Wahid left for Malaysia, the next leg
of his current ASEAN tour.

<HEADLINE> Gay Bar Blast Injures 6 in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Five men and one woman
were injured when an explosive device detonated at a gay bar early
on Saturday in Cape Town, South Africa, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at 12.20 a.m. local time when the device,
which had been placed against an inside wall of the Blah Bar,
detonated at the premises on Somerset road, Greenpoint -- a place
well known for its gay clubs.
</P>
<P>
Among those injured was Craig Gibson, co-owner of the bar, who
was admitted into the Somerset hospital and later discharged.
</P>
<P>
A cleaner at the club was also injured.
</P>
<P>
Captain Neville Malila, police spokesman for Operation Good
Hope, the unit established to combat urban terrorism, said the
inside wall of the bar took the major impact of the blast.
</P>
<P>
Damage was confined to most of the front section of the bar,
with the windows shattered and the doors blown out, he added.
</P>
<P>
The blast is unlikely to be linked to activities of urban
terrorism, Malila said, noting that the owner of the bar had not
received a bomb threat prior to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The device was set on a time-delay system because it was placed
about six meters from the entrance to the building during the time
the bar was open, he explained.
</P>
<P>
However, he could not confirm whether the explosive device was
a pipe bomb.
</P>
<P>
Another co-owner of the bar Glynnis Delenay said the bar was
"quite full" at the time of the blast.
</P>
<P>
"It is usually our busiest period just after midnight and it is
 fortunate more people were not injured," she said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Regrets Postponement of SAARC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday regretted
the postponement of the summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement that the
postponement of the SAARC Summit "on India's behest" has severely
damaged the organization and seriously impaired regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a gross breach of established norms of
inter-state relations, as well as the SAARC Charter," the
spokesman said, referring to the postponement of the summit on
India's behest citing internal developments in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Thus a precedent has been set which is derogatory to
international principles and detrimental to the organization,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The 11th summit of the seven South Asian nations was scheduled
to be held in Kathmandu, Nepal, on November 26-28. All SAARC
states, except India, have been of the view that the summit should
be held as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the SAARC member states and indeed the
entire international community cannot but conclude that "India has
scuttled the SAARC summit in reckless pursuit of her reckless
hostility towards Pakistan and her persistently negative attitude
towards dialogue and peaceful resolution of disputes."
</P>
<P>
In the process, he said, SAARC has been severely damaged and
the goal of economic development and progress through regional
cooperation has been seriously impaired.
</P>
<P>
The government of Sri Lanka, the SAARC chair, has expressed the
view that "a deviation for whatever reason, from the path of
collective endeavor commenced through SAARC, would at this
juncture have serious and damaging consequences for the progress,
prosperity, peace and security of South Asia," the spokesman said.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president arrived in Paris Monday on a private
visit for medical treatment of ear problem. He met with French

</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak are expected to attend a conference of the
Socialist International due to open on Monday, the news agency

light of outcome of the Oslo summit, Mubarak said.
</P>

Arafat, Barak and United States President Bill Clinton met on
Tuesday in the Norwegian capital and discussed the peace process,

thorny issues including Jerusalem, final borders, refugees and
Jewish settlement.

<HEADLINE> Australian Voters Reject Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia will keep its link
with the monarchy into the 21st century after a majority of voters
as five out of the country's six states rejected a republic
Saturday, vote-counting figures showed.
</P>
<P>
With 79.18 percent of the votes counted by the Australian
Electoral Commission Saturday night, the republic proposal was
defeated in five states.
</P>
<P>
Only in Victoria state, 50.1 percent of the voters said yes to
the republic and 49.9 percent said no.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the republic attracted only 45.28 percent support
and 54.72 of the voters said no.
</P>
<P>
To succeed, the referendum needs to attract a majority of
Australians and win a majority of votes in at least four states.
</P>
<P>
Also in the referendum, a proposed new preamble to the
Australian Constitution was soundly rejected across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Less than 40 percent of the nation voted for the proposal to
add a preamble to the constitution, which for the first time
mentions Aboriginal kinship with the land and refers to the
sacrifice of Australian servicemen and women in times of war.
</P>
<P>
The result came despite polls which showed that a solid
majority of Australians were in favor of a republic and this
indicated that voters were unhappy with the way a president would
have been appointed and dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor leader Kim Beazley, a major advocate of an
Australian republic, had already conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
"I'm terribly saddened by the result today," Beazley told ABC
radio.
</P>
<P>
"I am terribly saddened because it will do our country a little
bit of damage and I think there will be a wistfulness in the
community about this," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a marvelous legacy for the generation that
concluded this century to go into the next," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Labor Party would promise during the next election
to hold a non-binding plebiscite on the republic.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday night, leader of the Yes campaign for the
Australian Republican Movement Malcolm Turnbull was admitting that
a win was going to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
Turnbull told reporters that if the No vote won, it was "partly
attributable to" Australian Prime Minister John Howard's position
on the republic.
</P>
<P>
Former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, an advocate of an
Australian republic, was more openly pessimistic about the result.
</P>
<P>
"If you are going on the votes there now you'd have to say we
haven't got up," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It's looking pretty dicey in regard to getting the majority of
states," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hawke said that if the vote was lost Saturday night,
it was clear there would not be another chance under a non-Labor
government.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Improved in HK After Return: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Hong Kong
official said here Saturday that human rights have been improved
in Hong Kong in a number of aspects since its return to China in
1997 and that there is on-going progress.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law itself has improved protection of the human
rights in various ways and any law enacted in Hong Kong contrary
to it would be invalid, said Robert Allcock, acting solicitor
general of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), at a
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Article 39 of the Basic Law is a constitutional special status
for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (
ICCPR), which ensures all laws enacted in Hong Kong must comply
with the covenant, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ICCPR, Chapter 3 of the Basic Law sets out
fundamental rights and duties of citizens, he said. For example,
people have rights to strike and the freedom of choice of
occupation.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the judicial system, Allcock said the
establishment of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong is a major
step forward in terms of access to justice.
</P>
<P>
Before 1997, people have to go to London for the final appeal,
which was very expensive and prevented a number of people going to
the final appeal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is only after 1997 that all courts at all levels
were able to use the Chinese language in hearings, he said, adding
that this is a very important aspect of access to justice and the
rights of both defendants and plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. Human Rights Committee had expressed concern
that some people born in Hong Kong would be stateless.
</P>
<P>
This issue has been resolved with the application of the PRC
Nationality Law to Hong Kong in Annex III of the Basic Law, and
the Basic Law and a number of China's national laws improved human
rights in Hong Kong, he noted.
</P>
<P>
David Lan, secretary for home affairs, also said that Hong Kong
people enjoy better freedom of speech after the return, and the
press freedom enables people to express their views and even
criticism of the government.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government submitted a report to the U.N.
Human Rights Committee at its hearing in Geneva. The Committee
welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Hong Kong SAR government to
give publicity to its report and its commitment to give wide
dissemination to the Committee's concluding observations.

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) held a
reception here this evening to mark the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Mongolian Prime Minister Rinchinnyamiin Amarjargal and
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan said on the occasion that the
establishment of Sino-Mongolian diplomatic ties opened up a brand
new era of friendly relations between the two countries, and was
of great importance to promoting friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries have had smooth cooperation in
politics, economics, trade, culture, education, science and health
since the normalization of bilateral relations in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin had successful exchanges of visits since last year, Qi
said, adding that the two heads of state decided to develop a long-
term, healthy and good-neighborly relationship of mutual trust
oriented toward the 21st century, which set a direction of the
further growth of Sino-Mongolian relations.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian prime minister also attended a launching ceremony
of a commemorative envelope to mark the event earlier today.

<HEADLINE> Interpretation of HK Basic Law Entirely Legal: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The interpretation of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) by
the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) is
entirely legal and constitutional, said a government spokesman
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The SAR government emphasizes that not one person has been
deprived of the right of a fair hearing as a result of the
interpretation," he added.
</P>
<P>
At its hearing in Geneva on November 1 and 2, the Human Rights
Committee "did not say that the interpretation violated the ICCPR
(the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights)," the
spokesman said. "It only expressed concerns about the implications
of a request by the executive branch of government for an
interpretation for the independence of the judiciary and the right
to a fair trial."
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has noted these concerns, but is firmly of
the view that judicial independence of HK has not been weakened by
the interpretation.
</P>
<P>
"As we have explained both to the local community and to the
Human Rights Committee, the right of final adjudication of court
cases by the Court of Final Appeal is distinct from the right of
final interpretation of the NPCSC.
</P>
<P>
"The interpretation of the Basic Law to resolve the right of
abode issue received majority support in the Legislative Council.
According to opinion polls, it also received wide public support,"
the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Capture Another Town in Northern S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said Saturday that they had already captured
Puliyankulam, the ninth strategic town overrun by the rebels in
five days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
Puliyankulam is the last garrison town in the northern Wanni
region where government troops and LTTE rebels had fought major
battles during the past year.
</P>
<P>
"After overrunning Kanakarayankulam (Friday night), LTTE
commando units launched a fierce attack on Puliyankulam and
captured the town today," the rebels said in a statement issued
from London Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Puliyankulam, which lies about 27 km north of the
government-controlled town of Vavuniya, follows the LTTE's
capturing of other military complexes at Kanakarayankulam,
Mankulam, Olumadu, Karuppaddamurippu and Nainamadu on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since Tuesday, the LTTE had taken three other strategically
important towns of Oddusuddan, Nedunkerni and Ampakamam from
government troops.
</P>
<P>
"By overrunning several military complexes, bases and camps
within a short span of time by sudden and lightning assaults, the
Liberation Tigers have amassed a massive array of war materials
and military vehicles amounting to billions of rupees," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
With the capture of Puliyankulam, the strategic garrison town
of Vavuniya is now exposed to the LTTE's offensive thrust as
government troops' defense system in the Wanni region had
"collapsed suddenly," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of troops have already fallen back to bases in
Vavuniya to reinforce the defense system of the city where 50,000
Tamils live," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Basic Law Sets Out Democracy for Hong Kong: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The pace towards full
democracy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
is clearly set out in the Basic Law and that is the path Hong Kong
must follow, said a government spokesman Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law prescribes a mechanism for a decision to be
taken on the method for forming the Legislative Council after 2007,
" he said. "Moreover, a reservation was taken out against Article
25(b) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR) when it was extended to Hong Kong in 1976."
</P>
<P>
"This means that in terms of the covenant's application to Hong
Kong, we are not obliged to have elections on a basis of universal
suffrage. However, we will act according to our goal," said the
spokesman in response to the concluding observations made by the U.
N. Human Rights Committee after its hearing in Geneva on the HKSAR
government's report under the ICCPR on November 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the proposal to dissolve the
Provisional Municipal Councils after the terms of office of their
members expire is not a roll back in democracy.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it will enhance the Legislative Council's role in
monitoring the government's policies and the use of public funds
for municipal services, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The new 'District Councils' will have more directly elected
seats, increasing to a total of 390. They will also have an
enhanced role in the monitoring of government services at the
district level," he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Describes Rwanda's Spy Report as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has denied that two of
its envoys proposed to take over its embassy in Kigali have been
rejected by the Rwandan side reportedly because they are
operatives in intelligence organizations, the New Vision newspaper
reported Saturday. Earlier, a Rwandan English weekly Newsline
in its current edition quoted a Rwandan Foreign Ministry spokesman
as saying that they have rejected former External Security
Organization deputy chief Joan Rwabyomere and former Internal
Security Organization Director for Operations Sam Kwiringira, who
had reportedly been nominated for ambassador and deputy ambassador
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Rwandan government as saying they need
more names from which to choose the envoys because these two are
not competent enough to handle the delicate situation between the
two countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, this was denied by Ugandan State Minister for
Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi, who said it is not common for
Uganda to send a list of names for another country to choose from.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of Uganda's Foreign Affairs Ministry Ralph
Ochan described the Rwandan paper report as a laughable lie and
complete fabrication.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been good allies, but the shoot-out
between the armies of the two countries in Kisangani earlier this
year has soured their relationship.

<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Tibetan Hospital
has received more than 300,000 patients over the past seven years,
hospital director Huang Fukai said today at a meeting to celebrate
the 7th anniversary of its founding.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is an important part of traditional Tibetan
culture. The hospital's rapid development clearly refutes claims
by Dalai Lama cliques and anti-China forces that the Chinese
government is destroying traditional Tibetan culture, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at the State Administration of Chinese
Traditional Medicine, China has 134 hospitals of various ethnic
traditions, including 56 hospitals specializing in Tibetan
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The above-4,000-meter Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is said to be one of
the few pollution-free areas in the world. Many plants and animals
in this region are very effective in curing cardiovascular disease,
asthma, skin disease and rheumatism.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions China
showed their prowess on home turf to claim their fourth straight
crowns at the 7th Asian women's softball championship, which was
concluded here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Atlanta Olympics runners-up topped on the final
standings with perfect record though the final between the hosts
and Japan was canceled because of rain, with Japan and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea finishing the second and
third after Saturday's play-offs.
</P>
<P>
After sweeping Japan 7-1 in a preliminary contest Friday, top
qualifier China edged Japan 2-1 at the page-system play-offs
Saturday morning to ensure their triumph at this Asian meet.
</P>
<P>
Japan claimed the final berth after scoring a 2-0 win over the
DPR Korea, winners of the other play-offs game between the third
and fourth finishers from the preliminary round, but the rain
forced Japan to give up the chance to challenge the dominate
Chinese again.
</P>
<P>
"It is great to win for the fourth time in a roll. But I am
disappointed that our young players missed the chance to play
against our top rivals in the continent," said Chinese head coach
Liu Yaming.
</P>
<P>
Veteran short stop Wei Qiang opened the game with a home run to
put China at 1-0 and outfielder Mu Xia lifted it to 2-0 on Tan
Hua's two-base hit in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
China's error on catching in the third inning allowed Sato Rie
to earn the only point for Japan. China only consented two goals
in the championships, all to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korea, placed fourth in the preliminary round, upset
South Korea 2-0 in the play-offs, while South Korea had to settle
for the fourth place.
</P>
<P>
The all-star team was named after the six-day competitions
according to technical statistics with four Chinese players, two
Japanese and one player each from DPR Korea, South Korea and
Chinese Taipei on the list.
</P>
<P>
China's Zhang Yanqing was also voted the best pitcher while her
teammate Deng Xiaoling won the home-run hitter and Hirashita
Mayumi from Japan was the best leading hitter.
</P>
<P>
The quadrennial Asian event, which drew teams from 10 countries
and regions, was the first of the kind held in China.

various levels to fully support and coordinate with the media. "

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Terry Fox Run for Cancer Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua)-- The 19th Terry Fox Run, also
known as the "Marathon of Hope", was held here this morning to
raise funds for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
Nearly ten thousand participants, including doctors, embassy
officials, college students and 1,500 local cancer patients,
either ran, cycled, or used wheelchairs and roller blades during a
10 km journey starting from the Workers' Stadium to the Chinese
Cancer Institute (CCI) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Terry Fox, who lost his right leg to bone cancer, became the
Canadian national hero after he traveled across Canada on an
artificial leg to raise money for cancer research in 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping Terry's spirit in mind, we'll never succumb before any
serious illness," said Kenny Carnes, an American wheelchairs
athlete from the team representing United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Following Terry's death at the age of 23 in 1981, volunteers
began holding runs once a year to commemorate his death and raise
funds for cancer research. Over the past 20 years, 220 million
Canadian dollars (more than 136 million U.S. dollars) has been
collected among some 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
This year's event is organized by the Canadian Embassy and
Tumor Hospital under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. It
is the first time that Beijing has hosted the charity race on such
a large scale. All proceeds will go to the CCI.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urges S. Leone to Embark on National Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Friday addressed parliamentarians in Sierra Leone, urging
them to set a national agenda for peace so as to quickly steer the
country on the path of recovery following years of civil strife.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Saturday quoted him
as saying that "this is no time for politics but a time for a
national agenda. The national agenda for Sierra Leone as I see it
today is peace, security, reconciliation and disarmament."
</P>
<P>
The president pledged Nigeria's total commitment to peace,
security and development in Sierra Leone and stressed the
importance of investment to rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
"None of us in Africa can have employment for our teeming
populations unless we get investment from abroad", he said,
adding that conducive environments must be created in order to
attract foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Obasanjo's talks with President Tejan
Kabbah will focus on the eventual withdrawal of Nigerian troops in
the West Africa Peacekeeping Force (ECOWAS) from Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
While ECOMOG in its present form is expected to leave the
country, Nigerian troops will join as a part of a 6,000-strong
United Nations multinational peacekeeping force scheduled to be
deployed by the end of next month, according to officials of the
UN.

CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The leader for the Australian
Republican Movement, Malcolm Turnbull, was admitting on Saturday
night that a Yes win was going to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, Turnbull claimed if the No vote won, it
is "partly attributable to" Prime Minister John Howard's position
on the republic.
</P>
<P>
Former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, also an advocate of an
Australian republic, was more openly pessimist about the result.
</P>
<P>
"If you are going on the votes there now you'd have to say we
haven't got up," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It's looking pretty dicey in regard to getting the majority of
states," he added.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister said it was clear if the vote was
lost Saturday night, it was clear there would not be another
chance under a non-labor government.
</P>
<P>
Early vote counting by the Australian Electoral Commission
showed that the No case was taking a lead in the republic
referendum.
</P>
<P>
With about a quarter of the national vote counted, the YES vote
remains at 46 percent, behind the NO case with 53 percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Republic Heads for Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia will keep its link
with the monarchy into the 21st century after voters
overwhelmingly rejected the republic on Saturday, vote counting of
the Australian Electoral Commission showed.
</P>
<P>
With almost six million votes counted, the republic has failed
to secure a majority in any of the six states.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the republic attracted only 46 percent support with
almost half the vote counted.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise for the republic was in the key state of
New South Wales, where the republic failed to capture the
imagination of blue collar Labor voters in outer metropolitan and
regional seats.
</P>
<P>
However, the republic did poll strongly in inner city and
well-off suburbs.
Opposition Labor leader Kim Beazley, a major advocate of an
Australian republic, had already conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
"I'm terribly saddened by the result today," Beazley told ABC
radio.
</P>
<P>
"I am terribly saddened because it will do our country a little
bit of damage and I think there will be a wistfulness in the
community about this," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a marvelous legacy for the generation that
concluded this century to go into the next," he added.
</P>
<P>
Beazley said his Party would promise during the next election
to hold a non-binding plebiscite on the republic.
</P>
<P>
The vote counting result comes despite polls showing a solid
majority of Australians in favor of a republic, and indicated
voters were unhappy with the way a president would have been
appointed and dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proposed preamble to the constitution was also
rejected, attracting just over 40 percent support.
</P>
<P>
The proposed preamble for the first time mentions Aboriginal
kinship with the land, and refers to the sacrifice of Australian
servicemen and women in times of war.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the leader of the Yes campaign for the Australian
Republican Movement Malcolm Turnbull was admitting on Saturday
night that a win was going to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
Turnbull told reporters if the No vote won, it was "partly
attributable to" Prime Minister John Howard's position on the

PARIS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States marked a point in the great game of oil in
the Caucasus region by announcing on Friday in Ankara the
finalized agreement on constructing a strategic pipeline which
will bring oil from Azerbaijan to Turkey through Georgia. The 2,
000-kilometer long pipeline will transport oil of the Caspian Sea
to the world market by the terminal of Ceyhan in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
-- Pope John Paul II began on Friday a controversial 62-hour
visit to India, a country which has been entangled in the past
several months in a strong dispute over the exactions of Hindu
extremists against the Christian minority and accusations of
aggressive evangelization of certain Christian churches,
especially American churches.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Far from reinforcing the prestige of NATO, the Kosovo War
has triggered a debate on the construction of European defense
between European countries and the United States. French President
Jacques Chirac has insisted on the importance of strengthening
European defense as a priority of the work of France when it takes
over the rotating presidency of the European Union in the early
half of next year.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Le Figaro on the 10th anniversary of
the fall of the Berlin Wall, former Polish President Wojciech
Jaruzelski said that the process of the disintegration of the East
bloc started in Poland. He also said that he was right to impose
the martial law in 1981 in a Poland shaken by the Solidarity
movement, to avoid a Soviet military intervention or a repetition
of Hungary in 1956.

<HEADLINE> British MP Ends Humanitarian Crusade for Iraqis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- After a two-month
London-to-Baghdad bus trip to garner support for lifting sanctions
on Iraq, the British legislator George Galloway and his convoy
arrived at the Iraqi border Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Galloway said the aim behind the humanitarian crusade is to
enlighten the world and Arab public opinions with the sufferings
sustained by the Iraqi people under the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The British MP was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that people he met during his two-month trip all called for
lifting the sanctions, which he says constitute genocide crimes of
the U.S. and Britain by killing 7,000 Iraqi children per month due
to the shortages of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Galloway's red London double-decker bus has traveled through
Britain, France, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt
and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The intercontinental trip has been dubbed as Mariam Convoy
after a five-year-old Iraqi girl, Mariam Hamza, suffering from
leukemia who Galloway says manifests the consequences of the
U.N. sanctions on the health of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
Galloway set up the Mariam Appeal in 1998 when he brought
Mariam to Glasgow of Scotland, Britain for leukemia treatment in a
blaze of publicity.
</P>
<P>
Mariam was the first child that Galloway saw in the Baghdad
Hospital ward he visited. She was flown from Baghdad to Scotland
via Amman for emergency treatment at the renowned Yorkhill Royal
Hospital for sick children.
</P>
<P>
After several months of treatment, and with leukemia in full
remission, Mariam was flown back to her eagerly-awaiting family in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Mariam was admitted to Amman's al-Amal Center for cancer
treatment last Tuesday. She suffered from neurological disorders
such as blindness, seizure and weakness.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of neighboring Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Overrun More Towns in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Tamil rebels have captured five
more strategic towns Friday after fierce fighting which has left
hundreds of combatants killed on both sides in the north of Sri
Lanka, official sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) overran
the strategic town of Kanakarayankulam Friday night on the A9
highway after capturing Mankulam earlier on Friday, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
With the fall of Mankulam, the LTTE also took control over
Olumadu and Karuppaddamuripppu military bases, taking back a vast
area that the government troops had taken from the rebels last
year.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the LTTE rebels have also taken control of
Nainamadu, another key town west of Kanakarayankulam.
</P>
<P>
Kanakarayankulam is about 10 kilometers south of Mankulam, a
vital town 310 kilometers north of the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The loss of Mankulam was seen by military analysts here as a
serious blow to the government troops who lost three other bases
on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since Tuesday, the LTTE had taken three other strategically
important towns of Oddusuddan, Nedunkerni and Ampakamam from
government troops and seized a large quantity of arms, ammunition
and military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Over 1,000 troops have been killed and double that number
injured during the last four days of heavy fighting," the LTTE
said in a statement on Friday, adding that 82 LTTE fighters have
been killed so far.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said in a statement Friday that 89
soldiers had been killed and 645 others had been wounded, without
saying how many rebels had been killed or wounded in the fighting,
considered as the bloodiest since the fall of Kilinochchi town to
LTTE rebels in September last year.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition United National Party blamed the government
of President Chandrika Kumaratunga for the debacle and said the
setback was because troops were deployed to "gain political
mileage" ahead of the presidential election on December 21.
</P>
<P>
The latest losses might be a severe blow to President
Kumaratunga's chances of reelection, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The independent Island newspaper said Friday in an editorial
that the main parties have been embroiled in a power struggle
while the LTTE has been doing everything possible to achieve its
objective of a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
"So long as they continue to be blinded by political enmity to
the need for defeating the LTTE and the war is fought according to
a political agenda without a total focus, debacles on the front
will be inevitable and the LTTE will stand to gain," the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Talks Ought to Carry on After Nyerere: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi peace talks
should continue as efforts are being made to name another
facilitator to take over late Tanzanian leader Mwalimu Julius
Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete made these remarks in
the central town of Dodoma Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said that this is also the message given by leaders in
the Great Lakes region to Under-Secretary of the United Nations
Kieran Pendergast, who paid a visit here on Thursday, the African
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, Tanzanian founding president and the international
facilitator on the Burundi peace talks, died of Leukemia on
October 14 in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
Pendergast, who is in the region on a listening mission of
leaders' opinion on the Burundi talks, met President Benjamin
Mkapa Friday and is expected to leave here Saturday on a visit to
Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe before winding up his tour of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He has met Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Secretary
General of the Organization of the African Union Salim Ahmed
Salim, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and Kenyan Foreign
Minister Bonaya Godana.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders' willingness to have the process continued
is based on the fact that the negotiations are presently at the
committee level while Nyerere's role was at the plenary level,
Kikwete said.
</P>
<P>
"These committees are actually made up of members from various
countries worldwide and do not at this level require the role of a
facilitator," he said.
</P>
<P>
"According to schedule, the committee negotiations were planned
to go on between November 1 and 14 before they reach the plenary
session where the role of a facilitator would be required,"
Kikwete explained.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, several rounds of talks have been held in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, gathering all the warring
faction leaders at the same table to seek long-lasting peace to
the central African country.
</P>
<P>
A tiny landlocked country in the Great Lakes region, Burundi
was dragged into bloody conflicts in October, 1993 when the first
free elected ethnic Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye was
assassinated by the ethnic Tutsi- dominated Army.
</P>
<P>
So far some 150,000 people, mostly civilians, are estimated to
have been killed during the endless ethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the peace progress, the Great Lakes region
countries suspended on January 23 this year the economic sanctions
imposed on Burundi on July 31, 1996, a week after Pierre Buyoya
seized power in a bloodless military coup which toppled an ethnic
Hutu president.

<P>
MANILA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday his administration will neither
negotiate nor agree to any compromise with the New People Army
(NPA), the armed wing of the anti-government National Democratic
Front (NDF).
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program aired on the CBS-CBN Channel,
Estrada said: "The government will not negotiate nor enter into
any compromise with the NPA. They can do whatever they want. But,
they should be warned that if they violate the law, we will not
stop until they are punished."
</P>
<P>
NPA guerrillas have been involved in a series of raids in
Southern Luzon since the last week of October, torching a South
Korean construction firm's equipment and abducting some police
officers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the NPA is demanding a prisoner swap for one of
its commanders, Leonardo Pitao, who was captured by the government
intelligence group in Davao in the Southern Philippines Tuesday.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Saturday urged Malaysians to strive to ensure
that tolerance is practiced and inculcated to preserve racial
harmony and the well-being of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The people should take heed and be grateful for the benefits
they enjoy as Malaysians, Mahathir said in his message in
conjunction with Deepavali (Indians' festival) to be celebrated
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Deepavali celebrations this year should be more
cheerful compared to two years ago as Malaysia has been freed of
the economic crisis which hit the region in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir hoped that the people would join those celebrating the
Deepavali to further promote goodwill among the various races in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had managed to defend the nation and the
people from destruction at a time when some other countries faced
a bleak situation following attacks on their economies where
"riots, racial tensions, food shortage and unemployment...all
these happened within a short period and were widespread."
</P>
<P>
The people should be proud that all measures taken to defend
the economy from the manipulation of currency traders and market
speculators have been initiated by Malaysia on its own, he said.

trademark three-pointers but a pair of free throws by Williams
with just seconds remaining put the Kings out of reach at 98-95
before it settled at 100-95.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hezbollah Fighters Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah were killed in an Israeli air raid
earlier in the week, a statement issued by the group said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star quoted the statement as saying Saturday that
Haji Hussein Ali Mazlum, 29, and Ali Medlej, 21, both died
instantly when an Israeli warplane fired missiles at them.
</P>
<P>
They were penetrating the eastern sector of the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A third member of the resistance squad was wounded in the air
attack but managed to escape, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two bodies are still lying where they fell. They raise to
seven the number of Hezbollah corpses left in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has since been fighting to oust Israeli occupation
forces from country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Not to Allow India to Use Its Port: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has no
plan to allow India to use its southeastern Chittagong seaport,
State Minister for Shipping Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury told the
parliament on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the government does have a plan to allow Nepal to use the
Mongla port, some 170 kilometers southwest of here, for
international trade, said the state minister in reply to a
question from an opposition member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong and Mongla are the two main seaports of the country.
</P>
<P>
India has been pressing Bangladesh to allow it to use the
Chittagong port for its seven northeastern land-locked states,
which are relatively underdeveloped economically.

<HEADLINE> Marriages of Convenience Probed in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus police have began an
investigation into marriages of convenience, in which Cypriots
marry foreigners in order to get residence permits for them,
</P>
<P>
Local media reported on Friday that Cyprus' Attorney General
Alecos Markides has confirmed that there is no law against
marriages of convenience, but police are looking into cases where
"marriages are used as a means to get residence permits for
foreigners in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Police believe that these marriages are carried out in return
for fixed cash payments, between Cypriot men and foreign cabaret
dancers and barmaids, who are often coerced into prostitution by
local and foreign pimps.
</P>
<P>
There are also a number of foreign men and women, mainly
Russian, who marry locals merely to obtain a residence permit and
don't live with them.
</P>
<P>
The issue emerged during last week's House Ad Hoc Crime
Committee session looking into the cash-for-visas scam, when
Justice and Public Order Minister Nicos Koshis told law makers
that a Cypriot male had been paid 500 Cyprus pounds (1,000
U.S. dollars) by a policeman to marry his foreign girl friend,
whom he had never seen.
</P>
<P>
Markides said that the entire aliens law is now being
reviewed, including marriages of convenience.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police last month launched an emergency probe into
allegations that police officers are involved in flesh-trading and
are being paid to supply fake residence permits for foreign women
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has acquired a bad reputation for importing female
cabaret dancers who are then allegedly forced to work as
prostitutes.

<HEADLINE> Cyrus to Borrow Venus de Milo Statue From France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus intends to bring the
world's most famous classical statue, the Venus de Milo, to come
to the island from France to celebrate the holding of the 2000
Miss Universe pageant, local reports said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Nicos
Rolandis said that he had asked the French ambassador to Cyprus to
make arrangements to bring the ancient masterpiece to Cyprus on
loan for the whole month of May 2000, when the 2000 Miss Universe
pageant will he held.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to bring the statue, found by a farmer in a field
on the Greek island of Melos in 1820, on loan for the month of May
next year and return it to France after the pageant," Rolandis
said.
</P>
<P>
Legend said that Venus, the goddess of love and beauty in Greek
mythology, was born from the sea off Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The French ambassador has promised to convey the Cyprus
government's request to the French Culture Ministry and to the
Louvre Museum in Paris, said Rolandis.
</P>
<P>
A number of insurance companies had expressed their interest in
insuring the second century B.C. statue, throughout its transport
and stay on the island, free of charge, because of the huge
publicity the project would get.
</P>
<P>
The statue was carved in about 150 B.C. by Antioch sculptor on
the Meander river and was taken to the Louvre Museum after it was
unearthed in Melos.

<HEADLINE> Research, deployment of ABM System Unpopular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The research and deployment of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) system goes against the will of
the people, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when commenting on the adoption of a
resolution on the preservation of and compliance with the Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) by the First Committee of
the United Nations General Assembly Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the will and determination of the international
community to oppose the deployment of the ABM system and the
revision of the ABM Treaty by certain countries," Zhu said, adding
that China, as one of the co-sponsors of the resolution, expressed
heart-felt gratitude for those countries which voted in favor of
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
A certain country has made great efforts to develop the
National Missile Defense plan and worked with some other countries
in researching and producing advanced Theater Missile Defense
system in recent years, with an attempt to seek their absolute
security and strategic advantages, the Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman said, noting that this directly runs counter to the
purpose and objective of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and is
not conducive to international peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"This should be definitely opposed by the international
community," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu quoted an old Chinese saying that a just cause enjoys
abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support,
adding that the research and deployment of the Anti-Ballistic
Missile system goes against the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
"China urges countries concerned to seriously heed the strong
voice of the international community, and abandon the
Anti-Ballistic Missile plan which not only harms others, but does
not benefit themselves," Zhu said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 34
nations in the West Hemisphere Friday pledged to strengthen their
cooperation in fighting illegal drugs at the end of their three-
day meeting here.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, co-sponsored by the U.S. Office of National

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Paper Industry in Crisis: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's paper industry,
which has been hard hit by huge losses, are facing challenges of
lack of policy support and imported newsprint, a leading English
language daily newspaper here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All the four state-owned paper mills under the Bangladeshi
Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) are facing a grave
situation due to serious liquidity crisis which might lead to
closure of the industry, The Financial Express quoted sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Market constraints, coupled with acute shortage of working
capital, have forced the industry to utilize only a fraction of
its installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Khulna Newsprint Mill produces some 21,573
tons of newsprint against its installed capacity of 48,000 tons a
year, and the North Bengal Paper Mills produces about 5,397 tons
against its capacity of 15,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the four mills under the BCIC
have incurred a cumulative loss of 6.5 billion taka (130 million
U.S. dollars) till June 30, 1999. The industry incurred a loss of
1.01 billion taka (20.2 million dollars) during the 1998-99 fiscal
year ending on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the losses mainly to duty-free import of
newsprint, fund constraints and disruption in production due to
lack of infrastructural supports, including raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Sales of papers, especially the newsprint, have also come down
substantially as imported papers, superior both in quality and
appearance, are available in the market at cheaper prices, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the mills are facing stiff competition with
imported papers in marketing their products and are forced to
reduce their production as well as prices.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the crisis, the Bangladesh Paper and Board Mills
Association has urged the government to restrict the quota for
newspapers by about 50 percent, convince the industry of meeting
its quotas by using local newsprint, and increase the tariff value
from 850 dollars to 1,000 dollars per ton of imported paper.

Nations (ASEAN) which will be held here from November 24 to 28.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Saturday, the presidential palace
said that Estrada will meet the leaders of the nine ASEAN
member-countries and three dialogue partners of the regional
grouping, namely, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The 10 ASEAN member-countries are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The palace said that the informal summit in Manila, which will
fall on November 28, will be preceded by a special joint
ministerial meeting (JMM) on November 26 and a special ASEAN
finance ministers meeting, a special joint consultative meeting,
and the senior officials meeting, all to be held on November 25.
</P>
<P>
The special JMM will be attended by ASEAN foreign, economic and
finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is the third ASEAN country to host the ASEAN
Informal Summit. The first informal summit was held in Jakarta on
November 30, 1996, while the second in Kuala Lumpur on December
15-16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the Fourth ASEAN Summit held in Singapore in 1992, the
ASEAN leaders agreed to meet informally every year between the
formal summits which are held every three years.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN informal summits provide an opportunity for ASEAN leaders
to engage in free-wheeling discussions on issues of common
concern, without need for a formal agenda. A list of topics,
however, is usually prepared to serve as guide for the discussions
by the leaders.

<HEADLINE> Tea Production Declines in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The production of tea in
Bangladesh has declined remarkably during the current production
season, The Independent daily newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The total production of tea during the season ending in
September this year was 29.09 million kilograms, about 25 percent
less than the 39.02 million kilograms harvested during the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The total tea output this year might be 20 percent less than
that of last year when the country witnessed a record tea
production of about 55.97 million kilograms, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decrease in tea production was mainly caused by
unprecedented drought at the advent of the production season, tea
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the domestic demand for tea is on the increase at
the rate of 3 percent annually on an average. The domestic demand
for tea in the country was 3.81 million kilograms in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The volume of tea export has also declined in the backdrop of
increase of domestic demand and dipping tea prices in the
international market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exported 21 million kilograms of tea in 1998, mostly
to Britain, Pakistan, Sudan, Egypt, Russia, Afghanistan, Iran,
Kuwait and Poland.

WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ruled Friday that Microsoft is a monopoly, a
decision that could lead to serious sanctions against the software
empire.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious
market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on
pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one
of Microsoft's core products," the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision to apply the monopoly label is a
significant setback for Microsoft Corp., as well as a clear
recognition of the expansive influence of the software giant,
whose Windows products run most of the world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Still, Friday's action does not necessarily mean the company
will lose the case. Federal law generally bans companies from
maintaining monopoly power through illegal business practices, but
not from achieving their success selling popular products or
making shrewd business decisions.

EU Approves Loan for Central America
</P>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
approved the third phase of a plan to assist Central America with
a loan of 16 million euros (16.8 million U.S. dollars), Honduran
Social Investment Fund (FHIS) Minister Waleska Pastor said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Honduras will be the most benefited country of the region, as
it suffered in October 1998 the worst devastation of hurricane "
Mitch," which caused more than 4 billion dollars of economic
losses to the country, almost equaling its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Pastor said that 23 of the 48 assistance projects approved by
the EU will be developed in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
He said that 6.8 million dollars of the loan will go to the
most needed sectors, such as water, sanitation, health and
education.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European group has provided since last November
33.9 million dollars for Central America, of which 15.75 million
dollars were earmarked to Honduras in the first two phases of
assistance for natural emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane "Mitch" claimed the lives of about 10,000 people,
affected three million and afflicted 5 billion dollars of
economic losses in the region in October and November in 1998. (

MEXICO CITY -- Trade between Mexico, the United States and

percent increase over 1998, an official of the Mexican Commerce
and Industrial Development Secretariat (SECOFI) said on Friday
</P>
<P>
The start of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in
January 1994 promoted the trilateral exchange, said SECOFI
economic advisor with the Mexican embassy in Washington, Alma
America Alfaro.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the three nations went from 300 billion dollars
before the establishment of NAFTA to 523 billion in 1998, a 74
percent increase, Alfaro said at a congress in Hermosillo, the
capital of the state of Sonora, 1,530 kilometers northwest of
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
Mexico became the second largest trade partner of the United
States only after Canada, Alfaro said at the 5th International
Congress of Administration and Finances sponsored by the Higher
Studies Technological Institute of Monterrey (ITESM).

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Law Ministers Meeting Ends in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Law ministers from Southeast
Asian countries Saturday closed their two-day meeting here after
discussions on enhancing cooperation within ASEAN in the legal
sphere.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued after the Fourth ASEAN Law
Ministers Meeting (ALMM), the ministers agreed to establish an
ASEAN Government Law Directory which will contain particulars
about the government structure and key law officials of each ASEAN
member country.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to set up a government legal officer program
which will be held every two years to promote mutual understanding
of ASEAN legal systems.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that ASEAN countries engage in exchange of visits
by law officials and the share of legal information.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups Brunei,
Philippines, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand,
Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
S. Jayakumar, law and foreign minister of Singapore as well as
chairman of the ALMM, said in his closing statement that there are
certain inescapable facts which pose a challenge to the
realization of substantial legal cooperation within ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
One such fact is the existence of many diverse legal systems
within the 10 ASEAN countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The law ministers had never intended to force their
"kaleidoscopic ASEAN legal landscape into a unified legal system,"
which is "neither practical nor possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the ministers reached a consensus that they should
focus on areas "where ASEAN legal systems and legal systems and
legal fraternity can collectively facilitate the broader efforts
of ASEAN cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The ALMM, held every three years by ASEAN countries, was
preceded by the sixth ASEAN Senior Law Official Meeting which made
preparations on ideas and proposals in legal sphere before the
ministers met.

<HEADLINE> Flood Death Toll Tops 349 in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 349 people were killed
in Vietnam's severely-flooded central coast provinces over the
past week, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some 234 of these deaths have so far been recorded in Hue, the
most devastating flooded area.
</P>
<P>
Many sections of Vietnam's National Highway 1 in Thua Thien-Hue
province were still between 1.5m and 2m under water on Friday.
Traffic on Hai Van Pass, which is located in the midway between
Hue and Da Nang, remained blocked by landslides.
</P>
<P>
Communication and power lines are still held up in the seven
central coast provinces.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a new tropical depression began moving on Friday
afternoon from the sea towards Phu Yen and Ninh Thuan provinces in
a direction northwards towards the seven devastated provinces of
the central coast, according to Vietnam's National Center for
Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.
</P>
<P>
More heavy rain forecast for the next few days is expected to
hamper relief on the flooded central coast.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has ordered all
available military personnel and other government agencies to join
in what is one of the largest emergency missions undertaken in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Germany Agrees to Pay More to Slave Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The German government has
decided to pay more compensation to former Nazi forced laborers, a
German government representative said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with U.S. Deputy Treasury
Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, Otto Lambsdorff, chief German
negotiator in the negotiations on compensation to the World War II
Nazi slave laborers, also urged German companies to do so.
</P>
<P>
The German official said his government has decided to offer a
"significant improvement," but refused to reveal the exact figure.
</P>
<P>
The German government had offered 1.05 billion U.S. dollars and
the corporations offered 2.15 billion U.S. dollars to the victims,
far less from the demand by the survivors, who recently scaled
down their demand from over 30 billion U.S. dollars to about 12
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lambsdorff also said that the next round of negotiations will
be held on November 16-17 in Bonn. However, he added that there
probably won't be an agreement with victims at the talks.
</P>
<P>
The German government and dozens of big companies were accused
of operations in Germany during the World War II using more than
12 million people as forced laborers. Reports say two million of
the slave laborers were still alive today.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Children in East Europe in Worsening Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Conditions for children in East
Europe and the former Soviet Union have deteriorated over the past
10 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Germany newspaper
Der Tagesspiedel quoted the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said in a report, based on a survey sponsored by former
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, that the
transition to capitalism has led to a drastic reduction in
national expenditures, the disintegration of social welfare
systems and the eruption of a spate of armed conflicts in East
Europe and the former Soviet Union, and that children in these
countries bore the brunt of all the adverse impacts.
</P>
<P>
About 20 percent of the 150 million children in the region have
been turned homeless. Dire consequences of unemployment have
thrown tens of thousands of families into poverty, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Across the region, children living under state care have nearly
doubled since 1989, with less and less children attending schools.
Many schools are forced to close for months in winter due to the
lack of electricity and heating facilities.
</P>
<P>
Many youngsters, unable to see where their future lies, have
grown weary of life. The number of young people aged between 15 to
19 who have committed suicide has doubled, the number of drug
users are now twice the figure before and alcohol addicts
increased six times.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as a result of prevalent drug abuses, the number
of AIDS patients skyrocketed from 30,000 in 1995 to 270,000 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Genscher said that the European Union countries, when
negotiating with East European countries aspiring to join the EU,
should give more considerations to their social responsibilities
and the economic development in those countries, instead to giving
primary consideration to contending for sphere of influence and
power expansion.
</P>
<P>
He noted: "If you ever want to realize human rights and defend
human dignity, you should first have children in mind and try to
realize their rights and safeguard their interests since they are
always the weakest group in the society."

JOHANNESBURG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's star
swimmer Penny Heyns was among the eight winners of the annual
Presidential Sports Awards named by South African President Thabo

</P>
<P>
The prestigious gala event at the Presidential Guest House, is
held annually to pay tribute to the achievement of the country's
top athletes.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Mbeki said the function indicated the high
regard the country had for its sport stars. Sports had
contributed greatly to nation-building in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he was also confident that sports teams would be
racially representative of all South Africans in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that, as we overcome the legacy of our
discriminatory past, the day will come when in every major sports
tournament, our teams will, like the supporters, be composed of
South Africans of all colors and creeds," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Sports Commission would go a long way in
eliminating the obstacles remained to develop sports opportunities
for South Africans, Mbeki added.
</P>
<P>
Also listed as the individual gold class winners were cricket
all-rounder Lance Klusener who was named man of the match four
times during the Cricket World Cup earlier this year, Springbok
Mark Andrews, one of the world's top ten locks, Bafana Bafana
Captain Lucas Radebe, women's hockey captain Karen Roberts and two
members of the National Paralympic Committee of South Africa, Jane
Mandean and Tadhg Slattery.

<P>
The paralympic team won a total of four awards, including two
silver awards to Krige Schabort and Situ Ntombizanele.

receive gold award.

awards.
</P>
<P>

Samaai and footballer George Thabe. A posthumous award was also
made to Colin Roy Clarke for tennis.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour said while South Africa's
participation in world sport was once remembered more for its
symbolic significance, "we now regard ourselves as serious
contenders for continental and international honors".

<HEADLINE> Agassi Makes Last Four at Paris Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi held off the
blistering services from Australian Mark Philippoussis to move
into the semi-finals of the Paris Open on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The world number one routed the hard-hitting Philippoussis 6-4,
6-1 in just 65 minutes, setting up a meeting with 11th-seeded
Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, winner here five years ago, was never challenged by the
man nicknamed 'Scud' as he dominated rallies and found some
incredible angles to move his big opponent around the court.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who lost just seven points in his nine service games,
even won the ace count 9-8 as Philippoussis let himself down with
seven double faults.
</P>
<P>
In a close match between two of the rising stars of tennis,
Lapentti beat Germany's Tommy Haas 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Lapentti's win puts him in line for a place at the season-
ending ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover later this month
</P>
<P>
Earlier in day, Michael Chang made his first Super 9 semi-final
of the year with a 5-7, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 win over local hero Cedric

Chang, who had to qualify for an ATP event for the first time
in 11 years to earn a place at the Paris Open, was ranked in the
top 10 for six consecutive years before falling out of the top 20
last year.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Loan for Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
approved the third phase of a plan to assist Central America with
a loan of 16 million euros (16.8 million U.S. dollars), Honduran
Social Investment Fund (FHIS) Minister Waleska Pastor said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Honduras will be the most benefited country of the region, as
it suffered in October 1998 the worst devastation of hurricane "
Mitch," which caused more than 4 billion dollars of economic
losses to the country, almost equaling its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Pastor said that 23 of the 48 assistance projects approved by
the EU will be developed in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
He said that 6.8 million dollars of the loan will go to the
most needed sectors, such as water, sanitation, health and
education.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European group has provided since last November
33.9 million dollars for Central America, of which 15.75 million
dollars were earmarked to Honduras in the first two phases of
assistance for natural emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane "Mitch" claimed the lives of about 10,000 people,
affected three million and afflicted 5 billion dollars of
economic losses in the region in October and November in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Coal City Shifts Towards Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Datong, long known as "coal
city" in north China's Shanxi Province, is now shifting its
economic emphasis to tourism. according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The area is abundant with tourism resources: the Yungang
Grottoes; Wutai Mountain, one of the four well-known Buddhism
resorts in China; the Suspended Temple built over 1,000 years ago,
and the 2,700-year-old Pingyao Ancient City, which was named on
the World Heritage List in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Datong's tourism income in 1998 stood at about 100 million yuan
( 12 million U.S. dollars), or 0.6 percent of the GDP (Gross
Domestic Product). And if the percentage reaches 4 percent, the
average level for the whole country, another 500 million yuan will
be added to its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Development of tourism also will bring along a greater number
of job opportunities, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The city has changed the route of the No.109 National Highway,
which used to pass the Yungang, to avoid the pollution brought by
the coal trucks.
</P>
<P>
The 298-km Datong-Beijing Expressway project, with a budget of
6.8 billion yuan, is now underway. And dozens of hotels and
restaurants have been set up in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The city is the main supplier of coal in China, with three-
fourths of its exploited coal sent to the other parts of the
country and to foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Long-term exploitation of coal resources has rapidly reduced
its reserve, and it is estimated that the resource will be
exhausted in another 20 years. Since last year, Datong has reduced
its annual output by 1.5 million tons since last year.

<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United's hopes of
retaining the Champions League received a boost when Fiorentina
admitted they have no hope of finishing atop of their second-round
pool.
</P>
<P>
United and the Italians are joined in Group B by Bordeaux and
Valencia, with Sir Alex Ferguson's men starting with a game at
Fiorentina - who have Gabriel Batistuta in their ranks - on
November 23.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, meanwhile, have a tough draw in Group D, with Lazio,
Feyenoord and Marseille providing their opposition.
</P>
<P>
Fiorentina accounted for Arsenal in the last round but 'La
Viola' general manager Giancarlo Antognoni said: "Manchester
United are the team to beat but we have to try and finish second;
we have to beat Valencia and Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
"We always have good matches against English teams and we're
looking forward to it."
</P>
<P>
United secretary Ken Merrett, in Geneva for this morning's draw,
was in upbeat mood after the outcome was known.
</P>
<P>
Valencia beat Rangers to a place in the second phase but
Merrett said: "I think it's a very attractive draw.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a long history with any of the clubs but we're
certainly looking forward to going to Bordeaux, Valencia and
Florence.
</P>
<P>
"They're great places to go to and those of us who like the
wine will be delighted to be going to Bordeaux!"
</P>
<P>
Jean-Louis Triaud, president of the French club, added: "Every
draw at this stage of the competition is difficult. Marseille
proved that Manchester United are beatable. Maybe United will take
more care against the French teams now but United are still a
legendary side."

<P>
SINGAPORE, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid arrived here Saturday morning on a working visit
to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
This is Wahid' first overseas trip since he was elected
president of Indonesia last month.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the airport by Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong and Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo
(Minister-in-Attendance) and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The unusual welcome to the Indonesian head of state indicates
that the Singapore government attaches great importance to the
visit which is regarded as a chance to improve the rather strained
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Wahid will meet with his Singapore
counterpart S. R. Nathan, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew at Istana (the presidential
palace) later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president will also address the international and local
business community in Singapore at a luncheon to speak about his
vision and strategies for economic recovery in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The luncheon is hosted by Singapore Economic Development Board
(EDB) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian president will leave for Malaysia Saturday
afternoon to continue his round of calls on neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Mexico, the
United States and Canada will reach 600 billion U.S. dollars this
year, a 14.7 percent increase over 1998, an official of the
Mexican Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat (SECOFI)
said on Friday
</P>
<P>
The start of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in
January 1994 promoted the trilateral exchange, said SECOFI
economic advisor with the Mexican embassy in Washington, Alma
America Alfaro.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the three nations went from 300 billion dollars
before the establishment of NAFTA to 523 billion in 1998, a 74
percent increase, Alfaro said at a congress in Hermosillo, the
capital of the state of Sonora, 1,530 kilometers northwest of
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
Mexico became the second largest trade partner of the United
States only after Canada, Alfaro said at the 5th International
Congress of Administration and Finances sponsored by the Higher
Studies Technological Institute of Monterrey (ITESM).
</P>
<P>
NAFTA has created a market of 385 million potential consumers
in Mexico, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Mexico represents 10.4 percent of the United States imports,
and the United States represents 74 percent of Mexican imports,
which strengthens bilateral relations, Alfaro said.
</P>
<P>
The SECOFI official said that Mexico and the United States are
eliminating bilateral tariffs in a gradual way for markets with a
more open competition.
</P>
<P>
The SECOFI economic advisor said, without giving figures, that
90 percent of Mexico's exports are manufactured goods, seven
percent are oil and mineral products, and three percent are
agricultural and livestock products.

CARACAS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's oil basket price
rose 14 U.S. cents this week to 20.31 U.S. dollars per barrel,

production by a quota of 2.1 million barrels a day slated for one
year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Judge Rules Microsoft Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ruled Friday that Microsoft is a monopoly, a
decision that could lead to serious sanctions against the software
empire.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious
market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on
pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one
of Microsoft's core products," the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision to apply the monopoly label is a
significant setback for Microsoft Corp., as well as a clear
recognition of the expansive influence of the software giant,
whose Windows products run most of the world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Still, Friday's action does not necessarily mean the company
will lose the case. Federal law generally bans companies from
maintaining monopoly power through illegal business practices, but
not from achieving their success selling popular products or
making shrewd business decisions.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft issued a statement calling the judge's findings "just
one step in an ongoing process, with many more steps remaining.
We're confident the American legal system will ultimately support
our position and that our actions have benefited consumers."
</P>
<P>
Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein said, "This is a
tremendous victory for America's consumers... (that) shows once
again that in America no person and no company is above the law."
</P>
<P>
A final ruling could come by the end of the year, with any
penalties or remedies spelled out next year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Jackson could order that Microsoft be broken up
into smaller companies that would compete against each other. Or
he could choose from a range of lesser punishments, such as
requiring Microsoft to allow rivals to sell and improve its
dominant Windows operating system, or prohibiting the company from
interfering with new technology that could threaten Windows.
</P>
<P>
Appeals are likely to keep the case in court -- and delay any
punishments -- for several years.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled
Friday that Microsoft is a monopoly, a decision that could lead to
serious sanctions against the software empire.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious
market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on
pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one
of Microsoft's core products," the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision to apply the monopoly label is a
significant setback for Microsoft Corp., as well as a clear
recognition of the expansive influence of the software giant,
whose Windows products run most of the world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Still, Friday's action does not necessarily mean the company
will lose the case. Federal law generally bans companies from
maintaining monopoly power through illegal business practices, but
not from achieving their success selling popular products or
making shrewd business decisions. (US-Microsoft-Monopoly)

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose Friday
as the U.S. strong economy with lower-than-expected wage growth
eased worries about inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 64.84 at 10,704.48.
The blue chip index rose for the third straight session Friday but
it lost 25.38 points this week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 7.30 at 1,370.23 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 46.34 at 3,102.29, surpassing the
record closing high of 3,055.95 points set Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Labor Department reported that the
U.S. unemployment rate fell to a three-decade low of 4.1 percent
in October but average hourly earnings grew by a tiny 0.1 percent
in the same period. The data indicated that the hot economy
tightened the labor market but did not spark wage inflation.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices also rose after the report on the unemployment rate
and wage growth. The yield on the 30-year Treasury dropped to 6.02
percent Friday from a two-year high of 6.37 percent just last
week.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the bond yield turned away investors from the bond
market and helped move financial stocks higher. American Express
and J.P. Morgan led the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.64 at 627.36 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 2.51 at 442.41. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 0.73 at 806.74.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,756 up, 1,323 down and 472
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.00 billion shares from 970.71
million in the previous session.

"Mr. Berger raised our concerns about an early return to

stand that "it is very important to have the constitutional,
democratic and civilian government in Pakistan restored and that
we are looking for a timetable for steps to that end to be
described as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council spokesman said Washington also
wanted to have talks with Pakistan about regional security,
weapons proliferation, anti-narcotics operations and the putting
of pressure on the Taliban in Afghanistan to hand over Saudi-born
Osama bin Laden for trial on bombing charges.
</P>

Yaqub Khan will meet Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering
at the State Department later in the day. And he might also hold

<HEADLINE> 15 Dead in Combats in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Combats between the
guerrillas and the paramilitary in the north of Colombia caused 15
dead, military authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting occurred in a region of the Bolivar department
where the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) detained
recently several journalists and cameramen, and where 15
passengers of a plane hijacked last April were taken by the
National Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
The FARC and the ELN are disputing the United Self-Defense of
Colombia (AUC) paramilitary organization's control of the land in
that zone.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Joint Staff Chief General Rafael Hernandez Lopez
told the press that the guerrillas and the paramilitary have had
new confrontations in the region.
</P>
<P>
The FARC and the ELN, the two most important leftist guerrilla
groups in the country, have resisted for almost two years the
pressure of the far-right paramilitary in that region.
</P>
<P>
The zone of the confrontations is south of Cartagena, capital
of the Bolivar department, in the north.
</P>
<P>
The FARC detained last Friday four journalists and three
cameramen, who were released Tuesday, to publicize the
consequences of the paramilitary presence.
</P>
<P>
The ELN retains in the same region 15 passengers of a
commercial airliner it hijacked on April 12, when it was flying
from Bucaramanga to Bogota.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: It's Up to Israel to Decide How to Talk With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Friday that the current Israeli government would decide how to
deal with whatever might have been said before in its effort to
resume talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there's a change of government in Israel. And it's
up to the Israeli government to decide how to deal with whatever
might have been said before," State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin had promised complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
And a Syrian official said Wednesday that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright did not challenge this understanding.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials have said Rabin brought up full
withdrawal as a hypothetical possibility, to see what Syria would
offer in return in the way of normal relations.
</P>
<P>
The question of who said what in the Syrian-Israeli talks is
holding up attempts to resume the talks, which broke off at
Israel's request in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that in contacts through former U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher Israel made no agreement on withdrawal
from all of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and there were
no agreements on this question during the discussions between
Secretary Christopher and (Syrian) President (Hafez) al-Assad,"
Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Italy in Last Place in Support for Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy holds down last past in
Europe in standings on public support provided to families, the
International Center on Family Studies (CISF) reported Friday and
noted that this support declined in Italy from 1.2 percent of
gross domestic product in 1985 to 0.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In its sixth annual report on the state of the family unit in
the country, the center said families obviously are not given
priority by Italian politicians and the government would have to
double spending in this area to reach levels of support prevailing
in Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1995, family allowances in Italy have declined
by 12 percent while rising in Austria, Portugal, Britain and
Denmark by between 28 percent and 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
From another angle, CISF said single-person families in Italy
have risen to account for 21 percent of all households,
single-parent families now reach 7 percent of the total and
re-formed family units account for 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
These families are the ones most in need of public assistance,
with traditional families with children now no longer able to
maintain the pace of pro capita consumption.
</P>
<P>
Also the fiscal system is merciless in dealing with families in
Italy, said the center which affirmed that taxpayers are called on
to pay their taxes but do not receive the support from the state
to which they should be entitled.

<HEADLINE> President Chavez Plans to Govern Venezuela Until 2013 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said Friday he wants to govern the country until the year
2013, one day after the Constitutional Assembly approved the
extension of the presidential mandate and the immediate reelection
in the new Magna Charta provisional draft.
</P>
<P>
"If God wants it and the people resists it and understand my
message, I want to govern the country for more than 10 years,"
said Chavez at a ceremony that inaugurated the Bank of the People,
with the delivery of the first credits for a total 50 million
bolivars, some 80,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Assembly approved Thursday night an article
that extends the presidential period from five to six years, with
the possibility of an immediate reelection.
</P>
<P>
The present constitution, in force since 1961, permits the
presidential reelection 10 years after the end of a previous
period of government.
</P>
<P>
"If God wants and the people desires it, when we pass on the
government in the year 2013, Venezuela must be completely changed,
without corruption and without poverty," said Chavez.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Assembly, elected last July 25, has a
six-month deadline to finish the new magna charta, which will be
submitted to a referendum on December 15.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Compromised Foreign Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Friday approved a compromised foreign aid bill for
the fiscal year 2000 through the House after the Clinton
administration and the Republicans reached a compromised deal.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by a vote of 316-100 and will be sent to
the Senate for a vote. It is widely believed that the legislation
will easily pass the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this marks the start of a bipartisan effort to ensure
that America has not only the will and the resources to lead, but
also the wisdom to invest in peace," President Bill Clinton said
after the House vote.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, negotiators from the two sides agreed to
increase the funding from 12.7 billion U.S. dollars to 15.3
billion U.S. dollars for the bill.
</P>
<P>
Saying it's far from adequate, Clinton vetoed the bill which
was approved by Congress last month. Clinton indicated the cutback
of funding for foreign operation is an evidence of "new
isolationism" in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the compromised
bill as Republicans agreed to add nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars to
the original bill.
</P>
<P>
Republicans agreed to add the full 1.8 billion U.S. dollars
Clinton requested for implementing the Middle East peace agreement
to the package.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides also agreed to add 75 million U.S.
dollars for U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations,
170 million U.S. dollars for overseas economic aid, and 104
million U.S. dollars for former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The new package also include a total of 123 million U.S.
dollars for international debt relief for the poorest countries.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Bans Horse Imports From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Agriculture
Ministry forbade starting Friday the import of horses and
ostriches from the United States because of the presence of the
"West Nile" virus in that country.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Vinicius Pratini de Moraes said that the
measure aims at preventing the entrance of the virus to Brazil,
where it has never been diagnosed before.
</P>
<P>
Pratini said that the authorizations already granted by the
Animal Defense Secretariat (SDA) of the ministry were also
canceled.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also barred the entrance of all species of
crustaceans (shrimp) from any country, of fresh or salt water,
including fresh or frozen products.
</P>
<P>
The import authorizations will be subjected to previous
analysis of risk by the SDA, which will consider the sanitary
condition of the countries of origin and of their zones of
production.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry adopted this measure about the
crustaceans because the diseases known as "white spot" and "yellow
head" have been detected in shrimp nurseries in several countries
like the United States, Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, and some
Asian countries.
