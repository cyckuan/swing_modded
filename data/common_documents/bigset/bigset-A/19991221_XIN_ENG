<HEADLINE> Bomb Explosions Rattle Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded late Sunday
night inside a bank in Turkey's largest city Istanbul, but no
casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The blast caused minor damage to the Yapi Kredi Bank in the
Avcilar District of Istanbul, the Anatolia News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Security forces found on the spot of the blast a piece of cloth
on which the name of an illegal organization was written.
</P>
<P>
A full investigation into the cause of the incident has been
launched by the police.
</P>
<P>
According to the private NTV, two home-made pipe bombs exploded
in Istanbul on Sunday - one inside the Carrefour shopping mall in
the Radikoy District on the Asian side of Istanbul, the other just
outside.
</P>
<P>
A woman was slightly injured in the bomb attacks which also
caused panic among hundreds of shoppers.
</P>
<P>
So far no individual or organization has claimed responsibility
for the attacks.

Istanbul lies in the cross-roads of the Balkans, the Caucasus
and the Middle East with a population of nearly 10 million
excluding
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
It is prone to international drug smuggling and other organized
crimes. However, the police usually hold the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party and other illegal radical organizations responsible
for politically-motivated explosions.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad

Iranian and Ukraine officials will play a determining role in the
expansion of relations between Tehran-Kiev.

</P>
<P>
He noted that there are many possible areas of cooperation
between the two countries which enjoy high potential for
cooperation in scientific, technical, and industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the inauguration of joint project for
manufacturing of passenger airplanes in Iran's central province of
Isfahan is a good example of cooperation between Iran and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Middle East and Eastern Europe regions as sensitive
and important, he said the regional countries ought to concentrate
on their common points of view, end foreign presence in the region,
and guarantee progress and security in the region.

<P>
In the meeting, Tarasyuk handed over a written message of

Iran regards Ukraine as a potential trade partner and expects
Ukraine to demonstrate political will and steadfastness, Kharrazi
said, adding that Iran is interested in fostering cooperation with
other countries including Ukraine to serve mutual interests and
regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Tarasyuk said that the Ukrainian government backs the agreements
reached between the countries and is keen to develop economic,
industrial and cultural cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said the upcoming meeting of Kiev-Tehran joint economic
commission will serve to activate cooperation in the field of

<HEADLINE> New Euphrates Dam Erected in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A new dam straddling the
Euphrates River and a hydroelectric power plant were completed in
southeastern Turkey on Monday, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Suleyman Demirel attended the inauguration ceremony
and pushed the operation button.
</P>
<P>
The dam and the power plant are part of Turkey's ambitious
Southeast Anatolia Project. Demirel said everybody can witness a
new page of a big project and the Euphrates River offers prosperity
to the Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
The Karkamis Dam, whose construction started in May, 1996, is
located 4.5 kilometers north of the Turkish-Syrian border on the
Euphrates. And the power plant is expected to produce 652.5 million
kilowatts of electricity per hour once fully in operation next May.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Cumhur Ersumer said on
the occasion that Turkey has planned to build 28 more dams.
</P>
<P>
The electricity consumption in Turkey is far behind many
developed nations, said the minister, and "we have to provide cheap
and uninterrupted power supply to industry."
</P>
<P>
The dam and the power plant, which were jointly built by Turkish
and Austrian firms at a cost of 176.4 million U.S. dollars, lie in
the Karkamis County of the Gaziantep Province.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Ambassador Raiph Shade also attended the inauguration

<HEADLINE> Iran Supports Peaceful Settlement in Afghanistan: Rafsanjani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani on Monday reiterated that Iran backs the
formation of a broad-based government in Afghanistan comprising all
Afghan groups and tribes.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the Iranian commitment during a meeting with
visiting Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani and his government were driven out of the capital Kabul
in 1996 by forces of the Taliban, which now controls most of
Afghanistan and imposes a strict version of Islamic rule in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports the ousted president, who formed the Northern
Alliance to counter the Taliban forces, which are believed to be
backed by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made by the international community to end the
10-year bloodshed and institute a broad-based government in the
civil war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Rafsanjani told Rabbani that the statements made
by Pakistani Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf, during his
recent visit to Iran, have created the hope that Pakistan's policy
vis-a-vis Afghanistan would change "in favor of peace and security
in the country."
</P>
<P>
Iran expects practical measures to be taken on the part of
General Musharraf and the Pakistani government in this respect, he
said, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently chairman of Iran's powerful State
Expediency Council, also called for reducing military conflicts and
following up political means.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who arrived here on Sunday on a three-day visit,
thanked Iran for providing the Afghan people and government with
humanitarian assistance and support.
</P>
<P>
He said that his alliance has never favored continuation of war
in Afghanistan, rather it has been seeking peaceful and political
means to restore peace through efforts exerted by the international
community and neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prosecutors Start Probe into Vote-buying Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Rome prosecutors Monday opened an
inquiry into allegations of vote-buying by a party in the
governing coalition as another member of Parliament (MP) claimed
he had been offered money.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of the special "Jury of Honor" set up in the lower
house to examine the case, former Northern League MP Franca
Gambato said she had also received offers of money to change
political allegiance.
</P>
<P>
Gambato said the offer had come from Luca Bagliani, who left
the League in November to join the centrist Democratic Union for
Europe(Udeur), which is in the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
Bagliani was the MP fingered when the vote-buying scandal
started on December 16 after another Northern League MP, Paolo
Bampo, said that he was offered 200 million lire (about 105,000 U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He was also accused by yet another Northern League MP, Cesare
Rizzi, who said he had been offered half a billion lire (about 264,
000 U.S. dollars) and the post of an undersecretary in Premier D'
Alema's next government if he changed sides.
</P>
<P>
The allegations of vote-buying by the Udeur have been angrily
denied by the centrist party, which has threatened to sue Bampo.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema called for an inquiry and party floor-leaders on
Saturday to set up what they called the "jury of honor" to look
into the case.
</P>
<P>
The jury consists of House Speaker Lucio Violante and four
others,who have only limited powers.
</P>
<P>
The body's authority is only valid in the Lower House and it
cannot seize documents as evidence.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Rome prosecutors to open their own
investigation,after a request by an opposition MP, will clearly
not be hampered by such limitations.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have still to decide exactly what crime they will
be investigating as they seek to shed light on the scandal.

KAMPALA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and
some others injured in a surprise attack on a camp of displaced
people by the rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in
western Uganda overnight, a government official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened in the western district of Bundibugyo,
Ugandan Minister for Security Muruli Mukasa said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the rebels for attacking such soft targets like the
displaced people, saying it is an act of cowardice.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said the situation in the western region
is not as bad as it was three or four days ago. "The government
troops are containing the rebel attacks and the situation is under
control," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the rebels still fighting the government to take
advantage of the recently passed Amnesty Bill to come out and
reintegrate into the society.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels have recently killed more than 20 people in
their surprise attacks on security targets in western Uganda.

<HEADLINE> UK's Granny KGB Spy Escapes Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Melita Norwood, the 87-year-old
former KGB spy who passed atom bomb secrets to the Soviet Union
during the Cold War, will not face prosecution, the legal
authorities said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cases of four other spies uncovered through information
brought to Britain by former KGB chief archivist Vasili Mitrokhin
are also not being referred for investigation.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Ross Cranston QC, a senior government law
officer, said it was "clear that any prosecution would fail" and
to proceed would be "quite wrong".
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw in October told the House of
Commons that Norwood could still face the courts because of her
public admission of guilt on the BBC's Spying Game program.
</P>
<P>
The great-grandmother, who now lives in south London, admitted
she was the source of secrets passed to the Soviet Union enabling
it to build its first nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
But the solicitor general ruled her confession on camera would
not be admissible as evidence in court.
</P>
<P>
"There is little prospect of obtaining admissible evidence; and
in any event any prosecution would probably be stayed on the
ground of abuse of process," he said in a statement to the House
of Commons.
</P>
<P>
When Mitrokhin, the former KGB archivist, defected to live in
the United Kingdom, he brought with him an unprecedented wealth of
documentary evidence about the Russia secret service.
</P>
<P>
This led to Norwood being uncovered as the so-called "granny
spy" and a flood of similar stories based on the information he
brought to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebel Leader Surrenders to Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A top leader of the rebel
Lord's Resistance Movement (LRA), which has been fighting the
Ugandan government in the northern part of the country, has
surrendered to the government.
</P>
<P>
Kakoza Matale, presidential advisor on security, told a press
conference here on Monday afternoon that Captain Afred Oruba, aged
 26, had surrendered to the government together with his escort
and two rifles.
</P>
<P>
More LRA rebels are expected to follow suit if the Amnesty Bill
passed by the Parliament early this month could reach the rebels
now living in southern Sudan, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Matale, the surrendered rebel leader, who was
under direct leadership of the LRA Commander Joseph Kony, said
that after staying in the bush for seven years, he wanted to join
the society and live a normal life.
</P>
<P>
Matale said the rebel leader came out to the government with
the help of some coordinators sent by the government, adding that
the coordinators had received some support from Sudanese troops in
terms of food and weapons.
</P>
<P>
All the surrendered rebels would undergo some training in the
rehabilitation centers run by both the government and the
non-governmental organizations, and they would at the same time
enjoy the protection of law as ordinary citizens of the country,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels spearheaded by Kony have been fighting the
Ugandan government for 13 years and abducted more than 10,000
children from the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the presidents of the Sudan and Uganda met in
Nairobi to try to solve their security problem.
</P>
<P>
The two countries cut off diplomatic relations in April 1995,
accusing each other of backing rebels from the other's territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Under a merger plan of 28
billion Canadian dollars (about 18.9 billion U.S. dollars),
Canadian and U.S.rail giants will merge into the largest railway
enterprise in North America in mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
Canadian National Railway Co. (CN) and U.S. Burlington Northern
Sante Fe Corp. will combine operations under a new company called
North American Railways Inc., with its headquarters office to be
based in Montreal, local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plan would create an entity with 67,000 employees and
annual revenue of 18.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 12.5
billion U.S.dollars), the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The new company would run a total of 50,000 miles of rail track
stretching across Canada and 28 U.S. states.
</P>
<P>
The transactions will be a complex share swap that does not
involve cash or any transfer of assets, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The North American railway industry has been under siege in
recent years, struggling to keep up with rapid changes introduced
by the North American Free Trade Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Says Taliban Violate Ramazan Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite pledges to honor a
Ramazan cease-fire, the Taliban militia have recently launched a
number of offensives in northern Afghan provinces in an attempt to
remove opposition forces from their bases, an opposition commander
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition troops, however, have not only managed to defend
their strongholds but also have succeeded in dislodging the
Taliban from some key districts in Balkh and Sarre Pul provinces,
Commander Hussain Anwari said in a statement from the northern
province of Takhar.
</P>
<P>
In Balkh, the opposition managed to recapture the district of
Chapchal, he said, adding that the Taliban troops were pushed back
to their regional base before being forced out of the area
altogether.
</P>
<P>
In another counter-offensive in Sarre Pul over the weekend, the
district of Do Abe was recaptured by the opposition forces. In a
battle that raged for two days, the Taliban troops received a
drubbing at the hands of the local opposition troops, Anwari
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 Taliban soldiers were killed and 15 were captured
during the weekend fighting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Taliban have seized some 80 percent of the Afghan
territory and have been fighting to annihilate the opposition who
is controlling some areas in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the two warring parties had agreed to stop
fighting in the Muslim holy month of Ramazan which began from
December 10.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Sets Terms for Talks with Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"They must first recognize our government before we resume a
dialogue with them," Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, Taliban's foreign
minister, told the Pakistan-based press agency.
</P>
<P>
There are currently three countries -- Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates -- which recognize the Taliban
government, which has in vain kept urging the world and the United
Nations to recognize its rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mutawakil also offered a one-to-one exchange of
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
According to independent estimates, the Taliban are holding 4,
000 prisoners belonging to different opposition factions. The main
anti-Taliban faction led by former defense minister Ahmad Shah
Masood has about 500 Taliban soldiers in its custody.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Intensify Efforts to Overcome Arsenic Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations Children
Fund (UNICEF) chief Carol Bellamy Monday said that her
organization would intensify efforts to overcome the arsenic
poisoning to ensure that its achievement in providing safe water
will not vanish.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of what we achieved in the past several decades
and now we are responding to the problem," Bellamy told a press
briefing at the end of her three-day visit to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy earlier joined the launching of the UNICEF sponsored
National Communication Strategy for Arsenic Mitigation here with
the support of the U.N. body.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Salah Uddin Yusuf told the launching ceremony
of the arsenic information campaign that in Bangladesh, 15 deaths
caused by arsenic have been reported so far, but 25 million
people are at risk while only 5,000 arsenocosis patients have been
treated.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF officials said that this year, the U.N. organization
spent 1.3 million U.S. dollars directly on arsenic mitigation
activities. In 2000, the amount will be 8.9 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is really a night of revelry. Crowds of Beijing residents
flocked into the brightly-lit, well-burnished indoor stadium,
which was hung with bunting, red lanterns and colorful lights.
</P>
<P>
Party and government leaders, personalities of all walks of
life in the Chinese capital and foreign diplomatic envoys joined
in the joyous event which lasted nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's huge group of performing artists included 33 spare-
time local choirs, and popular artists from China's interior, Hong
Kong and Macao. Moreover, some prestigious performing arts
residing overseas have also made special trips to Beijing for the
re-union and joyous event.
</P>
<P>
The national television station, or the CCTV, televised live
the program, which enabled hundreds of millions of people
throughout China to share the joy and festivity.
</P>
<P>
The program was divided into two parts, namely, a celebration
rally and a large-scale performance themed "Sun and Moon Shining
over China, in celebration of Macao's Return." It began with a
chorus based on late Chinese leader Mao Zedong's poem "Snow, to
the Tune of Spring in a Pleasure Garden."
</P>
<P>
"Seeing what the northern countries show: hundreds of leagues
ice-bound go, and thousands of leagues flies snow, a magnificent
winter scene in north China," Late Chairman Mao in this poem,
citing eminent emperors of various dynasties in the history of
China, exclaimed "Brilliant heroes are those whom we will see
today."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the return of Macao today is attributed to
the prolonged and hard efforts of the three successive collective
leaderships of the Party central committees with Mao Zedong, Deng
Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin respectively at the core.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jingdong, a nine-year-old primary school pupil from Macao,
is the youngest leading singer of a chorus tonight. As Macao has
returned, he said, "my biggest wish now is to learn and speak the
Chines well, so that I will be able to have even easier access for
a better look at the Summer Palace and ascend for a better view of
the world famous Great Wall."

The song "My Chinese Heart" he sang tonight is now on the lips
of his fans across China, old and young, and man and woman. The
melody once again resounded in the spacious hall, and thousands of
audience members, while joined in the singing themselves, waved
red national flags and green flags of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
This song, which is now loved by the people of China, overseas
Chinese and foreign nationals of the Chinese origin, gives an
expression to the aspirations of the entire Chinese for Hong Kong'
s return to the motherland in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, two pupils, both nine years of age, from Pui Ching
School, a Chinese language school in Macao, performed the "Song of
Seven Sons", composed from a poem of the late writer Wen Yiduo of
the 1930s and 1940s in this century, which compared Macao, Hong
Kong and five other Chinese places under foreign occupation then
to the sons compelled to leave their mother.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao today opens up a new era in the history
of Macao. From today on, our compatriots in Macao will truly
become the masters of that land," President Jiang Zemin told the
jubilant gathering in celebration of Macao's return to China. His
words drew round after round of enthusiastic applause and
resounded throughout the fully-packed indoor stadium.
</P>
<P>
Act one presented viewers with a variety of "gems" of China's
divine land with vivid scenes. Against a backdrop of embroidered
brocade, bamboo slips and stone inscriptions came colorfully-clad
girls carrying huge pottery jars on their heads, boys dragging
huge writing brushes, sword-playing lads showing their superb
skills on giant projection of centuries-old Chinese characters --
all crowd pleasers reflecting the diversity of China's ancient
traditions.
</P>
<P>
"I especially liked the glazed pottery carried by the girls,"
said 63-year old Lu Yue-chen from Taiwan. "It is a form of our
traditional culture, a kind of link between our Chinese, no matter
whether they live in Macao, on the motherland or any other place
in the world."
</P>
<P>
"It is my sincere hope that our Chinese nation will achieve
complete reunification as soon as possible," said Lu, a chorus
member in tonight's gala.
</P>
<P>
However, miserable scenes from the following acts brought back
to the memory of audience members to the moving and tragic years a
century ago.

"I'm glad that the days when China was bullied are gone forever,
" Guo told Xinhua. "China has been turning stronger and more
powerful with each passing day and I'm proud to live in this time.
"
</P>
<P>
Tonight's Capital Indoor Stadium was a huge showcase for 5,000
years of Chinese culture, which was displayed on a stage of some
2,200 square meters, the largest of the kind in this country.
</P>
<P>
With the big Chinese character "Gui" appeared on the backdrop
of the stage, singers from both Beijing and Macao performed the
dancing and singing item "homecoming," the theme song for Hong
Kong's 1997 return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The rally ended with a rendition of the song of "Singing in
Praise of the Motherland." Performers dressed in costumes of China
's 56 ethnic groups joined in the song while the huge design of a
large Chinese national emblem flunked by the flag and emblem of
the Macao Special Administrative Region projected on the backdrop,
pushing the party to its climax.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jiankang, the designer of tonight's show as well as the 1997
party greeting Hong Kong's return, told Xinhua that he is now
looking forward to the day when he can design a grand event for
Taiwan's eventual return to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Needs to Define Priorities for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Monday said the government should define its priorities and
identify areas with the potential of contributing to the country's
Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks at the launch of the Matabeleland chapter
of the National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) in Bulawayo,
the second largest city in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Zimbabwe still found itself in economic
 predicament as it was considered to be more developed than its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent developments, he said that it had
witnessed a positive approach by the international community to
forgive a total of 31 least developed countries in Africa of their
foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Zimbabwe's foreign debt, which currently
stands at 2.36 billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to 18 percent of
the GDP, had not been forgiven because of the high per capita
income Zimbabwe had over other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
To counter such problems, he said the country needed to define
its priorities correctly and identify programs that would enable
it to revamp the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
"We need lots of capital investment in such infrastructural
services as roads, hospitals and housing. Identifying areas of
expansion such as these will give us the direction to focus on in
order to develop our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mugabe condemned the ministerial system of the
government, saying it was characterized by corruption and
inefficiencies, hindering the smooth flow of most developmental
projects in the country.

the president a broad array of powers, including the appointment
and dismissal of the Prime Minister and Cabinet ministers (all of
whom must be members of Parliament), and the right to hold any
ministerial portfolio. The President may submit bills rejected by
Parliament for national referenda. A 1982 constitutional amendment
permits the President to call a presidential election before the

The People's Alliance is Sri Lanka's ruling coalition of six
parties and is chaired by Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who is seeking reelection in Sri Lanka's
fourth presidential election on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The coalition is centered around Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
The other five much smaller parties are the Lanka Sama Samaja

The central-left People's Alliance was founded in 1993 to
oppose the dominant right-wing United National Party (UNP) in
provincial elections. It did well in those elections and in a
local vote in March 1994, launching it on a path to direct
electoral confrontation with the UNP. This came on August 16, 1994,
when the coalition beat the UNP by 105 seats to 94 and formed a
legislative majority with help from the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress
and Up-Country People's Front.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga was sworn in as prime minister on August 19, 1994
and became president the following November.


Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is the main pillar of Sri
Lanka's ruling People's Alliance coalition, which came to power in
August 1994. It is chaired by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike,
mother of President Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The SLFP was founded in 1951 by Sirimavo Bandaranaike's husband,
Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike. The party was elected to
power for the first time in 1956 with an aggressive program that
promoted the interests of the country's Sinhalese majority and the
emerging Sinhala-educated, nationalist, professional class.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike took over the party in 1960 following the
1959 assassination of her husband, then prime minister. She has
led the party ever since. The SLFP-led coalition governed the
nation on four terms, from 1956 to 1960, from 1960 to 1965, from
1970 to 1977 and since August 1994 when the People's Alliance led
by SLFP defeated the UNP.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the SLFP is to advocate non-aligned foreign
policy, industrial development in both the state sector and the
private sector, rapid modernization in education and in the
economy, and safeguards for minorities. It has 500,000 members. (

<TEXT>
<P>
The UNP, founded in 1946, is the main opposition party and the
largest party in the country. The UNP ruled Sri Lanka for more
than 30 years on four terms -- from 1947 to 1956, from March to
July in 1960, from 1965 to 1970, and from 1977 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
The UNP's main aims are to advocate free and fair society and
democratic socialism, free economic policy, independent foreign
policy and non-aligned foreign policy. The UNP was strongly in
favor of adopting Sinhalese as the official language and offering
state aid to denominational schools.
</P>
<P>
The UNP was led by President Ranasinghe Premadasa until his
assassination in 1993. The party was defeated in the August 1994
general election by the People's Alliance, a coalition at whose
center is the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which the UNP had trounced
to come to power in the 1977 elections.
</P>
<P>
The party has about 700,000 members and its leader is former
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe who will challenge the
incumbent President Kumaratunga at Sri Lanka's fourth presidential
election on Tuesday.


The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) or People's Liberation Front
</P>
<P>
The JVP, founded in 1964, is a leftist party which has led two
violent uprisings in 1971 and between 1988 and 1990. It was banned
following a coup attempt in 1971, regained legal status in 1977,
banned again in August 1983, but regained legal status in May 1988.
</P>
<P>
The party was virtually eradicated in 1989 when its former
charismatic leader Rohana Wijeweera and almost its entire
politburo was wiped out by security forces.
</P>
<P>
However, the JVP has slowly reappeared and emerged as Sri Lanka
's third largest party with a membership of 25,000 to 30,000. The
party contested the August 1994 parliamentary elections and won
one seat.
</P>
<P>
The JVP is looking for about 10 percent of the 225 seats in
parliament in the next general election as it got 6.5 percent of
the vote in April's five provincial council elections and later
garnered 12 percent in the Southern Provincial Council polls.
</P>
<P>
The party has fielded a candidate to contest the December 21
election with the objective of scrapping the executive presidency
and ushering in a "socialist system."
</P>
<P>
During the last presidential election in November 1994 the JVP
candidate pulled out after obtaining a promise from People's
Alliance's Chandrika Kumaratunga that she would abolish the all
powerful presidency.


The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, which was banned by the government in January 1998,
is the largest and most militant Tamil separatist guerrilla group
in Sri Lanka with 5,000 to 6,000 fighting cadres.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, has been fighting for
the creation of an independent Tamil homeland since its founding
in 1972 as the Tamil New Tigers.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has shifted its headquarters to Mullaitivu from the
Jaffna peninsula, the former stronghold of the group for 10 years
until the government forces retook it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the presidential election slated for Tuesday,
LTTE guerrillas have intensified their offensives in the north of
the country in a bid to gain more bargaining chips once the new
president calls for talks after inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is regarded as the primary obstacle to the government'
s efforts to resolve the ethnic conflicts because of its hard-line
militant position and terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Its members are blamed for the assassination of former Indian
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe
Premadasa and a string of other political and military leaders. (

<HEADLINE> South African Firm's Diamond Sales Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's diamond
giant De Beers said Monday that its sales of rough gem diamonds
this year has reached a record level of 5.24 billion U.S. dollars,
57 percent higher than the previous year's 3.35 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the second half of 1999 were 2.793 billion dollars, 70
percent higher than the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The company cut its sales last year to meet the market changes
in Japan and South East Asia and the disruption in the global
financial markets, De Beers said.
</P>
<P>
The stock levels in the cutting centers were therefore at a low
level at the end of 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the year 1999 has been positive in all the major
retail markets, with continuing strength in the United States,
increased polished diamond imports to Japan, some recovery in
South East Asia and steady growth in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the general market recovery, the company has
been actively pursuing a number of initiatives to increase its
sales, particularly of those areas of slow moving stock which had
been adversely affected by the economic difficulties in Japan and
South East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The company has also been boosting the millennium marketing
activities, which began in the second half of 1999 and will
continue throughout the year 2000, De Beers said.
</P>
<P>
"These have been well received by the trade and appear to be
having a positive impact," it said, adding that "it is anticipated
that incremental millennium sales should underpin the sale of
rough diamonds in 2000."

<HEADLINE> D'Alema Asked to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema was asked by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi Monday
evening to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency Ansa, D'Alema, who
accepted the mandate with the formal reservations, told reporters
he had agreed to form a new center-left cabinet "as rapidly as
possible, without neglecting any opportunity to achieve
clarification" and that he will start consultations Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema, who resigned Saturday evening, also thanked those
parties which named him as their choice as premier, together with
those who raised no objections to his name, apparently a
conciliatory reference to the centrist allies who precipitated his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's reference to "clarification" was also presumed to be
harking back to his pledge last week to seek a "radical
clarification" of the center-left alliance as a permission for a
stronger and more cohesive relationship in view of the regional
elections in the spring and the general elections in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In what was seen as a strongly symbolic gesture, seven of the
center-left parties went for the government-formation
consultations with Ciampi earlier Monday in a single delegation,
in a message that they have already serried their ranks.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King, Arafat Meet on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Monday called on Israel and the Palestinians to speed up
final-status talks to pave the way for reaching a framework
agreement in February.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal while meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, who arrived here earlier in the day for a two-day official
visit.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah reaffirmed Jordan's persistent support for the
Palestinians to regain their legitimate rights, including the
establishment of an independent state on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Amman, briefed Abdullah on the
latest developments and difficulties facing the final-status talks,
launched on November 8.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed the necessity for both sides to intensify
their efforts to remove all obstacles standing in the peace
process, including Israel's policy regarding settlement in the
occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Palestinian summit came within the framework of
bilateral consultations on the peace process. Jordan said it had
interests to be protected in the final-status talks, particularly
on issues concerning water, border and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Around 1.2 million Palestinians, displaced in successive Arab-
Israeli wars, are now living in Jordan as officially registered
refugees. Israel has vowed that it will never allow the refugees to
return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah said the resumed Israeli-Syrian peace
talks ought to be a supportive sector to a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed peace talks in Washington on December
15 and 16 after a 45-month suspension and agreed to hold another
round in early January.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah had said on many occasions that Jordan believed the
settlement of the Palestinian issue is the core element in the
Mideast peace-making, without which no durable and comprehensive
peace would be achieved in the region.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Arafat thanked Abdullah for his support to the
Palestinians in all stages of negotiations with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a key player in the peace process and it has
been trying to bridge differences between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to hold talks with Jordanian officials before
leaving for home on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Monday expressed his solicitude to Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga for her injury, caused by terrorist bomb attack and
hoped she would be soon recovered, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga was injured by two explosions on Saturday
at a rally ahead of election in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka,
which killed at least 36 people.

White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a written statement

"He sends to President Kumaratunga and others injured his best

deter the people of Sri Lanka from their strong commitment to
democracy and their hope and determination for peace," Lockhart
said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Tables Bill on National Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition party
Likud Monday presented to the Knesset (Parliament) a bill aimed at
preventing a possible peace deal between Israel and Syria from
being approved by a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, a peace deal with Syria must have the
support of more than 50 percent of Israel's eligible voters before
it could be ratified by the referendum. This means that the deal
must be approved by more than 60 percent of those who actually cast
their votes.
</P>
<P>
The bill, if passed, would undoubtedly make it more difficult
for Prime Minister Ehud Barak to win approval for a peace accord
that involves an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the
Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Barak held two days of talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa last week in Washington, reopening the Israeli-Syrian
negotiations after nearly four years of suspension. The two sides
have agreed to continue the talks on January 3.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to present any peace deal he reached with the
Palestinians or Syria to the public for a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Likud Knesset member Silvan Shalom, who heads the legal team
preparing the bill, said that his party has garnered the support of
45 legislators for the bill. It requires the support of 61 members
in the 120-member Knesset before the bill could become law.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin slammed the Likud for the bill by
saying that it was mainly aimed at reducing the influence of the
Arab-Israeli voters, which account for nearly 20 percent of the
Israeli voters. Most Arab voters are expected to vote for a peace
deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing more than a racist bill," Beilin told Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition is preparing its own bill on the referendum
which would only require a simple majority to approve a peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Floods Leave Thousands Dead in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombian authorities said
Monday the floods following the recent downpours have left about
10,000 dead and damage for at least 2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst natural disaster to hit Venezuela this century
since an earthquake in 1967 which left 300 dead.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel considered it possible
that the amount of 10,000 killed by the rains "remains short."
</P>
<P>
He said that between 1,000 and 1,500 bodies have been counted,
but it isn't known how many lie buried beneath the mud, perhaps
between five and six thousand in Vargas state, close to the
capital, alone.
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the National Constitution Assembly (ANC)
Isaias Rodriguez told the press that losses caused by the rains
are around 2 billion dollars in the capital and Miranda and Vargas
states.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Detente Charts Kuwaiti Policy Towards Arab Foes in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 20 (Xinhua) -- To continue practise
pragmatic foreign policy and drum up wide support in dealing with
its rival Iraq, Kuwait in the outgoing year resumed ties with
Jordan, Yemen and Sudan, which sided with Iraq in the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait severed diplomatic ties with the three states after the
war that ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of the gulf kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at isolating Iraq and drawing extensive support from the
Arab world in handling some unsolved issues with Iraq, Kuwait, the
small gulf sheikhdom took realistic attitude to improve ties with
the former pro-Iraq countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claims that Iraq still holds more than 600 Kuwaitis and
third country nationals in its jails. It has been trying to rally
support from members of the Cairo-based Arab League (AL) to
pressure Iraq to free the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
But the soured relations between Kuwait and Jordan, Yemen and
Sudan, all AL members, had hindered Kuwait's efforts in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Water-test contacts began as early as in 1996. In the following
year Kuwait formally held out olive branches by saying that it
was "willing to restore ties with those Arab countries that backed
Iraq." It also got positive response.
</P>
<P>
The past three years have witnessed a slow but steady
rapprochement process between Kuwait and the three states, and a
number of low and mid-level visits were exchanged and economic ties
partially re-linked.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwaiti-Jordanian relations, breakthrough emerged on February
8, 1999, when Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah rushed to Amman to join other world leaders
for the funeral procession of Jordan's late King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Saad's trip to Jordan, coupled with a nationwide mourning on
Hussein's death in Kuwait, were hailed by the Jordanian leadership
as a friendly overture, which political analysts believed might
imply something beyond.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing visit by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-
Khatib to Kuwait in March led to the normalization of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To serve their own interests, the underdeveloped and cash-
strapped Yemen and Sudan also want to improve ties with the oil-
rich Arab brother from the strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
The two countries not only reopened embassies in Kuwait in May
and July respectively. They went even further than Jordan, which
just described its past rift with Kuwait as "old differences," by
expressing willingness to apologize for their back for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"If Yemen had certain positions which could have been
misunderstood or wrong, then this was a summer cloud that is now
cleared," said Yemen's Foreign Undersecretary Ahmad al-Said in
Kuwait in May while preparing for Yemeni Deputy Premier and Foreign
Minister Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal's visit.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's reconciliation efforts have been remarkably rewarded.
</P>
<P>
The balance of power in 22-member Arab League has been tipped in
Kuwait's favor.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has promised to "spare no efforts to support Kuwait to
achieve a positive result" on the prisoner issue. Yemen and Sudan
are also more active in urging Iraq to release the Kuwaiti
nationals and comply with relevant U.N. resolutions, echoing the
Kuwaiti position.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the political rapprochement, trade was growing between
Kuwait and the three Arab nations, especially Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that Jordan's exports to Kuwait in 1998
reached 35 million U.S. dollars while Jordan's imports from Kuwait
were valued at 2.6 million dollars, something unthinkable before
1995.
</P>
<P>
While both sides are boasting about their warm-up in ties,
political observers have cautioned that the rapprochement was not
proceeding without problems and more efforts are needed.
</P>
<P>
The pending return of 300,000 Jordanian workers to Kuwait still
plagues Jordan-Kuwait ties. Cash-strapped Jordan depends heavily on
the labors, who were deported after the Gulf War, for remittances.
</P>
<P>
But dogged by its own economic problems resulted from unstable
oil prices, oil-dependent Kuwait at least temporarily can not
accommodate the Jordanian labors as it did nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Yemen, which sought to spare the region from foreign military
presence, should have reason to feel uneasy about Kuwait's over-
dependence on U.S. deterrence against any potential threat by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, whose relations with the U.S. worsened after Washington
accused Khartoum of harboring terrorists and pounded its
pharmaceutical plant last year, will certainly not applaud a
Kuwaiti-U.S. pas de deux.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni and Sudanese ambassadors to Kuwait presented their
credentials on December 1, months after the reopening of their
embassies, a source of speculations over the nature of their new
harmony.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, on the other hand, still maintains a Charge D'affaires
representation in the three states, although the return of its
newly-appointed ambassador to Amman is expected soon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Pakistan's Arrests No Connection to Worldwide Terrorist Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"My understanding of the situation is that it has to do with a
domestic criminal investigation, not necessarily connected to the
kind of international terrorism that we've spent a good bit of
time engaging both with Pakistan and a number of other countries
on," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Jordan said last week that they had arrested 14
people, suspected of belonging to a ring loyal to Afghan-based
Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Washington issued a worldwide warning following the arrests
that Americans abroad must take extra care for the risk of
possible terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said arrests in Pakistan, which reports said
amounted to 200 or so, may have been related to the killing of a
senior Pakistani finance ministry official but gave no further

<HEADLINE> High-level Experts Recommend Framework for ITU's Role in Authentication for E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of experts have agreed
on a set of recommendations on areas where the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) and other organizations can play in
overcoming the regulatory, technical and legal obstacles to the
use of authentication technologies across borders, said the ITU in
a press release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the ITU, with its unique expertise, experience
working closely with industry is well placed to help facilitate
electronic authentication and foster a global dialogue about
authentication measures and issues," said Fred Cate, professor of
law and director of the Information Law and Commerce Institute at
the Indiana University School of Law in the United States who
chaired the meeting of 35 experts.
</P>
<P>
Those at the two-day meeting included legal experts, e-commerce
and standards managers from telecoms carriers, manufacturers and
Internet service providers, experts from academia, representatives
from government agencies involved in authentication,
representatives from certification authorities and organizations
including the European Commission and the International
Telecommunication Users Group.
</P>
<P>
The group agreed that, in further considering authentication
issues, the ITU should encourage voluntary, rather than mandatory,
approaches and should focus on areas where international dialogue
is needed.
</P>
<P>
The ITU's work in authentication should also be technology-
neutral and not impede the development and implementation of
market-based initiatives and standards and of private arrangements
for authentication while being particularly attentive to the needs
of developing countries, cultural differences among individuals
and groups, and both the potential risks and opportunities
presented by various authentication measures for economic,
infrastructure, and social development, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They also called upon the ITU to start making an inventory of
the principles concerning authentication that have been produced
or are currently under consideration by other international and
regional, intergovernmental and industry organizations and
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Already, several countries have adopted legislation on
electronic signatures and the matter is under active consideration
in many other nations, in addition to numerous private initiatives.
</P>
<P>
But the global nature of the Internet makes it vital that
government and industry collaborate to harmonize national
approaches to authentication. The Internet is inherently global
and borderless, raising an important question as to what law is
applicable and what national certificates are recognized in cross-
border transactions.
</P>
<P>
"E-commerce has reached a stage where it is critically
important to agree on international approaches in the areas of
electronic signatures and authentication if we don't want to see
the emergence of fundamentally discordant standards as to what
constitutes a 'signature' or what constitutes valid certificates
in different jurisdictions," said Cate.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the ITU -- with its unique expertise,
experience working closely with industry, and inclusive membership
-- is well placed to help facilitate electronic authentication and
to foster a global dialogue about authentication measures and
issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of the group will be reported to the ITU
Council, the ITU annual governing body, for consideration at its
next meeting in July 2000.

WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton was
not expected to make an imminent decision on whether to free
Jonathan Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence official who
spied for Israel the White House said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Israelis discussed with
U.S. officials over the fate of Pollard, who was sentenced to life
in prison in 1986 for passing secrets to Israel
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said it was necessary to have the review of that case
completed before making some recommendation to Clinton, who
promised former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he
would take another look at the case during the Wye talks last
October.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said no recommendation had yet gone to the president.
He also denied the case would be used as a bargaining chip in the
Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"No recommendation has gone to the president," Lockhart told
reporters at his daily briefing. "I expect this to be dealt with
on the merits and not (as) part of the ... ongoing Middle East
peace process."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have previously said that the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department had recommended
against releasing Pollard, while the State Department had found no
compelling reason to free him.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Demand to Annex Jewish Settlements Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian negotiators turned
down an Israeli demand to annex the Jewish settlements in the
occupied Palestinian territories to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made in the 11th session of the final-status talks
in Ramallah Monday afternoon, said a Palestinian negotiator on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a paper on the border perspective that was tabled
by the Palestinian side during last session, the Israeli side
demanded the Palestinians revise its maps in a way that allows the
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to be under the
Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side refused the demand on the grounds
that it went against the U.N. Security Council resolution 242 that
provides for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab
lands occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed on forming two joint committees charged
with border and settlement affairs and the resumption of the talks
next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo
asserted that the positions of the two sides were "contradictory
and disparate."
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to stop all forms of settlement expansion,
which in the past has disrupted the final-status talks launched
more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran said that Monday's
session made some progress in minor issues and that the thorny
issues to be tackled in the final-status talks would be referred to
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The number of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
amounts to 170 and they house up to 166,000 Jewish settlers,
according to last year's figures.

The head of the Palestinian negotiating team Yasser Abed Rabbo
told reporters after the session that the settlement issue was the
main topic for the Monday session, but the two sides could not
reach an agreement on settlement expansions.

BEIRUT -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa said Monday
that his country will not represent Lebanon to negotiate with
Israel in the coming peace talks.

<P>
"Lebanon is an independent country and will represent itself in
the coming peace talks with Israel," al-Sharaa told reporters after
meeting with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa arrived here Monday morning to brief Lebanese

BAGHDAD -- Iraq's National Assembly (parliament) on Monday

said the new resolution was a repetition of the previous
resolutions with new vague and illegal conditions aiming at
prolonging the unjust embargo on Iraq.

<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's opposition party Likud Monday presented to
the Knesset (Parliament) a bill aimed at preventing a possible
peace deal between Israel and Syria from being approved by a
national referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, a peace deal with Syria must have the
support of more than 50 percent of Israel's eligible voters before
it could be ratified by the referendum. This means that the deal
must be approved by more than 60 percent of those who actually cast
their votes.
</P>
<P>
The bill, if passed, would undoubtedly make it more difficult
for Prime Minister Ehud Barak to win approval for a peace accord
that involves an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the
Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Contributes 266 Million Dollars to IDA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has
decided to contribute 420 million Swiss francs (about 266 million
U.S. dollars)to help replenish the funds of the International
Development Association, which belongs to the World Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
The contribution is part of the 12th replenishment round for
the IDA Partnership for Poverty Reduction program. The Swiss
government said Monday that it fully supported the IDA work, which
helps reduce poverty and improve quality of life in many
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The IDA program is aimed at reducing poverty by increasing the
availability of, and access to, basic social services and by
creating a policy environment that promotes employment-generating,
pro-poor economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The IDA work has helped reduce child mortality worldwide by 50
percent, and average life spans were up from 55 to 64 years,
according to the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, much remained to be done because there are
still about three billion people who had to get by on the
equivalent of less than two dollars a day, and 1.3 billion on less
than one dollar.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Parliament Claims Return of Boy Elian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban parliament asked the
United Nations Monday to claim the return to the island of boy
Elian Gonzalez, survivor of a shipwreck and held in the United
States for almost a month.
</P>
<P>
The statement, approved unanimously, is also meant for "the
parliaments of the world, parties, non governmental organizations,
religious and social, and to all people of good will."
</P>
<P>
"The United States has the inexcusable duty of returning
immediately this boy to the home from which he was illegally taken,
" affirmed the text made known by Ricardo Alarcon, president of
the Cuban parliament.
</P>
<P>
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, father of the little six-year-old boy, is
claiming the return of the child to the island, while Elian stays
held in the United States under custody of some distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary text also called on all Cubans "to double the
fight for the minor's return" and asked that "in all of the island
the demand of all Cubans to proclaim itself, not ceasing until
this crime stops."
</P>
<P>
The statement indicated that "initially the American government
intended to wash its hands regarding the boy's situation and
accepted the Act of Adjustment of Cuba, ignoring the minor's
condition, parental authority, U.S. and Cuban laws, as well as
international rights."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "a government that considers itself
responsible cannot submit its behavior to the shameful pressures
of a terrorist mafia or of corrupt and bribable demagogues."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russia Duma Elections Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Russia's parliament elections is positive and a sign that
democracy there is becoming accepted as normal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, White House Spokesman Joe
Lockhart noted the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) had made an initial judgment that the elections on
Sunday meet "the standards of free and fair."
</P>
<P>
"I think all sides there on the Russian government indicated
concern that we share with the tenor and of the campaign. It...was
a very rough-and-tumble campaign," the spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"But I think, most importantly...it says something about the
system in Russia, where elections are becoming more common, where
the turnout is so strong and the democratic institutions,
regardless of, you know, what you think of who won and who lost,
have become accepted as the norm, and that's a positive," Lockhart
added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the positive election, Lockhart indicated that the
United States has not decided whether to go ahead with loan

The U.S. Export-Import Bank is in the process of making their

He affirmed that the administration has provided "relevant

</P>
<P>
During the Russian elections, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's
position was reportedly strengthened for his handling of the
Chechnya conflict, for which Moscow is facing increasing outrage
from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The elections boosted Putin's hopes of becoming president and
weakened the Communists who have controlled the State Duma, the
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 60 percent of the 107 million
eligible voters have been to the polls, with 100 percent turnout
reported in two villages in the easternmost region of Chukot and
the Tula Oblast south of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Russia's State Duma has 450 members. Voters elect half of the
Duma members by casting a vote for a specific party listed on the
ballot; these 225 seats are then divided among the qualifying
parties by proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
Although 26 political parties and blocs competed in the
elections, only four of them are expected to comfortably clear the
threshold of five percent of the votes needed to enter the State
Duma, which has a normal term of four years.
</P>
<P>
They are the Communist Party, the Fatherland-All Russia
movement, the Unity Party and the Yabloko party.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland has stepped up
emergency aid deliveries for Venezuela's natural disaster victims,
contributing food, water and medical aid worth about 400,000 Swiss
francs (about 253,000 U.S. dollars), the authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Red Cross is providing blankets, water purification
equipment and medical supplies, which are distributed by about 1,
000 volunteers of the Venezuelan Red Cross. Switzerland's Roman
Catholic charity Caritas is supporting those efforts and helps set
up emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
The official death toll from Venezuela' worst natural calamity
this century has risen to 5,000 and is expected to rise further.
It is not clear how many bodies have been recovered but most of
the dead remain buried under rubble and mud after large swaths of
Venezuela's northern coast were swept away due to torrential
rainfall and landslides last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many of the dead and injured were people living in shacks made
of tin, wood and cinderblock. About 6,000 people are still
reported missing and another 150,000 have been made homeless. Many
survivors have been forced to wander through streets covered with
rocks and mud in search of food and water.

<HEADLINE> 200 Exiled Sierra Leonean Soldiers Leave Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 self-exiled Sierra
Leonean soldiers and their families Monday left the Liberian
capital Monrovia voluntarily for Freetown on board a chartered
vessel.
</P>
<P>
They were the second batch of such soldiers and ex-combatants
in Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war on their way to go home. A
similar number had returned in November, according to a report of
the Pan Africa News Agency reaching here from Monrovia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 soldiers and ex-combatants had fled the war-torn
country as refugees in Liberia, said Sierra Leonean Ambassador to
Liberia Kemoh Salia- Bao.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers are repatriated for fear that "the presence of
such a large number of combatants in neighboring Liberia could
pose of threat to the peace process in Sierra Leone," Salia-Bao
said.
</P>
<P>
According to another PANA report, the governments of Liberia
and Sierra Leone have agreed to set up a joint security committee
to investigate reports of subversive dissident activities in each
other's country.
</P>
<P>
The proposed committee will visit areas in the two countries
where suspected dissidents are reported to be stationed, and if
identified, they are to be prosecuted according to the laws of the
host country, Sierra Leone's Vice President Albert Demby told
reporters in Monrovia on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Denies He Would Hamper Khatami's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on Tuesday dismissed criticism that his return to the
Majlis (parliament) might be a hurdle for the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami to push forward his political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told a press conference that he supports both
economic and political developments (reforms) in the country and
his re-entry to the Majlis would be a good support for Khatami's
government.
</P>
<P>
A veteran and prominent political figure, Rafsanjani had served
as Majlis speaker for two terms from July 1980 to July 1989, and as
president for two terms from July 1989 to August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Widely acclaimed for his pragmatism, Rafsanjani has registered
to run in the sixth Majlis elections slated for February 18 and is
widely regarded as the major hopeful for the post of Majlis
speaker.
</P>
<P>
"I have no difference with President Khatami and we enjoy close
relations," he said, reminding that Khatami had served as minister
of culture and Islamic guidance in his cabinet and presidential
advisor to him.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani underlined that both political and economic
developments are necessary for the country and should be continued.
</P>
<P>
"The political development (advocated by Khatami) has no
contradiction with the Islamic revolution, which itself was based
on the people's participation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani is currently chairman of the State Expediency
Council, which functions as an arbitrative body between different
state powers and an advisory organ to the supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani noted that he will help push forward the political
development in the country in a much healthy way if he finds way
into the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
He called on all the political groups and factions loyal to the
Islamic revolution to close their ranks to serve the country.
</P>
<P>
While shunning from making comment on the possible result of the
Majlis elections, Rafsanjani said that his participation in the
polling was not aimed at being elected as the speaker.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is to be present in the scene of the
elections, and under the present historical juncture help the trend
of political, economic and cultural development of the country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both the supreme leader and the president were
among those who encouraged him to take part in the parliamentary
elections.

<HEADLINE> Preliminary Results of Russian Parliamentary Election Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Central Electoral
Commission on Tuesday announced the preliminary results of the
parliamentary elections held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With over 90 percent of votes counted as of 9 a.m. (0600 GMT),
six electoral blocs and movements consolidated their leading
positions and successfully entered the new State Duma (lower house
of parliament).
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party led by Gennady Zyuganov won 24.55 percent
of the ballots, keeping its number one status in parliament. It
was followed closely by the pro-Kremlin Unity movement headed by
Sergey Shoigu with supporting rate of 23.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fatherland-All Russia (OVR) led by former premier Yevgeny
Primakov collected 11.98 percent of the votes, while the Union of
Right-Wing Forces (SPS) led by former prime minister Sergey
Kiriyenko got 8.63 percent, Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Bloc 6.18
percent and Grigory Yavlinsky's Yabloko bloc 5.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
The other twenty blocs and movements, which were legally
registered for the State Duma election, failed to reach the five-
percent level required by law.
</P>
<P>
Our Home Is Russia movement (NDR) led by former prime minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the second biggest party in the last Duma,
was supplanted out of parliament with a disappointing 1.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
The following parties and movements, which failed to get
through to the Duma, won more than two percent of the votes: the
Communist and Working People of Russia for the Soviet Union (2.28
percent), Women of Russia (2.07 percent), and the Party of
Pensioners (2.02 percent). The rest of the election coalitions,
except Our Home Is Russia, mustered less than one percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
So far the turnout rate of the elections was 61.60 percent,
said the Central Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the poll are expected in about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, the Central Electoral Commission's preliminary
figures showed that as of 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) Monday, the Communist
Party won 43 of all 224 single-mandate districts. The Fatherland-
All Russia won 29, while the Unity movement 10, Our Home Is Russia
seven and Yabloko and the Union of Right-Wing Forces five
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Nominated individual candidates seized 105 single-seat
districts with individual volunteer candidates winning in six.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's electoral law, half of the Duma's 450 seats
will be proportionally shared among parties which get more than
five percent of the total vote and the other half will be elected
in 225 individual constituencies in the country.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary elections were held across the country on
Sunday with over 60 percent of the 107 million eligible voters
taking part. As many as 26 blocs and movements were registered
for the race.
</P>
<P>
No individual electoral district or voting stations were set
up in the breakaway republic of Chechnya because of the war there.
As a result, a total of 224 individual deputies will be elected
during the polls across the country.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 parliamentary elections involved 41 associations, but
only four managed to overcome the five-percent hurdle. Four
years ago, the Communist Party received 22.3 percent, the Liberal
Democratic party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky 11.18 percent, Our Home
Is Russia 10.13 percent and Yabloko 6.89 percent.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa Tuesday acknowledged the historic achievement scored
by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) over the past 14
years.
</P>
<P>
"The work of the JLG represented a most remarkable achievement,
" said Tung at a dinner held at the Government House for the

</P>
<P>

of life and the preservation of the systems as envisaged in the
Joint Declaration."
</P>
<P>
"The course we have charted for Hong Kong will be remembered in
history as a brave adventure and one which has made a most
important contribution to the reunification of China," said Tung.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong today is a vibrant and lively city and we see the
successful implementation of the concept of 'One Country, Two
Systems' not only in Hong Kong, but also in Macao which celebrated
its reunification with the motherland only yesterday," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 30 months since Hong Kong's reunification, we have
faced some important challenges such as the Asian financial
turmoil. However, we were able to tackle each hurdle put in front
of us with the full knowledge that the continued prosperity and
stability of Hong Kong is built on a strong foundation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The JLG held a reception here Tuesday to celebrate the
completion of its mission, which aimed to implement the terms of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration to maintain long-term stability
and prosperity in Hong Kong.

meeting, its last meeting, in Hong Kong, on December 8. It will be
dismissed on January 1, 2000 in accordance with the Joint
Declaration between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The editors-in-chief and
deputy editors-in-chief of 13 major Beijing-based newspapers and
one news agency today selected China's Top 10 News Events of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The following are the events in descending order of
significance:
</P>
<P>
1. A grand military review and a parade of 500,000 people were
held at Tiananmen Square to mark the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The military review demonstrated the accomplishments of the
Chinese army's modernization, and the mass parade displayed the
splendid achievements recorded by China in its socialist
construction under the collective leadership of three generations.
</P>
<P>
2. The second session of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC) on March 15 passed an amendment to the Constitution of the
People's Republic of China incorporating Deng Xiaoping Theory into
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The theory was thus enshrined in the country's fundamental law
as the nation's guiding principle, ensuring that China will
continue its march along the path of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The basic principle of governing the country according to law
and the enhanced status of non-publicly owned economic elements in
the national economy were also adopted into the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
3. China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20. Macao, which had been China's territory since ancient
times, was colonized by Portugal in the mid 16th century.
</P>
<P>
The successful return of Macao marked a great step forward in
the country's cause of reunification, following Hong Kong's return
in 1997, and the complete eradication of national humiliation
brought on by colonialism.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua)-- Peace talks with Syria is an
important issue concerning Israel's security and peace with all
neighbors, Israeli President Ezer Weizman said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with members of the Golan Residents Committee (GRC),
Weizman said all Israelis should support the peace process with
Syria because it can bring peace to everybody.
</P>
<P>
He told the GRC members that he can not keep quiet on this
issue, but expresses his strong support for the government to
resume peace talks with Syria, despite criticism from certain
political parties or groups including the GRC.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Peace talks with others request Israel to make
territorial concessions and only some territorial concessions can
bring peace to Israeli citizens, including residents on the Golan,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Golan residents to face reality and join the
government to find a best solution to the issue of the Golan
Heights.

back the government to move the Israeli-Syrian peace track forward.

<P>
He has also met with leaders of Shas, coalition partner of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's government, and asked them to support this
move.

week and the two sides will return to Washington early next month

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani: Iran-U.S. Issue Must Be Solved One Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said on Tuesday that Iran and the United States must end
their hostility one day, though not in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, the problems (between Iran and the U.S.) must be
solved one day," Rafsanjani, chairman of the powerful arbitrative
and advisory State Expediency Council, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
A veteran and prominent political figure, Rafsanjani had served
as Majlis speaker for two terms from July 1980 to July 1989, and as
president for two terms from July 1989 to August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Widely acclaimed for his pragmatism, he has registered to run
for the sixth Majlis elections slated for February 18 and is widely
regarded as the major hopeful for the post of Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
He denied there would be any breakthrough between Iran and the
U.S., but called on Washington to release Iranian assets frozen in
the U.S. since the 1979 Islamic revolution to show its "sincerity"
in improving ties.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has to show its sincerity and I have personally stated
times during my presidency that the unfreezing of Iranian assets
would be a sign of Washington's goodwill," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani blamed the U.S. for lack of readiness to improve ties
with Iran. For Iran, however, the only condition is that the U.S.
should take concrete action to show its sincerity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. severed its diplomatic ties with Iran in 1980 after
Iranian students occupied the its embassy in Tehran in the heyday
of the Islamic revolution, and retaliated by freezing Iranian
assets in the U.S. which Iran claimed amounted to several billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since the election in 1997 of the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, Tehran and Washington have exchanged goodwill gestures and
eased tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, several senior U.S. officials have called
for "unconditional talks" with Iran, but Iran rejected the U.S.
overtures, calling for practical steps to remove the "wall of
distrust" between them.

<HEADLINE> JLG Celebrates Completion of Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) held a reception here Tuesday to celebrate the
completion of its mission, which aimed to implement the terms of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration to maintain long-term stability
and prosperity in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The JLG has made, through friendly cooperation, hundreds of
arrangements for the smooth transition and handover of power in
Hong Kong ever since it was established on May 24, 1985, when the
Sino-British Joint Declaration went into force," said Wu Hongbo,
Chinese senior representative.
</P>
<P>
"We have now reached the final destination together, with a
sense of mission accomplished," said Alan Paul, British senior
representative, who jointly hosted the reception with Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the great concept of "one country, two systems"
has already become reality both in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), headed by its chief executive Tung
Chee-hwa, has been leading the Hong Kong people forward in the
unprecedented enterprise of "Hong Kong people administering Hong
Kong" and remarkable successes have already been made toward this
end.
</P>
<P>
The central people's government will, as always, support
vigorously the efforts of the Hong Kong SAR government in its
administration according to law. The mainland of China will remain
forever firmly supportive for the long-term stability and
prosperity of the Hong Kong SAR, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Both Wu and Paul spoke highly of Chinese President Jiang Zemin'
s visit to the United Kingdom in October this year.
</P>
<P>
"The visit promoted our bilateral relations to a new stage of
development and the new century will witness further growth of the
bilateral relations between China and the United Kingdom," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Paul said, "the state visit of President Jiang Zemin to Britain
was a great success. We are determined to build on that
achievement to our mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed confidence in Hong Kong's future under the
guidance of the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
Paul attributed significance to the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, saying that the declaration, a most reliable compass
to guide the JLG, gave the JLG members a clear sense of direction
and common goals for continued prosperity and stability in Hong
Kong and its smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
"Today, `one country, two systems` is working well in Hong Kong.
And the joint declaration continues to be the guarantee and guide
for Hong Kong's future," said Paul.
</P>
<P>
Paul pointed out that the work of the JLG proved that the
sensitive issues between countries can be solved by consultation
and cooperation, which constitutes an encouraging message to the
whole world community.
</P>
<P>
Anson Chan, administrative secretary of Hong Kong, who was
present at the reception, thanked the JLG "for their dedication
and years of hard work in turning the unique concept of `one
country, two systems` into a reality."
</P>
<P>
"It is now up to the government of the Special Administrative
Region and the people of Hong Kong, with the support of the
central government, to ensure its continued success," she said.
</P>
<P>
The JLG concluded the 47th meeting, its last meeting, in Hong
Kong, on December 8. It will be dismissed on January 1, 2000 in
accordance with the Joint Declaration between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The b-sample of Dieter Baumann'
s drug tests will be examined next week at a Cologne laboratory,
the German athletics body DLV announced in Darmstadt Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Baumann, 5,000m Olympic champion in 1992, is under suspicion of
drug abuse because his a-samples of random tests carried out on
October 19 and November 12 contained an illegal amount of the
anabolic steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Baumann faces a two-year ban from competition
if he is found guilty of drug abuse. The b-sample results always
confirm the findings from the first examinations.
</P>
<P>
Baumann has protested his innocence in the high-profile case
and criminal investigations are under way. They were requested by
Baumann after the Cologne lab found out that the nandrolone was in
his toothpaste, which normally does not contain the substance.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets EU, EC Leaders (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met with Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland, who currently
holds the rotating president's post in the European Union (EU),
and President Romano Prodi of the European Commission (EC) here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that mankind will soon enter a new century -- an
important time for the Chinese and EU leaders to jointly discuss
ways to further bilateral relations and contribute more to world
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He said that after meeting with several leaders of European
countries and two visits to western Europe this year, he noticed
that nothing can replace direct contact between leaders who are
working to deepen mutual understanding and promote cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest developing country, and the EU is
the most highly integrated regional organization with the largest
number of developed countries in the world, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
As long as both sides properly handle bilateral ties from a
strategic perspective, a constructive partnership oriented to the
21st century will be established, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The President expounded on his view of the world's diversity.
He said the world is a colorful place, and different countries are
at different stages of development. They are divergent in cultural
backgrounds, social systems, concepts of value, and lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
The world is exciting and vigorous exactly because of such
diversity, and only by respecting such diversity and seeking
common interest through communication can we follow the developing
trends of the world society, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang explained China's domestic situation, saying the Chinese
government is safeguarding the basic human and democratic rights
of the common people, and it has achieved noteworthy results in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in safeguarding human rights, the specific
situation of a certain country must be taken into consideration,
and by protecting the basic rights of subsistence and development
of 1.2 billion people, China has made the greatest contribution it
can to the world's human rights cause.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen and Prodi congratulated Jiang on the return of Macao,
and introduced the EU's plan on development and reform. They said
great changes are now taking place in Europe while it is adjusting
its economic structure, and political reform will also be
gradually carried out.
</P>
<P>
Under the new situation, it is of vital importance for the EU
to increase its relations with China, and the EU is willing to
work together with China to establish a constructive partnership
facing the new century, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails Ties With Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has termed the Egyptian-Bahraini relationship as unique, special
and long-standing, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-
Khalifa in Manama, Mubarak affirmed that the coming phase will
witness closer cooperation and coordination in the political,
economic and technical fields between the two countries, el-Sharif,
who was accompanying the president on a visit, told Egypt's Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak arrived in Bahrain on Monday for a two-day official
visit within a Gulf tour, which has taken him to Saudi Arabia and
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
El-Sharif said that during their summit, Mubarak and Hamad
exchanged views on Arab and international issues and reached
identical viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
The leaders expressed readiness to exert efforts to help promote
the Middle East peace process and to work on clearing the inter-
Arab relations and closing Arab ranks, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed peace talks last week after a gap of
nearly four years on the future of the Golan Heights that Israel
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations for a final peace agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel are continuing. Mubarak's Gulf tour is part
of the efforts aimed at forging a unified Arab stance toward the
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Hamad also underlined the need to introduce new
dimensions to the economic and trade cooperation in the Arab world
and to place the issue at the top of the Arab nation's priorities,
el-Sharif was quoted by the news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The inter-Arab trade stands at less than 10 percent of the total
foreign trade of the Arab countries. The inter-Arab investment is
also at a low level.

<HEADLINE> France Asks Iraq to Accept U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- France asked Iraq on Tuesday to
accept the United Nations resolution 1284 on reestablishing
disarmament control which has been suspended for one year.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to Iraq to join its implementation. We think that
this chance to reestablish the cooperation between Baghdad and the
U.N. could be fully grasped," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
France abstained from the voting on the British-proposed
resolution last Friday in New York, judging too strict the
conditions for lifting economic sanctions on Iraq, which the
United Nations imposed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Two other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China
and Russia, also abstained from the voting.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that Iraq and the U.N. should "turn toward
the future" by resuming their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"If this resolution is applied, it will bring about much
progress," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has not officially reacted to the
resolution yet, although the media and parliament of the country
have denounced it.

Levy briefed the Moroccan diplomat about the development of the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks, saying any difficulties
facing the talks can be solved through negotiations.

Since the launching of the final-status talks September 13, the
negotiating teams from the two sides have held 11 sessions. Till

The Wall Street Journal:

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Congress leaders
have
finally agreed to the government's call for the restoration of the
30-billion-peso (750 million U.S. dollars) cut on the national
budget, the Philippine government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in a press statement that Congress
leaders agreed to restore the 30-billion-peso Internal Revenue
Allotment (IRA) of the local government units (LGUs), although the
release of the IRA will not come without a price.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, all the financial obligations of
LGUs to the national government will be automatically deducted
from their IRA, before the fund could be directly released to them.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, all LGUs will be required to allocate 20
percent of their IRA to development projects, with priority given
to solid waste management, health care and food security.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said: "All LGUs shall
submit their respective Annual Investment Plan to the appropriate
regional office of the Department of Budget and Management not
later than January 31 of each year."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that for the year 2000, the national
government extended the submission of the plan until March 31, to
give them time to prepare their development plans.
</P>
<P>
The compromise came in the heels of threats made by local
government officials that they would resort to a sit-down strike
and work stoppage if the cut is not revived.
</P>
<P>
The Bicameral Conference Committee of Congress is still
discussing the proposed 651-billion-peso (16.3 billion dollars)
national budget for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the House of Representatives approved the budget to
remain intact but the Senate later cut the proposed budget by 52
billion pesos (1.3 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Work with Reduced Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Estrada administration can
work with a slightly reduced budget for the year 2000 without
significantly hampering the activities of the agencies affected,
the Philippine government assured the public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said in a statement that
the across-the-board cut from the 651-billion-peso (16.3 billion U.
S.dollars) national budget for next year will be equivalent to
around 22 billion pesos (550 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The administration is confident that it can work with the
foregoing budget cuts without significantly hampering the
activities of the government agencies affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 22-billion-peso cut, Barican said 7 billion pesos (175
million U.S. dollars) is considered "effective and hard cuts" to
be applied to maintenance and other operating expenditures (MOE),
capital outlays and some aspects of the school building program.
</P>
<P>
Cuts on MOE, according to Barican, would include training,
other services and intelligence funds except those allocated for
the Office of the President, Presidential Anti-Organized Crime
Task Force, Philippine National Police, and the Armed Forces of
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Cuts on capital outlays, on the other hand, would include those
earmarked as land compensation component of the comprehensive
agrarian reform program.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the 15 billion pesos (375 million dollars) in "
soft cuts" will involve deferment of some expenditures to adjust
to the inflow of revenues.

Zhu made the comment during the second China-European Union
Summit meeting with Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland, who
presently holds the rotating position of president of the EU, and
President Romano Prodi of the EC. The two sides exchanged in-depth
views on bilateral relations and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reviewed the smooth development of bilateral
relations since the first summit meeting in London last year, and
took note of the expanded cooperation in all areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he appreciated the positive measures that the EU has
taken to improve relations with China. China has consistently
stressed the importance of relations with the EU and its members
and considers this bond as vital to the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
China has also steadfastly supported the EU integration and is
glad to see the EU play a positive role in international affairs,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen and Prodi said that the EU hopes to increase
cooperation with China since closer EU-China ties will benefit

<P>
Zhu cited economic and trade cooperation as the "important
basis" of Sino-EU relations. The EU is China's third largest trade
partner and also the biggest supplier of technology and equipment
to China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that although the economic and trade cooperation
between the two sides has been fruitful, the scale and extent of
bilateral cooperation should be increased.
</P>
<P>
The economic scale of the EU has exceeded that of the United
States and Japan, but the trade volume of the EU with China
accounted for 3.9 percent of its overall trade volume, while EU's
investment in China occupied 2.24 percent of its total investment
outside, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the largest group of developed countries while China
is the largest developing country, he said, adding that the two
sides are economically complementary. He said he hopes that the EU
can reduce and finally abolish trade restrictions on China,
increase high-tech exports and technology transfers, and take
positive measures to encourage more European enterprises to invest
in China and cooperate with Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen and Prodi said that both the EU and China are
experiencing fast economic development, and there is great
potential and enthusiasm for economic and trade cooperation
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The EU will look into further investment in China, they pointed
out, adding that the EU wants China to play a bigger role in the
world economy, supports China's entry to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), and hopes to reach a beneficial and stable
agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reiterated China's principled stance on its accession to
the WTO and hoped the EU would make a decision as early as
possible so that the two sides can reach agreement on the matter.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Finnish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that China and Finland complement each other in many fields
and therefore the potential for bilateral cooperation is great.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks when meeting with visiting Prime Minister
Paavo Lipponen of Finland, the rotating presidency of the EU, who
arrived here this morning to attend the second China-EU Summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that as China is going to develop the vast and
resource-filled western areas in the coming century, the central
and local governments will need to increase investment to absorb
more capital, technology and talent from home and abroad. Since
Finland has "advantages" in these fields, Finnish enterprises are
welcome to invest in those regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Premier expressed his satisfaction with the progress of
bilateral ties, saying that bilateral exchange and cooperation in
various fields have developed smoothly and steadily. The frequent
contacts between leaders of both countries have helped increase
mutual understanding, and promote common understanding and
cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see that bilateral trade volume last year
approached 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, thus hitting ahead of time
the goal of doubling the volume in three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also stressed the importance of strengthening consultation
and cooperation between the two countries under the present
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen agreed with Zhu's comment on bilateral relations and
the view that the two countries share broad prospects in trade and
economic cooperation. He noted that bilateral cooperation has been
successful.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Announces Contingency Plans for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
announced contingency and recovery plans to check the Y2K bug in
the key sectors of the nation's economy with the assurance that
there is no cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Science and Technology Pauline Tallen
said Monday in capital Abuja that the contingency plans would
cover telecommunication, aviation, energy and the health sectors,
This Day newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She noted that although the telecommunication sector had 100
percent compliance status, the government "is not leaving
anything to chance."
</P>
<P>
Tallen, also chairperson of the National Y2K Committee, said
that the plan would allow the Nigerian Telecommunication
Corporation to cease all routes of the private telephone
operators that are not millennium compliant between December 15
and 28.
</P>
<P>
She announced that another measure is the switching off of all
 international gateways, secondary centers and digital primary
centers to generators at 22:00 hours on December 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
If at 10:00 hours on January 1, 2000, there is no problem from
the Nigeria Power Authority systems, she added, the exchanges
would be reconnected to its source of power supply.
</P>
<P>
In aviation, Tallen announced, the Air Traffic Monitoring (ATM)
for Lagos and Kano airports are ATM centers to coordinate with
the regional Y2K center in Dakar, Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Sokoto, Ilorin, Maiduguri and
Calabar have been designed Y2K emergency airports for aircraft
under distress due to Y2K failures, she added.
</P>
<P>

70 percent compliant status, saying that a directive has already
been issued that all hospital equipment which are not Y2K
compliant should not be put to use as from January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
She announced that large quantities of refined petroleum
products had been stocked which can be used for at least one

most expensive Spanish player in history.
</P>
<P>
"The deal has been completed," a spokeswoman for Atletico said.
"And it's the most anyone's paid for a Spanish player."
</P>
<P>
"It's a great coup. We've been thinking of him for a long time,
" Milan vice-chairman Adriano Galliani said.
</P>
<P>
Dani Garcia, who moved from Real Mallorca to Barcelona for 15
million U.S. dollars over the summer, was previously the most
expensive Spanish signing.
</P>
<P>
Jose Mari was due in Milan on Tuesday for a medical check
before signing the contract and will be eligible to play when
serie A starts on January 6.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Jose Mari is expected to be presented
officially on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to Italy to triumph," he was quoted as saying in
Spanish newspapers. "Milan are one of the biggest clubs in the
world and this is an important move for me."
</P>
<P>
Jose Mari, who scored nine goals in each of his first two
seasons at Atletico after moving from Sevilla in 1997, has yet to
list into Jose Antonio Camacho's senior national squad.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy to Grow 4.5-5.5 PC in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy (gross
national product) is projected to grow by 4.5 to 5.5 percent in
2000 from this year's 3.5 percent while the inflation rate will
drop slightly to 6.5-7.5 percent from 7-8 percent, the Philippine
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said in a
statement that the gross domestic product (GDP) will also improve
to 4-5 percent next year from 3 percent in 1999, on the back of
the full recovery of industries.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said industries are expected to post a 4.8- to 5.9-
percent growth from this year's 0.5-1.1 percent as manufacturing
and utilities strengthen and construction finally recovers.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the agriculture sector, however, is seen to
normalize at 2.5-3.5 percent from the 6 percent expected this year,
depending on the government's ability to more effectively
implement projects under the Agriculture and Fisheries
Modernization Act, he said.
</P>
<P>
That of services will be sustained at 4-5 percent, with
telecommunications and transportation being the major growth areas
of the sector.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this projected growth, the government, however, has
to address the key gaps that stood out in 1999, including the
national government deficit, the pace of structural reforms and
the inefficiencies in project implementation.
</P>
<P>
"The 62.5-billion-pesos (1.56 billion U.S. dollars) deficit as
the anchor of the government's fiscal program will be strictly
followed," Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this means that the national government
will have to cut its expenditures to ensure that its deficit will
not exceed 62.5 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said the inflation rate is expected to taper off to 6.5-
7.5 percent next year, taking into account the projection that
crude oil prices will remain at the current levels up to the first
quarter of 2000 and decline thereafter.

<HEADLINE> Britain Promises to Write Off Third World Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government promised
on Tuesday to write off 5 billion pounds (about 8 billion U.S.
dollars) in debt owed to Britain by the world's 41 poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Gordon Brown
said the debt relief plan would only apply to countries promising
to use the money to relieve poverty.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a Downing Street seminar called to
try to kick-start an agreement signed last autumn by the world's
wealthiest countries to write off Third World debt.
</P>
<P>
The government's immediate target is that 25 countries will
have benefited from debt forgiveness by Britain by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The first countries likely to benefit from the British move are
expected to include Uganda, Mozambique, Bolivia and Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
In June the Group of Seven (G7) major powers at their Cologne
summit decided to write off about one-third of all the loans owed
by the world's poorest countries.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia PM Hun Sen Meets With Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen met with investors Tuesday at the Government-Private
Sector Forum, aimed at promoting private sector development and
improving the country's investment environment.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 foreign investors and diplomats attended the
forum, presided over by Prime Minster Hun Sen with many senior
government ministers present. Hun Sen is also chairman of the
Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC).
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time that a prime minister, members and
senior officials of the royal government of Cambodia have met the
representatives of the private sector at this open forum," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Today's meeting is organized to highlight this private sector'
s role and strengthen our traditional partnership," added Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The forum gave an opportunity to initiate a dialogue and
exchange of views between the government and the private sector in
order to discuss sensitive points, which are critical to improving
the overall environment for investment.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hun Sen put forward some measures to
facilitate investments, such as giving a discount rate for
important users-buyers of electricity; extending duty exemptions
to supporting industries (carton boxes, plastic bags, shoe soles
and others); and allowing investors to benefit from a permanent
residential permit.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prime minister urged the setting up of a "one
stop service" decision process of the CDC for approving or
rejecting an investment project within 28 days.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister described the investors as the boss and CDC
as the servant. "So, from now on, we should do our best to satisfy
the investors," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone was found to take bribes, I will fire him at once,"
the prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Some new opportunities for investments were offered at the
meeting, such as through the build-operate-transfer scheme (BOT)
to develop the country's roads, airports and water and electricity
sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, CDC's Cambodian Investment Board
approved 80 proposed investment projects this year up to November,
with a total capital investment of 434 million U.S. dollars. The
figures are down significantly from last year, when 143 projects
worth 855 million dollars were approved.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen reiterated that the government's top priority is to
ensure and promote a social environment for peace, security and
stability in all parts of the country, which he said is very
important for attracting more investments.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also announced that the "Government-Private
Sector Forum" will be held once every six months and expressed his
happiness to chair the next forum.

<HEADLINE> Garrison Commander Vows to Fulfill Mission in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- "The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) Macao Garrison is capable of carrying out its historic,
sacred mission and defending the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR) to live up to the expectations of the people of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Major General Liu Yuejun, commander of the PLA Macao Garrison,
made the pledge here today in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The enthusiasm showed by Macao people to our troops is
touching," Liu said. Tens of thousands of civilians lined the
streets, waving colorful banners and chanting welcome greetings
when the 550 soldiers and officers rolled into Macao Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year old commander, who is described as being smart and
frank, has been in the service for 30 years and was promoted to
the current position by the Central Military Commission headed by
Jiang Zemin earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
China's resumption of the sovereignty over Macao is a grand
event for the Chinese people and marks the beginning of a new era
for Macao, he said, stressing that the PLA Garrison troops will
carry out its duties strictly in accordance with the Basic Law of
the MSAR and the Garrison Law.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment, the garrison troops have undergone
strict training to improve its military quality and the ability to
deal with the special situation in Macao, Liu said. Their weapons
mainly include light arms and armored vehicles, he noted, adding
the garrison is completely capable of fulfilling its defensive
duties in the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
As Macao is a special administrative region with high degree of
autonomy and governed by law, the troops will not only abide by
laws that are in compliant with laws of the country but also local
laws, and all the officers and soldiers have studied relevant laws
before they came, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the role of the garrison and local security, the
commander said, according to the Garrison Law, the troops would
assist the MSAR Government in safeguarding public security and
fighting natural disasters, with the approval of the Central
Military Commission at the request of the MSAR Government.
</P>
<P>
The garrison troops will respect the MSAR Government and the
social system and way of life in the territory, Liu said. "We will
stand together with the Macao people and fulfill our sacred
historic mission here," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Procurator-General Vows to Maintain Social Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chio Meng, procurator-
general of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR),
expressed belief that procurators of Macao are capable of
safeguarding social stability by abiding by the MSAR Basic Law and
with support from the region's chief executive and citizens.
</P>
<P>
As the MSAR has already had a basically sound legal system,
focus should be placed on strengthening law enforcement and
supervision, Ho said, stressing that his top priority will be
given to cracking down on crimes to secure public order and
protect people's legitimate rights and interests.  "This is an
area in which we face both challenges and opportunities," he said
</P>
<P>
He vowed to make greater efforts to deal with a few major cases
to strike a heavy blow against organized crime. And for this
purpose, a special group has been set up to deal with major
criminal violations. "We will make the most of relevant laws to
deter organized crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao will increase judicial cooperation with regional and
international organizations because many crimes are committed
across borders and control lines, he said, adding that MSAR
procuratorates will exercise their power independently.

<HEADLINE> Barak Plans to Form Regional Cooperation Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 21 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is working on a plan to set up a regional cooperation
association for shaping new relationships between the countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The envisaged body, named as the Middle East Regional
Cooperation, is modeled after the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), a voluntary organization whose members are
committed to non-intervention in member states' affairs, the local
daily Haaretz reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Barak ratified an overall geostrategic concept
formulated by the National Security Council headed by Major General
(RES.) David Ivri, in which the formation of such a association was
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is a model for non-intervention and coexistence by
countries that are not necessarily in love with one other, one
official in Barak's Office said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the
Philippines, Brunei, Vitenam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Israel will offer the Arab countries a similar arrangement based
on the following principles: international disputes in the region
are to be solved by talks; regional economic cooperation and
advancement of regional security are to be common goals;
construction of the organization and its institutions is to be
paced on the basis of the normalization processes.
</P>
<P>
Barak plans to present the plan as an official Israeli policy in
the coming months, timed to coincide with progress in the peace
talks with Syria and the Palestinians.

KHARTOUM, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-
Bashir Tuesday starts a visit to Libya at an invitation by Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi over the current developments in Sudan, the

<HEADLINE> Intel Creates Wireless Group, Focusing On Internet Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest computer chip maker, said Monday that it formed a new
business group focused on wireless communications, according to a
report from the company.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara, California-based company said its Computing
and Enhancement Group would become the Wireless Communications and
Computing Group, to focus on cellular and wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a major play for us," said Craig Barrett,
Intel's president and chief executive. "It's potentially a large
market."
</P>
<P>
The move, according to industry sources, is the company's
latest as it expands beyond its core PC microprocessor business on
higher growth areas such as communications and networking.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Intel has made a flurry of acquisitions as it
seeks to become the building block supplier of the Internet
economy.
</P>
<P>
In October, Intel announced a 1.6 billion dollar deal to buy
DSP Communications Inc., a supplier of chipsets, chip designs and
software for digital cellular products. With its new structure,
DSP will report as a wholly owned subsidiary within the Cellular
Communications division of the new Wireless Communications and
Computing Group.
</P>
<P>
Mark Edelstone, an analyst at Morgan Stanely Dean Witter, said
the market for chips for cellular phones and wireless devices is
rapidly growing to almost 10 percent of the approximately 144
billion dollar semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
"It's growing three times faster than the PC market," Edelstone
said. "It makes a lot of sense. It just highlights the focus that
companies are placing and should place on wireless."
</P>
<P>
Intel's flash memory business will also become part of the new
wireless group. Ron Smith, an Intel vice president, was previously
the general manager of the Computing Enhancement Group and will
become general manager of the Wireless Communications and
Computing Group.

the 750MHz Athlon chip. AMD previously had beaten Intel to the 700
MHz mark.
</P>
<P>
AMD won't lag Intel for long, however. The company plans to
introduce its own 800MHz Athlon early in January, possibly at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. PC makers Compaq Computer
Corp. and IBM are expected to support it.
</P>
<P>
"We've been sampling customers to support a January launch with
(PCs) available in January," said AMD spokesman Drew Prairie. "
What you will likely see on Monday are some reviews posted on our
800MHz part."
</P>
<P>
Intel priced the 800-MHz Pentium III at 851 dollars in 1,000-
unit quantities. The company also introduced a 750-MHz model,
priced at 803 dollars in 1,000-unit quantities. Both units are
available on a limited basis, with widespread availability later
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement, according some analysts, will be symbolic
to a certain extent and reflect the pressure Intel is experiencing
in its core market. Few of the new chips, originally scheduled for
the first quarter of 2000, have been shipped to PC makers, sources
said, meaning consumers won't see many computers using them until
next year.

<HEADLINE> Angola Solicits Support for Newly-liberated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government has appealed
to the international humanitarian agencies to provide more
assistance for the population living in the newly-liberated
central highland.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Minister of Assistance and Social Reintegration Albino
Malungo made the appeal in Luanda at a meeting with international
donators and coordinators.
</P>
<P>
"During the difficult period, we ask the humanitarian agencies
to improve the fast-responding mechanism in the areas newly
liberated by the Armed Forces of Angola, including Andulo,
Bailundo, Lumbala, Nguimbo, Cangamba and others," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Malungo said that he had recently discussed how to give
priority to the newly-liberated population at a meeting with the
representative of the World Food Program and coordinator of the
United Nations Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Unit (UCAH) in
Angola Francesco Strippoli.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past decades, those people living in
central highland were totally robbed of their goods and humiliated
by the Savimbist forces.
</P>
<P>
Malungo also asked the international community to help the
Angolan government win the battles against the "compatriots" who
are still living in forest areas and constitute obstacles to the
free circulation of people and goods, referring to the smashed
rebels hiding in forests.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will establish a
national space agency in North Eastern Province, President Daniel
arap Moi has said.
</P>
<P>
The agency would set the foundation for the country to
participate in space exploration activities and linkages with
similar foreign agencies, the East African Standard daily Tuesday
quoted Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Such an agency would also be useful in collecting scientific
data on the weather and thereby strengthening agricultural
planning and production, Moi told the ruling party Kenya African
National Union conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
Besides undertaking space exploitation, the space center will
carry out remote sensing in oil exploration, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The center will boost Kenya's status on the international
scene, Moi noted.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been seen as the oasis of peace in the turbulent
Africa, where economic development of some countries has been
constantly disrupted by the armed conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Lists Major Challenges Facing Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The HIV and AIDS pandemic, the
current economic downturn, job creation and poverty alleviation
are the major challenges facing Zimbabwe in the new millennium,
President Robert Mugabe said in Harare Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work together in this region to develop an
integrated policy to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic," the Herald
newspaper Tuesday quoted Mugabe as saying.
</P>
<P>
"All of us are affected by this pandemic," the president said,
adding that no country could score successes without neighbors
coming up with common policies against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economic problems also needs to be resolved at a
regional level, taking into account globalization and the need to
streamline operations and services.
</P>
<P>
"We need to expand our industries and develop relevant skills.
Capital injection alone will not succeed, unless the applications
have personnel with the right level of skill who can imbibe the
new technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the level of unemployment in the southern African
country, he said "there is rising unemployment in the urban
communities owing to rural-urban migration, especially by youths
who come to the towns in search of employment."
</P>
<P>
Noting that a lot of Zimbabweans are subsistence farmers, the
president said that agriculture is the largest employer and one of
the mainstays of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
If it failed, then the economy would suffer a great deal,
Mugabe pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said that the future is much brighter
for the country and appealed to the Zimbabweans to work harder to
rescue the country's economy from recession and to reduce poverty.

<HEADLINE> UN Wants de los Santos Promoted to Lieutenant General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (U.N.) is
asking the Philippine government to promote Army Major General
Jaime de los Santos to three-star rank as commander of the U.N.
peacekeeping force to be deployed in East Timor next year.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said Tuesday in a statement
that the Philippine government is amenable to the request provided
the promotion is only temporary.
</P>
<P>
He explained that under the existing law, only six lieutenant
generals or three-star generals are allowed at one time in the
present set-up of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan is expected to announce the
appointment of de los Santos to command the U.N. Transitional
Administration on East Timor (UNTAET) once the International Force
to East Timor is pulled out of East Timor in March next year.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said it is for this reason that the United Nations has
not officially announced the appointment of de los Santos to head
the UNTAET force.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief said he will recommend to Philippine
President Joseph Estrada to temporarily promote de los Santos to
the rank of lieutenant general.
</P>
<P>
However, when de los Santos completes his tour of duty as
UNTAET commander, he will be reverted to his original rank as a
two-star general.
</P>
<P>
De los Santos, the top choice of Annan to head the UNTAET force,
is presently the superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy.

The Jerusalem Post:

his first public comments since last week's talks with Israel in
Washington, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Reject US Letter on Osama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Tuesday released a public statement which said the alleged
terrorist Osama bin Laden is impossible to carry out terrorist
activities as feared by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released by the Taliban's Ambassador to Pakistan
Maulvi Sayed Haqqani here, was in response to a U.S. letter on
December 13 which claimed linkage of some suspects recently
arrested with Osama who lives in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Taliban don't have any information of "
whether any one is arrested, or to what the suspects have truly
confessed or whether there were elements of disgust involved in
confessions or not."
</P>
<P>
"However, we are confident of one thing and that is that Osama
carries out no activities," it said.
</P>
<P>
Some time ago the United States announced that a number of
suspects were arrested in an Arab country and later there were
reports that certain Jordanians were arrested and they said they
had been trained in Osama's terrorist camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said they would like to know and be informed on the
details and evidences of the linkage between Osama and the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Osama, a Saudi national who has been staying in the Taliban-
controlled part of Afghanistan, was accused by the United States
of masterminding bomb attacks on American embassies in East Africa
last year.
</P>
<P>
The statement also condemned the ways Washington had resorted
to press the Taliban to hand over the alleged terrorist. The
United States attacked Afghanistan with cruise missiles last year
and imposed economic sanctions on the war-torn country last June.
</P>
<P>
"The savage acts carried on up to now by the United States was
out of expectation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"If you really are interested to resolve this issue rationally,
then what is the use of force for?" it questioned.
</P>
<P>
When releasing the statement, the Taliban envoy to Pakistan
further refuted those reports on the Jordanian suspects.
</P>
<P>
When the Jordanian Embassy was contacted in Islamabad for more
details, "it was responded that the Jordanian government did not
say that the suspects had linkage with Osama," he said.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani also said the Taliban had restricted Osama's liaison
with outsiders and he had no use of telephone, fax and the like. "
We are totally sure that they are out of his use," he said.

<HEADLINE> Innovation Technology Forum Held in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking on Monday at the "Hong Kong -- Building a Technology
Frontier" forum sponsored by Hong Kong Young Entrepreneurs
Development Council, Secretary for Trade and Industry Chau Tak Hay
said Hong Kong "has to do more" if it wants to keep its
competitive edge in the innovation and technology field.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Chau explained, the government is launching a
range of programs to offer support in the sector, including the
planned merging of Science Park, the Industrial Estates
Corporation and the Industrial Technology Center Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The government set up the Innovation and Technology Fund in
July this year with an initial injection of 5 billion HK dollars (
641 million U.S. dollars) to support projects that contribute to
innovation and technological upgrading of Hong Kong's industries,
Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Since the majority of enterprises in Hong Kong are small and
medium-sized, the government also introduced the Small
Entrepreneur Research Assistance Scheme to help these enterprises
develop innovative concepts or produce prototypes, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Scheme, qualified projects will be given a grant of
not exceeding 2 million HK dollars (256,410 U.S. dollars), Chau
noted, adding that the government is hoping that the Scheme will
help cultivate a vibrant spirit of technological entrepreneurship
among the "budding companies".

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rights Commission Grills Former East Timor Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of Inquiry for
Human Rights Violation in East Timor started on Tuesday to grill
former Indonesian officials who had been posted in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, the commission summoned Dominggos Soares, a
former regent of Dili, capital of East Timor, and Dino Patti
Djalal, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both were questioned by the commission for about two hours
about their alleged involvement in human rights abuses which took
place after the East Timorese overwhelmingly voted in favor of
independence in a U.N.-sponsored direct ballot on August 30.
</P>
<P>
After the ballot many building and houses in the territory were
set ablaze and many civilians killed.
</P>
<P>
Soares later told reporters that he had never ordered (pro-
integration groups) to set fire on buildings and houses of pro-
independence groups.
</P>
<P>
"There was no instruction from any official to do so," Soares
said.
</P>
<P>
He denied a scorched earth policy in East Timor which left many
houses of East Timorese and buildings destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The commission would also summon top military officials
including former Indonesian Military Chief Gen. Wiranto who is
currently coordinating minister for political and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
But, the commission's Chairman Albert Hasibuan said he had yet
to set a fixed schedule for summoning military officials who had
been allegedly involved in human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
"But, we expect that the team will complete the investigation
by the end of the year. And the result then will be handed over to
the attorney general," Hasibuan told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Ferries in Hainan Suspended for Safety Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- A safety inspection team under
the Ministry of Communications has suspended operations of the
Zijing No.6 Ferry in southernmost China's Hainan Province for
safety violations. It is the fourth suspension issued to the
province in the past month for infractions of safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
The inspection stemmed from the nationwide overhaul of ferry
operations following the tragic wreck of the Dashun ferry on
November 24 near the port city of Yantai, which left 280 people
dead.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dehong, deputy-director of the Marine Safety Department
under the ministry, said that the Zijing No.6 ferry, built in 1996,
belongs to Guangdong Zhanjiang Ocean Shipping Group. Its safety
system, including the emergency and fire-prevention equipment and
lifesaving gear, are below standard.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, three ferries operating between Haikou, the
provincial capital, and Shekou in the island province, were
suspended from navigation because of technical and management
problems.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the ministry disclosed that the structures of
the ferries were deteriorating and systems on board were out-of-
date. The decks of two of the ferries built in 1971 were rotting
and their fire-alarm systems did not work.
</P>
<P>
The suspension will remain in effect until repairs made to the
ferries pass another safety check by the communication authority.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Screens Angolan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian Ministry of Home
Affairs has undertaken screening on Angolan refugees to determine
whether they are civilians or soldiers, the United Nations
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR resident representative Oluseyi Bajulaiye said the influx
of refugees from Angola has continued and the screening was to
separate civilians from combatants, not HIV related as some press
reports said.
</P>
<P>
"Screening them for HIV/AIDS against their will would be a
breach of human rights and is not feasible because it involves
quite a bit of medical technicalities which cannot be done at
entry points in border areas," The Post newspaper Tuesday quoted
Bajulaiye as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said 12,000 Angolan refugees have crossed into Zambia since
the beginning of October this year.
</P>
<P>
Bajulaiye projected that the influx of refugees will continue
as long as the civil war in Angola continued escalating.

<HEADLINE> Manila Gives OFWs Families Free Overseas Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
opened Tuesday one of its Christmas gifts -- a free three-minute
overseas calls -- for the families of overseas Filipino workers
OFWs), estimated at about 7 million.
</P>
<P>
In brief remarks during Tuesday morning's ceremony, First Lady
Luisa Estrada said the annual project is the government's way of
expressing its appreciation and admiration to all OFWs, now
considered as the country's modern-day heroes.
</P>
<P>
"They (OFWs) work in foreign land away from their families to
earn a living and provide the needs of their families. There is no
other noble deed other than the sacrifice of oneself for the
benefit of others," she said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the first lady said, the OFWs are worthy of respect
and admiration for the sacrifice they give for their families and
for the country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that foreign exchange remittances by overseas
Filipino workers this year could hit 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The free three-minute overseas call will last up to December 22
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the Presidential Palace and all other
specified calling centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
The project is sponsored by the Office of the First Lady in
cooperation with the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration,
National Telecommunications Commission, Presidential Action Center
and the country's major telecommunication companies.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine Senate President Blas Ople urged the
government to create more benefit programs for Filipino
expatriates whose remittances have served to support the domestic
economy.
</P>
<P>
Current programs for the OFWs include warm official welcome and
efficient services at Customs desks at their points of entry and
special opportunities for small businesses for retired overseas
workers.
</P>
<P>
Ople called for faster action on a proposal to create new
services for OFWs, including the establishment of a special bank,
a hospital and a housing program for them.

<HEADLINE> Printer Consumables Market Poised for Growth in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Market revenue for printer
consumables in Asia-Pacific is expected to reach 1.6 billion U.S.
dollars by the end of this year, according a report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The market, composed of serial dot matrix ribbons, ink
cartridges and laser toners, registered more than 700 million
dollars in revenue and more than 52 million dollars in unit
shipments in the first half of 1999, said the report from U.S.
market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Ink cartridges recorded the most dramatic growth in unit
shipments. IDC forecasts this segment to grow 31 percent in unit
terms in 1999. The forces driving this growth in Asia-Pacific
include the continuous price reduction of inkjet printer as well
as the growing acceptance of inkjet technology among small and
medium business and home users.
</P>
<P>
IDC also expects a boost in the demand for laser toners used
for network-ready and capable laser printers.
</P>
<P>
From a per unit standpoint, the report said, China holds the
lead with 51 percent of the region's shipments. However, it
accounted for only five percent of the region's total revenue. The
discrepancy between China's unit and revenue share, according to
IDC, can be attributed to more than an 80 percent unit
distribution from serial dot matrix ribbons in which prices are
low due to the shorter product usage life of compatibles.
</P>
<P>
From a revenue perspective, Australia and South Korea were the
two largest markets. This was due to a strong contribution of
laser toners from Australia and both ink cartridges and laser
toners from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
China and India are expected to be the two largest markets by
the year 2003, the report said. From a product perspective, both
ink cartridges and laser toners are projected to see strong growth
given the high demand for inkjet and laser printers. These two
markets are projected to register an annual growth rate each of
more than 20 percent in unit terms, IDC said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Massacre 90 Captives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) rebels have killed 90 of the prisoners they abducted
from Katojo Prison based in the western district of Bundibugyo.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the killed inmates were discovered by the
government troops in the Rwenzori jungles overlooking Bundibugyo
and Kabarole districts, the New Vision daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels may have killed their captives for failing to
cope with the pace at which they were fleeing from the government
troops pursuing them. The captives were either shot or hacked to
death, a government soldier was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels raided the prison on December 9 and abducted 365 of
the 841 prisoners. The pre-dawn attack was reportedly aimed at
rescuing 58 rebel colleagues arrested for terrorism and treason.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some 200 of the abductees have been rescued

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya spends 225 million
shillings (about three million U.S. dollars) daily to control
HIV/AIDS epidemic, Kenyan Health Minister Sam Ongeri has said.
</P>
<P>
The funds are used to maintain the two million Kenyans infected
with the virus, the East African Standard newspaper Tuesday quoted
Ongeri as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the two million, 500 victims die each day, Ongeri told a
conference of the ruling Kenya African National Union Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't take care of ourselves, Kenya will be wiped out,"
Ongeri said.
</P>
<P>
Some 764,000 people have died since 1984 when the virus was
first detected in the east African country, the health minister
said.
</P>
<P>
There are 800,000 children orphaned by AIDS and one quarter of
them are also HIV positive, Ongeri noted.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS pandemic was declared as the national disaster by
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi in late November just before the
International AIDS Day which falls on December 1.

<HEADLINE> Macao Return to China Marked in Wellington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to New
Zealand Chen Wenzhao and his wife gave a reception here Tuesday in
celebration of Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 guests attended the reception. They included Phil
Goff, minister of foreign affairs and trade and also minister of
justice of the new government; Don McKinnon, former minister of
foreign affairs and trade; members of the new parliament; and
representatives from the New Zealand-China Friendship Society,
local overseas Chinese organizations and Chinese students here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception, Ambassador Chen noted that Macao's
return to the motherland is another big step forward in the
Chinese people's great cause of national reunification after Hong
Kong's return in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is because of Deng Xiaoping's creative concept of "one
country, two systems" that the issues of Hong Kong and Macao have
been solved satisfactorily within this century, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said 1999 has also witnessed all-round
development of the China-New Zealand relations highlighted by the
exchange of visits by leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work with the new government of New Zealand
headed by its Prime Minister Helen Clark for more dynamic
bilateral relations between the two countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister Goff said in his speech that there is "a good deal of
drama and emotion in that solemn moment when the flag of one
country is lowered, and the new flag is raised. Looking back more
than two years, the world watched as china's flag rose over Hong
Kong. There was intense interest at that time in the way the 'one
country, two systems' formula would be put into practice. Today,
Hong Kong thrives as a special administrative region."
</P>
<P>
"I trust that Macao's transition to a special administrative
region will bring in a new era," Goff stressed.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his speech, the minister expressed his hope that New
Zealand and China would keep their close and friendly relationship
growing in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has resumed development funding to Kenya after eight
years of suspension, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi told his
ruling Kenya African National Unity Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are working together with the institution," the East
African Standard newspaper Tuesday quoted Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president urged his fellow Kenyans to eradicate corruption
in a bid to win confidence from the international community.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be accountable and transparent in our public
affairs," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans have to upheld unity and stability and then the World
Bank and IMF will grant more funds to Kenya, he said.
</P>
<P>
IMF will restart talks with Kenya next January on a
205-million-U.S. dollar loan for structural adjustment in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The financial organization suspended the loan project in July
1997 in protest against poor governance and corruption in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been in the economic doldrums partly due to lack of
funds in the past several years.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Sell Mines to Canadian Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will sell two of its
biggest copper mines to a Canadian company, bringing the
privatization of its mines closer to completion, the Zambia Daily
Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
First Quantum Mining of Canada will buy Zambia's Nkana and
Mufulira Division, the Canadian mining company said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the company Philip Pascal said that final deal is
subject to a successful conclusion of the negotiations and
execution of a definitive agreement with the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
The Nkana assets comprise the mining operation, concentrator
and cobalt plant while the Mufulira assets consist of mining
operation, concentrator, smelter and refinery, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Only one week ago, Zambia signed an agreement on the sale of
another three big mines to Anglo-American Consortium.
</P>
<P>
Copper mining accounts for about 80 percent of the country's
total export earnings, and its peak annual copper output hit
700,000 tons in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
However, due to copper price falls in the international market
and outdated equipment, lack of new investment and mismanagement,
Zambia's annual copper output has decreased to 300,000 tons in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
To revive the mining sector, the Zambian government started to
privatize ZCCM assets a few years ago to attract foreign
investment and advanced technology and management.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angolan Govt. Wins Battle, Not yet War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi suffered a major defeat
in the government's all-out offensive in recent months, he did not
even consider surrendering after 25 years of civil war with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi's forces have turned into small groups of armed
bandits and are still active in the mountainous areas, which are
almost out of reach of the government forces. There are still
possibilities for the smashed rebels to build new bases in remote
areas or even in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The government Army Chief of General Staff Joao de Matos said,
"the war is not over yet, our actions are continuing."
</P>
<P>
The government has reinforced its troops in the provinces
bordering with Zambia, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) to prevent the rebels from fleeing the country.
</P>
<P>
While enhancing military actions, the Angolan government has
strengthened diplomatic efforts to isolate UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Angola is urging Zambia to stop providing logistic support for
Savimbi troops, persuading Cote d'Ivoire to revoke Savimbi and his
followers passports and also asked help from the Zimbabwean troops
stationed in DRC to cut off the rebels retreat in neighboring DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has mended its ties with the regional
power South Africa by supporting the latter to play a leading role
in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). South Africa
has promised to abandon its support for the UNITA and implement
the UN sanctions against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Since the government has got an upper hand in the battle field
from mid September, the United States has changed its attitude
toward Angolan civil war and thrown its weight behind the
government forces and agreed to tighten sanctions against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to the war-torn country Joseph Sullivan said
recently, " peace in Angola can be expected soon."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has made progress in the battle field.
If the government can gain over-all support from the international
community, especially from its neighbors, peace and stability in
the poor country can be expected soon, but a total victory of the
government is still not in sight, observers believe.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Current Account Deficit Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's current
account deficit in the year to September was 6.6 billion NZ
dollars (3.35 billion U.S. dollars), which accounted for about
seven percent of its annual gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Although the figure released here Tuesday by Government
Statistician Len Cook was 1.6 billion NZ dollars more than a year
ago, it was slightly better than expected. But it still shows a
trend that will worry the NZ Government, overseas investors and
international credit rating agencies.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a brief period in 1997, the deficit has been growing
steadily since 1993, driven by a growing demand for imports. New
Zealanders have been spending heavily on imported goods,
especially on cars for which tariffs were removed last year. At
the same time, exports are growing but not as strongly as imports.
</P>
<P>
The growing deficit comes as New Zealand's economy shows signs
of recovery. But what the current account figures show is that the
recovery is led by import spending. This makes the recovery
precarious and means New Zealand is more vulnerable to any
international downturn.
</P>
<P>
International rating agency Standard and Poor's has had New
Zealand on negative credit watch since September 1998. If New
Zealand's credit rating is downgraded interest rates will rise and
overseas investment could fall because New Zealand would be seen
as a more risky place in which to invest or lend money.

<HEADLINE> NZ Govt's Policy Program for Next 3 years Outlined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Governor-
General Sir Michael Hardie Boys spelled out the New Zealand
coalition government's policy program for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government was formed by the New Zealand Labor
Party and the Alliance earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In a speech from the throne, Sir Michael said the NZ economy
suffers from major structural problems and New Zealand is still
too reliant on producing and exporting commodities.
</P>
<P>
"My Government recognizes that simply relying upon market
forces will not deliver these changes. A new partnership needs to
be built with business and local communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"State asset sales will stop. Treasury has been instructed to
cease all work on options for implementing such a program," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sir Michael said the floor for NZ superannuation will be
restored to 65 percent of the average wage and measures to improve
private savings will be considered as part of a wider tax review.
</P>
<P>
"More efforts will be put into increasing investment in
research and development, including establishing a more favorable
tax regime," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the new Government will introduce quotas to ensure
local content on radio and free-to-air television and will
strongly support New Zealand artists.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, environmental changes will include higher
standards of waste management, tougher rules on greenhouse gases,
stopping logging of native forests and a higher priority for
protecting threatened species and plants.
</P>
<P>
On national defense, Sir Michael called for a reanalysis of
defense plans. he said a third ANZAC frigate from Australia will
not be purchased and the recent contract to acquire 28 F-16s from
the United States will be reviewed to determine whether it can be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
The governor-general noted that the New Zealand Government
recognizes the Treaty of Waitangi as New Zealand's founding
document and is committed to closing the gaps between Maori and
non-Maori.

<HEADLINE> Flamengo Wins Copa Mercosur Soccer Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Flamengo won the title of
Copa Mercosur soccer tournament on Monday, drawing 3-3 away to
Palmeiras in a thrilling finale in Sao Paulo to South America's
youngest cup competition.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Le scored the title winning goal in the 84th minute,
less than ten minutes after coming on in the second leg of the all-
Brazilian final.
</P>
<P>
Flamengo's 4-3 first leg victory meant Palmeiras needed to win
to take the tie, decided on results rather than goal aggregate, to
a third match.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras seemed to be comfortably on their way when a penalty
by Francisco Arce gave them a halftime lead which reflected their
first-half dominance.
</P>
<P>
But Flamengo stunned the home crowd after the break, turning
the game around with goals by Caio and Rodrigo Mendes in a ten-
minute spell.
</P>
<P>
Palmeiras hit back immediately. Within a minute of Mendes' goal,
Arce scored again and Paulo Nunes then headed Palmeiras into a 3-2
lead. But Le levelled the score six minutes from the end.
</P>
<P>
Flamengo won the title, their first in an international
competition since 1981, despite selling top striker Romario to
rivals Vasco da Gama last month.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur is a made-for-television event featuring 20 of
South America's biggest clubs, who take part by invitation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Aims 5.6 Billion U.S. Dollars From Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
targeted foreign exchange revenues from tourism sector in 2000 for
5.6 billion U.S. dollars, an official said.
</P>
<P>
"The government targets foreign exchange revenues from tourism
sector for 5.6 billion U.S. dollars at the lowest and 6.3 billion
U.S. dollars at the highest in 2000," said Acep Hidayat, chief of
the Human Resources Development and Technology Section at the
Ministry of Tourism and Art.
</P>
<P>
He said the target was predicted to be reached from the foreign
tourist visit which is expected to attain 5.4 million to 6 million
next year.
</P>
<P>
"The government will improve tourism facilities and its
services to boost tourism businesses. We will also intensify
tourism promotion," he was quoted by the Bisnis Indonesia daily
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hidayat added that security affairs was an important element to
boost tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the foreign exchange revenues from
tourism sector in 2003/2004 would replace oil and gas as the main
income resources for the national state budget.
</P>
<P>
However Hidayat didn't disclose the number of domestic tourist
which is also expected to participate to meet government revenues
target from tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Hidayat said that foreign exchange revenues from tourist sector
in 1999 (January-October) reached 3.05 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign tourist visit to Indonesia has sharply
declined over the past two years after the country fell into
deepest economic and financial crisis which was then followed by
communal clashes and riots.
</P>
<P>
Many travel bureau had halted their plans to visit Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
But now, after the new government was elected, the situation
was becoming much better, and foreign tourist visit is expected to
be normal and even to increase.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Internet Securities Trading Boom Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Online securities trading
by private investors in Asia-Pacific markets will account for at
least 20 percent of all retail equity market transactions in the
region by 2003, a U.S. market research firm predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to the study of Dataquest, a subordinate of
the world's premier technology advisor GartnerGroup, 70 percent of
retail brokerages headquartered in Asia-Pacific will offer real-
time Asian stock market trading facilities via secure web sites by
2002. Through 2002, however, less than 50 percent of banks based
in the region will be able to leverage their Internet banking
systems to succeed in consumer electronic commerce services.
</P>
<P>
Financial services organizations in the region's leading
markets will be required to handle unprecedented retail
transaction volumes over the Internet in the next five years, the
research firm said.
</P>
<P>
According to Dataquest, the markets of Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan will be home to the bulk of Web-based securities traders
and online retail banking customers for at least the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the emerging markets in the region, including India
and Malaysia will continue to face online securities trading and
personal e-banking obstacles caused by regulatory hurdles and the
lack of an Internet-concerned infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Because of the sheer demand for securities trading over the Web,
Dataquest said, most Asian brokers will shift their retail
business to the Internet over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
As in North America, many brokerage customers in the region may
abandon traditional broker intermediaries when they realize the
power and competitive pricing of direct global market access
through Internet trading.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Government is making more efforts to
building Hong Kong into an innovation and technology center of the
21st century, a senior Hong Kong official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the "Hong Kong - Building a Technology Frontier"
forum sponsored by Hong Kong Young Entrepreneurs Development
Council, Secretary for Trade and Industry Chau Tak Hay said Hong
Kong "has to do more" if it wants to keep its competitive edge in
the innovation and technology field.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the government is launching a range of programs to
offer support in the sector, including the planned merging of
Science Park, the Industrial Estates Corporation and the
Industrial Technology Center Corporation, according to Chau.
</P>
<P>
The government established the Innovation and Technology Fund
in July this year with an initial injection of 5 billion HK
dollars (641 million U.S. dollars) to support projects that
contribute to innovation and technological upgrading of Hong Kong'
s industries, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Since the majority of enterprises in Hong Kong are small and
medium sized, the  government also introduced the Small
Entrepreneur Research Assistance Scheme to help these enterprises
develop innovative concepts or produce prototypes, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Scheme, qualified projects will be given a grant of
not exceeding 2 million HK dollars (256,410 U.S. dollars), Chau
said, adding that the government is hoping the Scheme will help
cultivate a vibrant spirit of technological entrepreneurship among
the "budding companies".

<HEADLINE> China Plans for More Communications Infrastructure Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China's road infrastructure
spending for 2000 is likely to stay on balance with this year's
budget of 180 billion yuan (2.17 billion US dollars), according to
sources with an international symposium on China's infrastructure
reform.
</P>
<P>
The 100-plus attending officials from the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC) and the Ministry of Communications and
experts from both at home and overseas held in-depth discussions
on the development of China's communications infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It proposed that by the year 2020, investment for railway
construction will amount to 357 billion yuan (43 billion US
dollars) and a big chunk of communications expenditure will be
appropriated to improve and upgrade airport facilities in the
country's central and western region.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zixiang, a senior research fellow with the Macro-Economic
Research Institute under the SDPC, noted that China's
communications infrastructure investment last year amounted to
some 300 billion yuan (36 billion US dollars), or 25 percent of
the country's total infrastructure spending and equaled the total
for the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
The money for railway construction has come mainly from the
fund designated for railway construction and loans from state-
owned banks. As a matter of fact, the investment for railway and
aviation industries relies on the state funding and bank loans,
and some airport projects have also introduced investment from
overseas.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Grows by 7.7 Percent in 3rd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy grew by 7.7
percent in the third quarter this year, the highest quarterly
growth recorded in four years, the Bangkok Post quoted the
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) of Thailand
as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure fans expectations that the economy may expand by 4.1
percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The last time the economy grew as fast was in the third quarter
of 1995, when the gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 9.7
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
For the next year, the NESDB forecast that GDP would grow by 4.
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figure is based on the projected export growth of 6.5
percent to 6.7 percent, an import increase of 14.3 percent,
inflation of two percent and a current account surplus of six
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
NESDB Secretary-General Sansern Wongcha-um said the growth rate
in the last quarter this year would likely be lower when compared
with the third quarter's figure, as the economy had started to
pick up during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB forecast GDP growth for the fourth quarter this year
would be around four percent year-on-year, thus, growth for the
whole year would be 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the large percentage of growth in the third quarter
may be distorted because of a low base, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the same quarter last year, the economy had hit rock
bottom and contracted by a record of 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, growth this year was not distributed evenly across the
board as the agriculture, construction and financial service
sectors continue to contract.
</P>
<P>
While the three sectors continued to slump during the first
nine months of this year, six other key economic sectors,
manufacturing, mining and quarrying, electricity and water
supplies, the whole sale and retail, hotel and restaurant and the
transport and communications, expanded favorably.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector grew sharply by 17.4 percent, mainly
attributed to the 49.7 percent growth of the food and drink sector,
the 139.5 percent rise of the automobile sector and the 32.5
percent increase of the non-metallic product sector.
</P>
<P>
As the key sector used in measuring public consumption, the
whole sale and retail trade grew by 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the three contracting sectors, agriculture was the least
worrying as it declined by only 0.2 percent, due mainly to a drop
in the production of crops and agricultural services.

<HEADLINE> 70 Percent of Banks in Bangladesh Lack Capital Adequacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank Deputy Governor
Ibrahim Khaled Monday disclosed that about 70 percent of banks in
the country are not maintaining their capital adequacy.
</P>
<P>
The daily Financial Express Tuesday quoted Khaled as saying
that the country's banking system would sustain at the existing
level at the beginning of the new century despite increasing
globalization of the financial system across the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dialogue on "Bangladesh in the New Century" held
here, Khaled said that the country's traditional banking system
would not see any major qualitative change in the first decade of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
There has been some pressure on the central bank to allow more
foreign banks to operate in Bangladesh, he said, adding that the
country is still resisting the pressure, "but ultimately we'd have
to allow new foreign banks in coming years."
</P>
<P>
The central bank deputy governor said the problem in the
banking sector is not resources, but the management. The model for
the next-century banks would be small bank with limited branches,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Prominent economists, bankers, researchers and lawyers of the
country attended the dialogue which was jointly organized by The
Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies and a local daily
newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is generally ready
for the millennium bug as major transport, banking, utility and
communication systems are Y2K-compliant, Transport Minister Agum
Gumelar said.
</P>
<P>
"If there is news that Indonesia is still unprepared, this
certification shows our readiness to the public," Agum, who is
also the chief of Indonesia's Y2K team, said when presenting Y2K-
compliant certificates to 22 government agencies and private
companies.

Accountancy agency and Koja Container Terminal.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K bug is a problem that is predicted to strike many
computer systems in the year 2000. Computer chips that have not
been updated could mistake "00" as 1900. The error could create
problems ranging from power outages to billing errors.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chairman of Indonesia's Y2K team J.B. Kristiadi said in
spite of its confidence, the government had established a national
alert post to monitor six areas deemed as particularly critical to
public services.
</P>
<P>
The areas are: air traffic controls at the country's airports,
the entire banking transaction system, the telephone system, power
management, road and rail signaling system and gasoline supply.
</P>
<P>
The alert post will be monitoring events at the turn of the
millennium on December 31 and on the first days of the New Year.
</P>
<P>
"If something does go wrong and affects the whole country, the
alert post will run contingency plans and have full authority to
act on behalf of the government, Djamhari Sirat, who heads the
post, was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Lodges Protest Against Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 20 (Xinhua) --- Nicaragua lodged a protest
Monday with Honduras' Foreign Ministry against its publishing of
a map of Nicaragua, Foreign Minister Eduardo Montealegre said.
</P>
<P>
Montealegre said the map "goes against Nicaragua's sovereignty.
"
</P>
<P>
The newspaper El Nuevo Diario said that in the map, Nicaraguan
land between the Atlantic zone of Jinotega and Gracias a Dios on
the Caribbean coast is "swallowed." Besides, Rio Coco, which
serves as the border demarcation between the two countries, is
made to lie within Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry also sent a letter to the
Customs General Headquarters to prevent the map from entering
Nicaragua, he added.
</P>
<P>
Montealegre also said Nicaragua will hold a direct dialog with
Honduras this week in the United States, proposed by Luigi Einaudi,
special envoy of the Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
The meeting "has nothing to do with the border question," he
said, but will discuss the alternative to prevent "a possible
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Honduras and Nicaragua have remained tense
since on November 30 when Honduran Congress ratified a sea
delimitation treaty signed with Colombia in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Managua said the treaty cuts off 130,000 square kilometers from
its continental platform in the Caribbean Sea, and has presented a
demand against Honduras before the International Court of Justice
at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the presidents of Nicaragua and Honduras will sign an
accord to reduce tension," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry denied Nicaragua has moved troops to the
border area with Honduras, and reiterated his country hopes to
solve conflicts with Honduras before the Hague Court and through
diplomatic means.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Female Weightlifters to Concentrate on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Four Indonesian women
weightlifters will likely miss the 15th National Games (PON) in
Surabaya in June due to their training program for the 2000
Olympics in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Weightlifting, Powerlifting and Bodybuilding
Association (PABBSI) secretary general Djoko Pramono said he would
still have to discuss with national coach Imron Rosadi if the four
lifter would be allowed to represent their respective provinces at
PON.
</P>
<P>
The Weightlifters are Sri Indriyani, Lisa Rumbewas, Winarni and
Supeni.
</P>
<P>
Djoko said the National Sports Council (KONI) had sent
notification to PABBSI urging them to be responsible for any
injuries sustained by athletes at PON that might spoil their
chances of competing at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We have to focus on the bigger target. The Olympics is the
biggest sports event in the world, so we have to skip the smaller
event in order to reach our goal. I can't forbid or allow them to
compete in PON because I will discuss it with Imron first," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Djoko said PABBSI was hoping the lifters win Olympics medals.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has three tickets to the Olympics after finishing
eighth at the World Weightlifting Championship in Athens, with one
gold and four silver medals.
</P>
<P>
The International Weightlifting Federation rules state
competitors who are ranked between seventh and ninth at the
championship earn three tickets to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Djoko said the centralized training program for the women
lifters would start on January 1.
</P>
<P>
"They will train with their respective coaches. In June, the
training will be centralized in Lampung with Imron as the coach,"
he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- China has an edge with the
World Trade Organization (WTO) no matter when it joins the
international trade group, because its newest special
administrative region, Macao, is already a member of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Macao has advantages in market entry, anti-dumping policies,
telecommunications, financial and insurance services," China Daily
quoted An Min, today's China Daily quoted An Min, an assistant
minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-
operation (MOFTEC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that China's entry into WTO will mean more business
opportunities for Macao and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Macao and Hong Kong businesses have gained valuable experience
through years of operation on the mainland, An Min said. They are
also familiar with international trade rules. Therefore, they will
have more development opportunities after the mainland joins "WTO".
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the mainland's economic activities will
adhere to international rules and practices once China joins WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Companies from Macao and Hong Kong can be at ease. There will
be no interference with their trade and investment activities on
the mainland," An said.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that mainland-invested companies will continue
to be an important force in Macao's long-term economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has placed great importance on the
function that mainland-invested enterprises play in Macao's
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he encouraged Macao businesses to participate in the
mainland's reform of State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign businesses are allowed to take over and annex small
and medium-sized enterprises on the mainland; this, to a certain
extent, helps expand the co-operation between Macao and the
mainland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade statistics show that as of the end of October 6,384
projects with direct investment from Macao have been established
on the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Bank Launches Healthy Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 21 (Xinhua) -- Bank loans to pay for medical
treatment are being offered in China for the first time. Shanghai'
s Pudong Development Bank (SPDB) officially launched the
individual medical loans last week.
</P>
<P>
So far, they only cover a limited medical treatment at a small
number of hospitals, but the bank plans to extend the scheme to
other medical conditions and hospitals in the future, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move marks the start of financial institutions' efforts to
further tap the city's individual loans market and is being seen
as a major breakthrough in this area.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that it will also help increase domestic
demand thus fueling the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The scheme allows an individual in Shanghai to apply for a 2000,
000 (2,400 U.S. dollars) loan from SPDB's Lujiazui branch if they
need financial aid to treat eye problems. An agreement has been
signed between the bank and three major hospitals in Shanghai,
including the No. 7 People's Hospital, Xinhua Hospital and
Dongfang Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"Facing the present fierce market competition, the domestic
banking sectors should put more effort into serving the needs of
individual customers rather than just enterprise customers," SPDB
Vice-governor Huang Jianping said.
</P>
<P>
Huang said banks should make the most of their own advantages,
their good understanding of local markets and comparatively
advance retail network, to tap the market, which is set to be very
promising as the economy grows.
</P>
<P>
The bank has already launched many loan projects for
individuals this year, including commercial housing loans, car
loans, travel-assistance loans, education-assistance loans and
loans for study overseas.
</P>
<P>
Huang said a total of 60 candidates had been granted the
overseas education-assistance loans by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
Some problems still exist, however, Huang said, adding that
the application procedures are too complicated due to the banks'
fear of possible financial risks.

MADRID, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Two-times world marathon
champion Abel Anton of Spain will run his one and only marathon

<P>
"Now all the fiestas and award ceremonies have to stop and it

London Marathon in which he has raced for the last two years and
won in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Everything I am doing is focused on the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old runner has European and world titles to show
for a long career in the sport but an Olympic medal is missing
from his collection.

ceasing of hostilities, from midnight Monday and for at least
until next January 10", said the head of state.
</P>
<P>
According to the leader, the decision of Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) is a gesture that Colombians have asked
for with insistence and is valued for all its importance.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully this will be the beginning of a change of attitude
humanizing confrontation and easing the way to dialog", said
Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
The president also exhorted other guerrilla groups and, in
general, all factors generating violence, " a similar position is
adopted, allowing Colombians to enter the new millennium in a
climate of tranquillity".
</P>
<P>
Monday morning FARC let know their ceasefire through a
communique from the guerrilla's general secretary read at the
distension zone in south Colombia by Raul Reyes, one of this
organization's spokesmen for talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
People in Colombia, a country slumped in civil war, are hoping
for peace, since thousands have dead in a three-decades conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Monday as investors were worried about a change to a "
tightening" bias in the monetary policy, which could be followed
by another hike in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 113.16 at 11,144.
27. The blue chip index rose 12.54 points Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index fell 2.94 at 1,418.09 but the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 30.81 at 3,783.87, surpassing the record
closing high of 3,753.06 points set in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The broad market moved down as bond prices fell, pushing the
yield on 30 year Treasury bond to 6.44 percent today from 6.37
percent Friday. Investors worried that the Federal Reserve will
make a change to "tightening " bias on interest rates Tuesday
while leaving rates alone at the last policy-making meeting of
this year, which means another rate hike on any future sign of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates three times this year to
cool the U.S. economy in efforts to ward off inflation. But
spending by U.S. consumers and business has not slowed.

<HEADLINE> Ferrari F-1 Cars to Use Aerospace Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Ferrari's Formula One
team is to benefit from cutting-edge aerospace technology
developed by Finmeccanica, the Italian engineering conglomerate
with a long experience in planes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari and Finmeccanica Monday signed a collaboration accord
which renews and widens an agreement which first signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We will give Ferrari a hand to beat its competitors," said
Alberto Lina, managing director of Finmeccanica, which has pledged
to make available its expertise in aerodynamics and chassis
materials.
</P>
<P>
Finmeccanica includes three companies whose research and
development activity is expected to be of use to Ferrari: Alenia,
which makes planes and has a stake in the new Eurofighter project;
Agusta, which makes helicopters; and Aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
"Formula One cars are planes turned upside down," commented
Ferrari Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo.
</P>
<P>
"There's more aerospace technology than automobile technology
involved," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Formula One is one of the most competitive fields there are,"
he continued.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we choose the best possible partners to beat strong
adversaries from England, Germany, France and Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Technical experts from both companies explained how
collaboration over the last two years had already altered the
transmission system in Ferrari's Formula One cars.
</P>
<P>
By adjusting it according to aerospatial criteria, the two
teams of technicians were able to come up with a gear system which
was lighter, faster and more reliable, they explained.
</P>
<P>
In return for this help, Ferrari is also to offer technical
assistance but more importantly it will allow its name to be used
in connection with Finmeccanica when the group begins looking for
investors next year.
</P>
<P>
Finmeccanica, currently 80 percent-owned by the Italian
government, is to sell of 50 percent of its share capital in a
partial privatization by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Because our sector is such a difficult one to explain to be
people, being associated with Ferrari will be very useful when it
comes to make ourselves known to hundreds of thousands of
investors," said Managing Director Lina.

<HEADLINE> Panama Recalls 10 Years of U.S. Military Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Relatives of Panamanian
civilians and soldiers killed during the American invasion of
December 20 recalled Monday their loved ones with different
commemorating events.
</P>
<P>
The president of Relatives of Those Fallen on December 20, 1989,
Sebastian Vergara, described Monday as "massacre" and "genocide" U.
S. military intervention that provoked thousands dead or missing
in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Human rights organizations speak of 7,000 Panamanians killed,
while the invading Army says that there were 260 Panamanian
victims and 23 American.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the U.S. government sent over 26,000 soldiers
under the pretext of capturing ex-Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega, accused of drug trafficking and money laundry in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ten years after this sad happening, Vergara said that up till
now justice hasn't been made to the invasion's victims.
</P>
<P>
"We ourselves, faithful to norms of international rights, have
filed a demand before the Inter American Commission of Human
Rights of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the
finality of the U.S. indemnifying the offspring of those who fell,
" said Vergara.
</P>
<P>
"We have to denounce before all the world that what happened in
Panama that fateful night of December 20 was a massacre and a
genocide against a defenseless nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the U.S. military intervention, combat planes bombed El
Chorrillo district, where hundreds of civilians, women and
children were perished or burned, and houses, some wooden ,were
totally incinerated.
</P>
<P>
Before the devastation of the powerful U.S. war machinery,
General Noriega gave himself up to the invading forces and is
currently in jail in Miami city, where he is serving a term of 30
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Among activities programmed for Monday, relatives of the
victims of the invasion organized a service in the cemetery "
Garden of Peace", where lie buried some of those fallen on
December 20.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Hits Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Much of Italy was plunged into
bad weather emergency Monday as winds gusting as high as 135km per
hour at the city of Trieste and snow storms swept the country.
</P>
<P>
In mud-slides and floods sparked by heavy rain in the mountains
behind Naples last Thursday, six died in the small town of
Cervinara.
</P>
<P>
No deaths were yet reported from Monday's storms and gales, but
winds recorded at 130km/h ripped up the northwest and central
coast, whipping away the roof of one apartment building in central
city of Livorno and forcing the evacuation of sixteen families.
</P>
<P>
In Olbia, island of Sardinia, a boat split open one side as it
tied up and heavy seas threw it against the quay, while winds of
120km per hour and force seven seas stopped ferries from Sardinia
from putting in at the port of Civitavecchia, near Rome.
</P>
<P>
In the same city, roads were closed as the wind scattered tiles
and cornices collapsed, fortunately without causing any victims.
</P>
<P>
But the sternest warning of the Christmas season was the snow
that fell in central Italy, from Emilio-Romagna and the Marche to
Umbria, Tuscany and northern Lazio.
</P>
<P>
Snow chains were made obligatory for all vehicles using the
stretch in the early afternoon, and traffic was slowed to a snail'
s crawl.
</P>
<P>
Also in central Italy, high winds blew cars off the road and
ripped roofs off homes.
</P>
<P>
The high parts of central region of Umbria were especially hard
hit, in areas where many are still housed in containers after the
earthquakes on September 26, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Most U.S. 911 Call Centers Y2K ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 98.5 percent of
the 911 emergency call centers in the United States have reported
that their equipment is now Y2K ready, according to a latest
survey from the National Emergency Number Association.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the 911 call centers reported that once the date
changes, they can continue to provide enhanced services, like
pinpointing where a person is calling from, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
An earlier White House report on Y2K preparedness said that
only half of America's 911 call centers had confirmed that they
were ready.
</P>
<P>
Public safety officials said 911 call centers have stepped up
both their Y2K compliance and reporting efforts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Department's Office of Overseas Citizen
Services announced Monday that U.S. embassies abroad will stop
issuing non-immigrant visas for the first two working days of the
new year and stop issuing immigrant visas for the first two weeks.
</P>
<P>
District of Columbia officials also said Monday that thousands
of officers will be on duty in New Year's weekend to tighten
security measures.
