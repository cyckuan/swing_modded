<HEADLINE> Boxing Federation Is Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- One of boxing's three major sanctioning  
organizations is being investigated by a federal grand jury 
examining whether it sold rankings and arranged fights in return 
for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Lee, president of the International Boxing Federation,  
denied the allegations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than yearlong probe by the U.S. attorney's office in  
Newark focuses on the IBF and has so far led to subpoenas demanding 
financial records from promoters, a source familiar with the 
investigation told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments were made by fighter managers, sometimes disguised  
as consulting fees, to promoters and sanctioning groups, according 
to unnamed sources cited by The Star-Ledger of Newark, which 
disclosed the investigation in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office, citing Justice  
Department policy, declined to confirm or deny the existence of 
such an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF, based in nearby East Orange, also came under scrutiny  
this week from law enforcement agencies in New York following the 
controversial draw in the March 13 heavyweight championship bout 
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. Of the three judges, 
only the IBF-picked judge had Holyfield winning the fight many 
believed Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctioning groups -- the IBF, World Boxing Association and  
World Boxing Council -- by their rules and rankings, play a large 
role in determining whom a boxer fights. Boxers who defy the groups 
risk losing the chance to be declared a champion and earn large 
purses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done nothing improper. And we'll let the facts be  
brought out by the committee investigating and we'll respond to 
them,'' Lee said Thursday. He said he had not been called to 
testify before the grand jury, but declined extensive comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee had told The Star-Ledger, however, that the grand jury has  
begun calling witnesses. The probe was aimed at ``investigating 
mostly boxing overall'' and how the IBF ``approves fights and ranks 
fighters,'' he told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was no secret to the boxing world, said lawyer  
Patrick English, who regularly represents boxing promoter Dino Duva 
and his Main Events company in northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a big thing for a while,'' English said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit he filed against the IBF in 1996 on behalf of one-time  
heavyweight champion Michael Moorer raised similar corruption 
allegations. It was settled for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	English said neither he nor his clients have been subpoenaed and  
is unsure if his lawsuit sparked the federal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think so, but I don't know. I don't think this is the  
only complaint they ever got,'' English said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is a former New Jersey boxing commissioner removed from  
office in 1985 after a state panel ruled he violated ethics 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The current commissioner, Larry Hazzard Sr., said the state  
Athletic Control Board has no authority over sanctioning 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	It does regulate boxing promoters, however, and Hazzard said  
that if a promoter told him that he was being shaken down by a 
sanctioning body, Hazzard would report that to law officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the way, no one has ever come to me with a complaint like  
that,'' Hazzard said.

<HEADLINE>  Albanians Sign Deal, Serbs Refuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The ethnic Albanian delegation at the Kosovo peace  
talks unilaterally signed a U.S.-sponsored peace accord today. But 
the Serbs still refused to sign the deal, and the talks appeared 
headed toward collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo Albanian delegation said it was leaving after the  
signing with some members heading to Brussels, Belgium, site of 
NATO's headquarters, some to Washington and others to Kosovo, where 
Yugoslav forces were massing and NATO has threatened airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	It remained unclear whether this second round of talks would be  
suspended or ended completely. There were signs the Serbs would be 
given a few days to consider their position. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement is there now,'' chief talks spokesman Phil  
Reeker told The Associated Press. ``We are waiting for the Serbs to 
do the same thing, to take a step for peace and a future for 
Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first round ended inconclusively in Rambouillet, France,  
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-chairs of the talks, French Foreign Minister Hubert  
Vedrine and his British counterpart, Robin Cook, are to be briefed 
by mediators later today, France's Foreign Ministry said. Then they 
will report to the rest of the six-nation Contact Group that is 
sponsoring the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on the future of the peace conference was expected  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting has claimed more than 2,000 lives in the past year in  
Kosovo, a province of Serbia and the dominant of two remaining 
republics comprising Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes amid renewed  
fighting in recent weeks. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2.2 million 
people are ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In a low-key ceremony, the ethnic Albanians inked the accord at  
the Paris conference center near the Arc de Triomphe where the 
talks have been held. It was also signed by two of the three 
mediators -- Christopher Hill of the United States and Wolfgang 
Petritsch of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Russian mediator, Boris Mayorsky, did not sign. Russia  
is an ally of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, although today 
the Russian foreign minister urged Milosevic to give in and sign 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs have said a unilateral signing is meaningless.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in a phone  
call to the ethnic Albanians, praised their decision to sign and 
asked that they ``stay unified,'' said State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The signing by the Kosovo Albanians in the face of continued  
Serb intransigence makes it clear that nothing more can be done 
here,'' Rubin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs are refusing to make a decision for peace. There are  
consequences to that situation that NATO officials have spoken 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin was referring to the threat of NATO strikes at Serbian  
targets -- a threat that so far has failed to spur Milosevic into 
accepting a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs adamantly refuse to allow a NATO-led force into Kosovo  
to police an accord, a key element of the peace plan that mediators 
insist is inseparable from the political part. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few days, the Serbs also have raised objections to  
the political part, which sets the terms for broad autonomy that 
would be granted to the ethnic Albanians but keeps Kosovo within 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo Albanians finally agreed to sign the deal earlier  
this week, although it denies them the independence they seek. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's official news agency, Tanjug, assailed the Paris  
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been no real talks or dialogue in Paris, just  
threats and pressure,'' the agency said. It said the signing by the 
ethnic Albanians alone is meaningless ``because there is no 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, arrived today in  
Macedonia to visit the alliance's fast-growing contingent of 
troops. The peace proposal calls for enforcement by 28,000 NATO 
troops --including 4,000 from the United States. About 12,000 troops 
have been assembled in Macedonia so far this month. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Wednesday that Milosevic also should realize NATO is  
ready to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's top military commanders warned during Senate  
hearings today that NATO airstrikes could bring heavy U.S. 
casualties because Yugoslav air defenses are sophisticated and dug 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in  
trying to penetrate those defenses,'' said Gen. Michael Ryan, the 
Air Force chief of staff.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Eyes Endangered Carcass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Smithsonian Institution was happy to  
accept $20 million from former NFL team owner Kenneth E. Behring 
and would like to take a more controversial gift from him as well -- 
the remains of one of the world's most endangered animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithsonian scientists have asked for a waiver to the Endangered  
Species Act to import the carcass of a bighorn sheep that Behring 
shot on a 1997 big game hunting trip in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's premier public museum complex is thus doing a favor  
for its leading donor by lending his trophy hunting the legitimacy 
of scientific research, the Humane Society of the United States 
charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheep, known as the Kara-Tau argali, would be added to the  
120 million specimens in the Smithsonian's National Museum of 
Natural History. Behring's $20 million donation will go in large 
part to renovate that museum, and its main mammal exhibit hall will 
be renamed in his honor this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Natural History Museum is giving this guy a credible  
defense for an activity that is repugnant and counter to any 
sensible principle of conservation,'' Humane Society vice president 
Wayne Pacelle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just nonsense,'' countered Robert W. Fri, director of  
the Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sheep is a very rare creature, and is therefore very rare  
in museum collections,'' Fri said. ``Museums are in the scientific 
business of maintaining life on Earth,'' and will seek rare items 
when they properly can, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 100 of the Kara-Tau animals remain in the wild,  
Russian scientists estimate. Behring noted in a statement issued 
through a spokesman that Russian scientists accompanied his hunting 
party to do field research on the animal and that he had a valid 
hunting permit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was certainly not encouraged by any museum to hunt them or  
offer them the specimens or donate the specimens to any museum,'' 
Behring said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while it was legal to kill the sheep, Behring could not get  
the creature into the country without the Smithsonian's help, 
Pacelle charged. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks after the hunting trip, the Smithsonian announced  
the $20 million gift from Behring, former owner of the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no connection,'' Fri said. He denied the museum is  
doing Behring any favors, and said Behring has not asked for any 
special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Humane Society maintains that Behring is using the  
museum to burnish his image as an accomplished game hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's even more prestigious for him to have this trophy  
exhibited in the Smithsonian's hall, with that hall named after 
him, than to have it in his personal collection in his home,'' 
Pacelle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Museum spokesman Randall Kremer said the animal would only be  
used for research and would not be displayed for the public at all. 
Visitors to the renamed hall will have no idea that Behring gave 
the Kara-Tau or any other specimen to the museum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fri said that to avoid an appearance of impropriety, he  
stipulated at the time of the donation in November 1997 that the 
museum not accept any specimens from Behring ``that were alive as 
of November'' of that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kara-Tau and other animals shot on the same trip were  
already dead. 
</P>
<P>
	At the moment, the argument over the Kara-Tau is academic  
because the carcass is in limbo in a Canadian taxidermy shop. The 
Fish and Wildlife Service has not granted the Smithsonian's 
request, in part because it requested additional documentation from 
the animal's native Kazakstan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kremer said the museum is trying to get the requested material.  
</P>
<P>
	If the Smithsonian does not want the sheep and other animals, or  
cannot win the necessary waiver, Behring plans to donate the 
animals to a Spanish museum.

<HEADLINE> IOC Approves Reform Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Despite pressure for independent  
oversight, the International Olympics Committee president said he 
will control the reform process himself -- drawing a stinging attack 
from a powerful U.S. critic. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the unprecedented expulsion of six members in the  
Salt Lake City bribery scandal, the IOC on Thursday approved a 
change in the selection process for the 2006 Winter Games and 
created special commissions to police its members and reform 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steps that we have taken send a very clear message -- we  
are doing what we promised,'' IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
said. ``We promised to clean the house. We did it. We promised 
reforms. We did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was not convinced.  
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC's actions today fall short of the reforms needed to  
bring transparency and accountability to the organization,'' McCain 
said. ``Nothing I have witnessed provides any substantive movement 
in that direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although critics blame the 78-year-old Spaniard for the  
atmosphere that produced the million-dollar gift-giving scandal 
stemming from the selection of Salt Lake for the 2002 Winter Games, 
Samaranch said he would be the chairman and pick the participants 
for the major reform vehicle -- IOC 2000, with a mandate to change 
the committee for the next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the president of the IOC,'' Samaranch said at a news  
conference. ``This commission must be presided by the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said it was ``worrisome at best'' that Samaranch would  
hand-pick the members. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the reform process lacks credibility, then the entire  
future of the Olympic movement will be in jeopardy,'' he said in a 
statement issued in Washington. ``If the purpose of the new panel 
is to truly restore the integrity of the organization, it must be 
completely independent, and its recommendations must be binding. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is true of any initiative for reform anywhere in the  
world,'' he said. ``The integrity of the Olympic movement is at 
stake. We must see meaningful reforms now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain will open Senate hearings April 14 on the Olympic  
scandal. Senators are proposing legislation to strip the IOC of its 
tax-exempt status, limit sponsors' tax deductions and reroute U.S. 
TV rights money to the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC gave a more positive assessment of the IOC's resolve.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have done what they said they were going to do,'' USOC  
president Bill Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added USOC executive director Dick Schultz: ``I think it's  
another step along the road to recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC launched the reforms to appease Olympics sponsors, and  
their first reactions were positive. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's Corp. called the IOC's proposals ``a step in the  
right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have very high expectations that these problems will be  
resolved,'' David Green, a senior vice president for international 
marketing at McDonald's, said in a statement. He said McDonald's 
would like to see the focus shift back to ``the true spirit of the 
games as personified by the hard work and commitment of the 
athletes and the international competition itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based United Parcel Service, a sponsor since 1994, felt  
the IOC's actions showed ``there is a clear intent on the part of 
the IOC to change itself,'' spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our expectations are met for this meeting. We didn't think  
they would come out of this meeting with a blueprint'' of all the 
changes they planned to make, she said. ``I think it's a start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would appoint members of the reform panel by  
the end of the month. The committee will be composed of 20-24 
members, half from the IOC and half from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the group will study radical reforms to the  
structure and running of the IOC, including the possibility of 
elections, term limits and age restrictions for members. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the panel would include ``eminent personalities'' with  
knowledge of sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has already announced that Giovanni Agnelli, head of  
the Fiat auto empire, has agreed to serve on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel will submit a preliminary report at the next IOC  
general assembly in June in Seoul, South Korea. The commission 
would present its final recommendations at another extraordinary 
IOC session in December or early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he will also appoint the members of a so-called  
``independent'' ethics commission, which will enforce a 
code-of-conduct for IOC delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	This panel will have eight members, a majority from outside the  
committee. IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper, a major 
proponent of the ethics panel, said IOC vice president Keba Mbaye 
will be the chairman and that Swiss IOC member Denis Oswald will be 
among the members. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of fending off calls from outside the IOC for his  
resignation, Samaranch was emboldened by Wednesday's overwhelming 
vote of confidence from the membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he was surprised at the extent of the support --  
86 votes in favor and only two against. He said he had expected up 
to 15 ``no'' votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the margin was even greater than when he was  
elected IOC president on the first ballot in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the vote will push me to work harder so that the IOC  
will recover the prestige we had a few weeks ago very, very soon,'' 
he said. ``It gives me a great responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he plans to serve out the rest of his term until  
2001, but again left open the possibility of an early departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what can happen in the future,'' he said. ``After  
the vote of confidence, my proposal is to go until the end of my 
mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the Sydney Games in 2000 ``will make the world  
see that what has happened in the last few months was only an 
incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The world needs the Olympics Games,'' he said. ``It is the  
most important event in the world, not just in sports. The youth of 
the world deserve the Olympic Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the 2006 games, the IOC approved a plan to have the host  
chosen from two finalists decided by a 15-member selection panel. 
The IOC members will retain their final vote, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is designed only for the selection of the 2006 site,  
which concludes June 19 in Seoul. But the IOC has promised 
permanent changes after more review. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is not as radical as what was first proposed --  
stripping of the vote from the general membership. That plan 
produced an uproar from delegates who said they were being punished 
for the corrupt acts of a few colleagues.

<HEADLINE> 'Macho' Roles Lead Best Actor Nods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A clownish death camp victim, an infantry  
captain, a director of horror films, an alcoholic cop, an American 
neo-Nazi -- these diverse roles have brought five accomplished 
actors, one Italian, one English, three American, to consideration 
as the best film actor of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them will stand on the stage of the Los Angeles Music  
Center March 21 and receive the Academy Award, the movie world's 
highest prize. For four of them, it's the first time. If the award 
goes to the fifth, Tom Hanks, he will have scored a rare triple, 
having won for ``Philadelphia'' in 1993 and ``Forrest Gump'' in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The varied roles of the best-actor nominees might seem to  
indicate a trend away from the macho heroics that epitomize 
mainstream movie fare in the 1990s. Alas, no. With the exception of 
Tom Hanks and ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the nominees appeared in 
``special'' films. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Benigni is in ``Life Is Beautiful,'' a foreign-language  
movie; the other three performances are in what could be considered 
art films -- small-budget projects dealing with racism, 
homosexuality and alcoholism, and destined for select audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the nominees:  

</P>
<P>
              	 *ROBERTO BENIGNI, ``Life Is Beautiful''    	
</P>
<P>
	As Charlie Chaplin did with ``The Great Dictator'' in 1940,  
Benigni chose to depict Nazism with comedy. While Chaplin applied 
ridicule to Hitler and Mussolini, Benigni showed invented moments 
against the horrific backdrop of a German concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a daring feat to portray an Italian Jew using humor to  
shield his young son from the Holocaust trauma. Benigni drew 
criticism, but audiences were moved by the poignancy of the 
father's act. ``Life Is Beautiful'' became an international hit, 
especially in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni appears in public as exuberant as he is on the screen.  
Before his film was premiered in Israel, he pranced about the stage 
and chirped, ``I kiss you on the mouth, everybody!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he defended the film against critics who thought it  
trivialized the Holocaust: ``I felt in my mind I was sincere -- I am 
a man, and I know what is sorrow. This was the best I could do with 
my soul, my mind and my body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benigni's triple play -- nominations for writing, directing and  
acting in ``Life Is Beautiful'' -- has been accomplished three times 
in the past. Orson Welles did it with ``Citizen Kane'' in 1941, 
Woody Allen with ``Annie Hall'' in 1977 and Warren Beatty with 
``Reds'' in 1981. 

</P>
<P>
                	 *TOM HANKS, ``Saving Private Ryan''    	
</P>
<P>
	For his role as a captain leading a squad of GIs through German  
lines to rescue a soldier, Hanks could merely have shown up for the 
first day of filming. Instead, he chose to join other lead actors -- 
most of them a decade or more younger -- in a grueling six-day boot 
camp in which they camped on the ground, ate field rations, carried 
60-pound packs and slept three hours a night. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fourth day, the younger actors mutinied. Hanks, then  
41, argued them out of it. His perseverance contributed to his 
soldiers' respect for him as a leader, and as a superstar who 
required no special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the heroics of Capt. Miller and his squad, Hanks viewed  
``Saving Private Ryan'' as an antiwar film: ``The first 25 minutes 
are set on Omaha Beach, and it's purely hell on Earth. By the time 
they start gunning down Germans trying to surrender, you honestly 
don't want to see anybody kill anybody again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hanks wins, he will join an elite group of triple-winners:  
Ingrid Bergman, Walter Brennan and Jack Nicholson. Katharine 
Hepburn holds the record with four. 

</P>
<P>
                	 *IAN McKELLEN, ``Gods and Monsters''    	
</P>
<P>
	English-born James Whale brought distinction to the  
suspense/terror genre with his 1930s films, ``Frankenstein,'' ``The 
Old Dark House,'' ``The Invisible Man'' and ``The Bride of 
Frankenstein.'' He was adept at musicals and dramas as well, but 
retired in 1940 to devote himself to painting. In 1957, he drowned 
in his swimming pool in mysterious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Lions Gate Films bought Christopher Bran's novel about Whale's  
later life, ``Gods and Monsters,'' which fictionalized a failed 
affair with a gardener (Brendan Fraser in the film) that led to the 
director's suicide. Sir Ian McKellen, one of England's great 
classic actors, was chosen to play Whale. 
</P>
<P>
	After learning of his nomination, McKellen remarked: ``When  
people give you a wonderful script, they say it has Oscar written 
all over it. By which they mean it's a good script, and you don't 
really believe a word more. But then when you start to get awards, 
you think, 'My dear, I wonder if I'm going to get nominated?' Now 
it's come true.'' 

</P>
<P>
                   	 *NICK NOLTE, ``Affliction''    	
</P>
<P>
	``It was a small ... $6 million budget picture to gather this  
much attention,'' commented Nolte after his nomination. ``One 
doesn't anticipate that. You make those kinds of films for the sake 
of making them. You can't really lose money on them, but it's just 
the love of filmmaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Affliction,'' Nolte plays a small-town cop bedeviled by  
drink and an abusive father (James Coburn, nominee as supporting 
actor). It's the kind of small but challenging film Nolte has been 
seeking after 20 years as a high-voltage star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going broke, compared to the lifestyle I was living,'' the  
actor has said. ``The biggest paydays I get now are $250,000, half 
a million. I used to make $6 or $7 million. But that was a terrible 
trap for me. I hated those experiences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those high-paid experiences, Barbra Streisand's ``The  
Prince of Tides,'' earned Nolte's first Academy nomination, for 
best actor of 1991. 

</P>
<P>
               	 *EDWARD NORTON, ``American History X''    	
</P>
<P>
	After a long search for an actor to play a murder suspect in  
``Primal Fear,'' the producers decided on an unknown, off-Broadway 
player, Edward Norton. His chilling performance in ``Primal Fear,'' 
his first movie, brought him an Academy nomination as supporting 
actor, and a Golden Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Brad Pitts and Leonardo DiCaprios, Yale  
University-educated Norton did not seek to cash in on his new fame. 
He played lesser roles in Woody Allen's musical ``Everyone Says I 
Love You'' and Milos Forman's ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``American History X'' continued his search for the offbeat. He  
plays a skinhead -- a tattooed American Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton has said his urge to act came from seeing a performance  
of ``Cinderella'' and Ian McKellen's one-man show, ``Acting 
Shakespeare.'' After the nominations were announced, McKellen 
commented: 
</P>
<P>
	``What's very encouraging is to see Edward Norton's nomination.  
He said to me I was the reason he became an actor. I hope I'm the 
reason he doesn't win an Oscar.''

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Ulcer Drug for Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Horses get ulcers, too? It turns out they do --  
quite often and quite bad. The government is riding to the rescue, 
approving the top-selling human ulcer drug to help racehorses, farm 
horses, even foals. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is called omeprazole, sold as Prilosec pills to humans.  
The equine version will be sold as GastroGard, a paste in a 
cinnamon flavor horses find yummy. 
</P>
<P>
	Its approval Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration  
provides the first treatment for horses with ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only recently, in fact, did veterinarians discover the  
seriousness of equine ulcers -- thanks to new, 6-foot-long 
endoscopes that let them peer into a horse's stomach. They 
experimented with other human drugs, but found that a horse not 
only requires a lot of Pepto-Bismol, it didn't work very well. 
</P>
<P>
	So horse lovers are excited about GastroGard, which will begin  
selling, by prescription only, within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``These ulcers are very painful and impact the horse's  
performance, his overall health and well-being,'' said Bill White, 
a veteran trainer at Miami's Calder Race Course. ``It's a problem 
more prevalent than most people may think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Mostly because of the way horses' stomachs are designed.  
But stress is a major underlying factor, said the FDA's Dr. Linda 
Wilmot. That means racehorses and performance horses are at extra 
risk, and so are foals, who can experience stress from infant 
illnesses or weaning. 
</P>
<P>
	According to GastroGard manufacturer Merial Limited, up to 1.8  
million performance horses may have ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug ``should have a tremendous impact,'' Wilmot said.  
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to popular belief, stress does not cause human ulcers --  
a bacterium called H. pylori is the main culprit. People's ulcers 
are treated with antibiotics to kill the germs and anti-acid drugs 
such as Prilosec that shut down gastric acid production so the 
stomach has time to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	But H. pylori hasn't been found in horses. Instead, the top  
lining of horses' stomachs is particularly sensitive to acid 
because it's made of the same extra-delicate tissue of a human 
esophagus. Any person who's ever had heartburn, when acid rubs that 
sensitive esophagus skin, can empathize. 
</P>
<P>
	The horse developed as a grazing animal, and grass neutralizes  
the acid. But whenever horses stop eating, the stomach still 
produces acid that bubbles against that sensitive tissue, explained 
Dr. Michael Murray of Virginia Tech's Equine Medical Center in 
Leesburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Even barnyard Mr. Eds get ulcers. Unlike people, horses in  
stressful environments or places where they can't eat often -- like 
training sessions or travel -- have a higher risk. Symptoms include 
decreased appetite, colic, poor hair coat, poor body condition and 
decreased performance. In foals, symptoms also may include 
intermittent nursing. 
</P>
<P>
	A test of GastroGard in 300 horses found a once-a-day treatment  
for 28 days healed or reduced ulcers' severity in 99 percent of 
treated horses. Treatment costs about $40 a day. Because 
in-training horses often suffer recurrences, Merial recommends a 
``maintenance dose'' after the initial 28-day treatment until 
training ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Horses with ulcer symptoms should be checked by endoscopy, a  
process that requires sedating the animal for 15 to 30 minutes, 
Murray said. Not all veterinarians can do that, but the drug seemed 
to have no side effects so some may rely on symptoms alone to 
prescribe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA did, however, warn the drug shouldn't be used by  
pregnant or lactating mares, because there's no proof it's safe for 
them.

<HEADLINE> Composer Ernest Gold Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Oscar-winning composer Ernest Gold, who wrote  
scores for ``Exodus,'' ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,'' ``On 
the Beach'' and ``The Secret of Santa Vittoria,'' has died. He was 
77. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold died Wednesday of complications from a stroke, daughter  
Martha Gold Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's most recognized work was the score of the 1960 movie  
``Exodus,'' for which he won an Academy Award and two Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	He received two Academy Awards nominations -- best score and best  
song -- for the 1963 film ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,'' and 
also received nominations for 1959's ``On the Beach'' and the 1969 
movie ``The Secret of Santa Vittoria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Vienna, Gold was raised in a musical family. He wrote a  
full-length opera when was 13, Mrs. Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
	He emigrated to New York with his family in 1938 after the Nazi  
annexation of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	His credits also included ``Smooth As Silk,'' ``Wyoming,''  
``Witness for the Prosecution,'' ``The Pride and the Passion,'' 
``Too Much Too Soon,'' ``The Defiant Ones,'' ``Inherit the Wind,'' 
and ``The Runner Stumbles.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects School Board Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cleveland Board of Education is violating  
the Constitution by opening its meetings with a prayer, a federal 
appeals court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling reversed a 1996  
decision that said the prayer was permissible because it was 
similar to opening a state legislature's sessions with prayer, 
which federal courts have ruled is allowable. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 2-1 ruling, the appellate court's majority said the  
prayer at school board meetings is more like prayers at school 
graduation ceremonies or in classrooms, which federal courts have 
said is unconstitutional as an apparent government endorsement of 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Tracy, a Cleveland mathematics teacher, and Sarah Coles, a  
former high school student now in college, sued the board over the 
prayer issue in 1992, when the practice began. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Knoth, a lawyer for the board, said Thursday he would  
consult with school officials before deciding whether to appeal to 
the U.S. Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. To Probe Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court cleared the path  
Thursday for the Justice Department to investigate the tactics of 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the Monica Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	The special court that appoints independent counsels dismissed a  
challenge by Landmark Legal Foundation, a conservative group that 
sought to block the Justice Department from investigating Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge court said it would not intervene because ``we  
are without power to act on the Landmark petition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office contended that Landmark could not be injured by  
the investigation and therefore had no legal grounds to sustain a 
lawsuit. The Justice Department argued that the Ethics in 
Government Act did not give the court the power to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both are correct rationales,'' the court said. ``We have no  
jurisdiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to sustain a case, the applicant must show ``a concrete  
and actual or imminent injury in fact,'' the court said. ``We find 
nothing in Landmark's motion that could even remotely be considered 
an injury to itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court also said it could not go beyond the powers set out in  
the Ethics in Government Act or review the attorney general's 
actions involving an independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said in a statement that the ruling was consistent with  
the position of his office that ``third parties, regardless of the 
merits of their complaints, have no standing to challenge the 
attorney general's actions under the statute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This office fully accepts the court's resolutions of this  
issue,'' Starr added. 
</P>
<P>
	Landmark President Mark R. Levin brushed off the ruling, saying  
his group's primary goal in pursuing the litigation ``was to make 
public an issue that the Justice Department never wanted to see the 
light of day. Mission accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said, ``We're pleased  
the court agreed with us that it did not have jurisdiction to 
review the attorney general's actions in this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department is investigating allegations of irregularities by  
Starr's office, including the initial handling of information on 
the Monica Lewinsky matter; Starr's request to the department for 
jurisdiction to investigate Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with 
President Clinton; and Starr's conduct during the investigation, 
including the initial meetings between the counsel's office and Ms. 
Lewinsky in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	One issue is the offer by Starr's deputies to Ms. Lewinsky of an  
immunity deal conditioned on her not discussing it with her 
original lawyer, Frank Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department rules prohibit government prosecutors from  
discussing immunity deals with defendants outside the presence of 
their lawyers. Starr's office is required to follow these rules 
unless doing so would undermine the purpose of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has denied any impropriety in his office's dealings with  
Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision comes at a time that several key lawyers are  
leaving Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion was handed down by U.S. Circuit Judge David Sentelle  
and senior appellate judges Peter Fay and Richard Cudahy.

<HEADLINE> NJ Police Settle Suit Over Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey State Police has agreed to  
pay $225,000 to a black woman who said she was pulled over because 
of her race, beaten and spat at. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a classic New Jersey State Police profile stop based  
strictly on the type of vehicle and the race of the occupants and 
nothing else,'' said Ronald Sage, a lawyer for Dorothy Cobbs. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement,  
saying Wednesday's agreement was made to avoid the cost of 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement comes as the state fends off allegations that  
State Police target minority motorists for stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman recently fired State Police Superintendent  
Carl Williams, who said minorities were responsible for most of the 
state's cocaine and marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cobbs, 52, of Wyandanch, N.Y., sued in December alleging  
false arrest, false imprisonment, assault and battery, malicious 
destruction of property and conspiracy to commit perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the mistreatment happened when she was returning from a  
trip to Atlantic City on Jan. 4, 1996, while driving her black 
Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
	She contends Patrick O'Dwyer -- a two-time state trooper of the  
year -- pulled her over saying she had a broken tail light. She says 
O'Dwyer swore at her, grabbed her by the wrist, punched her in the 
face, sprayed her with Mace and later tackled her after she ran 
across the highway to a median. 
</P>
<P>
	After being taken to the State Police barracks, she was slammed  
against a wall, spat at and verbally abused, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dwyer said Ms. Cobbs was driving slowly on the parkway and he  
pulled her over to offer assistance. He said he smelled alcohol on 
her breath and asked her to get out of the car. He said she became 
irate and unruly during questioning.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Resist Common Perception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Only Iowa -- and either Florida or Gonzaga -- stand  
in the way of Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun and his 
much-anticipated first trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun's Huskies are heavily favored to beat Iowa, and would be  
expected to beat the other two as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he and his players are assuming nothing, a wise decision  
considering the upsets in this year's NCAA tournament, and the fact 
that Calhoun has taken his team to the regional semifinals six 
other times in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I can taste it, though, per se,'' Calhoun said.  
``I'm just worried about Iowa. Hopefully our kids are going to be 
in the same frame of mind. If we can treat it like that, we're 
going to be a lot better off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, after blowout victories in the first two rounds,  
play the Hawkeyes in tonight's second game at America West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The closer he gets to the Final Four, the more Calhoun is  
reminded that he has never taken a team there. It's obviously an 
irritating subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've coached over 800-something games in college basketball,''  
he said, ``and I'm asked about four or five games. How fair is it? 
I didn't make the rules. We've won three or four Big East 
championship games against John Thompson, Jim Boeheim -- in Madison 
Square Garden on a Saturday night against St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those, I thought at the time, were big games. But I've been  
told since that there are bigger ones coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa has fed off the emotion surrounding the departure of coach  
Tom Davis, who is leaving -- not by his choice -- at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pour so much of your energy into practice and your  
workouts and trying to improve yourself because he gave you a shot 
to play big-time basketball,'' Iowa's Kent McCausland said. ``You 
know he's just a great guy and he puts everything into trying to 
make you a better player. For him to put that energy into you, you 
just want to give it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotion propelled the Hawkeyes to an upset victory over  
Arkansas in the second round. But the players weren't exactly 
brimming with confidence about their chances against the deep, 
talented Huskies, who have lost just twice in 32 games and romped 
to two victories last week in Denver.. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing so well right now,'' McCausland said.  
``They're like a well-oiled machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he'd do the hokey-pokey if Iowa wins, the Hawkeyes'  
Jess Settles said, ``You'll see more than that. They're so good, I 
can't even imagine that happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa was able to use Davis' trademark pressing defense against  
Arkansas, despite the Razorbacks' quickness. But doing it against 
Connecticut is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that's our strength,'' El-Amin said. ``We like to play  
the up-tempo game, and we love for a team to press us. We think we 
can do a very good job against anybody's press because we have very 
good ball handlers out there at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has dared press the Huskies much this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing. We've played 34 games and I don't think  
anybody's pressed us more than 10 possessions,'' Calhoun said. 
``New Mexico the other night threw on a press for about six 
possessions. We scored four out of six and the other times we got a 
good shot off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get pressed. But assuming Tom plays the way he always  
plays, which I think he will, we'll probably get pressed for 40 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kahlid El-Amin pulled hamstrings in practice two days ago, but  
should be at about 90 percent efficiency, Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Iowa, Connecticut All-American forward Richard  
Hamilton is at full strength. Hamilton has scored 49 points in the 
Huskies' NCAA victories over Texas-San Antonio (by 25) and New 
Mexico (by 22). 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, who has known Davis since the Iowa coach was at Boston  
College from 1977 to 1982, expects some sort of special defense 
geared to stopping Hamilton. 
</P>

offset that. But that is something we will have to prove 
tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes Missile Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Closely following Senate approval of a  
missile-defense bill, the House on Thursday passed its own version 
of a system to protect the 50 states against a limited ballistic 
missile attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no defense today against any missile system. It is a  
national priority that this Congress needs to address,'' Rep. Curt 
Weldon, R-Pa., chief sponsor of the legislation, told colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved 317-102 by the House, would commit the  
Pentagon to building the system. 
</P>
<P>
	A House-Senate conference committee will resolve differences  
between the two versions. The Senate measure, passed Wednesday and 
favored by the White House, includes a provision designed to 
encourage continued nuclear arms-reduction talks with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-led House rejected Democratic efforts to make the House  
bill more like the Senate version. In the end, 103 House Democrats 
voted for the measure while 102 voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed a similar measure in 1995 and  
Democratic leaders previously opposed a commitment to such a 
system. But lawmakers from both parties said recent missile tests 
by North Korea and Iran and reports of nuclear weapons espionage by 
China helped rally huge support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill states, in its entirety, that ``it is the  
official policy of the United States to deploy a national missile 
defense.'' It neither specifies a system nor sets a timetable. It 
also does not say that such a system should be deployed only when 
``technologically possible,'' as does the Senate's, which passed 
90-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House held firm that Clinton wants legislation that  
specifies, in addition to an assessment of the technology, that 
three criteria be evaluated before any deployment: threat, cost and 
the impact on arms control. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton spokesman P.J. Crowley stopped well short of a veto  
threat. ``We'll see what comes out of conference,'' Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House intelligence  
committee, said the legislation of only 15 words ``is a deceptively 
simple bill. But it speaks volumes to the entire planet that we 
will not shy away from the challenge to make the United States and 
its people safe from ballistic missile attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat is real. It is growing and more immediate than many  
have thought,'' Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Senate's bill, the House measure envisions a  
scaled-back version of the Strategic Defense Initiative proposed in 
1983 by then-President Ronald Reagan -- and derided by Democrats as 
``Star Wars'' -- that would provide a space-based defense against 
ballistic missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	While that plan was geared mainly at the former Soviet Union,  
the system now being promoted deals more with an accidental launch 
-- or by the deliberate launch by a rogue or terrorist state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has spent over $50 billion on research and limited  
tests on such a system, even though one still has not been 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The president put $10.5 billion in his budget for such a program  
over the next five years -- an increase of $6.6 billion -- but wanted 
to wait until June 2000 before deciding whether to actually deploy 
such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	House sponsors said their bill makes that decision for Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	The House vote came after the chamber received a report from  
former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that 25 to 30 nations now 
have or are working hard to acquire ballistic missiles capable of 
carrying nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumsfeld, who headed a congressionally appointed panel that  
looked into the missile threat, told reporters after the briefing, 
``It's not an accident that these countries are spending a great 
deal of money'' in developing such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumsfeld, defense secretary in the Ford administration, noted,  
in particular, heavy spending by North Korea to develop its missile 
program ``while people there are starving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said GOP leaders prevented them from offering  
amendments, similar to one passed in the Senate, that led Clinton 
to withdraw a longstanding veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	One amendment seeks to prevent the legislation from undermining  
separate efforts to negotiate with Moscow on nuclear warhead 
reductions. Another would assure that actual funds for such a 
system would be subject to the usual annual congressional 
appropriations process. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House had not specifically threatened to veto the  
House version, suggesting it hoped that the final measure to come 
from Congress would more closely resemble the Senate proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics portrayed the system as a waste of billions of tax  
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Greeks Have Stock Market Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- If the breeze is right, the gamy smell  
from the open meat market wafts over the main doors of Athens' 
stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it. It puts me in the mood: Blood and guts,'' sniffed  
Aris Makroyiannis, pausing for a moment at the market's crimson 
facade before racing to the gallery for a good seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with a calculator and binoculars, the 45-year-old shop  
owner is a new recruit in the army of investors laying siege to the 
exchange -- currently Europe's hottest trading floor and the world's 
No. 2 performer last year in terms of percentage increase. At about 
85 percent, it was only slightly behind South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Each business day, the small visitors section fills up. The  
cadre of private investors bite their nails, scribble on pads and 
peer through binoculars at the trading board and general index 
ticker, flanked by images of the goddess Athena and the sea king 
Poseidon. 
</P>
<P>
	Most often these days, investors end up counting their gains  
rather than moaning their losses. The exchange's general share 
index set another record Thursday -- its 21st ceiling-busting day 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is trying to cash in,'' stock broker Peter Spartalis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece's booming market has an odd blood line, born out of  
fiscal clutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Chronic inflation, crushing public debt and a host of other  
economic woes kept Greece from joining the first group of the 
European Union's single currency club. 
</P>
<P>
	But Premier Costas Simitis has so far managed to stay focused on  
the drive to meet EU standards and enter the euro group by 2001. 
Inflation has nose-dived. Interest rates have been cut. Plans have 
advanced to sell off money-losing state companies. A flurry of 
mergers and acquisitions are being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece, once the economic backwater of the EU, has earned  
applause from influential observers, including Moody's Investors 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	And the stock market -- especially the banking sector -- sprang to  
life last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For investors, it's a prime chance to catch a ride on an EU  
economy apparently chugging toward the single currency zone. 
Similar bull markets occurred in Italy and Spain as they made their 
euro transformations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the feeding frenzy atmosphere is more pronounced in smaller  
and poorer Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 1 million Greeks -- about one-tenth of the population --  
are believed to own shares. A decade ago, investing in the market 
was virtually unknown outside an elite circle. More than 100 
companies are awaiting regulatory approval to join the nearly 300 
listed firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see this market cooling off for a while,'' said  
Spartalis. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimism is so high that some people have taken out bank  
loans at 20 percent interest to buy stocks, according to media 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is sheer madness,'' warned an editorial in the respected  
Kathimerini newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Faith in the market can lead to foolish moves, analysts warn.  
Some small investors may throw their money at any company expecting 
sizable returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many, many unsophisticated investors racing to get  
into this market,'' said Chris Elafros, an analyst at Telesis 
Securities in Athens. ``These people may not be as prudent and may 
unwittingly take some unwise risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Greek stock market has been quite resilient on its upward  
climb. 
</P>
<P>
	It dipped by more than 7.5 percent in one day last month during  
the political upheaval following Turkey's arrest of Kurdish rebel 
leader Adbullah Ocalan, who had been secretly sheltered by Greek 
officials in Kenya. But the market regained almost all its losses 
the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts predict the Greek stock market may eventually  
mature and take on an Italian character -- where political 
developments don't necessarily shake up investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be positive,'' said Petros Katsoulas, an emerging  
market specialist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ``This 
market will go down and some investors will be scared ... It can't 
keep up like this forever. It's the law of physics.''

<HEADLINE> Heartburn Linked to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The chance of getting cancer of the esophagus -- a particularly  
deadly form of the disease -- is almost eight times higher in people 
who suffer from chronic heartburn, according to a new study 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	People suffering from acid reflux at night are at an even higher  
risk of getting the disease -- and taking antacids doesn't reduce 
the danger, researchers said in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Heartburn is a burning pain in the chest that people commonly  
associate with spicy foods or overeating. Acid reflux is a 
regurgitation of acid from the stomach into the esophagus because 
of a faulty valve. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors suspect that over time, the irritating acid causes  
cellular changes in the esophagus that can lead to the most deadly 
form of esophageal cancer, adenocarcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reflux symptoms should not be dismissed as trivial,'' said Dr.  
Jesper Lagergren of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. 
``If you have reflux symptoms and you get new symptoms -- maybe you 
have symptoms for several years and maybe the symptoms seem to 
change, like difficulty swallowing -- then you should seek medical 
care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that because treatment of heartburn and  
acid reflux doesn't reduce the cancer risk, those with severe 
symptoms should be watched carefully by their doctors for signs of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall risk of developing esophageal cancer is extremely  
low, but only 5 percent to 10 percent of patients survive more than 
five years after contracting the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found the risk of cancer was almost eight times higher  
among people who suffered heartburn, regurgitation or both at least 
once a week. Acid reflux at night was associated with a risk nearly 
11 times higher. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no increased risk for another form of esophageal  
cancer, squamous-cell carcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
	While up to one-fifth of Americans get heartburn, only about  
12,500 people a year develop esophageal cancer, according to the 
American Cancer Society. Over the past 20 years, cancer of the 
esophagus has become increasingly prevalent among white men, but 
researchers don't know why. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly what causes heartburn and acid reflux isn't clear.  
Previous studies have indicated a link between acid reflux and 
obesity, smoking and alcohol use, but this study found no 
correlation between those habits and heartburn. And Lagergren said 
there is no proof of the belief that spicy foods cause acid reflux 
or heartburn. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on data from 1994 through 1997 on all Swedes  
under 80, or about 8 million people. The researchers interviewed 
189 esophageal cancer patients and 262 stomach cancer patients and 
compared them with 820 randomly selected people. 
</P>
<P>
	The greater the frequency, severity and duration of heartburn  
and acid reflux, the higher the risk of developing esophageal 
cancer. The study found only a weak link between heartburn and 
stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found no indication that treatment -- either with  
antacids or surgery -- reduced the risk. In fact, patients who 
received medical treatment had a higher risk of developing cancer, 
though Lagergren said that may be because the people have more 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Sidney Cohen and Henry  
Parkman of the Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia 
suggested doctors test patients complaining of severe heartburn 
with an endoscope, a flexible tube with a tiny video camera on the 
end that is inserted down the throat to look for signs of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heartburn must be given respect,'' they wrote. ``Treatment  
should also be aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lagergren and his colleagues said the effectiveness of  
aggressive treatments, or any treatments for that matter, is 
debatable. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our knowledge, so far, you can't do much,'' Lagergren said.  
``We can't recommend anything.''

<HEADLINE> Foresters Wary of Spray Paint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Past and present employees of the U.S. Forest  
Service are seeking a court order to stop the use of a tree-marking 
spray paint they say causes miscarriages and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed last week in Washington accuses the Forest  
Service of breaking the law by using the all-weather paint without 
an environmental impact statement on possible side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The paint has been used widely in national forests over the past  
10 years to mark trees for logging. In 1993, an estimated 3,000 
people -- 80 percent of them men -- worked on crews using the paint. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and  
Health found an 82 percent to 177 percent increased risk of 
miscarriage among Forest Service foresters who used various brands 
of tree-marking paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers have also complained of blurry vision, confusion,  
nausea, fatigue, chronic sinus irritation, headaches and diarrhea. 
The lawsuit gives no figures on the incidence of these ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a Forest Service worker filed her own lawsuit against  
the manufacturer, Niles Chemical Paint Co. of Niles, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Tipton of Baker City, Ore., alleges the company knew the  
paint contained chemicals banned by the government, including 
toluene, a solvent that the state of California says is known to 
cause reproductive problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Tipton has not reported any paint-related problems herself but  
said she collected complaints from other employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemicals are used in the paint so that it can sprayed  
outdoors during freezing weather, when other paints might thicken 
or freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	At Niles Chemical, executive vice president and general counsel  
Sherman Drew said Wednesday he had no knowledge of the new lawsuit 
and had no comment. Company officials also have had no comment in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service spokesman Joe Walsh in Washington said many  
forests already are using a water-based alternative, and the agency 
remains on schedule to phase out the old paint completely by May 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, ``for areas where they have no choice but to  
use the oil-based paint, precautionary measures are being taken to 
protect the workers,'' Walsh said.

<HEADLINE> NFL Replay Rule at a Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A look at the differences in the instant replay officiating aid 	
systems for the NFL: 
</P>
<P>
                        *OLD SYSTEM (1985-91) 	
</P>
<P>
	-- A replay official in the television booth or press box would  
signal to the referee to stop play for a review. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Only the replay official could decide which plays should be  
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Only the replay official determined whether to overturn a call  
or let it stand. 
</P>
<P>
	-- There was no time limit on examination of a replay.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Replay officials were not part of a game's officiating crew.  
</P>
<P>
                         *NEW SYSTEM (1999)   	
</P>
<P>
	-- For the first 28 minutes of each half, coaches must challenge  
an official's call to have it reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Coaches are allowed two challenges per game.  
</P>
<P>
	-- If a call is not overturned, the challenging team loses a  
timeout. No challenges will be recognized if a team has exhausted 
its timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In the final two minutes of each half and in overtime, only  
the NFL replay assistant in the television booth or press box can 
call for a video review. There is no limit to the number of replay 
reviews the replay assistant can request. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A review called for by the replay assistant is not tied to  
timeouts for either team. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The referee will make all determinations, regardless of time  
of game, after reviewing videos on a sideline monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A time limit of 90 seconds has been placed on all video  
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Replay assistants will be part of a game's officiating crew.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Drug Debate Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The number of liver-related deaths linked to  
the diabetes drug Rezulin is much greater than previously 
announced, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 155 Rezulin patients have died since the drug went on  
the market in March 1997, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert Co., the maker of the drug which helps control  
blood-sugar levels, disputed the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Stephen Mock said there were 35 serious  
incidents since the introduction of Rezulin, including 28 deaths 
and seven patients who needed liver transplants because of 
complications stemming from the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said some of the patients had other health conditions,  
including stroke, cancer and heart attacks, that could have 
contributed to or caused their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert maintains that while there are ``hundreds'' of  
adverse drug reports that must be reported to the Food and Drug 
Administration, those cases do not always result in authorities 
finding a direct link to Rezulin, Mock said. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA spokesman Larry Bachorik said Thursday the agency would not  
release official numbers nor confirm the numbers given by 
Warner-Lambert. The agency will present results of a review of the 
drug during an advisory meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bachorik said the agency doesn't expect the numbers to be  
dramatically different from early December, when published reports 
attributed about 33 deaths to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin is among the biggest-selling diabetes drugs, taken by  
more than 1 million people.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Rosanne, Arnold Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld the  
$750,000 damage award given to Roseanne and ex-husband Tom Arnold 
in a dispute with a clothing manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 ruling Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
said the couple had a binding contract with Celeb Sales, which 
promised them $1 million in November 1993 but paid only $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Celeb Sales planned to market ``Roseanne'' and ``Tom'' lines of  
clothing for larger people. The company claimed the Arnolds 
undermined the deal by generating bad publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	After the pair sued the company, Celeb Sales countersued for $24  
million, contending the couple reneged on an agreement to market 
the clothing on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Harry Hupp dismissed the company's fraud  
claim, and a jury found that Celeb Sales had violated its contract.

<HEADLINE> Sooners' Sampson's Latest Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- When Kelvin Sampson looks at Oklahoma's game  
with top-seeded Michigan State in the NCAA Midwest Regional, he 
sees more than All-America guard Mateen Cleaves and a team that 
pounds opponents on the backboards. 
</P>
<P>
	He also sees Texas and Missouri and Oklahoma State -- teams his  
Sooners beat on the road during the regular season when no one else 
gave them much of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson always says he looks at challenges as opportunities, and  
that will be the case again Friday night in the regional 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The questions are always the same,'' Sampson said Thursday.  
``Last week, it was how are you going to guard Jason Terry? Now, 
it's how are you going to guard Mateen Cleaves? 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't overrespect. When you get this far, you're capable of  
winning and we've proven that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That mindset has carried 13th-seeded Oklahoma (22-10) this far  
for the first time since the Sooners' run-and-gun days of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma upset No. 4 seed Arizona and beat fifth-seeded North  
Carolina-Charlotte last weekend by playing outstanding defense, 
rebounding well and shooting 3-pointers. The Sooners made 10 3s 
against Arizona, 13 against UNCC. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said he's concerned about the long  
rebounds that result from long-range jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That can be an advantage or disadvantage,'' he said. ``If we  
get them, it can help our fast break. If we're not getting them, 
then it can create some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (31-4) have won 20 straight games, the Big 10  
regular-season and tournament titles, and showed their mettle last 
week by surviving a second-round scare against Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about Michigan State always begins with Cleaves, with good  
reason. He averages 11 points and seven assists per game, and 
presents problems with his strength. 
</P>
<P>
	While Arizona's Jason Terry was quick and smooth, Cleaves ``is  
kind of a sledgehammer point guard,'' Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dominates his position. He plays physically strong. I  
watched eight games where I thought he was the main reason they won 
at the end. He has an infectious enthusiasm about him. I think it's 
important for a point guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans' leading scorer, Morris Peterson, doesn't even  
start. Antonio Smith averages 8.4 rebounds per game but gets plenty 
of help from his teammates, especially at the offensive end. 
Michigan State has grabbed 18 offensive rebounds per game, about 
twice as many as its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	That could be where the game is decided. Oklahoma has been a  
good offensive rebounding team, but doesn't compare to the 
Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes the plays don't always work,'' Smith said. ``We do  
have some great offensive rebounding. Sometimes we do have a kind 
of ugly offense, but it's called getting the ball in the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma has gotten contributions from throughout the lineup in  
the first two tournament games. But if they are to have a chance 
Friday, the Sooners must get a big game from bruising forward 
Eduardo Najera. He had 17 points and 13 rebounds against Arizona 
and followed with 20 points and 15 rebounds against North 
Carolina-Charlotte. 
</P>

	``I watch a lot of college basketball throughout the season. I  
was very impressed (with Najera),'' Cleaves said. ``He has a 
passion for the game. He plays hard. It seems like he plays every 
game like it's his last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be one team's last game of this season. A Michigan State  
loss would be considered a big upset, although Spartan players said 
it would be an upset in seedings only. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is tough to play a team people considered the underdog,''  
Smith said. ``But we never look at people as underdogs. No. 1 seed, 
No. 13 seed, that's nothing but a number. We're not good enough to 
look past anyone.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Ford Unit Suspends Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian subsidiary of Ford Motor  
Co. is suspending production for two weeks because of a scarcity of 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of difficulties in obtaining parts and components we  
will stop production between March 22 and April 5,'' a company 
spokeswoman said Thursday, refusing to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leader Alfredo Cavalcanti said Ford's troubles were due to  
the recent devaluation of the country's currency which has made 
imported parts more expensive. He did not know what percentage of 
the parts used by Ford were imported. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency, the real, has lost 35 percent of its value since  
it was devalued on Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavalcanti said that because of the lack of parts, Ford has been  
unable to complete about 3,000 unfinished vehicles at its plant in 
the industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo on the outskirts of 
Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford is negotiating with local auto parts suppliers who are  
also having trouble because of the devaluation'', Cavalcanti said. 
``Hopefully the situation will be normalized by April 5.''

<HEADLINE> Euro Bankers Leave Bank Rates Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Despite the arrival of weaker than  
expected economic data, European Central Bank policy-makers kept 
interest rates unchanged at 3 percent at their regular meeting 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bankers did not act Thursday, many economists expect  
them to lower the key refinancing rate in the 11 nations that share 
the euro, the new single currency, to 2.75 percent later in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, a German think tank, the Ifo institute,  
reported that business confidence in western Germany was less 
optimistic in February than January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Munich-based Ifo tracks sentiment and prospects in the  
manufacturing, construction and wholesaling sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was the latest in a series of weak economic data that  
should persuade the central bank to lower rates, said Stefan 
Pelgrim, an analyst at Commerzbank. ``They're so weak that there's 
need to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, in its March monthly report released Wednesday, ruled  
out any near-term action, saying that the current economic picture 
did not suggest a need to change rates. The report noted that the 
outlook for inflation -- the bank's key monetary goal -- remained 
``favorable,'' and that the risks of rising prices were ``broadly 
unchanged on balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, all these factors argue in favor of an  
unchanged monetary policy stance,'' the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden resignation of German Finance Minister Oskar  
Lafontaine last week removed the main political proponent of 
lowering rates, diminishing any suggestion that a rate change would 
be politically influenced.

<HEADLINE> Supporting Actors Have Also Starred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Academy Award nominees for best  
supporting actor of 1998 share one thing in common: All five have 
also played leading roles. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, actors have challenged the taboo against stars  
accepting less than major roles in movies. The conventional wisdom 
insisted that stars who did so would send a signal that their 
careers were on the slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, you never know who will turn up for a brief turn in a  
movie. Robin Williams, Robert De Niro, George Clooney, John 
Travolta, Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Al Pacino and Sean 
Connery are among those who have played lesser roles for a fraction 
of their usual salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's a trend, because some of the best roles are  
supporting roles,'' says nominee James Coburn. ``It doesn't really 
matter to me. It's a pleasure to be supporting somebody who has to 
carry the picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The supporting actor nominees:  

</P>
<P>
                  	 *JAMES COBURN, ``Affliction''    	
</P>
<P>
	Coburn's two-week job as Nick Nolte's boozing, abusive father in  
``Affliction'' was enough to bring his first Academy nomination. He 
has been in films since 1959 and has starred in Sam Peckinpah's 
``Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid'' and the James Bond spoofs ``Our 
Man Flint'' and ``In Like Flint.'' His busy career came to a 
near-halt in the 1980s when he was stricken with crippling 
arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't quit acting, but I could only take jobs where I  
didn't have to do very much,'' he says. ``That lasted for about 12 
years.'' He recovered and has been more active in the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn, recently seen in an amusing supporting role alongside  
Mel Gibson in ``Payback,'' said he had no second thoughts about 
accepting ``Affliction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was such quality to it that I had no doubts at all,''  
says the actor. ``When you're playing with Nick (Nolte), Sissy 
(Spacek), Mary Beth (Hurt) and working with (director Paul) 
Schrader, that's not anything you could turn down without having a 
hole in your head.'' 

</P>
<P>
                 	 *ROBERT DUVALL, ``A Civil Action''    	
</P>
<P>
	Duvall is a veteran of Academy action, having been nominated six  
times, half as a leading actor, half for support. The leads were in 
``The Great Santini'' (1972), ``Tender Mercies'' (1983), for which 
he received an Oscar, and last year's ``The Apostle,'' which he 
also wrote and directed. 
</P>
<P>
	His first two supporting nominations came for ``The Godfather''  
(1972) and Apocalypse Now'' (1979). In ``A Civil Action,'' he plays 
Jerome Facher, a high-level but homespun attorney who defends a big 
corporation against a class action suit brought by another lawyer, 
played by John Travolta, over pollution of small town's water 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	After stage training off-Broadway and in summer stock, Duvall  
made a brief but memorable film debut as Gregory Peck's 
feeble-minded neighbor in ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1964). With 
``The Godfather,'' he became one of Hollywood busiest actors, both 
in leads and as supporting actor. He has played Dwight D. 
Eisenhower in the television movie ``Ike'' and won praise in TV's 
``Lonesome Dove.'' 

</P>
<P>
                  	 *ED HARRIS, ``The Truman Show''    	
</P>
<P>
	For the second time, Harris has been nominated for playing a  
take-charge commander in a control room, surrounded by banks of 
video monitors. The first time came in 1995 for his role as Gene 
Kranz, in charge of bringing a crippled space capsule back to Earth 
in ``Apollo 13.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Truman Show,'' he appears as the demonic producer of a  
television show about the real life of a young man (Jim Carrey) who 
doesn't know he is being filmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Tenafly, N.J., Harris played football at Columbia  
University, studied acting at Oklahoma State University and 
graduated in fine arts from the California Institute of the Arts. 
After a few minor film roles, his career was boosted when he played 
astronaut John Glenn in ``The Right Stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris has starred in films such as ``Walker'' and ``Paris  
Trout.'' In recent years he has co-starred with Clint Eastwood in 
``Absolute Power,'' with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage in ``The 
Rock,'' and with Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon in ``Stepmom.'' 

</P>
<P>
              	 *GEOFFREY RUSH, ``Shakespeare in Love''    	
</P>
<P>
	The question about Geoffrey Rush this year was not whether he  
would receive a nomination, but for which picture. The Australian 
gave outstanding performances in both Elizabethan movies -- as 
Walsingham, the bloodthirsty adviser to the queen in ``Elizabeth,'' 
and as Henslowe, the harried theater manager in ``Shakespeare in 
Love.'' Academy voters chose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Australia's leading stage actors, Rush achieved immediate  
international fame as the stammering piano virtuoso in ``Shine.'' 
His performance won the 1996 Oscar as best actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rush was asked if he was more at ease with his second  
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he replied firmly. ``It's a different project and I'm  
two years older, but you don't get used to something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His feelings now? ``Terror.''  

</P>
<P>
               	 *BILLY BOB THORNTON, ``A Simple Plan''    	
</P>
<P>
	Good ol' Arkansas boy Thornton burst onto the movie landscape  
two years ago with his nomination as best actor for his gripping 
portrait of a mentally retarded man in ``Sling Blade.'' He also 
wrote and directed the film and won the Oscar for original 
screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
	Most filmgoers had never heard of Thornton before, but he likes  
to remind people, ``I've been around for 20 years.'' He was 
nominated this year for his role as Jacob Mitchell in ``A Simple 
Plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thornton has made a specialty of playing country boys, sometimes  
good ones, sometimes not so good. Among his films: ``One False 
Move'' (which he wrote and starred in), ``Dead Man,'' ``The 
Winner,'' ``Armageddon,'' ``Primary Colors'' and ``U-Turn.''

<HEADLINE>  Boxing Judge Discusses Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Lennox Lewis fumed about being ``robbed,''  
the judge at the center of Lewis' controversial draw with Evander 
Holyfield maintained she scored it the way she saw it. 
</P>
<P>
	And apparently she couldn't see it as well as the other two  
judges because of her ringside position.. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at a state Senate hearing Thursday if she had any second  
thoughts about scoring the fight for Holyfield in wake of the 
controversy, Jean Williams said, ``No sir, I scored what I saw when 
I saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She saw it 115-113 for Holyfield.  
</P>
<P>
	Much has been made of Williams scoring the fifth round for  
Holyfield although Lewis, the WBC champion from Britain, outpunched 
WBA-IBF champion Holyfield 43-11 and had him pinned on the ropes 
for about 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Roy Goodman, chairman of Senate Committee on  
Investigations, asked Williams how she would score the round after 
she watched a tape of it at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like Lewis won that round,'' Williams said. ``But  
what I saw on TV is not what I saw that night. Certain punches I 
saw now I don't remember seeing them that night because of movement 
of (ringside) the photographer and the position of Lewis' body. 
What I saw in each individual round is what I scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, appointed by the IBF, was backed up by WBC judge Larry  
O'Connell of England, who scored the fight even at 115-115. WBA 
judge Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa favored Lewis 116-113. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did notice she had the worse seat of the lot because she was  
surrounded by photographers,'' O'Connell told the hearing by 
telephone from England. ``You do miss things from different angles 
of the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell and Christodoulou did not have photographers around  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	If Williams had scored the fifth round for Lewis, her score  
would have been 114-114 and the outcome would have been the same 
because it would have been a majority draw. A fighter must win on 
two cards to get a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	`Everything should be looked into,'' Lewis said Thursday upon  
his return to London. Frank Maloney, Lewis' manager, however, said 
he didn't believe bribes had been paid, but that it was more a case 
of incompetent judging. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has convened a  
grand jury to issue subpoenas and gather testimony about the 
unification fight. The New York State Athletic Commission also is 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Williams and O'Connell adamantly denied anyone tried to  
influence their scoring in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman asked Williams, a $39,200-a-year account clerk from  
Atlantic City, if anyone attempted to use her filing for bankruptcy 
to influence her judging. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	King also testified Thursday, saying, ``I have nothing to do  
with the selection of officials. I have no interest in who they 
will select.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Sulaiman, president of the WBC, spoke to the hearing by  
telephone from Mexico City and said he hadn't wanted either an 
American or British judge, but three neutral judges. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gilberto Mendoza of Venezuela selected Christodoulou,  
Sulaiman said he picked Daniel van de Wiele of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Of IBF president Bob Lee's selection of Williams, a judge for 10  
years, Sulaiman said, ``It was not a good choice and I told that to 
Mr. Tony Russo (executive secretary of the New York commission). I 
said we needed an experienced official.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Lee picked Williams, Sulaiman said he told Russo '' for  
reasons of neutrality (on American, one British and one neutral 
judge) and for some protection for our champion, I would appoint 
Mr. Larry O'Connell.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Calls `Vitamin O' Ads Deceptive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A ``Vitamin O'' dietary supplement  
advertised in USA Today and other newspapers as a cure for cancer 
is nothing more than bottled salt water sold for $10 an ounce, the 
government says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission is asking a federal judge here to  
bar two Washington state companies from making what the FTC says 
are false and unsubstantiated claims about the product. A hearing 
is set for April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC ultimately wants to force Kettle Falls-based Rose Creek  
Health Products Inc. and The Staff of Life Inc. to refund 
customers' money. 
</P>
<P>
	An ad that ran in USA Today claims Vitamin O ``has helped  
eliminate everything from breathing problems and lack of energy to 
life-threatening diseases'' such as cancer and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	An Food and Drug Administration lab analyzed the liquid and  
found it to be nothing more than salt water, said Eleanor Durham, 
an FTC attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald L. Smyth, owner of both Rose Creek and The Staff of Life,  
did not return a call Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has several pending complaints against producers of  
dietary supplements that purport to cure various ailments. Such 
products are frequently advertised in alternative medicine 
publications and can be sold without approval from the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vitamin O case is unusual because the product has recently  
been promoted in newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank To Raise More Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest  
commercial bank, plans to raise 6 billion marks, or about $3.37 
billion, to expand in Europe and finance its purchase of Bankers 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which is one-third more than Deutsche previously said  
it would raise, is needed to take full advantage of opportunities 
to penetrate the European market, chairman Rolf Breuer said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was a possibility of making acquisitions or  
forming alliances. 
</P>
<P>
	When it first announced the $10.1 billion takeover Bankers  
Trust, Deutsche Bank had said it would need to raise about 4 
billion marks on the capital market. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite lawsuits by Holocaust victims, Breuer said he expects  
Deutsche Bank's acquisition of Bankers Trust to be completed by 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank is one of many German companies facing  
class-action suits in the United States filed by Holocaust 
survivors, accusing them of profiting from slave labor or the Nazi 
expropriation of Jewish assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits could delay regulatory approval of the takeover.  
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank also announced that net profits more than tripled  
to 3.38 billion marks, or $1.9 billion, last year from 1.02 billion 
marks in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings were boosted by extraordinary gains from a special  
bonus dividend paid out by DaimlerChrysler last year. Deutsche Bank 
has a 12 percent stake in DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial crises in Russia, southeast Asia and Latin America  
pushed trading profits down nearly 4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes Drug Debate Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Liver-related deaths linked to the diabetes  
drug Rezulin increased dramatically last year, despite claims by 
the manufacturer that there had been fewer fatalities, the Los 
Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin was listed as a contributing factor in the deaths of 65  
people last year -- more than four times as many as in 1997, the 
newspaper reported, citing federal records. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first six weeks of 1999, 12 liver-related deaths were  
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 155 Rezulin patients have died since the drug went on  
the market in 1997. About 60 percent of the patients showed signs 
of liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the federal records, some of the patients had other  
health conditions, including stroke, cancer and heart attacks, that 
could have contributed to or caused their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert Co., whose sales of Rezulin have topped $1  
billion, assured the FDA in a letter dated Dec. 31 that 
liver-related deaths associated with the drug had declined 65 
percent over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin helps control blood-sugar levels. The same FDA advisory  
panel that approved Rezulin in 1996 is expected to vote March 26 on 
whether to restrict or ban the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined to comment specifically on the  
deaths, saying only that the drug's risks should be weighed against 
its benefits in treating adult-onset diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert spokesman Stephen Mock last December that he  
wasn't aware of a Rezulin-related death since July. The Times said 
FDA records show the company reported 31 deaths to federal 
officials between July 28 and Dec. 17.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Neilson Suspended Two Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers coach Roger Neilson was  
suspended for two games and fined $10,000 Thursday for throwing a 
stick onto the ice in Tuesday's loss in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson will miss Sunday's game against Detroit and Monday's  
game in Toronto. Craig Ramsey will coach the team in Neilson's 
absence, with Neilson watching the games but prohibited from 
communicating with the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson tossed the stick in the direction of referee Bill  
McCreary to protest the lack of a penalty call on which St. Louis 
scored. He narrowly missed linesman Lonnie Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson said he was not trying to hit Cameron but rather get  
McCreary's attention at the 6:47 mark of the third period in a 5-2 
loss to the Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a reaction and protest to what we thought was a  
non-call and I fired a stick,'' Neilson said. ``There's not too 
much you can say about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson and Flyers general manager Bob Clarke had a conference  
call Thursday with NHL disciplinarian Colin Campbell and vice 
president Jim Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
	A referee's report acknowledged there was no intent on Neilson's  
part to hit one of them, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just an emotional outburst and he fired the stick out  
onto the ice,'' Clarke said. ``Now he's got to pay the price ... 
We're obviously glad it's only two games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension comes with the Flyers in the midst of a  
team-record 12-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The team had Thursday off and will resume practice Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Neilson has said he's been ejected from several games during his  
coaching career but never suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	On the disputed play, St. Louis' Terry Yake appeared to hold  
Jody Hull's stick. That gave Chris Pronger a clear path to set up 
Pavol Demitra for the goal that gave the Blues a 3-1 lead.

<HEADLINE> LA Philharmonic Leader Is Dramatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With his boyish good looks, quick smile and  
deep eyes, Esa-Pekka Salonen could be mistaken for a Hollywood 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he does frequent the hall where the Academy Awards  
are held. 
</P>
<P>
	But Salonen works with a score, not a script, as the  
internationally respected conductor of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
	With Salonen at its podium, the Los Angeles Philharmonic has  
emerged as one of the world's leading progressive symphonies. The 
orchestra specializes in performing the music of contemporary 
composers, and is considered a leading venue to premiere new work. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Finnish native, who could pass for half his age,  
says he wanted to be a composer and became a conductor by accident. 
As a music student in the late 1970s, Salonen and his friends used 
to play each other's compositions. But someone had to conduct the 
sessions, and Salonen seemed to have a knack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then he became good at it. And the rest is history,'' said  
longtime friend Tapani Lansio. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979 -- only 21 and still in music school -- Salonen made his  
conducting debut with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Six 
years later, the young maestro became music director of the Swedish 
Radio Symphony Orchestra and also was made principal guest 
conductor of the Philharmonia in London. He took the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic's baton in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the lobby of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on a  
recent afternoon, Salonen stared into a paper cup of coffee and 
tried to explain why he was so good at conducting orchestras. He 
only does what comes naturally, he says, and really can't explain 
further. It just happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just try to study the music until I feel I have something to  
say, and then I convey it,'' Salonen said. ``That, more or less, is 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he discussed his passion for conducting, Salonen said he  
``can't imagine life without being a composer,'' and a good-natured 
grin begins to form at the corners of his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has redefined the maestro myth,'' says the Philharmonic's  
symphony violinist and principal concertmaster, Martin Chalifour. 
``He is really able to command respect and authority while seeming 
like one of the troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jorma Panula, a respected composer and former teacher at the  
Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, where Salonen studied for seven 
years, says he spotted the young man's talents immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Salonen's good humor is one of his strongest assets; ``He's able  
to laugh at some of the mistakes he made during the early stages of 
his conducting career,'' said Panula. ``His openness saves him. 
He's still a normal young man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even though he wields a conductor's baton like a magic wand  
and brings inexhaustible energy to his work, Salonen holds as much 
passion for composing. As he jets around the world to conduct, 
Salonen balances a laptop computer on his knees and works on his 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, he told an Associated Press reporter in Helsinki that  
he wanted to take a break from conducting to compose. And next 
year, he finally will. He plans to write an opera, and is 
deliberate and cautious when he talks about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like seeing a building from a distance -- a big building,  
like a cathedral. I can see the shape but the details are still too 
far away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is working under a deadline -- the premiere is scheduled for  
the summer of 2001 at the Aix-en-Provence music festival in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the premiere may be in Europe, the music will be  
decidedly Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can hear in my music that I have been here for a  
few years, and I don't mind it,'' he says. ``In fact, that is the 
whole point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salonen is largely responsible for establishing the  
Philharmonic's identity as an orchestra that premieres new 
composers, and whose repertoire includes a lot of 20th-century 
music. And it is not an easy niche to carve. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a measure of trust that has to be built between the  
music director and the community,'' said Grace Chang of the 
American Symphony Orchestra League in Washington D.C. If the 
audience is disappointed by modern compositions they find too 
difficult to enjoy, they are not likely to be back. 
</P>
<P>
	But Salonen sees spreading new music as a function of the  
orchestra -- to be as much a part of the Los Angeles scene as film, 
television and the visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``A symphony has to tap into the soul of its environment, and we  
try to produce programs which deal with life in Southern 
California,'' Salonen said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent production of Stravinsky's ``The Story of a  
Soldier,'' the characters were switched to contemporary 
Hispanic-American immigrants, and half of the story was performed 
in Spanish. The somewhat risky approach to the production was 
well-received by critics. 
</P>
<P>
	And his best-regarded work to date is titled ``L.A.  
Variations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he talks about his feelings for Los Angeles, he begins to  
fidget on his chair and his hands start to move as if he is 
conducting his own thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those (composers) who never change -- Schonberg came  
to L.A. to live and didn't change one bit. Stravinsky came here and 
changed a lot, and right away,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he raises his hand, as if to call a halt, and says with a  
grin, ``but I mean no comparison here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salonen finds some aspects of working in Los Angeles tough.  
Among the hardest, he says, is the general decline in music 
appreciation in local schools. And he notes that American 
television rarely broadcasts classical music. 
</P>
<P>
	``The natural sources from which a teen-ager would get a glimpse  
of classical music have dried up,'' he said. ``Even the background 
music of cartoons -- in the '60s and '70s you would have heard a 
symphony orchestra. Now, if you watch a cartoon, you hear a 
synthesizer or technopop in the background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salonen himself picked up his interest in playing music on his  
own. His father was a businessman, who enjoyed but never played 
music. Salonen entered music school as a French horn student. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still keep an old one in the bottom of a closet of my summer  
house in Finland,'' he says, as a dimpled grin takes over his face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it out once a year and use it just to scare away  
crows,'' he laughed. ``I make an awful noise.''

<HEADLINE> Gambling Addiction Report Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 20 million Americans have or could  
develop gambling problems, but the economic impact of that is 
``relatively small,'' concludes a study likely to further enflame 
the debate over legalized wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey conducted for the National Gambling Impact Study  
Commission found that more than 5 million Americans are 
pathological or problem gamblers and an additional 15 million are 
at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A second report, also released Thursday as the commission began  
two days of meetings in Washington, estimated that 1.8 million 
Americans suffer severe ``pathological'' gambling each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has three months to finish a wide-ranging report  
on gambling for Congress, and the extent of compulsive gambling in 
the country is just one of several open issues. Yet gambling 
addiction is the most contentious topic, and the report on the 
survey conducted for the commission only widened the chasm between 
the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr., president of the American Gaming  
Association, alleged that an earlier draft of the report was 
retooled to exaggerate the dangers of gambling through sensational 
language and changes in conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he noted that the report ``confirms that the economic and  
social benefits of gaming far outweigh the costs to society of 
pathological and problem gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report's classification of 15 million Americans as ``at  
risk'' for developing a gambling problem was criticized by 
Fahrenkopf and some commission members. 
</P>
<P>
	Survey participants who said they gambled just once to relieve  
uncomfortable feelings were put in the ``at risk'' group, said 
commission member John Wilhelm, general president of the Hotel 
Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members were troubled by the report's finding that the  
economic cost of problem gambling is ``relatively small'' -- about 
$5 billion a year in legal fees for divorce, court and jail costs 
for arrests, lost wages and bankruptcy. That compares with $72 
billion for smoking, $166 billion for alcohol abuse and $71 billion 
for motor vehicle crashes, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Dobson, president of Focus on the Family and the panel's  
most outspoken opponent of gambling, said the $5 billion estimate 
of gambling's cost is far too low. He wondered how to calculate the 
costs of child abuse or spousal abuse committed by a gambling 
addict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody on the commission has really struggled with this:  
How do you estimate the social cost?'' said commission Chairwoman 
Kay James. ``It's very difficult to do. At best, I think what we 
can say at this point is we really need more research, we need more 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerstone of the commission's work on the topic, the  
national survey, was conducted by the National Opinion Research 
Center at the University of Chicago in collaboration with other 
researchers. It is the first widespread survey since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that 2.5 million Americans are ``pathological''  
gamblers, a disorder codified in 1994 by the American Psychiatric 
Association, and another 3 million are problem gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining telephone surveys with interviews at casinos, the  
report concluded that people are about twice as likely to be 
problem or pathological gamblers if a casino is within 50 miles of 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Horn, spokesman for the National Coalition Against  
Legalized Gambling, said he was stunned at the finding that 6.4 
percent of casino patrons interviewed were pathological gamblers 
and 4.6 percent were problem gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means more than one in 10 people in a casino need  
psychiatric help,'' Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, by the National Research Council -- part of the  
National Academy of Sciences, an independent organization chartered 
by Congress to advise the government -- says pathological gamblers 
are far more likely to commit crimes, run up large debts, damage 
relationships and kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Pathological gambling is ``a significant enough problem'' to  
warrant funding ``a more sustained, comprehensive and scientific 
set of research activities than currently exists,'' the study says. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has just started discussing what steps to  
recommend to Congress. One mentioned Thursday would require 
casinos, state lotteries, the horse racing industry and other 
gambling outlets to help fund prevent and treatment programs for 
problem gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission member Richard C. Leone, president of the Twentieth  
Century Fund and a former state treasurer of New Jersey, said he 
worries that the nation is becoming one big compulsive gambler, 
with states battling it out to see who can capture the most dollars 
through casinos, lotteries, video poker and other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I view it as a kind of national psychosis,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Strike Eases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Taxi drivers began withdrawing their  
blockades Thursday after Ecuador's president annulled a gasoline 
price increase to defuse a bitter standoff that paralyzed cities 
for three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Private cars circulated freely and most striking taxi and bus  
drivers went back to work. Long lines of cars formed at gas 
stations to buy the cheaper gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The main demand of striking drivers had been that President  
Jamil Mahuad revoke a decree doubling gasoline prices they argued 
would bankrupt them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good news. I'm going back to work. But the drivers are  
still cautious. We'll shut the country down again if Mahuad tricks 
us,'' Quito taxi driver Antonio Puertas said. 
</P>
<P>
	While many strikers went back to work, others stayed at their  
barricades of burning tires and fallen trees after the taxi union 
said the government's offer was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to lowering gas prices, union leaders said they  
wanted the government to freeze gas prices at the lower levels for 
two years and release 68 strikers detained by police during 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to cause chaos, but we will continue the strike  
if we don't get our demands,'' taxi union leader Samuel Egas said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news conference at the presidential palace, Mahuad  
announced an agreement with leftist and center-left parties in 
Congress to pass vital economic austerity measures in exchange for 
annulling the price rise and ending a 60-day state of emergency he 
declared last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this I call on the country to return to normality and  
peace,'' Mahuad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahuad last week ordered the banks closed to prevent a financial  
meltdown and announced a package of spending cuts and tax increases 
to rescue the South American nation from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Furious leftist-led unions, students and Indian groups had vowed  
to force Mahuad to back down. 
</P>
<P>
	The new coalition agreed to approve tax increases and leave in  
place a controversial decree partially freezing bank accounts for 
six months to a year, Mahuad said. The partial freeze was to 
prevent a run on bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis was set off by last year's El Nino floods,  
which caused $2.6 billion in damage, and low world prices for oil, 
Ecuador's major export. 
</P>
<P>
	The government this year has had to bail out seven of Ecuador's  
39 banks. Its currency, the sucre, has lost more than 40 percent of 
its value, and inflation is at nearly 50 percent, the highest in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement followed days of intense negotiations between  
Mahuad and opposition leaders after the Social Christian party, his 
former conservative ally, said it would not support most of the 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The rupture of relations had cast doubts on Mahuad's ability to  
pass the reforms and led to calls for Mahuad, who took office seven 
months ago, to step down. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of food and fuel had doubled under the measures,  
increasing the hardship of already poor Ecuadoreans. Many people 
had supported the striking drivers.

<HEADLINE>  Boxing Judge Discusses Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Lennox Lewis fumed about being ``robbed,''  
the judge at the center of Lewis' controversial draw with Evander 
Holyfield maintained she scored it the way she saw it. 
</P>
<P>
	And apparently she couldn't see it as well as the other two  
judges because of her ringside position.. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at a state Senate hearing Thursday if she had any second  
thoughts about scoring the fight for Holyfield in wake of the 
controversy, Jean Williams said, ``No sir, I scored what I saw when 
I saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She saw it 115-113 for Holyfield.  
</P>
<P>
	Much has been made of Williams scoring the fifth round for  
Holyfield although Lewis, the WBC champion from Britain, outpunched 
WBA-IBF champion Holyfield 43-11 and had him pinned on the ropes 
for about 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Roy Goodman, chairman of Senate Committee on  
Investigations, asked Williams how she would score the round after 
she watched a tape of it at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like Lewis won that round,'' Williams said. ``But  
what I saw on TV is not what I saw that night. Certain punches I 
saw now I don't remember seeing them that night because of movement 
of (ringside) the photographer and the position of Lewis' body. 
What I saw in each individual round is what I scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, appointed by the IBF, was backed up by WBC judge Larry  
O'Connell of England, who scored the fight even at 115-115. WBA 
judge Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa favored Lewis 116-113. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did notice she had the worse seat of the lot because she was  
surrounded by photographers,'' O'Connell told the hearing by 
telephone from England. ``You do miss things from different angles 
of the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell and Christodoulou did not have photographers around  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	If Williams had scored the fifth round for Lewis, her score  
would have been 114-114 and the outcome would have been the same 
because it would have been a majority draw. A fighter must win on 
two cards to get a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	`Everything should be looked into,'' Lewis said Thursday upon  
his return to London. Frank Maloney, Lewis' manager, however, said 
he didn't believe bribes had been paid, but that it was more a case 
of incompetent judging. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has convened a  
grand jury to issue subpoenas and gather testimony about the 
unification fight. The New York State Athletic Commission also is 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Williams and O'Connell adamantly denied anyone tried to  
influence their scoring in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman asked Williams, a $39,200-a-year account clerk from  
Atlantic City, if anyone attempted to use her filing for bankruptcy 
to influence her judging. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	King also testified Thursday, saying, ``I have nothing to do  
with the selection of officials. I have no interest in who they 
will select.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Sulaiman, president of the WBC, spoke to the hearing by  
telephone from Mexico City and said he hadn't wanted either an 
American or British judge, but three neutral judges. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gilberto Mendoza of Venezuela selected Christodoulou,  
Sulaiman said he picked Daniel van de Wiele of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Of IBF president Bob Lee's selection of Williams, a judge for 10  
years, Sulaiman said, ``It was not a good choice and I told that to 
Mr. Tony Russo (executive secretary of the New York commission). I 
said we needed an experienced official.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Lee picked Williams, Sulaiman said he told Russo '' for  
reasons of neutrality (on American, one British and one neutral 
judge) and for some protection for our champion, I would appoint 
Mr. Larry O'Connell.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Browser May Edge Netscape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft's new Internet Explorer 5.0  
software makes navigating the World Wide Web faster and easier, 
offering minor improvements that could lengthen the software 
maker's lead over Netscape's once-dominant Navigator. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web browser released Thursday features a ``radio toolbar''  
that allows a user to listen to radio broadcasts over the Internet 
and still continue browsing. Microsoft Corp. says the software also 
uses less hard disk space on the computer and simplifies many tasks 
that tended to confound novice users. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for minor cosmetic differences, the new browser looks  
much the same as version 4.0, which was released in September 1997 
and enmeshed in Windows 98, launched last June. 
</P>
<P>
	But the improvements could give Microsoft an extra edge over  
Netscape's Navigator, the first widely used Internet browser that 
has withered in the face of Microsoft's bruising counterattack. The 
struggling Internet pioneer was bought by America Online for $9.8 
billion on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser edged Navigator's market  
share in 1998. IE had 43.8 percent of the market vs. Netscape's 
41.5 percent last fall, according to International Data Corp. A 
year earlier, IE had 39 percent vs. 50.5 percent for Navigator. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is battling a government antitrust suit that accuses  
it of illegally tying its browser to its Windows operating software 
to squeeze out rivals, notably Netscape. Windows runs roughly 90 
percent of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape is expected to bring out a new version of its Navigator  
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got the ability to get their browser out. We've got  
the ability to get our browser out. At the end of the day, users 
choose,'' Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said at a low-key ceremony 
at the company's television studios here. 
</P>
<P>
	The new software, the fifth version of Internet Explorer, will  
be the centerpiece of an upgrade to the Windows 98 operating system 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Several analysts say the new launch helps keep the product  
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
	The new version is necessary, said analyst Rick Sherlund of  
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., to keep giving consumers compelling reasons to 
buy new computers -- especially since more people are buying 
inexpensive machines intended primarily for e-mail and Internet 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest risk Microsoft has is not the Department of  
Justice, it's stagnation of technology,'' Sherlund said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't appear to be a quantum leap, but it will help  
them,'' said Scott McAdams, president of McAdams Wright Ragen in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft distributes its browser free, and made Internet  
Explorer 5.0 available over its Web site just after midnight. 
Company officials did not immediately have figures on the number of 
copies downloaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said the new browser is easy for Internet businesses to  
customize with their own features. Microsoft announced that six 
leading Web destinations -- AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, Go Network, 
Snap and Yahoo! -- plus its own Microsoft Network, were creating 
customized versions of Internet Explorer for their users. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Vista will provide foreign language translation of  
Web pages. It also will offer Vista Tracker, a personalized window 
in the browser that is constantly updated with news, weather, 
sports and stock information, no matter where else a user might go 
on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, Microsoft will bring out Windows 98 Special Edition,  
an upgrade that will incorporate Internet Explorer 5.0 and other 
new technologies, most notably, Internet Connection Sharing. 
</P>
<P>
	That technology will allow consumers to run up to four different  
computers simultaneously over a single Internet access account. It 
is aimed at multiple computer families where parents and kids 
compete for Internet time.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In a bid to discourage the storage of  
nuclear waste at an Indian reservation, Gov. Mike Leavitt has 
signed a bill requiring eight utilities to shoulder full liability 
in case of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The law strips the power companies, their officers and  
shareholders of a limited legal shield offered to some companies as 
a way of encouraging business development. 
</P>
<P>
	It also requires the governor and the Legislature to approve  
rights of way used to carry the waste to the planned temporary 
storage facility on the Skull Valley Indian Reservation, 40 miles 
west of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is an appropriate thing, given that we have made  
it perfectly clear we don't want this waste here,'' Leavitt said 
Thursday. ``If it's so safe, why don't they just keep it where it 
is?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 135-member Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians is split  
over a proposal to build the facility. Spent radioactive rods from 
power plants would be taken to the reservation to await shipment to 
a permanent storage site yet to be picked by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to make a final  
decision on the plan in 2001. Utah officials have agreed to fund a 
lawsuit by tribal members opposed to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Martin, a spokeswoman for the utilities, said the law is  
unnecessary because the consortium already believed it would be 
liable for an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The utilities involved are Southern California Edison, GPU  
Nuclear Corporation, Northern States Power, Consolidated Edison of 
New York, Illinois Power, Indiana Michigan Power, Southern Nuclear 
Operating Company and Genoatech.

<HEADLINE> Inflation All but Disappears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation all but disappeared -- again -- in  
February, allowing increased wages to flow directly into more 
purchasing power for American workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Price Index edged 0.1 percent higher last month,  
for the third consecutive month, despite a few scattered trouble 
spots such as meat, oranges, school books and airline fares, the 
Labor Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	World economic weakness continued to deliver dividends to U.S.  
buyers, with prices falling for clothing, cars and computers, 
reflecting the influence of imports manufactured in countries with 
devalued currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the department said average weekly earnings for  
American workers, adjusted for inflation, jumped 0.7 percent in 
February, the biggest increase in 18 months. During the past year, 
they have risen 3.6 percent to $452.49, before inflation, and 1.9 
percent after inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increased imports have had a positive effect on the economy by  
keeping prices down, and real consumer purchasing power up,'' said 
economist Dave Huether of the National Association of 
Manufacturers. ``There is no inflation-creep in sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted inflation rate for the first two months  
of the year was just 1.1 percent, compared with a 12-year low of 
1.6 percent for all of 1998. That means Federal Reserve 
policy-makers meeting March 30 probably will feel comfortable 
leaving short-term interest rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Low inflation will keep the Fed on hold throughout 1999,''  
said economist Stan Shipley of Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy costs were unchanged last month, with declines for fuel  
oil and gasoline offsetting increases for electricity and natural 
gas. Energy is down 5.7 percent from a year ago, but analysts 
warned recent big increases for crude oil mean prices at the pump 
will head higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll probably see a 3 percent to 4 percent increase in  
gasoline prices. ... It will be noticed but it won't be huge,'' 
said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, rose only 0.1 percent after a  
substantial 0.5 percent increase in January. Fruit costs went up, 
pushed by a 5.3 percent increase for oranges on top of a 24.1 
percent gain the previous month, reflecting a December freeze in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef rose 1.3 percent, the most in six years, and pork, 1.4  
percent. Still, pork remained 5.3 percent cheaper than a year ago 
and vegetable costs fell 3.4 percent, pulled down by a 20 percent 
drop for tomatoes, the most in almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components edged  
up 0.1 percent in February. Airline fares jumped 2.4 percent. 
Hospital services and textbooks rose, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Further airfare increases probably will appear in the March  
price index, due out next month. Over the weekend, the airline 
industry raised business fares about 1 percent and leisure fares by 
about 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, clothing costs fell 0.2 percent in February, and new  
cars and trucks, 0.3 percent. Computer prices declined 2.8 percent 
and were 34.6 percent lower than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, tobacco costs declined 1.4 percent but were still 33.5  
percent higher than a year earlier, reflecting tobacco companies' 
efforts to recoup the cost of multimillion-dollar liability 
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Count Vs. Hubbell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a  
criminal count against presidential friend Webster Hubbell in a 
fraud indictment that makes references to Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The count accused Hubbell of scheming to conceal work done by  
him and Mrs. Clinton, his former law partner, on a failed Arkansas 
land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson agreed with Hubbell that the  
allegations in the count were too vague. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charging language ... alleges no specific act or acts of  
concealment by 'trick, scheme or device' and no specific 'false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations,'' the 
judge said, citing specific language of federal law. ``It is 
non-specific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had obtained a 15-count  
indictment of Hubbell last November in connection with a land deal 
known as Castle Grande. Federal regulators said the deal was 
riddled with ``insider dealing, fictitious sales and land flips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson dismissed Hubbell's motions to throw out other counts  
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was referred to 36 times in the original indictment  
against Hubbell, signifying that her name could be brought up 
repeatedly in the trial set to begin June 14. She could be called 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's witness list is not due until April 14, lawyers said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons' Whitewater partner, the late James McDougal, tried  
to sell off pieces of Castle Grande to prop up his collapsing 
savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissed count charged that from March 1989 through  
December 1995, Hubbell tried to cover up the true nature of his and 
Mrs. Clinton's relationships with Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth 
Ward; with McDougal's Madison Guaranty bank and the land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also was accused of making ``false and fraudulent''  
statements and representations to two U.S. banking regulatory 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hubbell argues that Count 1 is a 'catch all' count that fails  
to inform him clearly of the precise offense of which he is accused 
so that he may prepare his defense,'' Robertson wrote in 18-page 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He points out reasonably that a jury might convict if it  
unanimously accepted the generality of the charge of 'scheming,' 
although split on which (if any) of the many acts alleged ... 
(that) Hubbell actually committed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office maintained that the count was ``sufficiently  
specific'' and that it was not necessary for that count ``to set 
forth precisely the false statements and acts of concealment upon 
which it depends ...,'' the opinion said. The independent counsel 
contended the concealment scheme was the offense, rather than any 
specific act.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Encourages Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- McDonald's will distribute 13 million booklets  
about the importance of reading with its Happy Meals this fall in 
an educational campaign announced Thursday by Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The booklets will ``explain to parents the importance of  
nourishing their children's minds as well as their bodies,'' Mrs. 
Clinton told members of the Association of American Publishers at 
the group's annual meeting. ``This is a great way to reach out to 
families who, running for a fast-food meal, like all the rest of 
us, are trying to get from one place to the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's will work with the AAP and the Education Department  
on the effort, which begins October. 
</P>
<P>
	The AAP also will sponsor a ``Get Caught Reading'' campaign to  
help spark interest among people ages 18 to 34, whom the first lady 
called a ``critical age group because it includes, obviously, the 
parents of very many young children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign will feature posters in major bookstores and  
various print advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's message that reading is cool will be aired by celebrities  
like Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell, who are going to be among 
those 'getting caught,''' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping that the 'Get Caught Reading' ads will have enough  
of a rebellious twist to encourage people who might otherwise not 
be caught dead reading to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said not all parents realize that reading to  
children can help build vocabularies, develop imaginations and 
improve their reasoning skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of take it for granted if you come from a family that  
loves books or if you've been read to as a child that that is 
something that's constantly going on in homes and families, but I 
learned early on that that's not the case,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AAP is a national trade group that represents about 200  
commercial book publishers, including university presses and 
scholarly societies.

<HEADLINE> Co. To Refund Termite System Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who took the bait that a termite  
removal system would prevent pests from infesting and damaging 
their homes can get their money back under a settlement announced 
Thursday by the maker of the product and government regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	United Industries Corp., which manufactures Terminate, has  
agreed to refund customers and modify advertising for its termite 
bait system. The Federal Trade Commission, the District of Columbia 
and nine state attorneys general had charged that the company's 
claims about the use and effectiveness of Terminate was deceptive 
and unsubstantiated. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the complaint, the company, based in St. Louis,  
advertised Terminate as ``the first do-it-yourself termite home 
defense system.'' The promotional materials imply that users only 
have to place bait stakes in the ground around their home and 
Terminate would do the rest, the complaint charged. 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission said consumers must actually inspect the bait  
stakes every two to three months or more frequently, add additional 
stakes where termite activity exists and replace or remove the 
stakes every nine months, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also failed to let consumers know that bait stakes  
do not work against drywood termites, the FTC said, and that 
professional pest control services are recommended for homes with 
active infestation or in areas with drywood or Formosan termites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Termites cause serious damage and consumers spend serious  
money trying to deal with it,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of 
FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. The commission has the 
authority to regulate truth in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Terminate is sold through national home improvement stores and  
regional chains for $60 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement filed in U.S. District Court in Baltimore,  
the company will not make any such claims without reliable 
scientific data to support them. The company must also disclose in 
its advertising that the product is ``not recommended as sole 
protection against termites, and for active infestations, get a 
professional inspection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company said adding this statement is consistent with its  
past communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement does not change the overall message that we  
have been sending since the product's launch. It does, however, 
make some clarification in these communications,'' said Jim Olsen, 
general manager of termite products for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Terminate label lists four steps consumers should  
take in addition to using the product to reduce the risk of 
infestations. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may seek a refund within 15 months of purchase of the  
product. 
</P>
<P>
	The order also requires the company to pay the District of  
Columbia and the following nine states $40,000 each for 
investigation and litigation expenses: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, 
Maryland, Ohio, New Jersey, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hurt When Object Falls in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 15-foot aluminum pole fell 22 stories from the  
building where the ball drops on New Year's Eve, injuring three 
people Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-inch thick rod was holding a 50-foot wide canvas sign that  
apparently broke loose in high winds at 1 Times Square. As the sign 
came loose, it struck a bank of lights along the building, 
showering debris onto crowded West 42nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The pole struck three women -- a traffic officer and two people  
walking to lunch. One suffered a cut to the head, another was cut 
in the hand and the third was hit in the back. All were 
hospitalized in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said a police officer saw debris falling  
and warned the women to move -- an act that probably saved their 
lives. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Priceline.com Files for IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Priceline.com, the Internet travel  
company that allows consumers to name their price for airline 
tickets, disclosed plans Thursday to sell 10 million shares in an 
initial public offering that would raise about $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the  
company said it expects the shares to start selling at between $7 
and $9. The company has applied to trade on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Star Trek'' actor William Shatner as its pitchman,  
priceline.com has become familiar to consumers since it launched 
its service last April. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says it has sold more than 237,000 airline tickets  
by allowing customers to name the price they want to pay, then 
searching for a major airline willing to release seats on flights 
where they have unsold space. No match, no tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company offers similar buying services for hotel rooms,  
mortgages and new cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel industry analysts predicted strong demand for the  
company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the most advertised Web site on radio that I've  
ever seen in my life,'' said Tom Parsons, editor and publisher of 
Bestfares.com magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The company originally filed in December but had not said how  
many shares it would offer or given its estimate on the initial 
selling price. 
</P>
<P>
	In its amended filing Thursday, the company said sale of the 10  
million shares represents a 8 percent stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	In its filing, the company said it sold 135,000 airline tickets  
in 1998, with revenue of $35 million. In the first 60 days of 1999, 
it sold 102,700 tickets, with revenue of $21 million.

<HEADLINE> Train Crash a Nightmare for Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NESBIT, Miss. (AP) -- Rainey and Lacey Lipscomb wanted to spend  
the night on the train with their hometown friends, the ones who 
had joined them on a spring break trip to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Cindy Lipscomb saw her two oldest daughters was  
when they kissed her goodnight Monday and headed to the front 
sleeper car of Amtrak's City of New Orleans train to join June 
Bonnin, 46, and her granddaughter, Jessica Whitaker, 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour later, the train plowed into a tractor-trailer  
loaded with steel and derailed. Leaking diesel fuel erupted in 
flames. Dazed but unhurt, Ms. Lipscomb searched frantically for 
10-year-old Rainey and 8-year-old Lacey. The three girls and Ms. 
Bonnin, all from this suburb of Memphis, Tenn., were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to die when I saw the flames because I knew,'' Ms.  
Lipscomb told The Commercial Appeal of Memphis. ``It was either lay 
down and die or pray, and I just sat down and prayed. It just felt 
like my heart was ripped out of my chest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lipscomb's youngest daughter, Jesse Anne, 5, was unhurt.  
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not officially released the names of those  
killed in the crash. More than 100 people were injured, including 
Ashley Bonnin, Ms. Bonnin's 8-year-old daughter, who lost part of a 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``She thought she might be a bit able to do more to get my wife,  
June, out of that car,'' Max Bonnin said Wednesday. ``We assured 
her that she did everything that she possibly could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheena Johnson Dowe, a senior at Tougaloo College in suburban  
Jackson was also among the fatalities, WLBT-TV in Jackson reported 
Wednesday. Dowe, her sister and three children were returning home 
after a trip to visit their mother in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> House Ponders Own Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top House leaders are weighing a plan to help  
lawmakers to a cost of living increase, a boost that could add 
about $5,000 to an annual salary of $136,673. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., raised the issue at a meeting  
earlier this year with Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, according 
to aides to the two men. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert told reporters today that current law permits members of  
Congress to have a raise and that many of them need it to support 
families with children, some of whom are in college. ``They need to 
have a life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters today that leaders in both  
parties are consulting with their rank and file. He said he thought 
a periodic cost of living increase ``is appropriate.'' He added 
that the House should vote publicly on any recommended increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress last received an increase two years ago,  
after the Republican and Democratic leadership agreed not to make a 
political issue of the subject. In other years, lawmakers have 
voted to stop the increase from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no noticeable public backlash against the 1997  
pay increase, some lawmakers objected at the time. The issue would 
almost certainly provoke debate on the House floor again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1989 law, lawmakers are entitled to a cost of living  
increase that is pegged to the pay raise the president proposes 
each year for federal workers. President Clinton recommended a 4.4 
percent increase for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. A 4 
percent increase in congressional pay would amount to more than 
$5,400 and raise the salary to more than $142,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While aides said a cost-of-living increase stands a good chance  
of taking effect, a separate proposal for an increase in 
compensation seemed to be faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion, floated by Rep. Bill Thomas of California, would  
allow most lawmakers to claim a $125 per day allowance to defray 
their living expenses in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The allowance could be claimed for any day the House meets, to  
be paid from the funds set aside for office expenses. Thus, any 
money the lawmaker claimed personally would have to come from staff 
salaries or other expenses such as equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Congress met for little more than a third of the year,  
lawmakers would be eligible for more than $14,000 in increased 
compensation -- an increase of more than 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has suggested making the change administratively by a  
vote of the House Administration Committee, which he chairs, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senior aides, as well as some lawmakers, said Thomas'  
proposal had attracted interest among the members, particularly 
from lawmakers who received a similar benefit when they were 
members of state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert distanced himself from the proposal during the day.  
``There are a lot of proposals out there and the speaker does not 
endorse this one,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for the speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas issued a written statement late in the day saying the  
panel would consider the proposal ``only at the request of the 
House leadership. ... The House Administration Committee, appointed 
by the speaker and the minority leader, would be responsive to the 
leadership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other aides and lawmakers noted that any lawmaker could force a  
vote on the proposal when the regular spending bill covering 
congressional expenses goes to the floor, regardless of what action 
the House Administration Committee took. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, a cost-of-living increase has greater appeal to  
some lawmakers than the suggested per diem. Congressional pensions 
are calculated on the basis of pay, and one official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said some veteran lawmakers would rather 
have a cost of living increase than the per diem allowance, even 
though it would cost them money in the short run.

``But we don't know if these talks will lead anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Judge: Pay Cuba Shootdown Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge today ordered more than $6.2  
million owed to Cuba by U.S. phone companies be paid instead to the 
families of three Cuban-Americans killed when their small planes 
were shot down by Cuban jets in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of three of four fliers killed in the attack won a  
judgment of $187 million against the Republic of Cuba and the Cuban 
Air Force in 1997, but had been unable to collect. 
</P>
<P>
	They then asked U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King,  
who awarded them the $187 million judgment, to let them seize Cuban 
assets in the United States -- including payments owed to Cuba by 
telephone companies doing business with the communist-controlled 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	King ruled today that they could have the telephone funds.  
</P>
<P>
	They money is paid to Cuba's ETECSA phone company by U.S.  
telephone companies as Havana's share of the payments for 
long-distance calls from the United States to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest by far, according to King, must come from AT&AMP;T, more  
than $4.1 million, and MCI International Inc., about $1.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's telephone company severed most direct service to the  
United States Feb. 25 because U.S. telephone companies have been 
withholding payments pending King's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone service was slowed but not stopped as U.S. carriers  
rerouted calls to the island, apparently through third countries or 
onto Sprint telephone lines, which were not affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members of the Miami-based group Brothers to the Rescue who  
were searching for refugees on rafts were killed when Cuban MiGs 
shot down two private planes in the Florida Straits on Feb. 24, 
1996. Three of them were U.S. citizens, making their families 
eligible to sue under U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
	After the judgment was awarded, the relatives first went after  
tens of millions of dollars in Cuban assets in the United States 
frozen by the State Department since the 1960s, but ran into 
opposition from the State and Treasury departments. 
</P>
<P>
	The families' effort to garnishee the telephone funds had also  
been opposed by the Clinton administration, which argued the U.S. 
trade embargo bans any financial dealings with Cuba, including 
garnishments, unless specifically licensed by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials also argued that the Cuban phone company, ETECSA, a  
joint venture between the Cuban government and an Italian company, 
is an independent company and therefore cannot be affected by the 
relatives' suit against the Cuban government.

<HEADLINE> Nike Third-Quarter Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Third-quarter earnings at Nike Inc. rose  
70 percent, partly on the strength of cost-cutting efforts that 
included a cutback on NBA endorsements, as the sneaker giant 
handily beat Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beaverton-based company earned $124.2 million or 44 cents a  
share, compared to $73.1 million, or 25 cents a share, for the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the three months ended Feb. 28 was $2.18 billion,  
down 2 percent from $2.22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had projected earnings of  
38 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Phil Knight said the effort to hold down expenses would  
continue because domestic demand remained weaker than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite continued softness in the U.S. athletic footwear and  
apparel retail market, we are beginning to see signs of increased 
consumer demand for our footwear,'' Knight said. ``While we are 
encouraged by these early indicators, we remain cautious on our 
prospects for near-term growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Future orders for athletic footwear and apparel has fallen, with  
orders scheduled for delivery between March and July 1999 down 4 
percent to $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders fell 6 percent in the United States and 16 percent in  
Asia but increased 8 percent in Europe, which has repeatedly been a 
strong market for Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the company performed a little better than they  
expected, but they remain concerned about the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Near term the outlook isn't as rosy as the long-term  
outlook,'' said Josie Esquivel of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New 
York. ``They're not going to rebound the way they did in 1995.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Nike stock prices may have been a little high recently,  
but the company has shown a strong recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're definitely on their way back,'' Esquivel said.  
</P>
<P>
	The results were released after the markets had closed Thursday.  
Shares of Nike fell $2.37 1/2 to close at $55 in trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Farmer Averts Bus Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alabama farmer Harold McCool heard his wife  
scream. Then he saw the driver of their tour bus slumped over the 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time I got up there, the bus was off the side of the  
road knocking down street lights,'' McCool said Thursday in a 
telephone interview after returning home to Gordo, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grabbed the steering wheel -- we were heading toward the lake  
then -- I just got hold of it the best I could and tried to get us 
away from the trees and the water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Park Police on Thursday credited McCool and fellow  
quick-thinking Alabama poultry farmer John Miller of Coaling with 
averting a potential disaster after their tour bus driver suffered 
a fatal heart attack Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman David Mulholland said McCool and Miller got the  
bus back on the George Washington Memorial Parkway and stopped. All 
24 passengers were unharmed in the Arlington, Va., incident. The 
bus driver, Walter D. Kreuter, 69, of Arlington, was pronounced 
dead at Pentagon City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	When the bus veered off the parkway, it knocked down two utility  
poles, clipped several tree limbs and came within about 20 feet of 
plummeting into a lagoon off the Potomac River, Mulholland said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to praise them for some very quick thinking,'' said  
Mulholland. ``We can attribute the fact that nobody else was 
injured to their actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCool, 59, and Miller, 62, were among some 300 Alabama farmers  
in Washington for the Alabama Farmers Federation's annual 
legislative trip. They were returning to Reagan National Airport 
for their flight home when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	McCool said he and his wife, Diane, were seated in the bus' two  
right front seats when she screamed on seeing Kreuter collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	When McCool got the vehicle back onto the parkway, Miller,  
sitting directly behind Kreuter, reached over the driver's left 
shoulder and activated an emergency stop button, engaging air 
brakes that stopped the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, when I got on the bus, I had noticed that  
emergency stop button and knew what it was because my boys are in 
the excavating business and they have big trucks with air brakes on 
them,'' said Miller, reached by telephone at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men downplayed their heroics.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't do any more than anybody else in the same situation  
would have done,'' said McCool. ``We just thank the good Lord 
nobody was hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Miller: ``I'm just glad to be alive and maybe have had a  
small part in saving some people.''

<HEADLINE> Boxing Federation Is Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- One of boxing's three major sanctioning  
organizations is being investigated by a federal grand jury 
examining whether it sold rankings and arranged fights in return 
for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Lee, president of the International Boxing Federation,  
denied the allegations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than yearlong probe by the U.S. attorney's office in  
Newark focuses on the IBF and has so far led to subpoenas demanding 
financial records from promoters, a source familiar with the 
investigation told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments were made by fighter managers, sometimes disguised  
as consulting fees, to promoters and sanctioning groups, according 
to unnamed sources cited by The Star-Ledger of Newark, which 
disclosed the investigation in Thursday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office, citing Justice  
Department policy, declined to confirm or deny the existence of 
such an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF, based in nearby East Orange, also came under scrutiny  
this week from law enforcement agencies in New York following the 
controversial draw in the March 13 heavyweight championship bout 
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. Of the three judges, 
only the IBF-picked judge had Holyfield winning the fight many 
believed Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctioning groups -- the IBF, World Boxing Association and  
World Boxing Council -- by their rules and rankings, play a large 
role in determining whom a boxer fights. Boxers who defy the groups 
risk losing the chance to be declared a champion and earn large 
purses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done nothing improper. And we'll let the facts be  
brought out by the committee investigating and we'll respond to 
them,'' Lee said Thursday. He said he had not been called to 
testify before the grand jury, but declined extensive comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee had told The Star-Ledger, however, that the grand jury has  
begun calling witnesses. The probe was aimed at ``investigating 
mostly boxing overall'' and how the IBF ``approves fights and ranks 
fighters,'' he told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was no secret to the boxing world, said lawyer  
Patrick English, who regularly represents boxing promoter Dino Duva 
and his Main Events company in northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a big thing for a while,'' English said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit he filed against the IBF in 1996 on behalf of one-time  
heavyweight champion Michael Moorer raised similar corruption 
allegations. It was settled for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	English said neither he nor his clients have been subpoenaed and  
is unsure if his lawsuit sparked the federal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think so, but I don't know. I don't think this is the  
only complaint they ever got,'' English said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is a former New Jersey boxing commissioner removed from  
office in 1985 after a state panel ruled he violated ethics 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The current commissioner, Larry Hazzard Sr., said the state  
Athletic Control Board has no authority over sanctioning 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	It does regulate boxing promoters, however, and Hazzard said  
that if a promoter told him that he was being shaken down by a 
sanctioning body, Hazzard would report that to law officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the way, no one has ever come to me with a complaint like  
that,'' Hazzard said.

<HEADLINE> IBF Judge Filed for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- The IBF judge who came under fire for her  
scoring of the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight filed for 
protection from creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code earlier 
this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenia Williams of Atlantic City filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy  
petition on Jan. 25, court officials confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about it, she told the New York Post, which first reported  
the story, ``I don't know what you're talking about. They told me 
not to answer any more questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She would not say to whom she was referring.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a 10-year veteran of judging who works as a  
$39,200-a-year accounts clerk for the city, scored the fight 
115-113 for Holyfield, even though many who saw the 12-round 
heavyweight title fight at Madison Square Garden and others who 
watched on pay-per-view felt Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBA judge at ringside, Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa  
scored it 116-113 for Lewis and WBC judge Larry O'Connell of 
Britain scored it a 115-115 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was to testify today at a hearing in New York City  
called by New York state senate investigators.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Grants Top Exec Stock Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. granted top executive Alan R. Mulally  
a multimillion stock deal that could exceed $27 million by mid-2008 
to keep him from becoming chief executive of another company, 
reveals a proxy statement being filed by the company today. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the package, which includes restricted stock and  
stock options, hinges on how Boeing stock fares over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulally headed Boeing Information, Space &AMP; Defense Systems when  
the agreement was negotiated last year. A couple of months later, 
he was promoted to president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, 
the company's bread-and-butter jetliner manufacturing arm and 
source of most of the company's recent problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior Boeing executive  
said Thursday that Mulally negotiated his stay-at-home deal after 
being offered the top position at a competing company. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive would not identify the company. The Seattle  
Post-Intelligencer and The Wall Street Journal reported last year 
that Mulally rejected an offer from Raytheon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The proxy statement prepared for filing today also showed Boeing  
chairman Philip M. Condit received more than $2.8 million in 1998. 
More than $1.8 million came from exercising previously awarded 
stock options and the rest was from salary and other direct 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Harry C. Stonecipher, Boeing's chief operating  
officer, received $956,577 in pay and other compensation last year. 
He did not exercise any stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit and Stonecipher announced last month they would forgo  
their bonuses for 1998 because of Boeing's poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has endured billions of dollars in losses and tumbling  
stock prices in 1997 and 1998 because of production line snarls, 
parts shortages, late aircraft deliveries and costly fixes on 
new-model 737s. Economic turmoil has cut orders from Asian 
countries, and tens of thousands of jobs are being cut after a 
costly buildup to boost aircraft production rates.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Euro; Down Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Thursday as  
poor German economic data kept the new European currency on a 
downward path. The dollar slipped against the yen after an early 
rally fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0970, down  
from $1.1007 on Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 117.45 Japanese 
yen, down from 118.01 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro hit a three-week high against the dollar during the  
European trading session. But the brand new currency, on a downward 
track almost since it was launched in January, quickly fell after a 
widely watched indicator of German business sentiment marked a 
sharper drop in February than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really did put a damper on the euro's ability to break  
away from that down trend,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, a senior 
economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	During Asian trading, the dollar rallied against the yen as  
Tokyo's main stock index fell 3.4 percent. But the U.S. currency 
got caught in that country's economic cross-currents. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies are selling foreign assets and bringing home  
yen to enhance their balance sheets before the end of the Japanese 
fiscal year on March 31, a trend that tends to push the yen upward 
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4575 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4509, and 1.5182 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5215. The British 
pound fell to $1.6297 from $1.6305. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7828 German 
marks, up from 1.7768; 5.9809 French francs, up from 5.9595; and 
1,763.67 Italian lire, up from 1,760.56.

<HEADLINE> C-Span Marks 20 Year Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When C-Span debuted on March 19, 1979, the  
cable TV network had four employees, a $450,000 budget and one 
telephone line to yield calls from creditors and viewers alike. It 
operated only during business hours because the satellite it shared 
showed sporting events at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, the network boasts gavel-to-gavel coverage of  
Congress, a staff of 250 and a $33 million budget. But ask chairman 
Brian Lamb to describe other differences between then and now and 
he'll say the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network he founded 
remains virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than the fact we offer a lot more programs, the mission  
is exactly the same,'' Lamb said in an interview. ``And the 
product, by and large on most days, is exactly the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	C-Span premiered with funding from the cable industry and to  
fears about the impact of televising proceedings in Congress. But 
the now-24-hour network soon became so popular among political 
junkies that senators began to complain about all the attention 
going to their House counterparts. Thus, the debut seven years 
later of C-Span 2 to telecast live sessions of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb said he always knew he'd find an audience for his network.  
C-Span has attracted a small but loyal group of viewers who crave 
more news than a 30-second sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 74.6 million households can view C-Span on their cable  
or satellite TV systems, a 1997 survey by Statistical Research Inc. 
estimated that just 22 million people watch C-Span each week. But 
nearly all of them -- 94 percent -- were registered to vote and did 
so in the last general election. C-Span viewers also were more 
likely to contact lawmakers, volunteer in campaigns and make 
political contributions, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience can be a somewhat fanatical bunch: Tune in at 7  
a.m. on the East Coast to the network's daily ``Washington 
Journal'' program hosted by Lamb and it wouldn't be unusual to hear 
from a wide-awake caller from California. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain percent of the public, a thinking public and  
voting public that wants the discussion, that wants the challenge, 
that wants the information,'' said Lamb, a stolid presence who 
could be called the Joe Friday of cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	His unemotional, ``just the facts'' interviewing style has  
helped make Lamb, 57, the most recognizable personality on the 
deliberately anti-personality C-Span. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb served as a Pentagon spokesman during the Johnson  
administration and as a press secretary for Republican Sen. Peter 
Dominick of Colorado. He is a former reporter for UPI Audio and a 
past Washington bureau chief for CableVision magazine, which is 
where he was working when he came up with the idea for C-Span and 
its gavel-to-gavel coverage of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Using simple, stationary camera angles, C-Span attempts to  
provide the most neutral view of every event it telecasts. In 
addition to sessions on the House floor, the network also shows 
congressional hearings, speeches at the National Press Club and 
press briefings by federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The only cameras C-Span cannot control are the ones in the House  
and Senate chambers -- the network must tap into a government feed -- 
but they are consistent with the network's speaker-and-podium 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	C-Span offers Americans a more realistic look at politicians  
than the usual polished image supplied by evening news clips and 
Sunday TV talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, C-Span has shown American that Congress consists of  
``flawed human beings,'' said John Pitney, a government professor 
at Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not every member is 'Mr. Smith Going to Washington.' The House  
is noticeably short of Jimmy Stewarts,'' Pitney said of the famed 
movie. Like many college instructors, Pitney uses C-Span 
extensively in class. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Levinson, a communications professor at Fordham University,  
recalled the shock of watching members of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice 
Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here they were considering very important issues -- should this  
man become a Supreme Court Justice, and sexual harassment,'' he 
said. ``Just the expressions on some of the faces of the senators, 
yawning and looking uninterested. It was something I don't think 
anyone had seen before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Frantzich, co-author of ``The C-Span Revolution,''  
agreed that the network has affected the way the public sees its 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's set up this kind of expectation that, hey, we ought to be  
doing things in public, that there's a sense of illegitimacy if 
it's done behind closed doors,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 67.15 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials moved back toward 10,000  
today as stock prices rose in response to another positive report 
on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 67.15 to 9,946.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well, with the Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index up 15.19 at 1,313.01, and the technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index up 25.61 at 2,454.58. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow briefly crossed 10,000 on Tuesday, but the blue-chip  
index quickly backed off, closed lower and then added to its losses 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate cause of today's advance was a Labor Department  
report this morning that consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent 
last month. That was a confirmation that inflation remains in check 
and a signal that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise 
short-term interest rates anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer price report boosted prices in the bond market,  
where the 30-year Treasury bond was up 3/8 point and its yield, which 
moves opposite from its price, fell to 5.47 percent from 5.5 
percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were unfazed by a separate report from the Commerce  
Department that the nation's trade deficit shot up 21 percent in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also undisturbed by the continuing rise in oil prices,  
which longer-term could prove inflationary. ``Oil is turning the 
corner,'' said Gregory Nie, a technical analyst at Everen 
Securities in Chicago, ``but there will be a proving period over 
the short term where you get a correction in crude that will take a 
little starch out of this move up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, higher oil prices fed advances in oil stocks. Dow member  
Exxon was up 5/8 at 74 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow components were also led higher by financial services  
stocks, which reacted positively to a report that Chase Manhattan 
Corp. is looking for a merger partner. Chase shares were up 1 13/16 
at 84 3/16. American Express was leading the Dow components higher 
and was up 5 1/16 at 126. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also said Friday's triple expiration of options and  
futures contracts lent a slightly positive bias to stock prices 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues were barely edging out decliners on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 675.87 million shares, up 
from Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Sex Basic-Training Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a battle of the sexes, lawmakers are  
clashing over a congressional commission recommendation that men 
and women train together at military boot camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md., argued Wednesday during a House  
subcommittee hearing against maintaining mixed-gender basic 
training in the Army, Air Force and Navy. Now, only the Marines 
separate the sexes in the first 12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The forces, except for the Marines, are forced to worship at  
the altar of political correctness,'' Bartlett charged, suggesting 
men and women may be sexually tempted if kept at close quarters 
when they first enter the services. ``The sexual dynamic is both an 
attraction and a distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., countered that there's no  
turning back from integrating women throughout the military so the 
sexes should learn to work together from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's this attraction ... when do we integrate the  
troops?'' she asked. ``If we follow what Mr. Barlett said, we would 
never have women in the military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez discounted Bartlett's argument that during 5,000 years  
of military history, no civilization has successfully trained men 
and women together during boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because maybe it didn't work for the Romans or the  
Israelis doesn't mean it can't work here in the United States,'' 
said Sanchez during a polite, but pointed exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartlett said he supports women in the military, where 14  
percent of the 1.4 million active duty force is female, and is only 
against mixing the sexes during the ``short period of intense 
resocialization'' that is basic training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men and women are different,'' he said. ``They're physically  
different and emotionally different.'' In training together, 
``Either you're not going to begin to challenge the average man or 
you're going to overstress the average women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House moved last year to require separate basic training for  
men and women, but the measure didn't pass in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate before the House Armed Services Committee's panel on  
military personnel centered on findings of the Commission on 
Military Training and Gender-Related Issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel chairman Rep. Stephen Buyer, R-Ind., said he asked for the  
study because of questions raised about training after several sex 
scandals, including with drill instructors at Aberdeen Training 
Ground, Md., and at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon did its own study in the wake of the scandals, but  
Defense Secretary William Cohen rejected his committee's 
recommendation to separate sexes during basic training. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Cohen announced in June that male and female recruits  
would continue training together in the Army, Air Force and Navy, 
but would sleep in separate, more secure quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	All the service chiefs agreed with keeping mixed training, which  
began as an experiment during the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, reflecting divisions on the subcommittee, had  
deeply mixed feelings, too. Six of 10 members approved keeping 
mixed training. The rest abstained or voted ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the abstainers said they want to change the system.  
</P>
<P>
	Anita Blair, chairwoman of the commission who abstained, held up  
Marine Corps basic training as the model. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force trainers ``told me the Marine Corps has the best idea.  
The Marine Corps does it right,'' Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	But former Pentagon official Frederick Pang, vice chairman of  
the commission, said the mixed training was working and the sexual 
scandals ``grew out of instances of failure ... not out of any 
fundamental breakdown that we could find.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, consisting of retired members of the military,  
educators and social scientists, is scheduled to deliver its final 
report in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyer, surprised commission members had not visited Fort Leonard  
Wood while investigating alleged training problems, suggested they 
should before completing their work.

<HEADLINE> Charges vs. First Lady Were Drafted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's top deputy testified  
Thursday that he had questioned the truthfulness of President 
Clinton and the first lady inside the prosecutor's office and had 
even drawn up a draft indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had ever referred to the Clintons as ``crooks and  
liars,'' W. Hickman Ewing Jr. said, ``I believe I made that 
statement in-house ... (but) I don't believe I used the L-word or 
the C-word. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly expressed internally that I had problems with some  
of their answers,'' Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Subpoenaed as the leadoff defense witness at the trial of Susan  
McDougal, one of the Clintons' former Whitewater partners, Ewing 
revealed some of the inner workings of Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, on trial for refusing to answer grand jury  
questions, is trying to demonstrate that prosecutors wanted to use 
her to get to the Clintons, whether there was sufficient evidence 
to charge them or not. 
</P>
<P>
	She is charged with criminal contempt and obstruction of  
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. McDougal's lawyers called Ewing to the stand in an  
effort to focus on the conduct of the Independent Counsel's office, 
his testimony is the type of attention the first lady would like to 
avoid as she tests the waters for a possible Senate bid in New York 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said that at dinner one evening with other Starr staffers,  
he graded the president and first lady on their responses to 
questioning by Whitewater investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said the president was about a 'C' and Mrs. Clinton about an  
'F,''' Ewing testified. Ewing said his remark followed his 
observing her answers during a July 1995 deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing testified that he made the statement after Mrs. Clinton  
said ``'I don't recall' about 50 times'' during the deposition in 
July 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he drafted the proposed indictment against the first  
lady sometime after September 1996. Early that year, Mrs. Clinton's 
long-sought law firm billing records mysteriously surfaced in the 
White House, revealing that she had worked on a failed land 
development that James McDougal was trying to use to prop up his 
failing S&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said it was not unusual for a federal prosecutor to draft  
an indictment whether or not a charge is ever brought. He didn't 
say what charge the draft might have included. 
</P>
<P>
	As a prosecutor, he said, ``You're always thinking about ...  
what possible crime could it be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he showed the draft to ``a couple of people in the  
office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's private lawyer, scoffed at Ewing's  
revelation, saying ``the mere fact that this prosecutor's office 
drafted a frivolous indictment three years ago has no significance 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the emergence of the billing records -- which had vanished  
after the 1992 presidential campaign -- Mrs. Clinton never revealed 
that she had done any work on the McDougals' Castle Grande 
development, which federal regulators said was riddled with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the billing records were turned over, the inspector  
general's office at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. concluded 
that Mrs. Clinton created a real estate document that was used to 
deceive federal regulators. Castle Grande ended up costing the 
McDougals' S&AMP;L nearly $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1995 interviews with Starr's prosecutors, Mrs. Clinton  
was questioned under oath about the work her law firm had done for 
the McDougals' S&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was in conflict with interviews we had already done with  
several people in the Rose Law Firm,'' Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted the president's changing responses to questions  
about whether he had asked Whitewater partner James McDougal to 
hire Mrs. Clinton's law firm to represent Madison Guaranty, the 
McDougals' savings and loan, in the mid-1980s. Clinton was Arkansas 
governor at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	James McDougal said Clinton made the request, and during the  
1992 presidential campaign, Clinton denied it. But in sworn 
testimony to Starr's investigators in 1995, Clinton said ``I don't 
recall'' whether McDougal's account was accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing made a number of concessions under questioning by McDougal  
attorney Mark Geragos. For example, he acknowledged that 
prosecutors hadn't told the grand jury that James McDougal kept 
changing parts of his story as Starr's office zeroed in on 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	And Geragos focused on the fact that even though prosecutors  
knew James McDougal had changed his story, Starr told U.S. District 
Judge George Howard on the day McDougal was sentenced that he had 
testified ``truthfully'' and had ``substantially aided our search 
for the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination by one of his own prosecutors, associate  
Independent Counsel John Barrett, Ewing explained why the Starr 
team was so intent on getting Mrs. McDougal's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``They needed a witness without baggage,'' Ewing testified. ``If  
they've been convicted, that's baggage. If they've given previous 
conflicting testimony, that's baggage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing noted that while Mrs. McDougal had been convicted of four  
felonies in her 1996 trial, she had not testified at that trial. 
James McDougal had testified, and later changed his account of 
whether Clinton knew about a fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. 
McDougal.

<HEADLINE> Starr Aide Made 1st Lady Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's top deputy testified  
today that at one point in the Whitewater investigation he drafted 
a proposed indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton and showed it to 
others in the independent counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Called as the lead-off defense witness in Susan McDougal's  
trial, W. Hickman Ewing Jr. also testified that he ``had problems'' 
with some of President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton's statements to 
investigators in April 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said he drafted the indictment against the first lady  
sometime after September 1996 and was not more specific. He said it 
was not unusual for a federal prosecutor to draft an indictment 
whether or not charge is ever brought. 
</P>
<P>
	As a prosecutor, he said, ``You're always thinking about ...  
what possible crime could it be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said he showed the draft to ``a couple of people in the  
office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Mrs. McDougal's attorney, Mark Geragos, whether he had  
ever referred to the Clintons as ``liars,'' Ewing said, ``I don't 
know if I used the L-word or not. But I certainly expressed 
internally that I had problems with some of their answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing questioned some of Mrs. Clinton's testimony in the Starr  
investigation: ``I don't know if she was telling the truth or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the April 1995 interviews, Mrs. Clinton was questioned under  
oath about the work her law firm had done for James and Susan 
McDougal's savings and loan, Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was in conflict with interviews we had already done with  
several people in the Rose Law Firm,'' Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing also referred to a statement by Clinton that he didn't  
remember whether he had asked James McDougal to engage Mrs. Clinton 
to do legal work for Madison Guaranty. During his presidential 
campaign, Clinton had said no, he never made that request to 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's testimony was the type of unwelcome attention the first  
lady would like to avoid as she tests the waters for a possible 
Senate bid in New York in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton became a focal point for Starr's investigation in  
January 1996 because of the still-unexplained reappearance of her 
law firm billing records on a table inside the White House. The 
records had vanished after the 1992 presidential campaign. They 
outlined her work for the McDougals' failing savings and loan in 
1985 and '86. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking the tactics of Starr's office is key to the defense  
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos contends Mrs. McDougal refused to answer grand jury  
questions because she felt prosecutors were pressuring her to give 
false testimony against the Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos also says prosecutors withheld information from the  
grand jurors who indicted Mrs. McDougal that would have decreased 
the credibility of other witnesses, including Mrs. McDougal's 
former husband, James. 
</P>
<P>
	She is charged with criminal contempt and obstruction of  
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution rested its case after seven days, ending this  
morning with testimony from an Arkansas banker, Ron Proctor, who 
dealt with the original loan for the Whitewater land development. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ewing watched from the rear of the courtroom as  
the prosecution closed its case by summoning three former members 
of the Whitewater grand jury before whom Mrs. McDougal had refused 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the day, Bill Henley, Mrs. McDougal's brother,  
reached through a crowd of reporters and handed Ewing a subpoena, 
saying, ``Hick, I've got something for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt really good,'' Bill Henley said a few moments later.  
``It's about time we got to ask them a few questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos would not rule out summoning Starr as well. ``First let  
me deal with Hick Ewing,'' he said. ``One at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making a prosecutor a defense witness was the second unusual  
turn of the day. The first was putting on the witness stand three 
members of the grand jury that indicted Mrs. McDougal after she 
refused to answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said that in 25 years as a federal prosecutor he had never  
seen grand jurors testify at a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jury foreman John Washam testified that the death of Mrs.  
McDougal's former husband, James McDougal, in 1998 made her 
testimony even more crucial than it had been before. 
</P>
<P>
	With his death, ``one link of the chain was gone'' of people who  
knew what went on in Whitewater, said Washam. McDougal had been 
Starr's chief cooperating witness in his investigation of the 
Whitewater land deal in which the Clintons and McDougals were 
partners.

<HEADLINE> Grains Down; Soybeans Mostly Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures were lower and soybeans mostly  
higher in dealings Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell sharply, pressured by reports of moisture  
moving across growing regions in the United States, as well as news 
that the dry Chinese wheat belt got rain Wednesday night. Traders 
also absorbed news of low net export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and corn futures also fell amid dimmed hopes that the  
government could orchestrate an acreage set-aside this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were mostly higher with talk of positive overnight  
export business. Likewise, recent rumors of a last-minute acreage 
set-aside by the government were dismissed by most market 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn finished lower despite hitting 9 1/2-week highs earlier in the  
day. The losses were limited by solid weekly export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was off 4 cents to $2.73 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn was off 1 1/2 cent to $2.24 1/4 a bushel; May oats were off 1/2 cent 
to $1.11 a bushel; May soybeans were up 3/4 cent to $4.82 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle futures were mostly higher on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as were lean hogs and pork bellies. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures rose 0.28 cent to 67.15 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle were unchanged at 72.00 cents per pound; April 
lean hogs were up 1.30 cent to 42.27 cents a pound; and May pork 
bellies were up 0.43 cent to 50.90 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> China Denies Spy Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Chinese diplomat on Thursday denied  
allegations his country stole nuclear weapons designs from a U.S. 
laboratory. The official blamed a Cold War mentality and 
``political atmospherics'' for the furor that has prompted FBI and 
Energy Department investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the State Department, responding quickly, said the United  
States remains ``deeply concerned about reports of China's attempts 
to illegally acquire sensitive U.S. technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That concern is ``shared widely by both branches, the executive  
and legislative branches of government, by both political 
parties,'' said James P. Foley, the deputy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no division there. The Chinese should not read our  
concern over espionage as a partisan matter or a matter that's 
manufactured by opponents of U.S.-China relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese diplomat, He Yafei, a minister-counsel at the  
Chinese Embassy, insisted ``the Sino-U.S. relationship has become 
the victim of party politics in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the Monica Lewinsky scandal, He said: ``You all know how  
party politics play, especially when you're nearing a major 
election. You have seen the outcry or the big media coverage on the 
Lewinsky issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The diplomat accused critics of harboring Cold War instincts.  
</P>
<P>
	``They are sorry there is no more Soviet Union and they don't  
know how to act,'' said He, referring to those accusing China of 
espionage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1980s to 
help modernize Chinese nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born American engineer at the New Mexico  
facility, is the focus of the investigation. He was fired last week 
for violating security regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with any crime and Energy Secretary  
Bill Richardson said he did not know if Lee would be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson told Congress on Wednesday he planned to tighten  
security at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories. Former CIA 
Director John Deutch is to help decide whether too many foreign 
visitors are admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think strengthening the security of labs is right,'' He said  
at a news conference in the embassy ballroom. ``Nothing wrong with 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, asserting the two nations and the world benefit from  
scientific exchanges, the Chinese diplomat cautioned: ``Don't go 
too far so that normal scientific exchanges are affected. It will 
not only hurt other countries, but it will hurt U.S. interests, 
too, because in the long run any advance in science and technology 
is not dependent on scientists of one country alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the dispute could harm improving relations between  
Washington and Beijing, and that some Chinese scientists were 
questioning whether to continue scientific exchanges ``to advance 
our knowledge of nuclear science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongii due here next month, He  
said ``there are some people in the United States who do not want 
to see progress in the Sino-U.S. relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever there is improvement in the Sino-U.S. relations,  
whenever there is an important summit that is going to happen, you 
will see ... these anti-China waves, undercurrents, whatever. Human 
rights issues, nuclear issues and other issues; it will come up,'' 
He said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not identify anyone, and specifically excluded Sandy  
Berger, the president's national security adviser who supports 
closer ties with China. On Sunday, Berger said ``there's no 
question'' China benefited from important information leaked from 
the Los Alamos laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the allegations of espionage and theft, He replied  
that ``nothing of this sort has ever happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``China never benefited from anything that is illegal,'' the  
diplomat said. ``We have normal exchange programs. Of course each 
side will benefit from these exchange programs, otherwise it will 
be meaningless. But it has nothing to do with nuclear military 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Repeatedly, He returned to his central theme, that U.S.-Chinese  
relations generally and scientific cooperation specifically were in 
jeopardy from people opposed to progress between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let Chinese-U.S. relations become hostage to that,'' He  
implored.

<HEADLINE>  2006 Olympic Bidding Different Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The cursor dragged across the  
computer screen, offering a 3-D vision of the jagged peaks off the 
lake in Klagenfurt, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	That is as close as the IOC members will get to six bidding  
cities ahead of their June decision on the host of the 2006 Olympic 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the members can no longer come to us, we have to do it this  
way,'' said Dr. Dieter Kalt, the general manager of the Klagenfurt 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking with years of wining and dining, lavish gift-giving and  
other pampering by bid cities, the IOC members decided Thursday to 
outlaw visits to reduce any risk of corruption, which is at the 
heart of the worst scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Visits are unnecessary and public perception of them is just  
too bad,'' said executive board member Jacques Rogge, who prides 
himself in keeping away from candidate cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidding war between the cities has been suspended since  
December when the Salt Lake bribery scandal broke. It will now be 
resumed under new, stricter rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were waiting like lions in a cage. Tomorrow we will be let  
out again,'' said Lance Kelly, international relations coordinator 
for Switzerland's Sion bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bid cities criticized the new limits as unfairly  
favoring Sion, which already was visited by most IOC members during 
previous bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had told us one year ago, we would have though twice  
about bidding,'' said Marco San Pietro of Italy's Turin bid, 
echoing complaints from the other five bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The other cities bidding are Helsinki, Finland; Zakopane,  
Poland; and Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of showing IOC members around, the cities are belatedly  
changing strategies, pumping more funds into an avalanche of 
paperwork, videos and CD-roms. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that is running into IOC restrictions forcing bid cities to  
submit their material to IOC headquarters before it can be sent on 
to the members. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Soviet-style censorship. It is ridiculous,'' said  
Evelina Christillin, head of the Turin bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Members will be snowed under paperwork ahead of the June 19  
selection in Seoul, South Korea. There, a 15-member panel will trim 
the six hopefuls for 2006 down to a final pair, which will be 
immediately sent to the general assembly for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidders will have an hour-long presentation for the members  
there, a do or die session where more money will now be poured 
into. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the budgets of bidding cities hover around $10-12  
million and some said around $700,000 was earmarked for the IOC 
visitors. Critics of Thursday's decision said that if the IOC was 
so intent of protecting their members from potential corruption, it 
should pay for the visits itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should arrange travel and pay everything and after the  
visit we get to pay them,'' said Kalt, eager to show that 
Klagenfurt's three nation bid of Austria, Italy and Slovenia is 
really quite compact. 
</P>
<P>
	Saarikangas agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of showing your product. Not a question of  
bribing,'' he said, comparing it to the difference between testing 
a car and browsing through a glossy leaflet. 
</P>
<P>
	The cities were allowed to come to the IOC meeting to compensate  
for the loss of exposure to IOC members. But IOC members were 
elusive as the general assembly devoted most of its time to 
expelling six members for corruption and centering on much-needed 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nearly impossible to talk to them here. Sometimes they  
drop by to try our chocolates,'' San Pietro said.

<HEADLINE> Miami, Ohio Has Daunting Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Midwest Regional was supposed to feature a  
rematch of last year's NCAA championship game, before Miami of Ohio 
crashed the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 10 seed that spoiled a Kentucky-Utah repeat Friday night  
is about a two-hour drive from Lexington, Ky., and light years away 
in terms of reputation. Coach Charlie Coles did a lot of chuckling 
when asked whether any of his players had also been recruited by 
the No. 3 seed and defending national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, whose school is in Oxford, Ohio, said somebody has made a  
big mistake if he and Kentucky coach Tubby Smith ever end up in the 
same place checking out prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, huh-uh, no, huh-uh,'' Coles said. ``We never really cross  
paths. If I see Tubby out recruiting someone, then I'm in the wrong 
gym. Nothing against our players, but that's just the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That even goes for tournament darling and likely NBA lottery  
pick Wally Szczerbiak, who has totaled 67 points in Miami's first 
two NCAA victories. Szczerbiak is averaging 24.3 points, 8.7 
rebounds and 2.9 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't recruited by Kentucky at all,'' Szczerbiak said.  
</P>
<P>
	Miami (24-7) has tied a school record for victories and is in  
the round of 16 for the first time since 1978. No one outside of 
Oxford, Ohio can name any of the other four starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody knows about Kentucky (27-8), which is the defending  
national champion and has been in the title game the last three 
years. The Wildcats have been to 41 NCAA tournaments, more than any 
other team, and this is their fifth straight appearance in the 
round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky also has won 17 in a row against Miami, with the last  
loss in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact we've been here and been so successful gives us  
confidence,'' said forward Scott Padgett, who made the winning 
basket in Kentucky's 92-88 overtime victory over Kansas last 
Sunday. ``At this time of the year we know what it takes to win 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially the seniors and upperclassmen, we try to pass down  
what we've learned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's approach is that's just history. The Mid-American  
Conference champions feel they belong after climbing on 
Szczerbiak's back for a first-round victory over No. 7 seed 
Washington -- he scored 43 of the 59 points -- and then beating No. 2 
seed Utah despite only 24 from Szczerbiak. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think Miami has gotten to the sweet 16, they'll be OK,  
they won't be sad, they'll be satisfied,'' Coles said. ``I 
guarantee you if we don't win, there won't be a dry eye in the 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak certainly isn't in awe of Kentucky.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one believed we could get this far but ourselves,''  
Szczerbiak said. ``The aura Kentucky has, it's really no different 
from the aura Utah had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's major strength is a bottomless bench. Four players  
average in double figures, led by Padgett's 12.5-point average, and 
Smith routinely substitutes for the entire starting five after the 
first four or five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The freshness factor has helped the Wildcats hold opponents to  
37.9 percent shooting, the best at the school since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak averages about three minutes of bench time per game  
and Damon Frierson, the team's other double-figure scorer at 13.1 
points, averages 2 1/2 minutes of rest. Szczerbiak isn't worried and 
in fact believes Kentucky's depth can be a negative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like this is going to be our first 40-minute game,''  
Szczerbiak said. ``We've been doing this just about every time. We 
know it's going to be tough, but with their platooning system, 
sometimes you can get out of the flow.''

<HEADLINE> Gambling Addiction Report Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 5 million Americans are pathological  
or problem gamblers, and another 15 million are at risk of becoming 
just like them, concludes a study likely to further inflame the 
debate over legalized wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	The study conducted for the National Gambling Impact Study  
Commission found that 20 million Americans have or could develop 
gambling problems but said the economic impact of that is 
``relatively small.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second report, also released Thursday as the commission began  
two days of meetings in Washington, estimated that 1.8 million 
American adults as well as up to 1.1 million American adolescents 
age 12 through 17 engage in severe ``pathological'' gambling each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has three months to finish a wide-ranging report  
on gambling for Congress, and the extent of compulsive gambling in 
the country is just one of several open issues. Yet gambling 
addiction is the most contentious topic, and the report on the 
survey conducted for the commission only widened the chasm between 
the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr., president of the American Gaming  
Association, alleged that an earlier draft of the report was 
retooled to exaggerate the dangers of gambling through sensational 
language and changes in conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he noted that the report ``confirms that the economic and  
social benefits of gaming far outweigh the costs to society of 
pathological and problem gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report's classification of 15 million Americans as ``at  
risk'' for developing a gambling problem was criticized by 
Fahrenkopf and some commission members. 
</P>
<P>
	Survey participants who said they gambled just once to relieve  
uncomfortable feelings were put in the ``at risk'' group, said 
commission member John Wilhelm, general president of the Hotel 
Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members were troubled by the report's finding that the  
economic cost of problem gambling is ``relatively small'' -- about 
$5 billion a year in legal fees for divorce, court and jail costs 
for arrests, lost wages and bankruptcy. That compares with $72 
billion for smoking, $166 billion for alcohol abuse and $71 billion 
for motor vehicle crashes, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Dobson, president of Focus on the Family and the panel's  
most outspoken opponent of gambling, said the $5 billion estimate 
of gambling's cost is far too low. He wondered how to calculate the 
costs of child abuse or spousal abuse committed by a gambling 
addict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody on the commission has really struggled with this:  
How do you estimate the social cost?'' said commission Chairwoman 
Kay James. ``It's very difficult to do. At best, I think what we 
can say at this point is we really need more research, we need more 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerstone of the commission's work on the topic, the  
national survey, was conducted by the National Opinion Research 
Center at the University of Chicago in collaboration with other 
researchers. It is the first widespread survey since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that 2.5 million Americans are ``pathological''  
gamblers, a disorder codified in 1994 by the American Psychiatric 
Association, and another 3 million are problem gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining telephone surveys with interviews at casinos, the  
report concluded that people are about twice as likely to be 
problem or pathological gamblers if a casino is within 50 miles of 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Horn, spokesman for the National Coalition Against  
Legalized Gambling, said he was stunned at the finding that 6.4 
percent of casino patrons interviewed were pathological gamblers 
and 4.6 percent were problem gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means more than one in 10 people in a casino need  
psychiatric help,'' Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second study, by the National Research Council -- part of the  
National Academy of Sciences, an independent organization chartered 
by Congress to advise the government -- says pathological gamblers 
are far more likely to commit crimes, run up large debts, damage 
relationships and kill themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Pathological gambling is ``a significant enough problem'' to  
warrant funding ``a more sustained, comprehensive and scientific 
set of research activities than currently exists,'' according to an 
executive summary of the NRC study, a review of existing research. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has just started discussing what steps to  
recommend to Congress. One mentioned Thursday would require 
casinos, state lotteries, the horse racing industry and other 
gambling outlets to help fund prevent and treatment programs for 
problem gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission member Richard C. Leone, president of the Twentieth  
Century Fund and a former state treasurer of New Jersey, said he 
worries that the nation is becoming one big compulsive gambler, 
with states battling it out to see who can capture the most dollars 
through casinos, lotteries, video poker and other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I view it as a kind of national psychosis,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Concerned Over Clot-Buster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government says hospitals are again  
experiencing shortages of the clot-busting drug Abbokinase, as the 
manufacturer investigates viral contamination in the factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration said Abbott Inc. found  
``reovirus'' in three bulk lots of Abbokinase, ingredients mixed up 
and awaiting heat-pasteurization before sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not cause for alarm, said FDA's Dr. David Feigal. At most,  
reovirus causes mild cold or gastrointestinal symptoms, and 
pasteurization should kill it, he said. Abbott stressed that 
testing has found no reovirus in finished Abbokinase that was sold. 
Further sales await FDA's approval once additional testing is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the Abbokinase lots were supposed to be sterile,  
so the reovirus illustrates a safety breakdown in manufacturing, 
Feigal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be asking Abbott to looking at manufacturing methods to  
create the conditions that these types of contaminations don't 
occur,'' he said. In a notice issued late Tuesday, the FDA alerted 
hospitals that ``this is going to create another time period of 
shortage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbokinase, known chemically as urokinase, is one of many drugs  
used to dissolve blood clots. It is made from kidney cells taken 
from foreign newborns who have died. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals experienced shortages last fall when the FDA  
temporarily suspended Abbokinase sales, saying Abbott failed to 
ensure the kidney cells were infection-free. No contamination was 
found, so the FDA allowed some sales to resume in January but urged 
doctors to use alternative clot-busters whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer group Public Citizen reiterated its call Wednesday  
for an Abbokinase recall until the product is proven sterile.

<HEADLINE> Teen Accused of Hacking Into AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- An 18-year-old high school dropout has  
been charged with computer tampering after hacking into the 
internal computers of America Online and altering some programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Satiro was arrested and his computer confiscated Wednesday  
night after AOL officials contacted authorities. A complaint filed 
against Satiro said the teen-ager altered AOL data and programs 
that would cost about $50,000 to repair. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato refused to give details of what was  
altered or how long the intrusion went undetected. He said the 
intrusion ``really should mean absolutely nothing for America 
Online members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satiro's mother posted $5,000 bail. He did not return telephone  
messages seeking comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jay's a genius, but his common sense is a little low,'' said  
his 15-year-old brother, Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
	First-degree computer tampering carries a maximum sentence of  
five to 15 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> America West Airlines May Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A four-year dispute over wages was coming to a  
head today as America West Airlines prepared for a strike by its 
flight attendants that could begin tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless an agreement is reached, flight attendants could strike  
as early as 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, a minute after the end of a 
30-day cooling-off period set by the National Mediation Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,300 attendants have been working without a contract since  
voting to unionize in 1994, three years after America West filed 
for bankruptcy protection and employees took pay cuts designed to 
help the company get back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the company has become profitable, posting record  
earnings in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of America West's flight attendants earn the  
top-scale salary of $23,800. Top-scale flight attendants at rival 
Southwest Airlines earn $41,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants also want the same daily expenses as  
pilots receive, $1.80 an hour away from their base city. Currently, 
flight attendants get no per diem allowance. 
</P>
<P>
	Most passengers at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix  
were well aware of the looming strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw this coming,'' said Laura de Leon, who was returning to  
San Jose Thursday with her husband Arnold and 10-month-old daughter 
Amelia. 
</P>
<P>
	Before booking their return flight, de Leon said she checked on  
an Internet Web site to make sure it wouldn't be affected by a 
possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out that we didn't have to change our flight, but we  
definitely made sure,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone was aware of the strike threat.  
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Hemwall of New York was flying to Albuquerque Thursday and  
planned to travel back through Phoenix via America West next week. 
He said he hadn't heard anything about the flight attendants' 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just take my chances. I'm sure something will happen by  
then. Really, I don't want to have to get involved,'' Hemwall said. 
</P>
<P>
	America West serves 53 domestic destinations overall and eight  
cities in Mexico and Canada. The nation's ninth-largest carrier has 
hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Lines at the America West ticket counter were long at Sky Harbor  
on Thursday, but travel agents say their customers are wary of 
booking America West. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pretty much avoiding America West at all costs and  
trying to go with other airlines,'' said Amy Wright, of Bell Travel 
in Sun City, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if America West has a lower published fare, people are  
tending to buy a more expensive ticket because they don't want to 
be caught in that predicament,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Van Epps of Moon Valley Travel in Phoenix said he's seeing  
the same trend for flights in the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``But further into the summer, people are still booking America  
West. They figure a strike would be over by then,'' Van Epps said. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agencies reported a steady stream of America West  
customers trading in electronic tickets for paper tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	America West on Thursday recommended the switch, saying it can  
more easily re-accomodate passengers holding paper tickets to other 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's flight attendants say they will stage a series of  
random, unannounced work stoppages -- dubbed CHAOS for ``Creating 
Havoc Around Our System.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has threatened to shut its entire operation down if  
CHAOS begins and has reportedly said it will fire flight attendants 
who participate in the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said, ``America West will  
not tolerate employees who engage in acts the flight attendants 
describe as CHAOS. If there is a disruption in airline service like 
that the company will take action appropriate to the 
circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Flight Attendants have used a CHAOS strike  
just once before in 1993 against Alaska Airlines. Despite only 
seven flights being canceled, the strike succeeded in driving away 
passengers. Alaska Airlines fired six or seven flight attendants, 
but the courts ordered the airline to give them back their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Zack, a spokesman for the union, said the union has been  
informing members of the possibility of being fired during a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that happens, we're confident they'll get their jobs  
back,'' Zack said, calling the company's threat illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	America West flight attendants conducted dry run strike  
procedures Thursday and announced that in just seven minutes they 
can successfully prevent any flight from leaving Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Zack said the time includes passing through security, informing  
people at every gate that they're being struck, and reconvening.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Whitaker Pleads Guilty to DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Former world boxing champion and  
Olympic gold medalist Pernell ``Sweetpea'' Whitaker pleaded guilty 
to driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker was fined $1,000 and his driver's license was suspended  
for a year during a hearing into the June 4 incident Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	General District Judge Robert L. Simpson also imposed a 60-day  
jail sentence that was suspended on the condition that Whitaker 
stay out of trouble. He ordered Whitaker to attend an alcohol 
safety education program. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker declined to comment after the hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Whitaker has been undisputed lightweight  
champion and has held pieces of the junior welterweight, 
welterweight and junior middleweight titles. He suffered the third 
loss of his pro career last month to Felix Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended from boxing for seven months after he tested  
positive for cocaine and was reinstated Sept. 11.

<HEADLINE> 'Lock, Stock' Star Enjoys the Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Some people in England shy away from stardom. But  
not Nick Moran. 
</P>
<P>
	At 30, the once-unknown lead of ``Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking  
Barrels'' speaks happily of leaving anonymity behind, courtesy of a 
cheeky gangland comedy that has had Britain laughing -- and 
cowering. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, he says with a smile over coffee at a south London  
cafe, ``I go to auditions, and they make tea and they polish your 
shoes. Before, people would say, `Who is that upstart? Get out!' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could carry a film, but I didn't know I could  
actually, legitimately,'' he says. ``But with `Lock, Stock,' it's 
written in black and white: Can Carry A Film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran has every right to be likably immodest, given the  
phenomenon that ``Lock, Stock'' has become in Britain since its 
late-summer opening. 
</P>
<P>
	A loopy East End thriller that is funny and knuckle-busting in  
turn, the film struck a particular chord with Britain's youth 
culture, making stars of its little-known quartet of leads, as well 
as a local hero out of Londoner Guy Ritchie, its first-time 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's broader appeal will be tested March 19, when ``Lock,  
Stock'' opens wide in the United States, following an acclaimed 
premiere in January at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, and 
critical openings in New York and Los Angeles earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Moran's killer cheekbones may be more than simply  
British tabloid fodder. With three further movies awaiting release 
in 1999, Moran is ready for the big time -- and excited by it as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a No. 1 movie in my own country,'' says Moran, not so  
much warming to a theme as devouring it, well, lock, stock, and 
barrel. ``There are very, very few people who can say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran's performance as Eddie, the hapless if charming card shark  
whose misadventures set in motion a Byzantine underworld face-off, 
is the linchpin of a densely plotted scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie's sort of like my flash alter ego,'' Moran says. ``I  
always looked at it as if Eddie was a better-looking version of 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the actor acknowledges that the movie itself -- an ensemble  
piece -- was greater than any individual player, which may explain 
why he was chosen for the role and not Stephen Dorff and Ethan 
Hawke, who were originally mentioned. (The film's biggest names are 
Sting, who took a tiny role because wife Trudie Styler is a 
co-producer, and, in his acting debut, Vinnie Jones, one of the 
``bad boys'' of English soccer.) 
</P>
<P>
	``What's great is that `Lock, Stock' is so full of people  
discovering their own abilities,'' Moran says. ``I don't think Guy 
knew he was an absolutely brilliant director until he made an 
absolutely brilliant film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest of three boys, Moran grew up in what he calls a  
``really heinous'' council estate -- Britain's equivalent of 
low-income housing -- in the north London suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	And while many British actors have parents in the profession,  
Moran says his background was more likely to land him a job at the 
local supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, ``someone had told me about these mythical places  
called drama schools which I never knew existed. I lied about my 
age, got in, and was just 20 when I left. I did the course and 
inadvertently learned how to act properly,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a decade before ``Lock, Stock'' came, accompanied by  
serious recognition. Before that, Moran spent a year on the West 
End in the musical ``Blood Brothers'' and did a little-seen film, 
``Hard Days, Hard Nights,'' about a Liverpool band that was not the 
Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
	Since ``Lock, Stock'' came out in Britain, Moran has won acclaim  
for a London play, Nick Grosso's ``Real Classy Affair,'' which 
co-starred Joseph Fiennes of ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And among his upcoming movies, he speaks highly of ``New  
Blood,'' in which he plays John Hurt's son, and a cameo role, again 
with Fiennes, in ``Rancid Aluminum,'' playing a dress-wearing 
schoolboy who deals cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood remains an untapped market that Moran is eager to  
test, but he says he's unlikely to choose a project simply because 
of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do good stuff, not cheesy stuff,'' he says. ``I  
don't have to be in a $50 million or $100 million movie. Something 
like `Lock, Stock' will do me, you know what I mean?''

<HEADLINE> Mich. Students Protest Sweatshops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Students protesting possible sweatshop  
conditions in factories that make University of Michigan-licensed 
apparel continued their sit-in today at the school president's 
offices after meeting with him. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 students carrying sleeping bags and food began the  
sit-in Wednesday morning and met with school President Lee 
Bollinger by evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am trying to figure out the most constructive way to resolve  
this issue,'' Bollinger said. ``We're developing a position and 
we're trying to make sure human rights are protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan leads the $2.5 billion-a-year licensed collegiate  
apparel business. It is the top seller for the Collegiate Licensing 
Co., which licenses products for more than 170 colleges. Michigan 
makes $5 million a year in licensing royalties, school spokesman 
Joel Seguine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I say that I am from the University of Michigan, I don't  
want to be associated with blood,'' said sophomore protester Jason 
Keydel of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	A key unresolved student demand is that manufacturers agree to  
pay their workers a living wage. Seguine said the university agreed 
in principle but the two sides had not agreed on how to define a 
living wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the university agreed to require licensed-apparel  
makers to reveal their plant locations -- the second school to do so 
after the University of Wisconsin. Knowing the locations is 
essential in seeing that the plants pay sufficient wages, provide 
safe conditions and do not exploit child labor, protest organizers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest follows similar demonstrations at other campuses  
across the nation.

<HEADLINE> Lewis: I'm Victim of Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lennox Lewis returned home today endorsing the  
investigations into his disputed draw with Evander Holyfield in 
their heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after touching down at London's Heathrow Airport, Lewis  
maintained was the victim of a ``conspiracy'' and that the judges 
had been ``incompetent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everything should be looked into,'' he said. ``There  
was definitely something going on, some kind of conspiracy we don't 
know about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Holyfield-Lewis showdown at Madison Square Garden in  
New York created an outcry when it was called a draw. Most in the 
sellout crowd felt Lewis had won comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Arthur Mercante Jr. agreed, as did most boxing writers  
who covered the 12-rounder 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three judges saw the outcome differently. South  
African Stan Christodoulou scored it 116-113 for Lewis, Eugenia 
Williams of Atlantic City, N.J., voted 115-113 for Holyfield and 
Britain's Larry O'Connell scored it 115-115. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' manager, Frank Maloney, said he didn't believe bribes had  
been paid, but he questioned Williams' competence as a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe there was any illegal payment, they wouldn't  
have been that stupid,'' Maloney said. ``They may not find money in 
her bank account, but there was definitely something wrong with her 
judging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations by state authorities are being held in New York,  
and the Manhattan district attorney is looking into possible 
criminal activity regarding the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be  
identified, said: ``We could be looking at tampering or illegal 
payments. Then again, maybe we're looking at lousy judging, which 
is not a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said Holyfield should hand over the WBA and IBF titles,  
although the British fighter doesn't expect that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Evander's a man, he should admit that he got beat and give  
me my belts,'' said Lewis, who is the WBC champion. ``But he's not 
that kind of character. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say that Evander Holyfield is holding my belts right  
now for me. They're actually my belts but he's holding them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to a possible rematch, Lewis' promoter, Panos  
Eliades, said he was looking at ways of removing Don King as a 
promoter of the fight, although he conceded it would be very 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney said he would prefer the rematch to be in the United  
States or Britain while Eliades said he had been contacted by 
President Nelson Mandela who wanted the fight in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis took consolation from one thing. He believes he won over  
Americans who had been skeptical about his ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``People stopped me in the streets and said 'you got robbed'.  
It's weird getting so many people coming up to me and saying 
that,'' Lewis said. ``When I go out on the streets a lot of people 
know me.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Mixed; Wheat, Coffee Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Oil prices were mixed Thursday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange, with crude futures erasing early gains amid some doubts 
about proposed output cuts by most of the world's top producers. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, wheat prices dropped sharply and coffee prices  
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	April crude oil surged to a 5-month high for a second straight  
day on growing confidence that the world glut that has depressed 
prices will soon be alleviated. But the gains were erased late in 
the session as some uncertainty crept into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuwait was the latest country to indicate it will go along with  
proposed production cuts, telling customers that deliveries will be 
reduced beginning in April. That came one day after Saudi Arabia 
announced plans to cut production by 580,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and Mexico last week reached  
agreement on a plan to cut production. The agreement still must be 
formally approved at the meeting of the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries next week in Vienna, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	But some market participants are skittish about the plan, said  
Ed Kevelson, a vice president at Paribas Futures Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of countries still haven't detailed their cuts.  
Venezuela's comments have been shaky at best,'' Kevelson said. 
``Venezuela is always the wild card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevelson pointed out that while oil prices have rallied lately,  
the market remains bearish compared to previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for April delivery fell 5 cents to $15.00 a barrel.  
April heating oil rose .02 cent to 39.70 cents a gallon; April 
unleaded gasoline fell .17 cent to 47.03 cents a gallon; April 
natural gas fell .61 cents to $1.687 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in May  
rose 10 cents to $13.37 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, grain futures were lower and soybeans mostly  
higher in dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were sharply lower, pressured by moisture moving  
across growing regions in the United States, as well as news that 
the dry Chinese wheat belt got rain Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants also digested news of low net export sales.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and corn futures tumbled on dimmed hopes that the  
government could orchestrate an acreage set-aside this year, which 
had been rumored. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were mostly higher with talk of positive overnight  
export business. Likewise, rumors of a last-minute acreage 
set-aside by the government were dismissed by most market 
participants, which weighed on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just physically can't happen (this year) and I think the  
trade started to realize that today,'' said Don Roose of U.S. 
Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn finished lower despite hitting 9 1/2-week highs earlier in the  
day. Losses were limited by solid weekly export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was off 4 cents to $2.73 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn was off 1 1/2 cent to $2.24 1/4 a bushel; May oats were off 1/2 cent 
to $1.11 a bushel; May soybeans were up 3/4 cent to $4.82 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee experienced its biggest decline in about a month after  
the end of a strike by truckers in Colombia, the world's 
second-largest grower. U.S. warehouse inventories are already 
brimming, meaning depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee for May delivery fell 4.55 cents to $1.0265 a pound on  
the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York.

<HEADLINE> Dems Revive Campaign Funding Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats, preparing for possible  
Republican delaying tactics, said Thursday they are launching a 
signature drive to force the House to take up legislation to change 
campaign funding laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said that by getting 218  
signatures, a majority of House members, on their ``discharge 
petition,'' they could bring the issue to the House floor by late 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the effort are the ``Blue Dogs,'' a group of 29 moderate  
and conservative House Democrats, and Democratic freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would do a terrible disservice, not only to our  
constituents, but also to future generations, if we fail to take 
advantage of this window of opportunity,'' said Rep. Brian Baird, 
D-Wash., president of the 23-member Democratic freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., agreed to bring  
campaign finance bills to the floor only after a similar discharge 
petition neared the 218-signature mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leadership, which opposed campaign spending limits, was  
unable to stop the August passage, by 252-179, of a major campaign 
funding bill sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and 
Martin Meehan, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shays-Meehan bill would ban federal ``soft money'' --  
unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties. It also 
would restrict issue ads, which seek to influence elections under 
the guise of educating voters, and expand disclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar measure in the Senate, sponsored by Sens. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold, D-Wis., had 52 supporters but was 
unable to garner the 60 votes needed to bring it to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenholm said Shays-Meehan again would be the base bill under  
their petition, but that others, including the Republican 
leadership, could offer alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has said he would allow floor  
time this year for the campaign spending issue. But he has not 
responded to a letter from the Democrats seeking a more definite 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala., said he talked to staff in the  
Speaker's office Wednesday, but got no commitment of a time for 
debate. ``We will not be denied this opportunity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stenholm and other supporters are concerned the debate would get  
pushed back to year's end, when the upcoming election season will 
complicate matters and time might run out for both House and Senate 
consideration.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Supporters Elated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Supporters of using marijuana to ease  
patients' pain say they have been handed an important weapon in 
their battle with the federal government to legalize the drug: 
science. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vindication! We were right all the while,'' said Dennis Peron,  
a pro-legalization advocate in San Francisco. ``The science is 
there. Is the political will there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute of Medicine, an affiliate of the National Academy  
of Sciences, said Wednesday that marijuana's active ingredients can 
ease the pain, nausea and vomiting caused by cancer and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	The new analysis, which bolsters similar conclusions by the  
National Institutes of Health, urged scientific trials and the 
development of a standard way to safely use the drug, such as an 
inhaler. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballot measures approving marijuana for medicinal use have  
passed in Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and 
Washington. Still, the drug remains banned by federal law and 
doctors are wary of prescribing it, even in those states. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug policy adviser Barry McCaffrey said federal law  
would be unaffected by the study, although he acknowledged that 
authorities still need to unravel conflicting state and federal 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that because the chemicals in marijuana ease  
anxiety, stimulate the appetite, ease pain and reduce nausea and 
vomiting, they can be helpful for people undergoing chemotherapy 
and people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said there is no evidence that use of marijuana leads to  
other drug use. The panel did warn that smoking marijuana can cause 
respiratory disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of medical marijuana cheered the study's results and  
said opponents will need to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they continue to cling to their arguments, then they begin  
to lose their credibility,'' said Rand Martin, chief of staff for 
California state Sen. John Vasconcellos, D-Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates say the Food and Drug Administration must reclassify  
marijuana from Schedule I -- illegal drugs -- to Schedule II, drugs 
that doctors can prescribe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us waste no more time in providing this medication through  
legal, medical channels to all the patients whose lives may be 
saved,'' said Daniel Zingale of AIDS Action. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking ranks with the pro-medical marijuana groups was the  
National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws, which condemned 
the report as ``tepid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ``What we found  
out is that there may be some chemical compounds in marijuana that 
are useful in pain relief or anti-nausea, but that smoking 
marijuana is a crude delivery system. So I think what this calls

</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who led the fight to get the U.S.  
House of Representatives to condemn medical marijuana last fall, 
said he is ``deeply concerned'' the report might encourage people 
to smoke marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Maginnis, of the conservative Family Research Council,  
said doctors have other medicines to treat any ailment that 
marijuana can help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing good medicine -- not marijuana -- is the compassionate  
response to patients' pain and illnesses,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Renowned Photographer Callahan Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Harry Callahan, who focused on ordinary  
situations to create extraordinary photographs, becoming one of the 
era's most influential photographers, died of cancer. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan died Monday at his home in Atlanta. The National  
Gallery of Art has characterized his work as ``some of the most 
expressive, innovative, and influential photographs of the 20th 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He received the National Medal of the Arts in 1997, one of the  
highest honors for an artist. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took the medium of photography and through his passion and  
his discipline he expanded the boundaries of what we think 
photography is,'' said Tom Southall, photography curator at 
Atlanta's High Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his mentor Ansel Adams, who is known for his black and  
white photographs of mountainous and snowy landscapes, Callahan 
concentrated on the everyday. His subjects ranged from the cities 
where he lived to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Among celebrated works in his national exhibit were studies of  
trees in the snow, crowded streets in Detroit, color work from his 
travels during the late '70s and 80's and shots of his wife 
Eleanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan, who was born in Detroit, started taking pictures in  
1938 after he bought his first camera and did not stop until about 
1995 after suffering a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan was one of the first photographers to experiment with  
color in the 1940s and 1950s, Southall said. But he said Callahan 
did not exhibit this work because color print technology at that 
point ``was not up to the intensity of his vision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan also taught at Chicago's Institute of Design and  
established the photography department at the Rhode Island School 
of Design. He moved to Atlanta in 1983 to be closer to his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Jackson, of Jackson Fine Art, worked as Callahan's local  
representative. After his death, she recalled going through boxes 
of prints in Callahan's closet. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the prints that he tossed aside ... For most  
people, they would have been their premier body of work,'' Ms. 
Jackson said. ``I'm not really sad, because he has left all of this 
wonderful art for people to remember him by. To me, he will never 
die.''

<HEADLINE> Foreign Nurses Bill Clears Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A limited number of foreign-trained nurses  
would be allowed to work in short-staffed American hospitals in 
poor, rural and inner-city areas under a proposal that cleared a 
House subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nurses would be allowed to work in U.S. hospitals for up to  
five years. Visas would be capped at 500 per year over the 
four-year life of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee's immigration panel approved the  
bill by voice vote, sending it to the full committee for further 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals must meet certain criteria in order to hire foreign  
nurses. They must be short of nurses, have at least 190 acute care 
beds, a Medicare population of 35 percent and at least 28 percent 
of the patients on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., the primary sponsor, said that while  
there was no nationwide nursing shortage, many hospitals lack a 
sufficient number of health care professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains safeguards to protect the jobs of  
American nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar measure passed the House last year but died in the  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 441.

<HEADLINE> One Chinese Bank Acquires Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Everbright Bank of China announced today it has  
acquired China Investment Bank, a deal that signals government 
plans to marry troubled financial institutions to stronger 
commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal, Everbright pays nothing for China Investment Bank,  
which has assets of 80 billion yuan ($9.7 billion), but must assume 
an extensive portfolio of non-performing loans, said Zhu Xiaohua, 
chairman of Everbright Holdings, the bank's parent. Zhu told 
reporters at a signing ceremony that about 50 percent of China 
Investment's loans are believed to be bad. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 80 percent of the ailing bank's foreign currency  
loans are considered non-performing and will be shifted to the 
Ministry of Finance to try to recover. The hard currency loans are 
owed to such institutions as the World Bank and the Asian 
Development Bank, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Everbright officials said the bank was acquired through a  
competitive bidding process, not a government-orchestrated bailout. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the Chinese government has put its debt-ridden  
financial institutions in the custody of state banks, which then 
sold off assets and tried to retrieve loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing departed from this practice in January when it declared  
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp. bankrupt and 
said creditors would have to pursue their claims in court. The 
move, however, shook foreign confidence in China's banking system 
and led to a tightening of overseas credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Everbright officials said Thursday's acquisition of China  
Investment marks a new step in efforts to restructure failing banks 
along commercial lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Everbright, one of China's most profitable commercial banks, is  
taking over China Investment from State Development Bank, which is 
keeping 20 branches to use as regional banking centers. State 
Development Bank currently has only one bank branch outside 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Everbright will get 29 branches and 137 banking offices from  
China Investment. Everbright will also keep about half the bank's 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu, who said the takeover occurred ``without political or  
administrative interference,'' predicted Everbright can pull China 
Investment out of the red by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Tire Marks Key to Train Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- As the crossing gates clanged their  
warning, the train rolled down the track in the darkness and a 
truck pulled near the danger zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights earlier at the same site and at about the same time,  
Amtrak's City of New Orleans train plowed into a tractor-trailer 
loaded with steel, killing 11 people and injuring more than 100 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, investigators were standing by as they used a  
reenactment Wednesday night to help figure out what happened in the 
seconds before the nation's deadliest train wreck in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main purpose is to see who could see what and when,'' said  
Robert Lauby, director of railroad safety for the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also talked again to the engineer, who  
remained in the hospital, and the driver of the truck, John Stokes 
of Manteno. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB spokesman Phil Frame would not comment on what the engineer  
said or the nature of his injuries, or what information the brief 
telephone interview with Stokes produced. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports Tuesday that the engineer said immediately  
after the crash that the truck driver had tried to zigzag his 
semitrailer through the crossing gates after they had come down. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB member John Goglia said authorities are analyzing two tire  
tracks in the mud at the crossing that ``would indicate that 
somebody tried to go around the gates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reenactment was conducted at about 9:45 p.m. -- almost the  
same time the City of New Orleans approached the crossing 50 miles 
south of Chicago on Monday. This time, a single engine moved slowly 
down the tracks, sounding its horn while crossing gates came down 
and warning lights flashed. A tractor-trailer sat parked behind the 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of freight cars was also placed on a nearby side track  
to see if they could have impaired the truck driver's view. NTSB 
officials spent more than an hour taking measurements but declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, family members of those who died boarded two buses and  
were driven from their motel to the crash site. They gathered in a 
massive hug and placed a wreath and pink, yellow and white roses 
near the front of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Some brought dental records to help identify the victims.  
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, who was driving on a probationary license after three  
speeding violations in Indiana, told investigators he had already 
driven into the crossing when the gates came down. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities said there was no indication the gates had  
failed to work. The red signal light flashes for five seconds 
before the gates descend and then drivers already in the crossing 
have 26 seconds to clear it. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia said results of a breath test for the 58-year-old driver  
for alcohol had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that it didn't show he went over the limit,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was hauling tons of steel rods produced at a nearby  
mill when struck by the train, which had been traveling at 79 mph. 
The onrushing twin locomotives swept the heavy truck aside and 
smashed into two railroad cars on a nearby siding before stopping 
about 50 yards south of the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	When the locomotives stopped, many of the 14 cars hurtling along  
behind plowed into the engines, jackknifed and piled up in a heap 
of twisted metal. Diesel fuel began to burn and the fire crept 
under a double-deck sleeping car ripped open by the impact with a 
locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
	All those who died were in that car, authorities said.

	Source: Driver Tried To Beat Train  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- A motorist who claims to have been  
directly behind the truck involved in the deadly Amtrak collision 
said the driver tried to snake through lowered crossing gates and 
beat the train, a high-level federal source told The Associated 
Press today. The National Transportation Safety Board source, who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said investigators believe the 
motorist is credible and had a clear view of the accident. Monday's 
crash killed 11 people. The engineer in the locomotive has claimed 
the truck driver had tried to zigzag his tractor-trailer through 
the crossing gates after they had come down.

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Arab foreign ministers today again turned  
down Iraq's demands to condemn U.S.-British airstrikes on the 
country, declaring instead that Iraq should comply fully with U.N. 
resolutions. In a joint statement issued at the end of their 
two-day meeting, the ministers only demanded ``a halt to any action 
against Iraq outside the mandate of the related (U.N.) Security 
Council resolutions.'' The statement did not refer directly to the 
airstrikes or name the United States and Britain.

attacks. ``We have no defense today against any missile system. It 
is a national priority that this Congress needs to address,'' Rep.

Brian Jones of England headed out over the Atlantic Ocean, hoping 
for a possible Sunday morning landing in northwest Africa. By this 
afternoon, Jones, a 51-year-old balloon instructor, and Piccard, a

six times but pulling back each time. On Tuesday, the Dow briefly 
traded as high as 10,001.78 before slipping back. A spark for 
today's advance was the report that consumer prices rose 0.1

problem and prevent the number from being planted in such

Microsoft confirmed earlier this month that its latest version of

scoring wouldn't have changed the ultimate outcome of the bout, 
though.

<HEADLINE>  Gonzaga Ready for Gators' Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- They are as diverse as schools get in the NCAA  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga, named for a 16th-century Jesuit priest considered the  
patron saint of youth, has about 4,800 students on its campus in 
the chilly, windswept eastern Washington city of Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	At opposite corner of the country, Florida has 42,000 students  
and a bushel of national sports championships, most notably in 
football. Gonzaga doesn't even field a football team. 
</P>
<P>
	But both play basketball, and when the Zags and Gators meet  
tonight in the NCAA West Region semifinals, they will play with 
styles that are much alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have incredible similarities,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson  
said. ``Both are superior shooting teams with tremendous skill 
people. Both can step out four guys that shoot quality 3s. We are 
two of the more skilled teams as far as being skilled offensively 
at five positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida will try to rattle the Bulldogs with defensive pressure,  
a tactic that could backfire against Gonzaga's two-headed 
point-guard system, with Quintin Hall and Matt Santangelo as 
co-playmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can handle any press,'' Hall said. ``I don't think it  
really can stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida coach Billy Donovan acknowledges that Gonzaga is  
equipped to survive the press, but that won't change the style he 
learned as a player and later as an assistant coach under Rick 
Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've pressed Kentucky this year. We've pressed Arkansas.  
We've pressed Tennessee,'' he said. ``That's who we are. That's 
what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a press is as foreign as a March week in Phoenix for  
Monson's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a concern of mine because in our league we've been this  
invincible team that can't be pressed because we have two point 
guards on the floor at the same time,'' he said. ``We haven't been 
challenged with full-court pressure much this year at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``So whether we're good at it or not, we haven't had a lot of  
repetitions at it. That's scary as a coach because we only have 40 
minutes tomorrow to figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps of more concern is how Gonzaga will handle Florida's  
size inside, especially 6-foot-7, 260-pound freshman Udonis Haslem, 
while at the same time defending the Gators' 3-point shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to throw bodies at him just like we did last week  
(against Stanford),'' Monson said. ``That's probably about as scary 
as anything because he keeps you honest coming off of anybody else 
and helping out because they put four shooters around a guy like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have had opposite experiences the past few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga, the West's No. 10 seed, emerged as one of the darlings  
of the nation's media and basked in the unfamiliar spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an overwhelming week for myself and our kids, one  
that we'll cherish forever,'' Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators, meanwhile, came directly to Phoenix from Seattle and  
have quietly spent the past few days practicing and staying low-key 
at a hotel near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been practicing, watching films and resting,'' said  
guard Eddie Shannon, one of just two seniors on the team. ``It's 
been a perfect situation. There need not be any distractions. We 
want to be prepared to play.''

</P>
<P>
	``We can handle any press,'' Hall said. ``I don't think it  
really can stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida coach Billy Donovan acknowledges that Gonzaga is  
equipped to survive the press, but that won't change the style he 
learned as a player and later as an assistant coach under Rick 
Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've pressed Kentucky this year. We've pressed Arkansas.  
We've pressed Tennessee,'' he said. ``That's who we are. That's 
what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a press is as foreign as a March week in Phoenix for  
Monson's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a concern of mine because in our league we've been this  
invincible team that can't be pressed because we have two point 
guards on the floor at the same time,'' he said. ``We haven't been 
challenged with full-court pressure much this year at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``So whether we're good at it or not, we haven't had a lot of  
repetitions at it. That's scary as a coach because we only have 40 
minutes tomorrow to figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps of more concern is how Gonzaga will handle Florida's  
size inside, especially 6-foot-7, 260-pound freshman Udonis Haslem, 
while at the same time defending the Gators' 3-point shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to throw bodies at him just like we did last week  
(against Stanford),'' Monson said. ``That's probably about as scary 
as anything because he keeps you honest coming off of anybody else 
and helping out because they put four shooters around a guy like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have had opposite experiences the past few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga, the West's No. 10 seed, emerged as one of the darlings  
of the nation's media and basked in the unfamiliar spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an overwhelming week for myself and our kids, one  
that we'll cherish forever,'' Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators, meanwhile, came directly to Phoenix from Seattle and  
have quietly spent the past few days practicing and staying low-key 
at a hotel near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been practicing, watching films and resting,'' said  
guard Eddie Shannon, one of just two seniors on the team. ``It's 
been a perfect situation. There need not be any distractions. We 
want to be prepared to play.''

<HEADLINE> Temple Preps for Purdue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- There's a four-letter word Temple coach John  
Chaney doesn't want his players to utter, and it begins with ``D.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If you guessed ``Duke,'' you would be right. Just try not to  
mention the name of the top-ranked team to the Owls again until 
after sixth-seeded Temple's East Regional semifinal game Friday 
against 10th-seeded Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys who look too far ahead make a lot of blunders. I  
just want them to win today, just win now,'' Chaney said before his 
team departed Philadelphia on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Temple (23-10) beats Purdue (21-12), they could face  
top-seeded Duke, assuming the Blue Devils defeat 12th-seed 
Southwest Missouri State in Friday's other semifinal at the 
Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to convince my team that the most important thing  
that happens to you is what happens today, not yesterday, not 
tomorrow,'' Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that his players need much convincing in the first place,  
especially with last year's 82-52 first-round loss to West Virginia 
still lingering in their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Karcher, who sat out last season because of academics,  
remembers watching the game on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still can't believe (I'm here). I remember last year I was  
home watching the game with my grandmother. It was a bad feeling,'' 
said Karcher, who leads Temple in scoring with 13 points per game. 
``The whole time I was watching, I was saying to myself, `Man, I 
wish I was playing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Karcher hopes to step up his shooting against Purdue. After  
scoring in double figures for 15 straight games, the 6-foot-5 
forward has managed just 11 points on 3-for-12 shooting in the 
first two tournament games and has been hampered by foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes down to fundamentals,'' Chaney said. ``The guys who  
make a lot more errors, the guys who try to hit home runs, the guys 
who concentrate on the small things, don't make it. We always go 
back to A-B-C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers have been up and down all season, entering the  
tournament having lost four of five games. But upset wins over 
Texas and Miami in the NCAA tournament have Purdue on the upswing 
again, with Purdue's man-to-man defense holding second-seeded Miami 
to a season-low 32.9 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Temple's matchup zone keys their play. The Owls have  
limited opponents to 37.8 percent shooting, including 36 percent 
from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, Temple's 6-10 forward Lamont Barnes, who has averaged  
13.5 points in the tournament, might be able to take advantage of 
Purdue's front line, which has no starter taller than 6-8. Pepe 
Sanchez has averaged 14.5 points the last two games, but the point 
guard is even more essential in keying the Owls' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Purdue) is a physical team, and they play great defense,''  
said Temple sixth man Quincy Wadley, who is still nursing a bruised 
hand but is expected to play Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``But defense has been our philosophy, too. Our defense -- that's  
been the key to our success,'' Wadley said.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Warns Citizens Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department renewed its calls  
Wednesday for Americans living and traveling abroad to remain 
vigilant of their personal safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said in a formal advisory that it continues to  
receive reports that provide cause for concern for the safety of 
U.S. government officials and private citizens abroad 
</P>
<P>
	``We takes these threats seriously, and the U.S. has increased  
security at United States Government facilities worldwide,'' the 
advisory said. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar worldwide caution was issued in December. ``It's not a  
specific incident, it was a continuing situation,'' State 
Department spokeswoman Julie Reside gave Wednesday as the reason 
for extending it. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of U.S. diplomatic posts have temporarily suspended  
service to the public because of threats, and others may have to do 
so in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The department cited the following situations as possible  
threats to the safety of Americans abroad: 
</P>
<P>
	--Osama bin Laden, who has been indicted for the bombings of U.S.  
embassies in Africa and for threatening to kill U.S. citizens, and 
other terrorists continue to make threats against the United States 
and do not distinguish between military and civilian targets. 
</P>
<P>
	--The potential for retaliatory action against Americans and  
American interests following U.S. air strikes against Sudan and 
Afghanistan and the apprehension of suspects in the bombing of the 
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	--The potential for retaliatory action against Americans  
``because of Iraq's continuing defiance of U.N. Security Council 
resolutions and persistent challenges to U.S. and coalition 
enforcement of the no-fly zones over Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department recommended that Americans maintain a low  
profile, vary routes and times for all required travel and treat 
mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans traveling abroad can obtain the latest information on  
security conditions from the nearest embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	The public announcement expires on June 17.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Tobacco Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An effort to require states to spend tobacco  
settlement money on health-related projects was killed today by the 
Senate, which endorsed allowing states to spend the money any way 
they please. 
</P>
<P>
	By 71-29, the Senate killed an amendment by Sen. Arlen Specter,  
R-Pa., to a $1.9 billion spending bill that would have required 
states to spend 50 percent of the money they receive from a 
November settlement on smoking reduction programs and assistance 
for tobacco farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's typical federal government arrogance,'' declared Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``The federal government wants 
the money -- or if they don't get it, they want to control it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is state money, it is not federal money,'' said Sen. Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected Specter's argument that the federal  
government has the right to set spending priorities for the money 
because it pays 57 percent of Medicaid costs, which were part of 
the states' claim against tobacco companies. Without those 
guidelines, states were likely to spend the money on unrelated 
projects, such as highways and tax cuts, its proponents argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a right and obligation to say that some portion of  
that money, that federal money, ought to go to health-related 
obligations,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that the federal government could demand the states  
return all of the money it spent on Medicaid, ``this is really a 
gentle nudge,'' Specter said from the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents instead argued that the states fought for, won and are  
entitled to spend the money as they please. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to tell Texas how to spend its money, quit the  
Senate, move to Texas ... and run for the state Legislature,'' Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, told the amendment's supporters. ``The federal 
government needs to butt out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate underscored the ongoing dispute over tobacco policy  
following the death last year of a $516 billion settlement 
sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. McCain voted for the Specter 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the tobacco industry settled with the states,  
agreeing to pay $40 billion over 25 years to settle four state 
lawsuits and an additional $206 billion in a broader deal with the 
other 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison sponsored an amendment, approved by the Senate  
Appropriations Committee earlier this month, that would prevent the 
federal government from dictating how states spend the settlement 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter's measure, which was opposed by every governor and flew  
in the face of the GOP's stated commitment to give states greater 
decision-making power, would have replaced Hutchison's.

<HEADLINE> NEA Drops Book, Printing Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A children's book by Mexican guerrilla leader  
Subcomandante Marcos has more than doubled its print run since the 
National Endowment for the Arts withdrew its backing this month, 
the distributor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We originally had 5,000 printed,'' said Randall Beek,  
president of Consortium Book Sales and Distribution in St. Paul, 
Minn. ``They're all gone and we've ordered 6,000 more. We'll have 
to see how much more demand all the publicity will generate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new printing, like the first one, is being done in Hong Kong  
and will be in the United States next month, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Called ``The Story of Colors,'' the book tells how the old Mayan  
gods created colors to brighten a gray world. The bilingual edition 
published in El Paso, Texas, included an NEA logo photo of Marcos 
in his signature black ski mask, with ammunition belts across his 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcos has been at odds with the Mexican government since he led  
a brief revolt five years ago in the southern state of Chiapas, 
known for its ancient Mayan ruins and poor farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	NEA Chairman William J. Ivey canceled the $7,500 grant, which  
had been approved at lower levels, on March 9 after a reporter for 
The New York Times called it to his attention. Ivey said some of 
the grant might find its way to the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lennan Foundation of Santa Fe, N.M., called the decision  
political censorship and made a $15,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government has identified Marcos as a graduate in  
philosophy and literature from a Mexican university. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivey has been working to rebuild support for the NEA after  
unsuccessful attempts by the House Republican leadership to abolish 
it. Opponents of the agency say some of the work it financed was 
obscene. 
</P>
<P>
	Susannah Byrd of Cinco Puntos Press in El Paso, Texas, which  
published the book, said the new printing will omit the NEA logo, 
but that will be the only change.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Researcher Is Ostracized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Researcher Peter Duesberg is a  
scientific outcast because of his AIDS theories, but he's still in 
business thanks to a fund-raising approach as unconventional as his 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Duesberg, who maintains that AIDS is not caused by the human  
immunodeficiency virus but by illegal drugs and the AIDS medication 
AZT, has been raising money from private sources for years, living 
from check to check. 
</P>
<P>
	But his fund-raising took on added urgency last November when he  
feared he was about to lose his lab at the University of California 
at Berkeley for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of Duesberg sprang into action, soliciting donations by  
way of the Internet and an ad in the alumni magazine. The ad 
brought in a stream of small contributions, which along with 
$200,000 in foundation money and some other big individual 
donations amounted to $325,000, enough to eke out another year of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Duesberg is grateful for the kindness of friends and strangers  
but said it's a hard way to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
	``You also begin to see how easy it is if you just conform,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve years ago, Duesberg filled out grant applications and the  
government sent him checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, Duesberg was a member of the elite National Academy  
of Sciences, winner of a 1985 Outstanding Investigator Award from 
the National Institutes of Health and a leading authority on 
retroviruses, a family that includes the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	But after he published his HIV theory, his reputation tanked.  
The mainstream AIDS community has rebuffed his theories, saying it 
is clear that HIV does cause AIDS and that arguing otherwise 
dangerously undercuts the safe-sex message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever inroads we have made to help people to practice safer  
sex or to exchange needles -- that all goes out the window,'' said 
David Evans of Project Inform, an advocacy group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1987, Duesberg has had 20 grant applications turned down.  
A spokesman for the NIH declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	As a tenured professor of molecular and cell biology, Duesberg  
still has his salary and position at Berkeley. But without grant 
money, he cannot operate a lab, which is crucial to continuing his 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	The private donations can't overcome another problem: no  
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Duesberg said students visit early in the semester and seem  
interested. But after a few weeks, they fade away. ``They're told 
by the graduate advisers and by their peers, they may not be able 
to get a job, I may not be able to pay them, and it would be bad 
for their reputations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Lynn, head of Duesberg's division, said the Berkeley  
community hasn't ostracized Duesberg. ``Everybody kind of looks at 
him an amused sort of way,'' Lynn said. ``Berkeley has a lot more 
radical people than Peter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duesberg said his lab and money problems reflect his one-man  
battle with scientists and drug companies who, he maintains, have 
invested too much in the HIV-AIDS connection to admit to an 
alternative theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't realize how un-free we are to do science in  
America,'' he said. ``They can afford to give millions, but they 
cannot afford to give me $100,000 or $200,000 to prove them 
wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Ireland Has New Singer Sinead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Women often react as if they're hearing a  
feminist anthem when singer Sinead Lohan performs the title cut to 
her album, ``No Mermaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hypnotic chorus certainly sounds like a defiant statement of  
self-sufficiency in a patriarchal society: ``I am no mermaid, and I 
am no fisherman's slave,'' she sings. ``I am no mermaid, I keep my 
head above the waves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Lohan is uncomfortable when women cheer and sing along in  
solidarity with sisterhood. In those moments, she's apt to switch 
personal pronouns and make the mermaid a man. 
</P>
<P>
	She began writing the song with the image of a person going down  
to the water's edge, faced with the prospect of swimming out of his 
or her depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people would take the challenge and go for it and others  
would be too conflicted,'' she explained over a cup of coffee one 
cold afternoon in Manhattan. ``I was thinking that no matter how 
far you go out into the water, you're still a person, you still 
have to go back on the land. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what it was,'' she said. ``It wasn't about women at  
all. I was just making an observation about human nature. I leave 
that sort of hidden political message to another Sinead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lohan's not about to have her music hijacked by anyone. Her  
American debut album, one of last year's best, exhibits that 
resolve. It's a sturdy collection of folk-rock, impressive in its 
maturity and sense of craft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lohan, 28, grew up in County Cork, Ireland, the daughter of a  
school administrator and a father who used to play in show bands. 
She was a fan of classical music, but was also moved by 
contemporary artists like Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and 
that other Sinead -- Sinead O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admired them for being themselves,'' she said. ``It wasn't  
like I could sing like them or write like them. I discovered you 
could be yourself and still be that strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from high school, she took a college course in  
music and began singing her own songs in a pub back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Lohan even had a chance to decide whether music was what  
she wanted to do with her life, her songs started getting noticed 
and she made a record. That 1995 album, ``Who Do You Think I Am,'' 
was a Top 10 hit in Ireland and was eventually released throughout 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``No Mermaid'' represents Americans' first chance to hear her  
music. She's signed to Interscope Records in the United States, one 
of the most successful labels of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Her songs are infused with ambivalent characters. ``Sometimes  
you give me all you've got to give me,'' Lohan sings, ``and 
sometimes you act like you don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She says she's fascinated at how everyone can relate to the  
emotions in music, regardless of language or nationality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really only trying to capture a feeling that you might  
have had for a minute in a song,'' she said. ``It's like trying to 
take a photograph of a particular feeling or a time. I'm writing 
about really small things. I'm not writing about any things that 
are unusual -- it's just basic human emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And don't worry if you can't understand what's going on in a  
particular song. Sometimes you're not meant to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to create a mood in a song and it doesn't matter  
what the words mean, really,'' she said. ``Maybe I get a feeling 
from someone else's songs and I wouldn't necessarily know what they 
are talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In producer Malcolm Burn, Lohan found a distinctive, though not  
overwhelming, partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Burn is a disciple of producer Daniel Lanois, whose spooky  
soundscapes are heard on albums like Bob Dylan's ``Time Out of 
Mind.'' The drawback to Lanois is sometimes his work is more 
recognizable than the artist he's producing. Burn had intriguing 
production ideas but they were all in service to the song. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed a producer who would take what I produced and build a  
picture around me instead of a collaborator,'' she said. ``I sang 
as best I could and he filled it in. His production ideas were 
amazing, he made every sound sound different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lohan's career was boosted by an association with Joan Baez. She  
opened concerts for Baez on a British tour and the veteran folkie 
was so impressed with Lohan's work she recorded two of her songs, 
including ``No Mermaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it as a huge compliment, that somebody who has been  
around so many great songwriters would choose to record some of my 
songs,'' Lohan said. ``She's in a different scene, but she appeals 
to a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lohan is methodically trying to build her audience.  
She's done three separate concert tours in the United States since 
the album's release, each time playing to bigger crowds. She was 
even amenable to playing in the Northeast during the winter even 
while pregnant with her first child. She brought along her 
childhood sweetheart, an accountant, for company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still very exciting for me to come over from Ireland and  
play,'' she said. ``It's still a big adventure.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 25.53 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were higher at midday as investors  
reacted to another positive report on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
25.53 at 9,904.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well, with the Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index up 7.00 at 1,304.82, and the technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index up 9.82 at 2,438.79. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow fell 51.06 to 9,879.41 after briefly  
crossing 10,000 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose this morning after the Labor Department reported  
consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent last month, a signal that 
inflation is under control. That news boosted prices in the bond 
market, where the 30-year Treasury bond was up 9/32 point and its 
yield, which moves opposite the price, was at 5.48 percent, down 
from 5.5 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were unfazed by a separate report from the Commerce  
Department that the nation's trade deficit shot up 21 percent in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also undisturbed by the continuing rise in oil prices,  
which longer-term could prove inflationary. ``Oil is turning the 
corner,'' said Gregory Nie, a technical analyst at Everen 
Securities in Chicago, ``but there will be a proving period over 
the short term where you get a correction in crude that will take a 
little starch out of this move up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were higher today, with Dow member Exxon up 1 at 75 3/8.  
</P>
<P>
	Dow components were also led higher by financial services  
stocks, which reacted positively to a report that Chase Manhattan 
Corp. is looking for a merger partner. Chase shares were up 1 1/16 
at 83 7/16. American Express was leading the Dow components higher 
and was up 3 5/16 at 124 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. of  
Hartford, Conn., said Friday's triple expiration of options and 
futures contracts lent a slightly positive bias to stock prices 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Shaughnessy said, ``the fundamentals of the market  
remain solid. Inflation is benign, the economy is in good shape, 
profits will start to pick up this quarter.'' He predicts the Dow 
will rise to 10,600 by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues edged out decliners by 1,422 to 1,345 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 364.53 million 
shares, up from Wednesday's pace of 337.61 million.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Count Vs. Hubbell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a  
criminal count against presidential friend Webster Hubbell in a 
fraud indictment that makes references to Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The count accused Hubbell of scheming to conceal work done by  
him and Mrs. Clinton, his former law partner, on a failed Arkansas 
land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson agreed with Hubbell that the  
allegations in the count were too vague. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charging language ... alleges no specific act or acts of  
concealment by 'trick, scheme or device' and no specific 'false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations,'' the 
judge said, citing specific language of federal law. ``It is 
non-specific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had obtained a 15-count  
indictment of Hubbell last November in connection with a land deal 
known as Castle Grande. Federal regulators said the deal was 
riddled with ``insider dealing, fictitious sales and land flips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson dismissed Hubbell's motions to throw out other counts  
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was referred to 36 times in the original indictment  
against Hubbell, signifying that her name could be brought up 
repeatedly in the trial set to begin June 14. She could be called 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's witness list is not due until April 14, lawyers said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons' Whitewater partner, the late James McDougal, tried  
to sell off pieces of Castle Grande to prop up his collapsing 
savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissed count charged that from March 1989 through  
December 1995, Hubbell tried to cover up the true nature of his and 
Mrs. Clinton's relationships with Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth 
Ward; with McDougal's Madison Guaranty bank and the land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also was accused of making ``false and fraudulent''  
statements and representations to two U.S. banking regulatory 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hubbell argues that Count 1 is a 'catch all' count that fails  
to inform him clearly of the precise offense of which he is accused 
so that he may prepare his defense,'' Robertson wrote in 18-page 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He points out reasonably that a jury might convict if it  
unanimously accepted the generality of the charge of 'scheming,' 
although split on which (if any) of the many acts alleged ... 
(that) Hubbell actually committed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office maintained that the count was ``sufficiently  
specific'' and that it was not necessary for that count ``to set 
forth precisely the false statements and acts of concealment upon 
which it depends ...,'' the opinion said. The independent counsel 
contended the concealment scheme was the offense, rather than any 
specific act.

<HEADLINE> Moya Has Hot Competition for No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. (AP) -- Carlos Moya's first tournament as the  
No. 1 player in the world could be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniard is just one of five men with a chance to emerge  
from the Lipton Champions ranked No. 1. Moya leads Pete Sampras by 
just 37 computer points, and Patrick Rafter, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and 
Alex Corretja are also in the chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya, who plays Davide Sanguinetti in his opening match Friday  
or Saturday, knows it won't be easy to stay No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to fight a lot if I want to win, because now  
all the players want to beat me,'' he said Thursday. ``It will be 
difficult to win every match, because they're going to be extra 
motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unseeded players were in action Thursday. Among the winners were  
Jennifer Capriati, who beat Silvija Talaja 6-4, 6-3, and Vince 
Spadea, who beat Franco Squillari 6-3, 6-2. Petr Korda lost to 
Christian Ruud 6-2, 7-6 (8-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Becker was scheduled to play his first match in the United  
States since 1996 against Gianluca Pozzi on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya, the defending French Open champion, is the 15th player and  
the first Spaniard to earn the No. 1 ranking. He overtook Sampras 
by winning his semifinal match last week at Indian Wells, prompting 
a memorable celebration on the court by Moya, his coach and 
trainer. They formed a circle, held hands and began jumping up and 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning Grand Slams is great, but I think being No. 1 is the  
greatest thing that can happen to you,'' Moya said. ``There have 
only been 15 players. That shows you how difficult it is to get up 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moya, who lost a five-set final to Mark Philippoussis at Indian  
Wells, will try to improve on a modest 2-2 career record on 
Lipton's hardcourts. His ascent to No. 1 shows that Spaniards can 
succeed on surfaces other than clay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clay was my natural surface, where I move better,'' he said.  
``I don't have to think at all to hit the ball. But it was always 
in my mind that I wanted to be a good player on hardcourts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moya's reign begins a year after Marcelo Rios became the first  
No. 1 player from South America. Rios rose to No. 1 by winning 
Lipton and held the spot for six weeks in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to end the French Open as No. 1,'' Moya said.  
``That will be difficult, but that's my next goal.''

<HEADLINE> State Department, Bosnia Links Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In contacts under federal investigation,  
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's brother-in-law received 
thousands of dollars from an associate of accused war criminal 
Radovan Karadzic around the time he tried to arrange the Bosnian 
fugitive's surrender, according to lawyers and government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott's brother-in-law, Cody P. Shearer, is now telling  
authorities he has received mail threats from Bosnian figures who 
claim he took the money in 1997 with promises to win leniency for 
Karadzic on the war crimes charges, and demand that he pay 
Karadzic's family $1 million or risk ``tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer's lawyer denies those claims and says the money his  
client received was reimbursement for expenses he incurred while 
helping the Karadzic associate. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Shearer reported the threats, the State Department  
inspector general and the FBI had begun investigating whether he 
misrepresented his ties to the Clinton administration in his 
dealings with the Bosnian figures, several government officials 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The contacts include a meeting Shearer had with Karadzic's  
family, a letter he received from the accused war criminal, his 
efforts to introduce a Karadzic associate, physicist Dragan 
Hajdukovic, to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, 
Netherlands, in 1997 and his efforts to assist Hajdukovic's 
advocacy of a Bosnia peace plan, according to documents and 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Karadzic was indicted by the war crimes tribunal in 1995 for  
geonicide in the massacre of thousands of Muslims after Bosnian 
Serb forces captured Srebrenica, which had been designated as a 
U.N. ``safe zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Documents show U.S. officials knew that Shearer was dealing with  
Hajdukovic to arrange a possible surrender by Karadzic as early as 
summer 1997. A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said Talbott was told about it at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later when reports surfaced that Hajdukovic was promoting  
a plan that would undo the 1995 Dayton peace accords for Bosnia, 
Talbott sent a letter to Shearer suggesting such contacts were 
better left to the U.S. special emissary for the region, Robert 
Gelbard. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer's lawyer, William Murphy, said his client received  
payments of less than $25,000 from Hajdukovic in fall 1997 and the 
money was used as reimbursement for expenses and a donation to a 
group Shearer runs. Murphy said Shearer paid phone and living 
expenses for Hajdukovic as the physicist promoted his own peace 
plan for Bosnia and later tried to arrange Karadzic's surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	Karadzic, who led the Bosnian Serbs during 3 1/2 years of civil war  
that left 200,000 dead, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
	One issue for investigators is how Shearer, who visited Bosnia  
as a journalist and head of a tax-exempt peace organization, 
represented his ties to his diplomat brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	In a February 1996 letter, for instance, Shearer wrote  
Hajdukovic claiming the Bosnian had played a ``an unheralded, 
critical role in bringing peace to Bosnia'' and securing the 
release of a U.S. journalist and French pilots held captive there. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer wrote that Talbott had been ``absolutely amazed at your  
work and contacts'' and suggested he had talked to Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright, then the U.N. ambassador, and President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hajdukovic says Shearer invoked the names of Clinton and  
Talbott. ``He said, 'If you can show to my big friends, meaning his 
brother-in-law and president, that you can offer a serious line of 
negotiation, military action to capture Karadzic would not 
happen,''' Hajdukovic said in a telephone interview from Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy demurred. ``Cody always made it clear to Mr. Hajdukovic  
that he was not an official representative of the United States nor 
would he act as an emissary to representatives of the U.S. 
government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past month, Hajdukovic and other Bosnians sent at least  
eight letters to Shearer and his lawyers alleging he had reneged on 
promises to ``moderate'' or ``abolish'' the war crimes charges 
against Karadzic and claiming the money he received came directly 
from Karadzic's family, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer said Shearer never was told the money had come from  
Karadzic or had any connection to the war crimes case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The letters that Mr. Shearer recently received were troubling  
and prompted us to forward all of them to the FBI so that they 
might investigate whether Mr. Shearer is the victim of an attempted 
extortion,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hajdukovic acknowledged sending some of the letters and said  
Shearer had been paid substantially more than the $25,000. He would 
not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I ask is not to blackmail, I simply ask that he repay the  
funds he received, nothing less and nothing more,'' Hajdukovic 
said. Hajdukovic declined to say where the money came from. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer is the brother of Brooke Shearer, who is married to  
Talbott. Shearer's brother, Derek, was Clinton's ambassador to 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	When the contacts were first disclosed last fall by former GOP  
congressional investigator David Bossie, U.S. officials said Cody 
Shearer was not acting on behalf of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the State Department's present assessment is that Karadzic tried to 
use the Hajdukovic-Shearer connection to claim influence with 
Talbott and Clinton and ``sow seeds of discontent'' among Bosnian 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents reviewed by the AP indicate that Shearer met with  
Karadzic's mother and brothers in Montenegro in 1997, then received 
a letter from the fugitive indicating he was willing to consider a 
surrender to the Hague tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of any risky acts, I am ready to cooperate in ... a  
resolution of the Hague problem,'' Karadzic wrote Shearer. ``I 
don't know how the Hague problem is going to be resolved. I am not 
concerned with my destiny, nor am I afraid from what may happen to 
me but I do have a good case, since I did not do anything wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer forwarded the letter to his brother, the former  
ambassador. His fax, dated Aug. 25, 1997, stated he had met 
Karadzic's mother and brothers in Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	His family and others said that if Karadzic died in a military  
capture raid, ``the Serb part of Bosnia will go up in flames and 
Dayton (peace accords) will be killed forever,'' Shearer reported 
to his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Shearer requested that a ``responsible U.S. official'' contact  
Hajdukovic. Shearer's fax was forwarded to a State Department 
lawyer who reports to Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	According to both Hajdukovic and an associate close to Shearer,  
who spoke only on condition of anonymity, Shearer introduced 
Hajdukovic to a lawyer at the war crimes tribunal in late summer 
1997.

<HEADLINE> Boy Awarded $14.5M in FB Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A boy who suffered brain damage while  
playing high school football has won a roughly $15 million jury 
award from the company that made the boy's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	After six hours of deliberation Wednesday, federal jurors  
awarded $11.45 million to Joe Rodriguez, a former Los Fresnos High 
School football player, and his mother, Raquel Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Pre-judgment interest currently puts the total award around  
$14.5 million, plaintiffs lawyer Arnold Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Riddell Sports Inc. has promised to appeal the  
decision. Riddell is the biggest producer of football protective 
equipment and supplies helmets and pads for the NFL. Revenue for 
last year topped $186 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During the six-day trial, the plaintiffs argued that Riddell  
could have provided a safer, more-padded helmet than the one 
Rodriguez was wearing. The company had, in fact, made such a helmet 
but chose not to sell it, Aguilar argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had the materials to make a better helmet,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Riddell lawyers argued that Rodriguez could have had a previous  
medical problem, such as a brain aneurysm, that was aggravated by 
the blow he took to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was 19 in August 1995, when he was thrown to the  
ground and landed on his head during a scrimmage. He walked to the 
sideline and collapsed minutes later. Today, he is in a vegetative 
state and is fed through a tube. Doctors expect him to live only 15 
more years, and his medical bills run about $125,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors listened to six days of conflicting testimony from expert  
witnesses, including doctors and engineers who disagreed on whether 
the helmet Rodriguez was wearing or an improved helmet would have 
prevented his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Bob Guerra, who represented Riddell, declined comment  
Wednesday and didn't return a phone call from the Associated Press 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell officials in Chicago also did not return a phone call,  
but in a statement said that even if the verdict stands, it is 
responsible for only $750,000 in damages. The rest is covered by 
its insurance, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We disagree sharply with the verdict and plan to aggressively  
appeal this case,'' the statement said. ``The facts, in our view, 
are not consistent with the verdict that was rendered.''

<HEADLINE> Movies Revisit Cold War Over Kazan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Time has done nothing to quell the  
hurt and anger felt by those on Hollywood's blacklist toward the 
people who named their names. 
</P>
<P>
	At a raucous news conference Thursday, blacklisted screenwriters  
displayed ads bought in Hollywood trade papers denouncing a special 
Oscar going to director Elia Kazan, who identified Communist Party 
members during infamous hearings nearly 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``His actions did enormous damage to the motion picture  
industry, as well as established throughout the country a climate 
of fear which suppressed creativity and silenced dissent,'' says 
the ads to appear today in the Hollywood Reporter and Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were unveiled by members of a group called the Committee  
Against Silence. At the event, interrupted by a heckler shouting 
``Communism is evil!,'' writers, entertainment union members and 
others said Kazan's testimony in 1952 denied many of his colleagues 
the opportunities for the same accomplishments he is being honored 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ruined and destroyed their careers, their families, their  
lives,'' said Norma Barzman, a 78-year-old blacklisted writer whose 
name was restored this month to the 1953 film ``Luxury Girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 89-year-old Kazan will receive the lifetime achievement  
Oscar during Sunday night's televised ceremony. His critics have 
called on audience members to refrain from applauding when he 
accepts his award. 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate news conference, Academy president Robert Rehme  
said the award was solely for Kazan's ``body of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a good side to the protest, it is that it has made  
people aware of that terrible period of our history and the impact 
of that,'' he said. ``But we stand by our award to Mr. Kazan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People who support the award have formed a group called the Ad  
Hoc Committee for Naming Facts, calling on Academy members to wear 
American flag lapel pins to the ceremony. Both sides have promised 
to demonstrate outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacklisted actor John Randolph, who has appeared in ``Serpico''  
and ``You've Got Mail,'' said Kazan gave credibility to the 
hearings by the House Un-American Activities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a question of forgiveness. It's a question of  
remembrance,'' Randolph said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan has declined to comment on the controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	Kazan, who had once been a member of the Communist Party,  
informed on eight friends from the Group Theater, the best known of 
whom were playwright Clifford Odets and actress Paula Strasberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the director never issued a blanket apology, but  
made it clear that he agonized over his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Even to his detractors, Kazan has long been considered one of  
the greatest stage and film directors. His debut film, ``A Tree 
Grows in Brooklyn'' in 1945, earned an Oscar for supporting actor 
James Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Kazan won a directing Oscar for ``Gentleman's  
Agreement,'' which also was named best picture. His second Oscar 
was for ``On the Waterfront,'' the 1954 film that made Marlon 
Brando a star. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan also was nominated for ``A Streetcar Named Desire''  
(1951), ``East of Eden'' (1955) and ``America'' (1963).

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Defense Gets Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Attempting to put Kenneth Starr's  
tactics on trial, lawyers for Susan McDougal want to call the 
Whitewater prosecutor's top deputy to the witness stand. But a 
judge ruled today the defense must first spell out in more detail 
what questions will be asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting on a request from Starr's office, U.S. District Judge  
George Howard ordered Mrs. McDougal's lawyers to provide a better 
summary of their questions for Deputy Independent Counsel Hickman 
Ewing and told the two sides to try to reach an agreement on 
Ewing's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers filed earlier by Starr's office suggested the  
defense lawyers' summary might be used to fight an appearance by 
Ewing or to try to block some questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is charged with criminal contempt and obstruction  
of justice for failing to answer questions before Starr's grand 
jury. Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, has portrayed her as a mistreated 
pawn in prosecutors' overzealous pursuit of President and Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office argued that federal regulations require that the  
defense must disclose ahead of time what information is being 
sought when a U.S. attorney is called as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already told them what we wanted to talk to Ewing about,''  
Geragos said outside of court. ``Now they want more detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to prosecutors, Geragos said he planned to ask Ewing  
about: any conversations he recalled regarding Mrs. McDougal's 
``cooperation'' with the Whitewater grand jury; the circumstances 
surrounding her grand jury appearance; and why prosecutors believe 
she acted with corrupt intent when she refused to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office complained that the letter was too vague and  
``contains only three sentences describing the areas of inquiry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legal wrangling came as Mrs. McDougal's lawyers prepared to  
call their first witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution rested its case after seven days, ending this  
morning with testimony from an Arkansas banker, Ron Proctor, who 
dealt with the original loan for the Whitewater land development. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing watched from the rear of the courtroom Wednesday as the  
prosecution closed its case by summoning three former members of 
the Whitewater grand jury before whom Mrs. McDougal had refused to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the day, Bill Henley, Mrs. McDougal's brother,  
reached through a crowd of reporters and handed Ewing a subpoena, 
saying, ``Hick, I've got something for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt really good,'' Bill Henley said a few moments later.  
``It's about time we got to ask them a few questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said later he didn't think prosecutors would try to block  
his appearance at the behest of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to hide,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he hinted at a possible legal dispute ahead over how far  
afield Mrs. McDougal's lawyers should be allowed to range in 
questioning the Whitewater prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos would not rule out summoning Starr as well. ``First let  
me deal with Hick Ewing,'' he said. ``One at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making a prosecutor a defense witness was the second unusual  
turn of the day. The first was putting on the witness stand three 
members of the grand jury that indicted Mrs. McDougal after she 
refused to answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said that in 25 years as a federal prosecutor he had never  
seen grand jurors testify at a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jury foreman John Washam testified that the death of Mrs.  
McDougal's former husband, James McDougal, in 1998 made her 
testimony even more crucial than it had been before. 
</P>
<P>
	With James McDougal's death, ``one link of the chain was gone''  
of people who knew what went on in Whitewater, said Washam. 
McDougal had been Starr's chief cooperating witness in his 
investigation of the Whitewater land deal in which the Clintons and 
McDougals were partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos focused on the fact that Starr's office didn't tell  
grand jurors James McDougal had changed his story a number of 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't you have wanted to hear that?'' Geragos asked grand  
juror Marsha High. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' she responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Geragos argues that his client didn't want to answer questions  
because overzealous prosecutors were trying to force her to give 
false testimony against the president and first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> 3 New Alzheimer's Studies Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alzheimer's disease is one of the scariest  
threats of old age, particularly frightening because so far there's 
no way doctors can protect people at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be about to change.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have just discovered that a memory problem called  
``mild cognitive impairment'' can be an early warning sign of 
Alzheimer's -- and they're beginning three huge studies to see if 
certain drugs could prevent those patients from ever getting 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting,'' said Neil Buckholtz, chief of the  
dementia branch at the National Institute of Aging. But ``I don't 
think people are really aware of this concept'' of mild cognitive 
impairment. 
</P>
<P>
	So the NIA is trying to get the word to people over age 55 that  
if they're getting abnormally forgetful, they should see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	We all have occasional lapses where we forget where we parked  
the car or can't recall someone's name. That's normal, particularly 
as people age or experience stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Depression also can cause memory lapses, and forgetfulness is a  
side effect of some drugs. Doctors can offer immediate help for 
those problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But mild cognitive impairment is a more persistent memory  
problem. A golf lover makes a tee time on Tuesday but by Thursday, 
he leaves his golfing buddies waiting in vain on the links. 
</P>
<P>
	A pattern of such forgetfulness can mean mild cognitive  
impairment -- as long as doctors rule out other dementia symptoms. 
The mildly cognitive impaired don't have such symptoms as 
difficulty completing normal daily activities, problems with 
reasoning or inability to communicate, Dr. Ronald Petersen of the 
Mayo Clinic reports this month in Archives of Neurology. 
</P>
<P>
	A final test is simple: Read a paragraph's worth of information  
and wait 30 minutes. Someone with healthy short-term memory usually 
can spout back the information, but the mildly cognitive impaired 
have trouble, Buckholtz explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Mild cognitive impairment doesn't mean you're definitely  
destined for Alzheimer's. But studies show that every year, 12 
percent to 15 percent of those patients will progress to 
Alzheimer's -- in other words, up to 45 percent will have 
Alzheimer's within three years. In contrast, only 1 percent of 
healthy people over age 65 get Alzheimer's each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of Alzheimer's is not known. But 4 million Americans  
have it, a number expected to jump as the baby boomers age. So 
neurologists want a way to at least delay Alzheimer's onset. 
</P>
<P>
	Three new studies are hunting such a therapy in patients  
diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment: 
</P>
<P>
	--A National Institute on Aging-sponsored study will give 720  
patients ages 55-90 either high-dose vitamin E, the current 
Alzheimer's medication Aricept or a dummy pill. Results are 
expected by 2003. For information, call 1-888-455-0655 or check the 
Internet at www.memorystudy.org. Study sites are in 28 states and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Why those choices?  
</P>
<P>
	NIA-funded scientists discovered in 1997 that high-dose vitamin  
E can slow by about six months the progression of moderately severe 
Alzheimer's. Vitamin E is an antioxidant thought to limit damage 
from ``free radicals,'' molecular damage that has been found in 
Alzheimer's patients' brains. 
</P>
<P>
	Aricept inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine, a brain  
chemical vital for nerve cells to communicate with each other. 
Also, test-tube studies suggest acetylcholine could decrease the 
buildup of Alzheimer's-related brain plaques. 
</P>
<P>
	--Novartis Pharmaceuticals is enrolling 900 patients ages 55-85  
in a three-year study comparing its experimental drug Exelon to a 
placebo. Exelon, which also inhibits the breakdown of 
acetylcholine, is awaiting government permission to sell in the 
United States as an Alzheimer's treatment. The new prevention study 
will be conducted at 50 sites worldwide. For information, call 
1-877-554-HOPE. 
</P>
<P>
	--Merck &AMP; Co. is enrolling more than 1,000 Americans over age 64  
in a study comparing its experimental drug Vioxx to placebo. Vioxx 
is a novel painkiller awaiting government sales approval. But it 
works by inhibiting inflammation, considered another possible cause 
of Alzheimer's disease, so Merck now is studying its brain effects. 
For information, call 1-800-65-STUDY.

<HEADLINE> Balloonists Cross Dominican Rep. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Fatigued and chilled but  
exhilarated by their success, two adventurers soared over the 
Dominican Republic on the back of strengthening winds in a final 
push to become the first balloonists to circle the globe nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of  
Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, 
traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on 
March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could only find a fast jet stream and whiz across the  
Atlantic, that would be great,'' Brian Smith, a flight controller, 
said from a control tower in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospects for a quick Atlantic crossing -- the team hopes to make  
it across and complete the round-the-world odyssey by Saturday or 
early Sunday -- picked up after the Breitling Orbiter balloon found 
strong winds at 34,500 feet. It was traveling at 83 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had a low day yesterday when they slowed down and things  
didn't look very good. Today it's very positive, they've got better 
winds than (had been) forecast,'' said Jones' wife, Joanna, working 
a 14-hour day at the control center. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the team was over the Domincan Republic and preparing  
for the Atlantic crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think their spirits will soar when they start a crossing  
because it's the last leg,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite thermal underwear, the pilots were shivering in the  
balloon's cabin, where the temperature was 46 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The team raced across the Pacific in six days and scooted over  
Mexico on Wednesday, with winds pushing them to speeds of 115 mph. 
But they slowed after being ejected from the jet stream and started 
to drift. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tiring day, one of the most difficult,'' Smith  
said Wednesday. He added that the balloonists ``have been 
fantastic, fatigued but in very good spirits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns about communications and fuel consumption,  
Smith said the pilots were confident they would make it to North 
Africa and complete the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anheuser-Busch brewery company of St. Louis is offering  
$500,000 to the first balloonists to make it around the world, and 
an equal amount to the charity of the winners' choice. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first attempt at circumnavigating the world, the two  
have beat the record set last year by American millionaire Steve 
Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of 
Sweden. The three ditched their balloon off Hawaii in December 
after flying 13,751 miles, more than halfway around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, the chances of Jones and Piccard flying all the way  
to Egypt's pyramids, as Jones had hoped to do, appeared ``quite 
improbable,'' Smith said. The pilots now hope to land further west, 
in Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two make it, the pair will have conquered one of the last  
great tests facing balloonists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 choice right now would be outside the best hotel in  
Casablanca, with a large'' parking lot, Smith said.

<HEADLINE> FTC Calls `Vitamin O' Ads Deceptive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is asking a  
judge to bar two Washington companies from making unsubstantiated 
claims for a dietary supplement advertised as a wonder drug that 
can cure diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC alleges the ``Vitamin O'' supplement is nothing more  
than bottled salt water sold for $10 an ounce. A federal court 
hearing is set for April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency wants to force Kettle Falls-based Rose Creek Health  
Products Inc. and The Staff of Life Inc. to refund customers' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	An ad that ran in USA Today claims Vitamin O ``has helped  
eliminate everything from breathing problems and lack of energy to 
life-threatening diseases'' such as cancer and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A Food and Drug Administration lab analyzed the liquid and found  
it to be nothing more than salt water, said Eleanor Durham, an FTC 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today routinely screens ads for diet supplements to ensure  
that advertisers offer a money-back guarantee and include a phone 
number or address for consumers' questions, a spokesman for the 
Arlington-Va.-based newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Anderson said the five Vitamin O ads USA Today ran from  
November through February met those standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have to take a long and hard look'' before approving  
any future Vitamin O ads, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Smyth, owner of both Rose Creek and The Staff of Life,  
did not return a call Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has several pending complaints against producers of  
dietary supplements that purport to cure various ailments. Such 
products are frequently advertised in alternative medicine 
publications and can be sold without approval from the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vitamin O case is unusual because the product has recently  
been promoted in newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Report: Louis Farrakhan Is Ailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is  
reported to be gravely ill, but the Muslim group's leaders would 
not release any information about his condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, who was treated for prostate cancer several years  
ago, has been ill since early January with an undiagnosed 
condition, according to an article in The Final Call, the Nation of 
Islam's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan said the current illness ``took me down so fast, that  
it concerned me greatly because, though I'm nearing 66, I have 
never been sick like this in my life,'' the newspaper reported in a 
March 10 update on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Feb. 28 speech in Chicago, Farrakhan said he lost 20  
pounds and most of his muscle mass in less than two weeks and had 
``no appetite, night sweats, dealing with the after effects of 
radiation therapy (for prostate cancer) and other things,'' 
according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking comment Thursday from the newspaper's editors, a  
Nation of Islam spokesman and Farrakhan were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Call scheduled a press conference Friday to ``respond  
to rumors about the Honorable Louis Farrakhan's health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has sometimes rankled U.S. officials with his  
outspoken support of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, whom he has 
visited several times, and his negative comments about Jews, 
Christians, white people and the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan reportedly was treated for prostate cancer by  
Gadhafi's doctors after announcing he had the illness in 1991. He 
most recently met with Gadhafi in November -- his fifth visit to 
Libya in three years.

<HEADLINE> Mortgages Fall But Still Over 7 Pct / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages fell this week for the first time since late 
January but remained above 7 percent for the third consecutive 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average declined to 7.01 percent, down from a 10-month high  
of 7.11 percent last week but still a quarter percentage point 
higher than the 6.74 percent average seven weeks earlier, Freddie 
Mac, the mortgage company, said Thursday. The average had remained 
below 7 percent from mid-June of last year through February. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.64 percent this week, down from 6.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.75 percent, down from 5.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged just under 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Senate Hears Airstrikes Briefing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's top military commanders warned  
today that there could be U.S. casualties if NATO launches 
airstrikes against Serb positions in an effort to pressure Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's air defenses are sophisticated and heavily  
defended, Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a distinct possibility we will lose aircraft in  
trying to penetrate those defenses,'' Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be tremendously dangerous,'' Marine Corps  
Commandant Gen. Charles Krulak agreed. Serbian air defense systems 
``are mobile. The terrain is very tough. And the weather cannot be 
underestimated,'' Krulak said. He said there were some 
``bottom-line question'' that still need to be answered: ``What is 
the end game? How long will the strike go on? Will our allies stay 
with us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony came as the Senate prepared to debate the Kosovo  
issue later in the day, including a move by some members to block 
funds for sending U.S. troops to Kosovo to help enforce a peace 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Dennis Reimer, the Army chief of staff, told the committee  
that the ``current criteria for commitment'' on the ground remains 
a still-elusive peacekeeping agreement. President Clinton has said 
he's prepared to send up to 4,000 U.S. troops to Kosovo as part of 
a 28,000-member NATO peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troops that would be earmarked for that are prepared to do  
that,'' Reimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., said he was troubled by  
the massing of Serbian forces on the border with Kosovo. ``That 
calculus seems to me to me that they are ready for extensive ground 
operations,'' Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you are correct, Mr. Chairman,'' Reimer said. ``We are  
watching that very closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony by the military commanders came as peace  
negotiations in Paris seemed on the verge of collapse. Stymied by 
the Serbs, the Clinton administration was seeking to establish 
friendly ties with the Kosovar Albanians, who are trying to wriggle 
free of Yugoslavia's control. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright invited Hashim Thaci and  
other members of the ethnic Albanian delegation here for talks on 
their political goals, and they accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to develop a good relationship with them as they  
transform themselves into a politically oriented organization under 
a Kosovo living in peace,'' said James Foley, the deputy State 
Department spokesman, after disclosing that spokesman James Rubin 
had flown unannounced to Paris to deliver Albright's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Rubin's taking on that unusual role, Foley said he  
had developed ``rapport'' with the ethnic Albanians in earlier 
rounds of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright has also employed Bob Dole, the defeated Republican  
presidential candidate, to deal with the insurgents who gave their 
formal approval to the plan this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-nation plan the Serbs are resisting would give the  
ethnic Albanians control over schools, police and other day-to-day 
activities, but not the independence many have sought and battled 
Serb troops for. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo Liberation Army, a guerrilla group, has spearheaded  
the secession movement in the Serbian province. Its members, under 
the peace plan, would be eligible to be part of the police force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to develop closer and better ties with that  
organization,'' Foley said, referring to the Kosovar Albanians' 
drive for political acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have sought discussions and assistance from us in this  
regard, with an eye toward their future role under a peace accord 
in Kosovo,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration persisted in its drive to persuade  
members of Congress it is a good idea to send U.S. troops to Kosovo 
as part of a NATO peacekeeping force if a settlement somehow is 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed  
Services Committee, said he and several other Republicans do not 
believe Americans should be sent into military action to solve 
Europe's civil wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Spence complained that the United States had spent about $10  
billion for troop deployments and military operations in Bosnia and 
will lay out $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year to continue the 
mission, which has no time limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and other administration officials have threatened the  
Serbs with a NATO attack if they blocked a settlement that had 
Albanian approval and if they broke a cease-fire established for 
Kosovo last October. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, told Congress that  
Serb forces were prepared to resume fighting in Kosovo on a ``very 
large scale'' if no accord was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright assessed the bleak situation in separate telephone  
calls to French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and Russian Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov.

<HEADLINE> Military Recruiting Is Hampered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military recruiting efforts are being hampered  
by parents and teachers who view the armed forces as a ``last 
option'' for students unable to get into college or find good jobs, 
recruiters told lawmakers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have parents out there that forget what made America  
America,'' Army Sgt. Monica Duncan-Boney of St. Louis told a House 
Armed Services subcommittee. ``We have a lot of walls to break 
down. We have to show the military is a No. 1 option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navy Petty Officer Dahlia Clow of San Antonio said teachers and  
principals believe they have failed if they don't get students into 
college and they don't consider the educational benefits of the 
military, which provides schooling, training and university grants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is with the attitude of educators,'' Clow said.  
``The military to them is the last option for their students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Sgt. Robert Austin, a recruiter from Oklahoma City,  
said high schools often provide college representatives with lists 
of seniors but decline to give the names and phone numbers to the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether to allow military recruiters on campus is  
left up to individual school districts and principals, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if they're federally funded, they shouldn't be  
able to tell us we can't come into the school,'' Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on the House Armed Services Committee's military  
personnel panel didn't indicate whether any of them would propose 
mandatory recruiter access to high schools that receive federal 
funds. Nearly all public high schools receive some form of federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hawaii Rep. Neil Abercrombie, the ranking Democrat on the  
subcommittee, said, ``I think that's a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1994 approved legislation denying military grants  
and contracts to colleges that barred recruiters. Two years later, 
lawmakers increased the penalty to ban federal student aid to 
universities that did not allow military officials on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Abercrombie also said he was pleased that Army Secretary Louis  
Caldera is looking at accepting more non-high school graduates as 
long as they have their GED equivalent certificates and pass 
entrance tests. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who chaired the subcommittee  
hearing, said he and many other Republicans are opposed to 
accepting more recruits without high school diplomas or lowering 
other standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that further reductions to recruit quality standards  
present a very costly and dangerous risk to military readiness that 
must be avoided,'' Graham said. ``Quality recruits are essential to 
maintaining the warrior ethos so essential to combat readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Defense Secretary William Cohen and other Pentagon  
officials haven't endorsed Caldera's GED acceptance proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	All the recruiters representing the services except the Army  
rejected a proposal by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman 
John Warner, R-Va., to shorten some military enlistments from 
several years to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner made the proposal in a letter to the military chiefs,  
saying the plan might attract recruits who don't want to serve four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army already has a two-year program. But Navy, Air Force and  
Marine officials argue it would be too difficult and costly to 
train people for high-tech military jobs without a four-year 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would lead to a higher turnover,'' Austin said, making  
recruiting an even tougher job as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at least 90 percent of Army recruits must have high school  
diplomas, a standard set by the Defense Department. The Navy, faced 
with more than 20,000 job vacancies, also has recently begun 
accepting more recruits who don't have a high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Corps and Air Force, which historically have had the  
least trouble recruiting, have been adding recruiters and boosting 
advertising so they won't face large shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera said he expects the Army to fall short of its goal of  
recruiting 74,000 soldiers this fiscal year. The Navy, which fell 
6,900 short this year, also is heading toward a shortfall, as is 
the Air Force. The Marine Corps is expected to be the only service 
to make its recruitment quota for fiscal year 1999, which ends 
Sept. 30.

<HEADLINE> 'Lock, Stock' Star Enjoys the Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Some people in England shy away from stardom. But  
not Nick Moran. 
</P>
<P>
	At 30, the once-unknown lead of ``Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking  
Barrels'' speaks happily of leaving anonymity behind, courtesy of a 
cheeky gangland comedy that has had Britain laughing -- and 
cowering. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, he says with a smile over coffee at a south London  
cafe, ``I go to auditions, and they make tea and they polish your 
shoes. Before, people would say, `Who is that upstart? Get out!' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could carry a film, but I didn't know I could  
actually, legitimately,'' he says. ``But with `Lock, Stock,' it's 
written in black and white: Can Carry A Film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran has every right to be likably immodest, given the  
phenomenon that ``Lock, Stock'' has become in Britain since its 
late-summer opening. 
</P>
<P>
	A loopy East End thriller that is funny and knuckle-busting in  
turn, the film struck a particular chord with Britain's youth 
culture, making stars of its little-known quartet of leads, as well 
as a local hero out of Londoner Guy Ritchie, its first-time 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's broader appeal will be tested March 19, when ``Lock,  
Stock'' opens wide in the United States, following an acclaimed 
premiere in January at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, and 
critical openings in New York and Los Angeles earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Moran's killer cheekbones may be more than simply  
British tabloid fodder. With three further movies awaiting release 
in 1999, Moran is ready for the big time -- and excited by it as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a No. 1 movie in my own country,'' says Moran, not so  
much warming to a theme as devouring it, well, lock, stock, and 
barrel. ``There are very, very few people who can say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran's performance as Eddie, the hapless if charming card shark  
whose misadventures set in motion a Byzantine underworld face-off, 
is the linchpin of a densely plotted scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie's sort of like my flash alter ego,'' Moran says. ``I  
always looked at it as if Eddie was a better-looking version of 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the actor acknowledges that the movie itself -- an ensemble  
piece -- was greater than any individual player, which may explain 
why he was chosen for the role and not Stephen Dorff and Ethan 
Hawke, who were originally mentioned. (The film's biggest names are 
Sting, who took a tiny role because wife Trudie Styler is a 
co-producer, and, in his acting debut, Vinnie Jones, one of the 
``bad boys'' of English soccer.) 
</P>
<P>
	``What's great is that `Lock, Stock' is so full of people  
discovering their own abilities,'' Moran says. ``I don't think Guy 
knew he was an absolutely brilliant director until he made an 
absolutely brilliant film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest of three boys, Moran grew up in what he calls a  
``really heinous'' council estate -- Britain's equivalent of 
low-income housing -- in the north London suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	And while many British actors have parents in the profession,  
Moran says his background was more likely to land him a job at the 
local supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, ``someone had told me about these mythical places  
called drama schools which I never knew existed. I lied about my 
age, got in, and was just 20 when I left. I did the course and 
inadvertently learned how to act properly,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a decade before ``Lock, Stock'' came, accompanied by  
serious recognition. Before that, Moran spent a year on the West 
End in the musical ``Blood Brothers'' and did a little-seen film, 
``Hard Days, Hard Nights,'' about a Liverpool band that was not the 
Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
	Since ``Lock, Stock'' came out in Britain, Moran has won acclaim  
for a London play, Nick Grosso's ``Real Classy Affair,'' which 
co-starred Joseph Fiennes of ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And among his upcoming movies, he speaks highly of ``New  
Blood,'' in which he plays John Hurt's son, and a cameo role, again 
with Fiennes, in ``Rancid Aluminum,'' playing a dress-wearing 
schoolboy who deals cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood remains an untapped market that Moran is eager to  
test, but he says he's unlikely to choose a project simply because 
of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do good stuff, not cheesy stuff,'' he says. ``I  
don't have to be in a $50 million or $100 million movie. Something 
like `Lock, Stock' will do me, you know what I mean?''

<HEADLINE> Dow Touches 10,000; Ends at 9,997.62 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average cracked 10,000  
six times today but pulled back each time, finishing a nail-biting 
session less than three points below the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip index ended at 9,997.62, up 118.21 points on the  
day. It was the second day that the Dow crossed 10,000 but failed 
to hold its gains -- on Tuesday, the index briefly traded as high as 
10,001.78 but slipped back and closed with a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad market indexes made substantial gains as well today,  
indicating a broader and perhaps more durable advance in the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 18.73 to 1,316.55 , and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 33.99 to 2462.96. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
NYSE, with 1,559 up, 1,390 down and 613 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 827.39 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
749.79 million the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 6.96 to 617.61, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index declined 0.97 to 714.86. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.12 to 399.55.  
</P>
<P>
	But while the broader indexes showed Wall Street had some brawn,  
advancing issues still barely edged out decliners on the New York 
Stock Exchange, and volume was moderately heavy. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate spark for today's advance was a Labor Department  
report this morning that consumer prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent 
last month. That was a confirmation that inflation remains in check 
and a signal that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise 
short-term interest rates anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer price report boosted prices in the bond market,  
where the 30-year Treasury bond was up 3/8 point and its yield, which 
moves opposite from its price, fell to 5.47 percent from 5.5 
percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also attributed the advance to Friday's triple  
expiration of futures and options contracts, which added a layer of 
excitement and volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	But the momentum for Dow 10,000 has been building for a long  
time with an extraordinary alignment of positive events, including 
low interest rates, a very strong U.S. economy that is prompting 
consumers to buy everything from stocks to socks, and the recent 
perception that the world's economic trouble spots are recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the real prime mover is the obliteration of  
inflation expectations and successful completion of a conflict, the 
Cold War, and with that finished, changing dynamics in the world 
economy,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, chairman of investment policy 
at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``These fundamental drivers are critical to 
attracting ... money'' into the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seemed bent on driving the blue-chip index above the  
benchmark figure. They were unfazed by a separate report from the 
Commerce Department that the nation's trade deficit shot up 21 
percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	They were also undisturbed by the continuing rise in oil prices,  
which longer-term could prove inflationary. ``Oil is turning the 
corner,'' said Gregory Nie, a technical analyst at Everen 
Securities in Chicago, ``but there will be a proving period over 
the short term where you get a correction in crude that will take a 
little starch out of this move up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, higher oil prices today fed the advance of oil stocks.  
</P>
<P>
	Dow components were also led higher by financial services  
stocks, which reacted positively to the drop in interest rates and 
a report that Chase Manhattan Corp. is looking for a merger 
partner.

<HEADLINE> Debate Opens Over HMO Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Differences over how far Congress should go to  
protect patient rights are on full display as debate begins in 
earnest over regulating HMOs and other managed health care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Outnumbered Democrats are sure to lose on every major point as  
legislation works its way through the Senate Health, Education, 
Labor and Pension Committee, which began debate Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the GOP bill, expected to win early  
committee approval, ``falls far short'' of what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today represents the first test of whether this new Congress  
is serious about providing Americans with a strong enforceable 
patients' bill of rights to assure quality health care,'' Clinton 
said in a statement. ``I urge the committee to do everything it can 
to pass this test and give Americans the health care protections 
they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was already looking past the  
committee vote, promising reporters: ``We'll win on the floor of 
the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill would offer a mix of popular protections, including  
the right to reasonable emergency room payments, direct access to 
gynecologists for women and prohibition of much-maligned, but 
virtually nonexistent ``gag rules'' that prevent doctors from 
discussing all options with their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But those protections would be given only to 48 million  
Americans covered by federally regulated health insurance plans. 
Republicans noted that other patients are covered by state 
regulations, and numerous states have adopted many of the same 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the GOP bill would cover all Americans in  
employer-sponsored health plans -- about 75 million -- with a key 
provision that would give patients the right to take disputes over 
payments to an independent group of experts outside the health 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say all Americans should be covered by all of the  
bill's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats also want to give people new rights to sue their  
health plans over bad decisions and to require plans to pay for 
what doctors determine to be ``medically necessary'' care. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., argued that more  
lawsuits are not needed and emphasized that the GOP bill would add 
hardly anything to health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal,'' Jeffords said, ``is to give Americans the  
protections they want and need in a package they can afford and 
that we can enact.''

<HEADLINE> CDC Cites Appalachian Tooth Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Chomping through crisp apples and gnawing on  
tough steaks is a hard chew for many seniors in Appalachia, where 
more than a third of those 65 and older have lost all their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia leads the nation in toothlessness -- 47.9 percent  
of people over 65 have lost all their teeth. Kentucky, Tennessee 
and Georgia aren't far behind, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tooth loss was most prevalent in states where there tend to be  
lower per capita income levels and low levels of dental insurance 
coverage,'' said Dr. Scott Tomar, a dentist and epidemiologist in 
the CDC's Division of Oral Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the lowest rates were out West. Less than 20 percent of  
elderly Americans in Arizona, California, Hawaii, Oregon and 
Wisconsin reported having lost all their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the disparity is probably due to factors such  
as isolation and poverty. Tooth loss was greatest among blacks, the 
uninsured, people with less than a high school education and 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental insurance in the United States is almost entirely  
employment-based, and many procedures aren't covered by Medicare. 
The federal health care program for the elderly does not cover 
routine dental exams. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody has a tooth that's decaying, restoring it with a  
root canal and a crown is a preferable treatment, but it's much 
more expensive than having a tooth extracted,'' Tomar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on telephone surveys done in 1995-97 with  
27,736 people 65 and over in 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The prevalence of total tooth loss has dropped steadily since  
the 1950s because most of the nation's water is now fluoridated. 
Before then, more than 50 percent of Americans over 65 lost all 
their teeth, Tomar said.

<HEADLINE> Aides: Moral Majority Was Misguided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two leading figures in the Rev. Jerry Falwell's  
Moral Majority during the 1980s now say that the organization was a 
misguided idea and that politics are not the way to boost spiritual 
values in America. 
</P>
<P>
	In a book out next week, they endorse religious right views but  
contend American society should be improved mainly by changing 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of ``Blinded By Might'' are syndicated columnist Cal  
Thomas, who was the Moral Majority's much-quoted spokesman, and the 
Rev. Ed Dobson, a former Falwell aide who is now a pastor in Grand 
Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The book appears weeks after one of the Moral Majority's three  
founders, Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation, sent 
colleagues a letter suggesting that social conservatives should 
admit defeat and drop out of the political fray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I no longer believe that there is a moral majority,'' Weyrich  
said. If there were, ``Bill Clinton would have been driven out of 
office months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and Dobson agree that religious conservatives do not  
command a majority of the population. They think last November's 
elections ``demonstrated the problematic, even declining, power of 
the religious right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they go further, arguing that churches and individual  
believers should influence society through persuasion and spiritual 
conversion. Politics, they say, is usually a temptation that 
diverts Christians from a higher calling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Religious conservatives, no matter how well organized, can't  
save America. Only God can,'' they write. 
</P>
<P>
	At Calvary Church in Grand Rapids, where he has been pastor  
since 1987, Dobson says he focuses on Bible teaching and forbids 
petitions, voter registration drives, voter guides and promotion of 
political causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Falwell, who has disbanded Moral Majority, said in a statement:  
``While I feel people of faith in this century desperately need to 
be involved in moral and social issues that affect our future as a 
nation, I gladly grant to my friends Cal and Ed the right to 
disagree and to advocate the withdrawal of American churches and 
people of faith from the cultural conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The authors also object to the concept of Pat Robertson's  
Christian Coalition, a successor to Moral Majority. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in the book, Robertson said that if religious  
voters would rally to elect a conservative Congress and ``an 
evangelical, born-again president'' who would make like-minded 
appointments to the Cabinet and Supreme Court, ``we could roll back 
many of the bad things that have been done in government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another target of the book is James Dobson -- no relation to Ed --  
of the Focus on the Family media ministry, an increasingly 
outspoken Christian activist in the right wing of the Republican 
Party. Thomas says James Dobson has done more than anyone else to 
strengthen American families and fears politics will ``derail and 
dilute the good he is doing.''

<HEADLINE> Oscar Moves to Sunday Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Never on Sunday for Oscar, the film industry  
said for 46 years. Too risky to air the Academy Awards on the 
weekend, when people should be buying movie tickets instead of 
enjoying a free TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chance to shore up TV ratings -- and a growing  
appreciation of the Academy Awards as an unparalleled promotional 
tool for Hollywood -- finally caused a reappraisal. 
</P>
<P>
	When host Whoopi Goldberg steps on stage at 8:30 p.m. EST  
Sunday, ABC and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences 
hope that the weekend broadcast will be the start of a new 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great move,'' said Gil Cates, who is producing his  
ninth Oscar ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday is a festive day, a day of relaxation. It's a non-work  
day, and I think that comports well with what Oscar should be,'' he 
said. ``The whole phenomenon of folks rushing home from work to 
watch the show is going to be avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Oscar ratings rise and fall, the ceremony is  
television's second most-watched event after the Super Bowl. 
Commercial rates reportedly have reached $1 million for a 30-second 
spot, up from around $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the show is lacking a hit centerpiece like last year's  
``Titanic.'' Some of the nominees are in films largely unseen by 
moviegoers, such as best actor contenders Nick Nolte in 
``Affliction'' or Edward Norton in ``American History X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a blockbuster date, Oscar can be relatively unpopular.  
The 1997 ceremony, at which the highbrow film ``The English 
Patient'' dominated, had the second-worst ratings on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no one is expecting the ceremony to match the 1998  
numbers, the best in 15 years, ABC is counting on the move from the 
show's longtime Monday berth and a half-hour earlier starting time 
to avoid a big deflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday has the highest 'HUT' level of the week, more  
'households using television' than any other night,'' noted Michael 
Davies, ABC executive vice president in charge of specials. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier start ensures the ceremony will end at a reasonable  
hour, a ratings plus. Viewership tends to plummet when the Oscars 
stretch into the midnight hour on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The star quotient, of course, remains unchanged. Harrison Ford,  
Jack Nicholson, Denzel Washington, Kim Basinger, John Travolta, 
Annette Bening, Andy Garcia and Helen Hunt are among the 
presenters. 
</P>
<P>
	The performers are Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Whitney Houston,  
Mariah Carey, Randy Newman, Peter Gabriel, Allison Moorer and 
Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar winner Geena Davis (``The Accidental Tourist,'' 1988) will  
be host of an academy first: an exclusive pre-ceremony show 
beginning at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to attempt to give the audience a backstage pass  
and look at everything that goes into making the Oscar ceremony,'' 
said Davis. That includes clips of events leading up to the 
ceremony, such as the nominees' luncheon, and, of course, the 
fashion parade of arriving stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said she immediately said yes to the job. ``I've always  
been a fan not only of the Oscars but of the excitement, and 
arrivals have always been a big part,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony itself will celebrate the waning century, Cates  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inasmuch as film is a child of the 20th century and made its  
impact in the century, we're going to reflect on that,'' he said, 
including a look at what film's role might be in the next 100 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	One era will loom especially large because of an honorary award  
being given to director Elia Kazan, whose critically acclaimed 
films include ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Gentleman's Agreement.'' 
Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese are presenting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, Kazan drew fire by giving the names of colleagues  
to the House Un-American Activities Committee investigating 
communist infiltration in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the passage of time, the award has divided the industry.  
``Age and ability in the arts or anything else, in my opinion, does 
not excuse a crime,'' said actor Rod Steiger, star of ``On the 
Waterfront.'' Actor Karl Malden was the member of the Academy's 
board who proposed the lifetime achievement award for Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, veteran Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd, citing  
the controversy, wrote in the trade paper's March 10 issue: ``I'm 
just one who will still remain seated during that honorary Oscar 
presentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Cates: ``I think Army Archerd is dead wrong in his attitude  
toward Kazan. I think the academy is absolutely correct in honoring 
Kazan. He's a great director. ... I think the majority of the 
audience is delighted with that honorary Oscar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging there are those who will refuse to applaud Kazan,  
Cates said: ``We'll show all.'' There will be no ``sweetening'' if 
the applause is scant or attempt to mask any boos, he said.

<HEADLINE> 2006 Olympic Bidding Different Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The cursor dragged across the  
computer screen, offering a 3-D vision of the jagged peaks off the 
lake in Klagenfurt, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	That is as close as the IOC members will get to six bidding  
cities ahead of their June decision on the host of the 2006 Olympic 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the members can no longer come to us, we have to do it this  
way,'' said Dr. Dieter Kalt, the general manager of the Klagenfurt 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking with years of wining and dining, lavish gift-giving and  
other pampering by bid cities, the IOC members decided Thursday to 
outlaw visits to reduce any risk of corruption, which is at the 
heart of the worst scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Visits are unnecessary and public perception of them is just  
too bad,'' said executive board member Jacques Rogge, who prides 
himself in keeping away from candidate cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidding war between the cities has been suspended since  
December when the Salt Lake bribery scandal broke. It will now be 
resumed under new, stricter rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were waiting like lions in a cage. Tomorrow we will be let  
out again,'' said Lance Kelly, international relations coordinator 
for Switzerland's Sion bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bid cities criticized the new limits as unfairly  
favoring Sion, which already was visited by most IOC members during 
previous bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had told us one year ago, we would have though twice  
about bidding,'' said Marco San Pietro of Italy's Turin bid, 
echoing complaints from the other five bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The other cities bidding are Helsinki, Finland; Zakopane,  
Poland; and Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of showing IOC members around, the cities are belatedly  
changing strategies, pumping more funds into an avalanche of 
paperwork, videos and CD-roms. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that is running into IOC restrictions forcing bid cities to  
submit their material to IOC headquarters before it can be sent on 
to the members. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Soviet-style censorship. It is ridiculous,'' said  
Evelina Christillin, head of the Turin bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Members will be snowed under paperwork ahead of the June 19  
selection in Seoul, South Korea. There, a 15-member panel will trim 
the six hopefuls for 2006 down to a final pair, which will be 
immediately sent to the general assembly for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidders will have an hour-long presentation for the members  
there, a do or die session where more money will now be poured 
into. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the budgets of bidding cities hover around $10-12  
million and some said around $700,000 was earmarked for the IOC 
visitors. Critics of Thursday's decision said that if the IOC was 
so intent of protecting their members from potential corruption, it 
should pay for the visits itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should arrange travel and pay everything and after the  
visit we get to pay them,'' said Kalt, eager to show that 
Klagenfurt's three nation bid of Austria, Italy and Slovenia is 
really quite compact. 
</P>
<P>
	Saarikangas agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of showing your product. Not a question of  
bribing,'' he said, comparing it to the difference between testing 
a car and browsing through a glossy leaflet. 
</P>
<P>
	The cities were allowed to come to the IOC meeting to compensate  
for the loss of exposure to IOC members. But IOC members were

<HEADLINE> Two Workers Die When Boxcar Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMTRAMCK, Mich. (AP) -- Two railroad workers were killed  
Thursday when a loaded boxcar fell on top of them as they tried to 
make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Grand Trunk Railroad workers were trying to fix the  
car's undercarriage while the train was held up by wooden jacks 
that gave way, police spokesman Walter Tripp said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men was pinned between the tracks and the boxcar,  
Tripp said. Police were able to extricate him, but the other worker 
was trapped face-down underneath the fallen boxcar.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The head of the Episcopal Church has rebuffed a  
protest from other national branches in the Anglican Communion over 
the Americans' liberal policy on homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August the world's Anglican bishops voted 526-70 for a  
declaration that homosexual acts are ``incompatible with 
Scripture.'' But the Episcopal Church, the U.S. branch of 
Anglicanism, has allowed each bishop to decide, and several endorse 
gay and lesbian clergy and same-sex couples. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter dated Feb. 26, the leaders of Anglican branches in  
Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Australia, the Middle East, South America 
and Southeast Asia wrote Presiding Bishop Frank T. Griswold, asking 
all U.S. bishops to comply with the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	Griswold replied that divergent opinions exist in the United  
States and other Anglican branches. ``We therefore find ourselves 
in a process of discernment and 'testing the spirits','' he said. 
He invited the complainants to visit and talk personally with 
homosexuals and bishops who support them. 
</P>

 *Episcopal priest evicted    	
</P>
<P>
	BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) -- An Episcopal priest has been evicted from  
church grounds in a dispute over gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The court order came after a long-running feud between members  
of a conservative congregation, St. Paul's Church, and a liberal 
diocese led by Bishop Thomas Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have lost access to our church building, but we have  
not lost faith,'' the Rev. Thomas Morris said. ``In the end, Jesus 
wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' followers claim they have been at odds with church  
officials since earlier in the decade, when the diocese elected to 
sanction same-sex marriages and ordain homosexuals as priests. St. 
Paul's then began withholding fees it was bound to pay the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	A Superior Court judge granted a preliminary injunction against  
Morris, forcing him to vacate the building. But Judge Charles J. 
Hely wrote in his decision the issue was not religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants have no legal authority whatsoever to ownership  
or control of the real and personal property of St. Paul's 
Episcopal Church,'' he wrote, adding, ``The undisputed facts of 
this motion do not require the court to attempt to resolve any 
religious doctrine controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Edward W. Rodman, a diocese spokesman, said the diocese  
embraces homosexuality because it is ``inappropriate to single out 
any group of people or sin as being worse than any other.'' 
</P>
<P>

 *Episcopal bishop resigns    	
</P>
<P>
	SOMERSET, N.J. (AP) -- The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New  
Jersey is taking a leave of absence before the end of June and will 
resign in September 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked on the one hand at the battered and beleaguered  
diocese, and on the other hand I looked at the progress that has 
been made. ... In doing so, I came to the conclusion that I am in 
the way,'' Bishop Joe Morris Doss said in announcing his 
resignation at an annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics in the diocese that covers central and southern New  
Jersey disapprove of Doss' leadership style, and some mistrust him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Clayton Matthews, an official with the national church,  
said the resignation was highly unusual. He said an interim bishop 
will be appointed to head the diocese until September 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Doss said his role has been as a lightning rod  
and his tenure incited controversy because he brought deep-rooted 
problems to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters have said his liberal stance on social issues  
including homosexuality are too much for conservatives in the 
diocese. The Rev. Alan French, president of the Diocesan Standing 
Committee and a Doss critic, said the problems stem from Doss' 
leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had nothing to do with ideology,'' French said. ``I think  
that's totally unfounded.''

 *Lutheran bishop vows rural aid    	
</P>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The Evangelical Lutheran Church wants to do  
something to ease the farm crisis in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop H. George Anderson, who leads more than 5 million  
Lutherans nationwide, said his church will try to listen and 
administer to the needs of farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson spoke at ``Sowing Seeds of Hope,'' a church conference  
of Great Plains pastors and lay leaders called to discuss the rural 
crisis. The Evangelical Lutheran Church is trying to understand how 
it can be most effective in helping people survive the crisis, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nebraska, the church has set aside $500,000 for a national  
``rural concerns desk'' that, among other things, could lobby for 
changes in laws that affect the agricultural community. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretchen Ritola, an assistant to Nebraska Bishop Richard Jessen,  
said some congregants feel that if the church truly stands for 
justice, it must fight for economic justice for family farmers and 
ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	At its highest level, she said, the church would deal with  
everything from overseas trade issues to corporate farming. 
Locally, pastors need to understand the marketplace and signs that 
lead to losing the farm.

 *'A Taste of Passover' on PBS    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- ``A Taste of Passover'' on PBS is a musical  
offering that producer Gerald Slavet hopes will nourish not just 
the souls of Jews but those of other religions. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert was filmed before an audience at the New England  
Conservatory of Music in January and will be presented March 21 as 
a public television special, 10 days before Passover. 
</P>
<P>
	It features a gospel choir singing traditional Jewish songs, a  
klezmer band, and a demonstration of how to make the perfect matzo 
ball. Broadway actor Theodore Bikel is host. The show also features 
humorist Moshe Waldoks and Yiddish language expert Harriet Chasia 
Segal. 
</P>
<P>
	Slavet said he chose the conservatory's gospel choir to perform  
because he feels gospel music expresses the spirituality of the 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Hasidic music, it comes from deep in the soul and  
gospel music comes from deep in the soul,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Passover is an eight-day holiday celebrating the Jewish exodus  
from Egypt and escape from slavery.

<HEADLINE> Precious Documents Get Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Viewed by more than a million visitors a year,  
the charters on which Americans base their independence, run their 
government and protect their rights are in line for new display 
cases to secure them for the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Already more than two centuries old, the Declaration of  
Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights have survived 
invading armies, thoughtless and prolonged exposure to direct 
sunlight and attempts at reproduction that may have sapped the ink 
directly from the parchment on which they are written. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the National Archives showed off the manufacturing  
model of a titanium, aluminum and tempered-glass case intended as 
part of a display system that will encase all pages of the founding 
documents by the end of 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Work on the casing system is to run in tandem with the  
restoration of the Archives building on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Every viewer can see that the Declaration, especially, is badly  
aged and faded. But its value to the nation has remained unaltered. 
</P>
<P>
	John Carlin, the archivist of the United States, told an  
audience of officials and preservation experts in the Archives 
rotunda that the importance of the three documents cannot be 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are touchstones of truth,'' he said. ``They verify the  
original words and the original signatures, attesting to the 
validity of the foundations of our governance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are, he said, ``the physical reality of the instruments  
through which we asserted our nationhood, created our government 
and defined our rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archivists have long been concerned that the current arrangement  
is inadequate for the long-term preservation of fragile documents 
already damaged by rough handling and exposure to excessive levels 
of light during their early years. 
</P>
<P>
	The glass that has pressed against the historic parchment since  
1952 is beginning to deteriorate even though the fragile documents 
themselves are reported to be in no immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Archivists also have been frustrated in that the present system  
totally seals the documents from outside intervention, preventing 
physical examination or contact checks for possible deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
	The display system now in use allows only the first and last  
pages of the Constitution to be shown. The new arrangement will 
display all four of that document's pages as well as the single 
pages of the Declaration and Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The three documents have been on display since 1952 in a bronze  
and marble-columned shrine inside the Archives rotunda. Each 
evening the documents are lowered into a vault of steel and 
reinforced concrete. The process is reversed each morning when the 
encased documents are returned to their marble display units. 
</P>
<P>
	The extreme care with which the United States has shielded the  
three documents in recent years contrasts with the often casual 
preservation efforts of the past in which they were carted from one 
temporary home to another, rolled and unrolled, and displayed for 
years on end under the destructive glare of unfiltered light. 
</P>
<P>
	When the British army burned Washington in August 1814, the  
Declaration of Independence and the other documents were hastily 
bundled into linen bags and trundled into rural Virginia in a cart. 
</P>
<P>
	When interest in seeing exact copies of the Declaration became  
irresistible a few years later, printers made reproductions by 
methods that probably soaked the original iron gall ink directly 
out of the parchment. 
</P>
<P>
	When World War II threatened, the three charters were placed  
under Secret Service guard to the U.S. gold depository at Fort 
Knox, Ky., where they remained until the government offered 
assurances in 1944 that all possibility of an attack on Washington 
was at an end.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ski Jumper Survives Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANICA, Slovenia (AP) -- Ski jumper Valery Kobelev of Russia  
suffered a concussion and severe neck bruises in a terrifying crash 
during qualifying Thursday for a ski flying World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Kobelev, 25, was taken by helicopter to the intensive care unit  
of a hospital in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sedated and on a respirator, but a computer scan revealed  
no brain, head or spine injuries, a hospital statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kobelev was swept by a gust of wind, lost control in the air and  
crashed head-first into the landing area of the mammoth ski flying 
hill in this Slovenian resort. After tumbling down the hill, he was 
taken away in a stretcher unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	The qualifying session for the final World Cup event of the  
season was delayed and often interrupted by gusts of wind.

<HEADLINE> DNC Exec To Use Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The incoming co-chairman of the Democratic  
National Committee is pledging to ``make the party of high hopes 
the party of high-tech,'' with standardized files to target voters 
and $1 million in software improvements for state parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Andrew, in a speech to be delivered Friday when he formally  
takes his position, lays out his vision to harness technology for 
expanding the reach of the party and keying on the concerns of 
individual voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as businesses across America are changing the way they  
operate, we will electrify, digitize, and personalize the way we do 
politics in every election,'' says Andrew, President Clinton's 
choice to run the DNC's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC, working with state parties, will create a National  
Voter File to profile and target voters across the country. With 
this information, campaigns can deliver a tailored message to 
voters, Andrew says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Voter File will allow us to slice and dice  
information to reach voters with the one-to-one customized message 
that will move them to the polls and move them to vote 
Democratic,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Andrew details a plan to spend $1 million to  
equip state parties with the voter file and upgrade their software. 
He said the money will create a network connecting state parties 
and the DNC to exchange information and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC also intends to establish a Democratic Internet Center,  
hiring staff and buying new equipment so party members use the 
latest tools of technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Democrats must always be the party of what's next,'' he  
says.

Golden divides her time between two parents who no longer share a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most, she calls one parent ``Mom'' and the other  
``Nana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an unusual family situation that is bound by an even more  
unusual court order requiring Kelly Cunningham, or ``Mom,'' and 
Leanne Bueker, or ``Nana,'' to share custody of the girl in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which has been hailed by gay rights advocates as a  
landmark custody ruling, was scheduled to go back to county court 
today. Judge Christopher Munch must decide whether Ms. Cunningham 
may take the child to Albany, N.Y., to create a family with her new 
husband, Michael Naylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cunningham has contended the joint custody order has denied  
her daughter the opportunity to live in a stable, loving 
environment. Ms. Bueker claimed it is in the best interest of the 
girl to remain in Colorado, where both women may play an active 
role in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message seeking comment from Ms. Cunningham's  
attorney was not returned, and Ms. Bueker's current attorney 
declined comment. But Mara Pawlowski, who represented Ms. Bueker 
until recently, said the key is the finding the best interest of 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``This child is a very bright, gifted child who does not want to  
move to New York,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Bueker began a relationship and moved in  
together in 1987. They decided the next year to have a child, 
according to court records, and Ms. Cunningham was artificially 
inseminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter was born in July 1989. Seven years later, Ms.  
Cunningham, a computer programmer, informed Ms. Bueker that she had 
met Naylor through the Internet, fallen in love and wanted to 
pursue a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The women separated and Ms. Bueker, a mortgage banking  
supervisor, sued for custody even though she was not listed on the 
birth certificate and did not adopt the girl legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records indicate the child loved both women equally and  
feared losing one through the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Jefferson County District Judge Frank Plaut awarded  
the two women joint custody, calling Ms. Cunningham the girl's 
``biological'' mother and Ms. Bueker the ``psychological'' mother. 
</P>
<P>
	He based the decision on a state law granting custody rights to  
an unrelated person who has had physical custody of a child for at 
least six months prior to a separation. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaut also said the girl should remain in Colorado, where she  
could be nurtured by both women. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was one of a handful nationwide in which a court  
has legally recognized a family with parents of the same sex, said 
Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five years, the number of lesbian custody cases  
nationwide has grown from three to as many as 15 a year, she said. 
Custody is awarded the biological parent in about 70 percent of 
those cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important issue is that this family be treated by the  
court in the same way the court would treat a heterosexual-headed 
household with the very same issues presented,'' Kendell said.

<HEADLINE> Remains of 3 Vietnam MIAs ID'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has identified the remains of  
three more American servicemen who had been listed as missing from 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, officials said they are those of Navy  
Cmdr. John C. Mape of San Francisco, Air Force Maj. John E. Bailey 
of Minneapolis, and Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class John F. Hartzheim 
of Appleton, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mape was flying an armed reconnaissance mission over North  
Vietnam on April 13, 1966, when his A-1H Skyraider was destroyed by 
a surface-to-air missile. Remains illegally excavated and removed 
from the site were confiscated by Vietnamese authorities in 1994 
and given to U.S. officials. They turned out to be from Mape. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was on a combat strike mission over North Vietnam on May  
10, 1966, when his F-105D Thunderchief slammed into the ground with 
its canopy in place. His remains were recovered from the site 
during a joint U.S.-Vietnamese excavation in August 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartzheim was on board an OP-2E Neptune flying a reconnaissance  
mission over Laos on Feb. 27, 1968, when the plane was hit by a 
37mm antiaircraft round. Shrapnel from the explosion struck 
Hartzheim and he was unable to parachute from the plane before it 
crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of visits to the crash site by joint U.S.-Lao teams in  
1994-96 recovered the remains. 
</P>
<P>
	With the accounting of Mape, Bailey and Hartzheim, 2,069  
Americans are now listed as unaccounted-for from the Vietnam War.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Coast Guard Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has agreed to provide $9.4 billion  
to the Coast Guard over the next two years, including almost $2 
billion for drug interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorization bill, approved 424-7 on Wednesday, would  
enable the Coast Guard to operate an additional 15 patrol boats, 
eight cutters and several maritime patrol aircraft and to open a 
law enforcement training center in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said 
House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the resources to interdict almost all the drugs if the  
Coast Guard is given those resources,'' said Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, 
R-Md., chairman of the Coast Guard subcommittee. ``Within five to 
seven years I am convinced that we can interdict up to 85 percent 
of those drugs if we are given the right resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House boosted the president's request for fiscal year 2000  
by some $500 million to pay for anti-drug programs. The Coast Guard 
also is responsible for aiding navigation operations, enforcing 
fisheries laws, search and rescue and marine transportation safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which the Senate still must consider, also would  
provide $3 million in fiscal 2000 for design competition and $128 
million in fiscal 2001 for construction of a vessel to replace the 
Mackinaw, the Coast Guard icebreaker that has been operating in the 
Great Lakes since 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mackinaw allows ships, many supplying U.S. steel plants, to  
sail later in the winter and earlier in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 820.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Rave About New QB Harbaugh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Although Jim Harbaugh has yet to set foot in  
San Diego since becoming a Charger, his impact is already being 
felt by a team desperate to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Lew Bush thinks Harbaugh will be a better fit than  
Warren Moon, who shopped his services to the Chargers several weeks 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the kind of line we have, and with our running game, now  
we have a legitimate offense and a chance,'' Bush said Thursday. 
``That's all we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Darren Perry, the Chargers' new starting free safety who  
was introduced to the media on Thursday, spoke highly of Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's on my side now,'' Perry said. ``Jim's a  
tremendous quarterback. He's going to win some ballgames for us. 
There are some things he can do that you just can't teach to a lot 
of quarterbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh's contract has been reworked to fit under the Chargers'  
salary cap. The only thing left to complete his acquisition from 
the Baltimore Ravens is for him to take a physical on Monday. A 
news conference has been set for late Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh, 35, was due to be paid $3.25 million in 1999. He  
agreed to a deal with San Diego that will pay him $2.75 million 
over two seasons, plus incentives. The Chargers, who haven't had a 
winning season since 1995, agreed Monday to send the Ravens a 
conditional fifth-round draft pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to keep adding to the offense, the Chargers (5-11 last  
year) hope to hear by Friday whether free agent wide receiver Jeff 
Graham will accept a $1.1 million, one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, a starter with the Pittsburgh Steelers since his rookie  
season of 1992, remembered the AFC championship game in January 
1996, when Harbaugh's Indianapolis Colts fell one incomplete pass 
short of going to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sacked him five or six times, and I look up at the clock  
and there's 10 seconds left, and they're on the 35-yard line with a 
chance to go to the Super Bowl,'' Perry said. ``He didn't quit. He 
kept coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh is expected to help in the development of Ryan Leaf,  
who was benched nine games into his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a major, major move if you want Ryan to emulate  
somebody,'' Bush said. ``He's a tremendous competitor. You know 
what you're going to get out there, and I'm looking forward to 
playing with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Harbaugh has all but been named the starter for the  
season opener, Leaf shouldn't go into training camp thinking this 
will be a learning year, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to go in and compete like everyone else. It's a  
humbling experience to get that kind of contract and struggle 
through the kind of year he went through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, meanwhile, said he's been asked why he wanted to join a  
team coming off a bad season. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many things determine the outcome of a game, and they were  
right there,'' said Perry, who will join a defense that was ranked 
No. 1 overall and against the run. ``The defense was impressive. 
It's a great situation for me to come into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry agreed last Friday to a two-year contract worth  
approximately $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Chargers officials said All-Pro linebacker Junior  
Seau had minor shoulder surgery last week. General manager Bobby 
Beathard said Seau should be OK for the bulk of offseason workouts.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Preparing To Borrow Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., which just acquired cable TV giant  
Tele-Communications Inc., is about to go on a borrowing binge with 
the planned sale of at least $6 billion in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a new look for a company that has long been the most widely  
held stock in America. For generations, Americans have bought and 
held shares in the company they regarded as reliable old Ma Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next week, investors can purchase a piece of AT&AMP;T's  
debt as well. But will investors who have coveted AT&AMP;T for its 
stability and steady profits be so quick to embrace a security 
based on debt? 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Thursday they expect the cachet of the AT&AMP;T name  
to make the bond offering a hot ticket, perhaps stimulating the 
entire $2.4 trillion U.S. corporate bond market. While the company 
plans to offer $5 billion to $6 billion in bonds, outsiders say the 
deal could easily balloon to $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That would surpass the $6.10 billion of debt taken on in August  
by upstart rival WorldCom Corp. as it gobbled up MCI Communications 
to become MCI WorldCom Inc. The biggest corporate bond issue ever 
was by RJR Holdings Capital, which sold $6.11 billion in May 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T needs the money to foster its growth in a booming, highly  
competitive industry, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T's goals take vision, money and execution,'' said Jeffrey  
Kagan, an independent industry analyst in Atlanta. ``They have the 
vision and can certainly execute their plans. They just need 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T officials said proceeds from the offering will first be  
used to help pay for its recently completed $42 billion purchase of 
TCI and its $4 billion stock buyback program. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, AT&AMP;T will need the funds to help convert TCI's cable lines  
into local phone lines, a cornerstone of AT&AMP;T's plan to move back 
into local service. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond sale isn't AT&AMP;T's first foray into selling debt.  
Spokeswoman Eileen Connolly said the company has moved in and out 
of the bond market for years, although the last offering was a 
relatively paltry $300 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The time is right for borrowing by big business. Interest rates  
are low. In addition, as federal surpluses grow, the government is 
cutting back on its borrowing and the bond market is able to absorb 
more debt from businesses without pumping up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good time for us to get back into it,'' Connolly  
said, citing the TCI deal. By contrast, the mid-1990s featured the 
sale or divestiture of AT&AMP;T's credit card assets, Lucent 
Technologies Inc. and NCR Corp., which left the company flush with 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength and competitiveness of rivals like MCI WorldCom  
have spurred AT&AMP;T to keep growing and keep spending, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an expensive time for all the phone companies,'' Kagan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond offering will allow AT&AMP;T to pay for its deals without  
dipping into cash on hand or issuing more stock, which would dilute 
earnings. Just Wednesday, the company's board approved a 3-for-2 
stock split, effective April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper Petagna, president of American Municipal Securities in  
St. Petersburg, Fla., said shareholders shouldn't necessarily be 
scared off by the prospect of debt. While corporate bonds are more 
frequently purchased by institutional investors, individuals can 
buy them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``A company can really enhance its value by borrowing to finance  
growth,'' he said. ``It all has to do with the way the business is 
managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, as AT&AMP;T began a push to attract institutional  
investors to the bonds, company executives emphasized their 
intention to protect AT&AMP;T's credit rating. That's an important 
gauge for any investor, Petagna said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's long-term debt now receives stellar reviews from  
credit-rating agencies like Standard &AMP; Poor's and Moody's Investors 
Services Inc. Tim Caffrey, an S&AMP;P analyst who covers AT&AMP;T, said the 
big new bond offering isn't likely to affect the company's 
creditworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an offering of this size came as a surprise, that would be  
a problem,'' Caffrey said. ``But AT&AMP;T has always kept us pretty 
well-informed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AT&AMP;T fell $1.87 1/2, or 2 percent, to close at $82.12 1/2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Has Plan To Rescue Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Former Pittsburgh Penguins star Mario Lemieux  
on Thursday promised to raise $50 million as part of his plan to 
buy the team and rescue it from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The promise came in a reorganization plan Lemieux submitted to  
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz, who is overseeing the 
team's Chapter 11 procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan valued the Penguins at about $94 million and  
promised to pay off the team's debts, which he estimated at $110 
million to $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who led the Penguins to Stanley Cups in the 1991-92 and  
1992-93 seasons, released a statement calling the reorganization 
plan ``the beginning of a new Penguin dynasty in which financial 
commitments are well-negotiated and honored, players are paid and 
fans get their money's worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins co-owners Howard Baldwin and Roger Marino did not  
immediately return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux did not publicly disclose the names of his financial  
backers, but said he would reveal them to the bankruptcy judge. A 
hearing on Lemieux's reorganization plan was scheduled before 
Markovitz on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for protection from their creditors in U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court just as the NHL season began in October, citing 
debt amounting to as much as $124 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz is expected to rule sometime next month on whether the  
plan paints an honest picture of the team's financial position, 
said Douglas Campbell, Lemieux's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditors will then decide whether to accept the plan and award  
Lemieux and his investors ownership of the team. It is up to 
Markovitz to decide whether to affirm their vote, said Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	A history of the bankruptcy filed with the plan says the  
Penguins were ``undercapitalized,'' or didn't have enough money to 
operate, since Baldwin bought the team in 1991. Marino bought into 
the team in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's filing also said the team suffered from negotiating a  
poor lease with SMG, which manages the Civic Arena, and a cheap 
broadcast contract with Fox Sports Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan calls for renegotiating both contracts.  
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said the low lease and broadcast contract made it  
difficult for the Penguins to pay players' salaries, the team's 
greatest expense, and that the 1994-95 lockout only made the team's 
situation more bleak. The plan would pay the deferred salaries owed 
to some former players, as well as banks, insurance companies, 
attorneys and other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan includes a payment schedule for the $32.6 million  
he said he's owed in deferred salary and penalties. The schedule 
calls for a $6 million cash payment, a promissory note for $4.9 
million and a second note for payments of $11.4 million over eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants another $5.2 million when the team's other debts  
are settled, and reserves the right to sue former Penguins owner 
Roger Marino ``or any other third party'' for the remaining $5.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's attorney said earlier this month he would walk away  
from the Penguins if Lemieux and his investors shoulder the team's 
annual losses, don't gut the team's high-priced talent, and repay 
$5 million of the $42.5 million Marino invested in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment consultant Chip Gesner and Michigan trucking company  
owner Harvey Gainey are also interested in buying the team.

<HEADLINE> Montgomery Ward Ends Pension Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Looking for some cash as it attempts to emerge  
from bankruptcy, Montgomery Ward &AMP; Co. is terminating its pension 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The move affects 30,000 retirees and 22,000 current employees,  
but company officials said everyone will be taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
	The retirees are being offered the option of receiving an  
annuity from an insurance company equal to the value of the pension 
they were receiving or a lump-sum payout. 
</P>
<P>
	About 25 percent of the excess funding in the old pension plan  
will be used to fund a new plan for current employees, Wards said. 
A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in Delaware approved the pension plan 
termination last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is at risk,'' Wards spokesman Chuck Knittle said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 127-year-old privately owned retailer announced last month  
that it had reached an agreement with a committee of creditors that 
will allow it to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by midyear. 
</P>
<P>
	Wards has been operating under court protection from creditors  
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Wards doesn't yet know how much money it will recapture from  
ending its pension plan, but pension experts said it should be 
significant given the number of employees in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago bankruptcy attorney Robert Fishman said retirees and  
employees should feel safe because any tinkering with pension plans 
is closely supervised by a government agency, the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corp., and bankruptcy judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishman said it makes sense that the company's pension plan  
would be overfunded -- the recent runup in stocks has probably 
raised the value of the plan's investments well beyond projections.

<HEADLINE>  Maureen O'Hara Leads St. Pat Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Smiling eyes, blue skies and a touch of glamour  
lent by grand marshal Maureen O'Hara added to the panache of 
today's 238th annual St. Patrick's Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Hara, the Irish-born star of such classic movies as  
``Miracle on 34th Street'' and ``The Quiet Man,'' waved and smiled 
broadly to the cheering crowds, which were pressed 10 deep against 
police barricades as some 200,000 marchers moved along the 2 mile 
parade route. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a New Yorker, I think this is the greatest parade in the  
world,'' said Mickey McGovern, 55, a Brooklyn-born drug counselor 
who now lives in Greensboro, N.C., but drives up every year just 
for the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible,'' said honor guard Michael Malfi, whose  
Monsignor Farrell Marching Band -- an all boys parochial school from 
Staten Island -- was the first marching band to step up the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Malfi, 17, and James Capelonga, 18, were carrying flags instead  
of their usual instruments -- a synthesizer and xylophone -- but were 
happy just to be there. ``It's a great honor and a good 
experience,'' said Capelonga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Pipe Band, making its New York debut, received  
applause and encouragement from fellow marchers as they lined up on 
West 44th Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all very excited to be in the parade,'' said the band's  
Scottish mentor, Ian MacDonald. And Conn McKenna, 70, also of 
Scotland, a first time paradegoer, was glad to see them. ``The 
more, the merrier,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other first time marchers included the 10-member Irish Galloglas  
Guard, a unit that has served as bodyguards for Irish leaders since 
1242 A.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in rust kilts, gray military shirts and black berets,  
one member carried a massive ax on his shoulder which he called ``a 
medieval attitude adjustment device.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The luck of the Irish was evident as thousands of green-wearing,  
shamrock carrying paradegoers lined the avenue under beautiful, 
balmy spring skies and temperatures inching toward 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's breathtaking,'' said Kieron Bredy, a young man from  
Glasgow, Scotland. ``America's great because no one's ashamed to 
show they're Irish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Damian Gallagher, 19, also from Scotland, wore a  
green ribbon on his lapel. ``This is for the Republican 
prisoners,'' Gallagher said. ``My father's been incarcerated for 
two and a half years (in Glasgow). He was sentenced for 
conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day began with a morning Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral  
where Cardinal John O'Connor talked about the contribution of 
Catholic schools to the education of New York children. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose  
relationship has never been warm, attended the Mass but sat in 
front pews on opposite sides of the aisle. The mayor sat next to 
Ms. O'Hara and later marched up the avenue with ``Saturday Night 
Live'' actors Colin Quinn and Molly Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor has been a guest and hosted the show several times and  
invited the cast members to march with him and the New York City 
Police Department bagpipers. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these years I never got invited to the parade,'' said  
Quinn. ``It took an Italian to invite me to my own parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, who is deciding whether to run for Sen. Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan's seat next year, was cheered and greeted warmly 
all along the parade route. Seizing the political opportunity, 
Giuliani made frequent stops along the way pumping hands and 
kissing babies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki, wearing an Irish knit sweater and waving an Irish flag,  
marched far behind the mayor with Lt. Gov. Mary O'Donohue and the 
gray-hued, stern-faced New York State Trooper contingent. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, in what has become as familiar to the parade  
as shamrock-colored cheeks and green hats, 17 members of the Irish 
Lesbian &AMP; Gay Organization were arrested on disorderly conduct 
charges outside the New York Public Library on 42nd Street. It was 
the ninth year they staged the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was a smaller part of about 100 demonstrators who were  
protesting the decision of the parade host, the Ancient Order of 
Hibernians, to ban them from carrying a banner in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilwoman Christine Quinn, who was arrested at two  
smaller St. Patrick parades recently in the Bronx and Queens, was 
again taken into custody. She admitted the ILGO demonstration was 
done by rote. ``Maybe, we need to come up with a new, more exciting 
strategy,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Census Measures Head to Full House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local officials would get to review and  
challenge census figures under a Republican bill headed to the full 
House under threat of a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argue that the bill and six other census measures  
that were approved by the House Government Reform Committee on 
Wednesday would help to reduce the inaccuracies that plagued the 
1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
	That count, which missed 8.4 million people and counted 4.4  
million people twice, was the first to be less accurate than the 
one before it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats insisted that the proposals will just cause  
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley, whose department oversees the  
count, also said this week that three of the bills actually ``would 
reduce the accuracy and seriously disrupt the schedule of Census 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this legislation were presented to the president, I would  
recommend that he veto it,'' Daley wrote in a letter Tuesday to 
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the committee's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which advanced on a 23-21 vote, would let local  
officials review and challenge the census figures before they are 
finalized. A similar program was dropped after the 1990 count and 
the Census Bureau says the current plan already relies on input 
from local officials before the census begins on April 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few thousand people might not make a difference in  
Washington but they make a huge difference in smaller local 
communities,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., the bill's sponsor and 
chairman of the committee's census panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Census officials had planned to use a scientific method known as  
``statistical sampling'' to improve next year's count but 
Republicans objected. 
</P>
<P>
	The census figure is calculated every 10 years and is used to  
redistribute the 435 seats in the House and dole out federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insisted on the ``enumeration'' outlined in the  
Constitution and have suggested that a number produced by sampling 
could be manipulated to shift House seats and federal aid to 
Democratic-leaning areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argue that sampling would produce a more accurate  
count. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans went to court and the Supreme Court ruled in January  
that sampling is unconstitutional for the purpose of redistributing 
House seats. But the high court said the law requires it for other 
purposes, such as giving out financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau director, subsequently  
announced the census would use two counts. One will be based on the 
traditional method of door-to-door counting and be used to 
determine how many House seats each state gets; the other will use 
sampling to find people missed during the first count and produce 
what officials say will be a more accurate census. 
</P>
<P>
	The process involves mailing questionnaires to some 100 million  
households and then sending workers to find those who fail to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also object to the two-track plan, which Miller  
described as ``an absolute disaster. It's terrible public policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., a sampling advocate, said  
Republican attempts to ``micromanage'' the census would cause 
breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The professionals at the Census Bureau cannot conduct the best  
census possible if Congress is in their way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other census bills approved by the committee but facing a  
veto would require census forms to be printed in 34 languages and 
mandate a second mailing of census forms. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining bills the committee passed would allow welfare  
recipients to work as temporary census employees without losing 
benefits; provide $26 million in grants to municipalities and 
tribal governments to promote the census; authorize $300 million 
next year for Census Bureau advertising; and expand a program for 
promoting the census in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are HR 472; HR 683; HR 928; HR 929; HR 1009; HR 1010;  
and HR 1058.

him on the roster by waiving guard James Robinson.

15 games for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, 32, signed with the Clippers as a free agent on Feb. 4.  
He will be in uniform Friday night when the team plays at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 28, averaged 7.6 points and 1.9 rebounds in 14 games  
this season. He joined the Clippers as a free agent prior to last 
season, when he averaged 7.7 points in 70 games.

<HEADLINE> Top 4 Percent Guaranteed at UC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- For years, graduating at the top of the  
class didn't mean high school students would be eligible for 
admission into California's prestigious public university system. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about to change. In an attempt to reward high-performing  
students from low-performing schools, the Board of Regents is 
backing a plan to ensure eligibility to the University of 
California to students who graduate in the top 4 percent of their 
class. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says we understand that some schools are better than  
others, but that is not the student's fault. All the student can do 
is do as well as humanly possible,'' said Gov. Gray Davis, 
president of the Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is not expected to significantly change minority  
enrollments, which plunged after the state stopped using 
affirmative action in the admissions process. But it will bring in 
more rural and poor students and, supporters hope, could serve as a 
morale booster for schools that traditionally send few students to 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 4 percent admissions program will say to every student in  
every high school, `Keep dreaming big dreams, keep working hard. If 
you really excel, we will reward your effort,''' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, recommended Thursday by a 13-1 committee vote, is  
expected to be approved by the full board today and would take 
effect in fall 2001. Students still have to take required college 
board tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of who gets into the university has been hotly  
debated since 1995, when regents voted to drop affirmative action -- 
a vote taken under the supervision of then-Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ban went into effect last fall, admission of black and  
Hispanic students dropped about 10 percent across the system, with 
much steeper declines at the prestigious campuses of Berkeley and 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters later banned affirmative action at all state colleges by  
passing Proposition 209. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he supported affirmative action, Davis says the 4  
percent plan is not an attempt to get around Proposition 209. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the plan would affect relatively few students. A pilot  
study found that of the 10,200 estimated students in the 4 percent 
pool, two-thirds were already eligible for UC. That left 3,600 
students, of whom about 2,000 were white. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those supporting the plan was Regent Ward Connerly, who  
led the move to drop race as a factor in admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this proposal can hold the promise of sending two or three  
students to UC without a basketball scholarship, then it is worth 
it,'' said Connerly, who is black.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ethnic Clashes Kill 43 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Ethnic groups armed with knives and  
swords clashed for a second day Thursday in a remote area of Borneo 
known for its brutal communal violence. At least 43 people have 
been killed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 houses were burned, and several people were  
dismembered in the fighting, which began Wednesday and involved 
four ethnic groups that ganged up on a fifth one, officials and 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was decapitated, his head paraded through a village by a  
screaming crowd, a witness said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 400 people from the outnumbered ethnic group, immigrant  
farmers from the island of Madura, boarded boats to flee the 
fighting, said Lukman Hakim, a local district official. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and troops rushed to the Tebas and Pemangkat districts  
near Indonesia's border with Malaysia, 450 miles northeast of 
Jakarta, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	A resident said the fighting had stopped by late Thursday but  
the situation remained tense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very scared. We can still see some houses burning. No  
one wants to go out,'' said the resident, who identified himself 
only as Djusan. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting on Borneo involved the latest outbreak of violence  
between rival ethnic and religious groups in Indonesia, a country 
struggling with one of its worst economic and political crises in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 people have been killed since January in weeks of  
clashes between Christians and Muslims in the Maluku Islands in the 
country's east. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people fear that such violence could escalate as the  
world's fourth most populous nation prepares to hold its most open 
parliamentary election in 45 years on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The ballot is regarded as crucial to a democratic process that  
began when authoritarian President Suharto quit in May amid riots 
and protests against his 32-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Stability also is needed to help Indonesia recover from its  
position as the worst victim of Asia's 19-month economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	A local police chief, Chaherul Rafidi, said 43 people were  
killed in the two districts of Borneo in fighting involving 
indigenous Malay, Bugis, Dayak as well as ethnic Chinese people on 
one side and Maurese immigrants on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	A national police spokesman, Brig. Togar Sianeapar, said the  
violence was prompted by a dispute over an unpaid bus fare by a 
Madurese immigrant on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hakim, the district official, said it began when passengers  
discovered that the Madurese had boarded the bus with a hidden 
weapon, in violation of an agreement that his ethnic group and 
Dayaks had recently reached to reduce tensions between them. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, at least 300 people were killed when Dayak tribes  
fought with Madurese farmers, who had been relocated to the area by 
Indonesia's government in an effort to ease population growth 
elsewhere. At that time, there were reports of cannibalism by 
indigenous tribesmen.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Opposes Food Co. Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department filed a lawsuit  
Thursday to block Suiza Food Corp. from acquiring Broughton Food 
Co. on grounds the deal could result in higher milk prices for 
Kentucky school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust division also sought a temporary  
restraining order to prevent the deal from closing until the court 
rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction to block the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza, based in Dallas, and Broughton, based in Marietta, Ohio,  
agreed not to oppose the restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in London, Ky.  
</P>
<P>
	Suiza and Broughton compete for school milk contracts in dozens  
of south central Kentucky school districts. Their merger would 
create a monopoly on milk bids in more than 20 school districts 
there, the government said. In another 30 districts, the deal would 
reduce bidders from three to two. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction would substantially lessen competition for  
school milk business and result in higher prices and poorer 
services to schools and school children in Kentucky,'' said 
Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein. ``If allowed to proceed, 
the merger would eliminate the chief source of school milk 
competition in the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the affected school districts have a large percentage of  
students entitled to participate in the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's school lunch program. As a result of paying higher 
milk prices, south central Kentucky school districts would have 
less money to spend on other food provided by that program, the 
division argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza owns and operates 37 fluid milk processing plants in this  
country; it had net sales of $1.8 billion in 1997. Broughton owns 
and operates three fluid milk processing plants in the United 
States and had 1997 sales of $87.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The department noted that the school milk industry in Kentucky  
has a history of collusion, although it did not involve Suiza or 
Broughton. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, two other companies pleaded guilty to criminal  
bid-rigging charges involving milk sold to Kentucky schools over 10 
years. Suiza and Broughton each later acquired a processing plant 
from one of the offending companies. The government said the 
history shows that school milk markets are conducive to collusion.

<HEADLINE> Temple's Sanchez Has Unlikely Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- If you think Purdue making it to  
the Sweet 16 is surprising, consider Pepe Sanchez's road to Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-sport athlete growing up in Argentina, Sanchez chose  
basketball over soccer. He made his country's national junior team 
and then found his way to Philadelphia after Temple coach John 
Chaney was impressed with what he saw of him on a videotape sent by 
a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Since arriving three years ago, Sanchez has started every game  
for the Owls and just might be the most important person on the 
court Friday night when sixth-seeded Temple (23-10) takes on 
10th-seeed Purdue in the semifinal of the East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will play either No. 1 and top-seeded Duke (34-1) or  
12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State (22-10) on Sunday in the 
regional championship that everyone expects Duke to win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Purdue-Temple matchup pits teams with veteran coaches who  
stress defense and a more deliberate style of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think whoever gets the lead will have some control,'' Purdue  
coach Gene Keady said. ``We really don't care about the pace. I 
think the main thing is to control Temple's offense with our 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That ultimately means controlling Sanchez, who was spectacular  
in victories over Kent State and third-seeded Cincinnati. He played 
77 of a possible 80 minutes, and had 29 points, 10 assists, eight 
rebounds, seven steals and three turnovers. He was also the focal 
point of the Owls' matchup zone defense that limited the Bearcats 
to 34.7 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I play a game, my goal is not to be the star of the  
game,'' said Sanchez, an All-Atlantic 10 first-team selection this 
year and its defensive player of the year last. ``My goal is to be 
the most regular person on the floor and to have balance and to be 
cool thinking about what I am doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A perfect game is scoring between 10 and 15 points, six or  
eight assists, stealing balls and getting rebounds and not turning 
the ball over,'' Sanchez added. ``If I score 30 points, something 
is wrong and we're probably not going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue guard Jaraan Cornell said Sanchez just doesn't make a lot  
of mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have to make him work and not try to let him  
make the easy pass and try to contain him,'' Cornell said. ``He 
leads the team in steals so I am going to have to protect the ball. 
It's going to be a challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that might help Purdue is to avoid what Cincinnati  
did, which was to try to attack Sanchez's side of the zone. Going 
the other way might be easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue, though, seems to have found answers in the NCAA  
tournament that were missing at the end of the Big Ten season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, there were a lot of people that doubted  
whether we would be here since we lost five of our last six 
games,'' forward Brian Cardinal said. ``But we're proving people 
wrong now and showing them that we do deserve to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has changed is the Boilermakers' defense, which has gotten  
a lot tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we figured out the problem, I started to like our team  
much better,'' Keady said. ``I don't like guys with bad attitudes 
because they are going to make you fail. I don't want to be a 
failure. I want to be the best I can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue edged Texas 58-54 in the opening round of the tournament  
and surprised second-seeded and 10th-ranked Miami 73-63 behind a 
20-point performance by Cardinal. The Boilermakers also got a great 
defensive effort from Alan Eldridge, who limited Johnny Hemsley to 
13 points.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Does Ads for Lawyer's Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is America ready to welcome O.J. Simpson back  
as a commercial spokesman? A lawyer referral service thinks so, and 
the company has videotaped him making a pitch for legal 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, the former spokesman for Hertz and other companies,  
said he made the appearance on behalf of Justice Media as a favor 
to a friend and because he believes in the rights of all defendants 
to have adequate legal representation. He said he was paid only 
enough to cover his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the proposal interested him because it is aimed at  
minority defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I have learned is you can't walk into a  
courtroom without competent legal representation,'' Simpson said in 
a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The football Hall of Famer said he was grateful he had the money  
to hire the best lawyers in the business to represent him at his 
1994 criminal trial. He was acquitted on charges of murdering 
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after a trial with 
a defense focused on racism and alleged misconduct by the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Ms. Simpson and  
Goldman in a separate civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 
million in damages. Any income he receives can be seized by the 
estate of Ms. Simpson and the Goldman family to satisfy the 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wonder if a referral from Simpson would help a lawyer's  
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is not bad, but people may have problems with the  
messenger,'' said Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola 
University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Assuming they are targeting an African-American audience, it's  
still iffy,'' she said. ``And it's kind of sad. Isn't there anybody 
else in the African-American community who can speak out for 
justice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said he has been following a number of recent cases in  
which defendants convicted long ago were released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people lost years of their lives,'' Simpson said. ``If  
any of them had the money to properly defend themselves, maybe they 
wouldn't have had to spend any time in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was innocent,'' he said, ``but what if I had had to wait 16  
years to be vindicated?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged a lot of people are convinced he is guilty but  
said that reflects a public unwillingness to believe that police do 
bad things. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he has any new evidence that might help convince the  
public of his innocence, he said, ``I'm working on it.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Found To Curb Menstrual Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vioxx, the highly anticipated new pain pill from  
Merck &AMP; Co. Inc. that promises to be easier on the stomach than 
aspirin, works well in relieving menstrual and post-surgical pain, 
according to two company studies unveiled today at a medical 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx is expected to reach pharmacies later this spring after  
obtaining approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx was as effective as prescription-strength Aleve, an  
aspirin-type drug, in treating moderate to severe menstrual pain, 
according to a Merck study of 127 women being presented at the 
American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics in San 
Antonio, Texas. The study found pain relief was sustained for at 
least 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second study of 151 patients who had oral surgery to remove  
their wisdom teeth, Vioxx proved as effective at postoperative pain 
relief as ibuprofen. The dental study also showed one 50 milligram 
Vioxx pill could provide relief for a full 24 hours. Ibuprofen must 
be taken at least three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx will likely become the second in a new class of pain  
medications which work as well as aspirin and other 
anti-inflammatory medicines but don't cause stomach irritation that 
can lead to ulcers and other dangerous ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck, the world's largest drug company, will be playing  
catch-up to Monsanto Co.'s Celebrex drug, which won U.S. approval 
on Dec. 31. Celebrex, approved for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis, has already sold more than 1.1 million prescriptions, 
making it the biggest new drug of 1999. It has also has become the 
second-fastest-selling new drug in history after Pfizer Inc.'s 
impotence pill Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Celebrex, Merck is looking to get approval for Vioxx to  
treat osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans. 
But instead of also seeking indication for rheumatoid arthritis, 
which affects about 2 million Americans, it wants the FDA to 
approve Vioxx for acute pain treatment -- a market of more than 40 
million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	It's for this reason that Merck is giving the FDA data showing  
how the drug works against different types of pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the risk of stomach ailments is higher when taking  
aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs for prolonged use, a 
dilemma faced most arthritis sufferers, the gastrointestinal risks 
exist even with short duration use, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners, said  
getting the acute pain indication is vital for Merck, though the 
market for the both Celebrex and Vioxx is bigger with arthritis 
because patients with that condition take pain relievers more 
often. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA advisory committee meets April 20 to review Merck's  
application for Vioxx.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Regrets Calling Lewis KO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Evander Holyfield regrets his prediction that he  
would knock out Lennox Lewis in the third round of their 
heavyweight title unification bout, which ended in a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was wrong by even saying that, even though I felt I would  
take him in three rounds,'' Holyfield told The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``By saying that, I made it hard, and I refused to turn from it.  
I apologize for that,'' said Holyfield, who lives in suburban 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and WBA champion said he watched a tape on Sunday of  
Saturday night's fight at Madison Square Garden, but did not try to 
score it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're both champions,'' he said of himself and Lewis, the WBC  
heavyweight champ. ``I could see why the judges thought neither of 
us took the fight from the other guy. The judges said it was a 
draw. Realistically, he didn't knock me out, and I didn't knock him 
out. It's all based on a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with the punch stats, people say, `Well, this man hit you  
600 times.'' But if he hit me that much, why didn't I fall? How 
come I was never staggered or hurt? Obviously, because a lot of 
times he was tapping me,'' Holyfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was trying to get Lewis close to him ``so that I  
could nail him with a big shot. But it didn't work. When boxers 
don't do what they're supposed to do, it falls into the judges' 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield confirmed remarks by his attorney, Jim Thomas, who  
said that the fighter did not feel well just before the fight. He 
said he had a ``difficult camp,'' alluding to a virus and other 
ailments, including leg cramps during the Lewis fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things happen. But when things happen, I don't go looking for  
excuses. Lennox fought a good fight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield said he is ``willing to be flexible'' in negotiations  
for a rematch with Lewis, and he might fight for a lower guarantee 
than the $50 million he earned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	About the rematch, Holyfield said, ``He can't beat me the same  
way. Don't think that I'm going to come back and be the same. What 
he did was very effective. I've got the bruises to show that he was 
effective. I got punished enough.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Appeals Judge's Rejection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The NCAA on Thursday appealed a federal  
judge's refusal to give it more time to revamp its freshman 
eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Buckwalter declined Tuesday to  
issue a stay which could have delayed enforcement of his court 
order striking down Proposition 16, which mandated that freshmen 
attain a minimum standardized test score to play in Division I 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA on Thursday asked for another stay from the 3rd Circuit  
of the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	In his initial ruling last week, Buckwalter declared that  
minimum score requirements have ``an unjustified disparate impact 
against African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA has said that without more time to develop new  
requirements, there will be chaos among the 302 Division I schools 
because they will be without a critical recruiting guideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Proposition 16, students scoring less than 820 on the SAT,  
or 16 on the ACT, could not participate in athletics, regardless of 
their other academic credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckwalter's ruling on Proposition 16 only struck down using  
such tests as minimum requirements, but did not outlaw altogether 
the use of standardized tests, which many educators have long said 
are racially and culturally discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA has said the earliest it could establish new guidelines  
is October, since it has to consult its member schools before 
instituting new rules.

<HEADLINE> Schwarzenegger Sues Doctor for Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger has added a doctor as a  
defendant to his $50 million libel suit over a supermarket tabloid 
story claiming that the strong-man actor was suffering from heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer ruled Tuesday that Dr.  
Arnold Fox, who was quoted by the Globe, can be included in the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was prompted by an Aug. 4 cover story headlined  
``Arnie's Heart Crisis.'' The Globe has defended the story's 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarzenegger said Fox never examined him and had no contact  
with him or access to his medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor had surgery in 1997 to replace a heart valve. But the  
operation was ``a complete success and he has made a full 
recovery,'' and he doesn't have heart disease, spokeswoman 
Catherine Olim said.

<HEADLINE> Monthly Trade Deficit Biggest Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's trade deficit jumped to its  
highest monthly level in history, a $17 billion imbalance that is 
certain to boost a growing movement in Congress to erect trade 
barriers to protect American industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 percent widening in the January deficit -- up by $2.9  
billion from December -- reflected a booming U.S. economy's strong 
demand for foreign products and global recessions that have 
seriously undercut exports by American farmers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's worse-than-expected Commerce Department report on the  
trade deficit in goods and services came one day after the House, 
by a lopsided 289-141 vote, passed a bill that would impose stiff 
limits on imports of foreign steel. The Senate has not yet 
considered the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Protectionist pressures are likely to increase in coming months.  
Economists believe last year's record $169 billion trade gap could 
easily swell to $200 billion this year as recessions in one-third 
of the world hurt American exporters and imports continue to flood 
into the United States because of strong domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States remains an oasis of prosperity in the global  
economy,'' said Michael Fenollosa, economist at John Hancock in 
Boston. ``Unless our economy tanks or the rest of the world makes a 
miraculous recovery this year, this deficit is going to get worse, 
much worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is worried that rising protectionist  
sentiment in this country could trigger new financial turmoil in 
developing countries by signaling the United States is no longer 
willing to serve as an importer of last resort for troubled 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has threatened to veto the steel import bill,  
arguing it would violate World Trade Organization rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is the bill WTO inconsistent, it could send a  
chilling message to the rest of the world at a time when our 
economy is doing very well,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports Thursday showed that despite America's trade  
troubles, the U.S. economy continues to turn in a stellar 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation, helped by the flood of cheap imports and falling  
world oil prices, rose by only 0.1 percent in February, while the 
number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits remained below 
the 300,000 level for the seventh straight week, something that 
last occurred 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents of the administration's free trade policies are  
unswayed by the good overall economic performance, saying that is 
little comfort to workers laid off by import competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``An unemployed steel or textile worker will tell you the trade  
deficit does matter,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. factories have cut 337,000 jobs in the past year and  
farmers are suffering through their worst times since the recession 
of the early 1980s because of lost export sales and falling world 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been forecasting the January deficit would widen  
but the size of the gap caught them by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Shipley, economist at Merrill Lynch, said he expected trade  
would cut 1.5 percentage points off economic growth in the current 
quarter, although he said the gross domestic product would still 
expand at a healthy 4 percent annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
	By country, America's deficit with China widened sharply to $4.9  
billion as U.S. exports to China fell to the lowest level in more 
than two years. Daley said this poor showing highlighted the need 
for China to do more to eliminate trade barriers if it wants to 
gain entry into the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Japan narrowed by 22 percent to $4.7  
billion, but the deficit with all Pacific Rim countries, the region 
hardest hit by the financial crisis, widened by 7.8 percent to 
$12.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a sign of coming problems, the U.S. surplus with Latin  
America, one of the few areas where the trade flow is in America's 
favor, was cut in half to $671 million in January, reflecting that 
region is now falling victim to the global turmoil that has hurt 
Russia and Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in the January deficit came as exports fell by 1.4  
percent and imports rose 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.1 billion drop in exports was led by falling demand for  
farm goods including corn, oil seeds and cotton and manufactured 
products including oilfield drilling equipment, farm machinery, 
aircraft and autos. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.8 billion rise in imports included monthly records in  
shipments of foreign autos, food and consumer goods, led by a $425 
million increase in shipments of pharmaceutical products into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit would have been even worse expect for the fact that  
Americans continue to benefit from falling world oil demand, which 
pushed the average price of imported crude oil down to $9.19 per 
barrel, the lowest level in 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise in Light Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose slightly in quiet trading  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32  
point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.49 percent from 5.50 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities were up 1/8 point to 
3/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.48 
point to 1,290.22 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.49 percent as the  
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.38 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.62 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.45 percent. One-year yields were 4.69 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.02 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.47 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged from late Wednesday at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 1/4 from 124 21/32. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.17 percent from 5.18 percent.

<HEADLINE> SEC Urged on Corporate Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Nasdaq for corporate bonds?  
</P>
<P>
	As Wall Street bond dealers try to head off a government  
mandate, lawmakers are prodding securities regulators to act to 
make price data on corporate bonds as clearly available as 
information about stocks and government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Greater numbers of ordinary investors have started buying  
corporate bonds, which now have a U.S. market of $2.4 trillion -- 
nearly twice the size of the municipal bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate bonds are considered integral to the stock market's  
performance, because it would be difficult to make sound judgments 
on a company's stock without accurate data on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their rapid growth, lawmakers and federal regulators  
believe corporate bonds have fallen behind stocks and other bond 
markets in the openness of their prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come ... to illuminate this needlessly dark  
corner of our capital markets,'' Arthur Levitt, chairman of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, testified Thursday at a hearing 
of the House Commerce subcommittee on finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly the technology now exists to gather transaction  
prices, distribute them and interpret them in a timely, accurate 
and an efficient fashion,'' Levitt said. ``Incomplete information 
leaves investors vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To spur the SEC, the subcommittee began considering a proposal  
that would order the agency to adopt new rules governing price 
disclosure in the corporate bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important goal for our markets and investors,''  
said Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the full Commerce 
Committee, who challenged the SEC and the bond market last fall 
``to get going and clean this market up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone using the bond market to save for retirement or  
education will benefit from it,'' Bliley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt, who began pushing for better price disclosure in  
corporate bonds in a speech last September, said Thursday the new 
proposal ``creates a greater sense of urgency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following an SEC review of bond markets, the National  
Association of Securities Dealers agreed last year to adopt rules 
requiring dealers to report all corporate bond transactions to the 
NASD and develop systems for real-time disclosure of buying and 
selling prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD, a self-policing group that operates the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, also has said it will improve its efforts to detect fraud 
in corporate bond trading. While the SEC review found that the 
overall bond market was running smoothly, it uncovered anecdotal 
evidence of possible insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike stocks, the vast majority of bonds are not traded in a  
central market. They are bought and sold over the telephone by a 
relatively small group of dealers that includes major brokerages 
such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bond Market Association, which represents the dealers, has  
disputed claims that they are impeding the development of 
electronic trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is offering its own system for reporting prices at  
which dealers buy and sell bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In less than six months, the industry has made substantial  
progress toward implementing a system that will enhance corporate 
bond price transparency,'' Micah Green, the association's executive 
vice president, testified at Thursday's hearing. ``Our commitment 
to improving transparency is serious, and we are making it 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the price-reporting system being developed by the dealers  
only covers investment-grade corporate bonds, not the popular 
high-yield ``junk'' bonds, and details of the new system ``are 
still unclear,'' Levitt told the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edolphus Towns of New York, the subcommittee's senior  
Democrat, said, ``I hope we are not being asked to anoint any one 
system at this point.''

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Eyes Record at Darlington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Even Dale Jarrett, who's won the past  
two TranSouth 400s, can't help sneaking a look at Jeff Gordon and 
Jeff Burton when it comes to Darlington Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett can tie David Pearson, the track's career champion with  
10 Winston Cup victories, by winning the TranSouth for the third 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it seems like everyone, including Jarrett, talks about the  
battle of Jeffs that's gone on here the past few years. Gordon has 
won five of the past seven races, including an unprecedented four 
straight Southern 500s, while Burton has four top-five finishes the 
past two years and nearly ended Gordon's string in the past two 
Labor Day races. 
</P>
<P>
	In their straightaway duel at the 1997 Southern 500 over the  
final half-mile, Gordon blocked out a hard-charging Burton, who 
ducked down low in one of NASCAR's most classic recent finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, Gordon and Burton all shoot for this year's TranSouth  
400 title, with qualifying today. The race is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's won twice this year, most recently last week at  
Atlanta. Burton edged out his brother Ward to win at Las Vegas two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's pretty sure he knows who he'll have to outrace to  
match the record of ``The Silver Fox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two guys that run as well there as what we do, and  
that's Jeff Burton and Jeff Gordon, and we'll have to race them,'' 
Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett did just that at Darlington a year ago, beating Gordon  
to the finish line by about three car lengths after the two touched 
coming out of the last turn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Jarrett's Ford held off Ted Musgrave in a similar  
situation to win for the first time at a track only 40 minutes from 
where he grew up in Camden. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Jarrett keep things going this year?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we can, but it's a tough race track as always,''  
Jarrett said. ``It's not like it's getting any easier and with each 
race, it just becomes a little more difficult with the pavement 
wearing out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, the only driver besides the Jeffs to win a Winston  
Cup event this year, has watched from the back of the pack as 
Gordon, Burton and Jarrett have become dominant at Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin used to hold that position, taking five races here  
between 1993-96, including the Southern 500 six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's so eager to run well at Darlington, he spent time  
testing the week after he won at Rockingham. His top lap of 169.698 
mph was more than a mile per hour quicker than his pole-winning lap 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of success here, but in the last few years,  
it's been pretty lean,'' he said. ``We're ready to get back in a 
racy mode here and be a contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett has learned to glide through the 1.366-mile oval layout  
with the grace of Pearson, who won a record seven spring races at 
the track that now has a grandstand named for him. 
</P>
<P>
	As a child, Jarrett would follow Pearson's Hall-of-Fame career  
and dream of similar feats. ``The things that he's been able to 
accomplish in this sport just amazes me,'' Jarrett said of Pearson. 
``Maybe we can do that, but it'll be tough.''

<HEADLINE> ACLU To Defend Festival Organizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union and state  
Sen. Tom Hayden said police overreacted when they used force to 
disperse a crowd at a hip-hop festival last month. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU Executive Director Ramona Ripston said Wednesday that the  
organization will represent Asia Yu, the festival organizer who has 
been charged with inciting a riot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police treated this as a riot, but there was no riot,''  
Ripston said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 28 scene became chaotic after police marched in wearing  
riot gear, wielding batons and aiming guns at the seemingly 
peaceful crowd, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very frightened if I saw police in riot gear aiming  
guns at me,'' said Ripston. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden, whose son attended the festival and videotaped it,  
issued a statement saying he had viewed the tape and ``I am of the 
opinion that the LAPD overreacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The confrontation began simply enough with police arresting  
someone spray-painting graffiti on a wall,'' Hayden said. ``This 
led to a handful of people throwing bottles and/or rocks at police 
vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said police escalated the situation by calling a citywide  
tactical alert. Officers also occupied the Venice area for several 
hours, used excessive force in making arrests and pointed weapons 
at the crowd, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Hayden's statement, police spokesman Lt. Anthony  
Alba said, ``That's a private citizen's opinion. I was there and I 
witnessed individuals throwing rocks and bottles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yu, 28, a professional hip-hop dancer, could receive a year in  
jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted of inciting to riot.

<HEADLINE>  Albanians Seek Peace, Await War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The red Albanian flag flutters over  
the ruins of Likovac, and the devastated village that serves as 
Kosovo Liberation Army headquarters swarms with black-uniformed 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	They're ready for more war, yet they seek peace.  
</P>
<P>
	As the battle for Kosovo heads into its second year, even  
hardened KLA commanders are ready to suspend their struggle for 
independence and settle for autonomy, as laid out in the 
U.S.-sponsored peace accord signed Thursday by ethnic Albanian 
delegates in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Even KLA supreme commander Sulejman Selimi says he's happy to  
hang up his gun and become ``a free civilian'' in an autonomous 
Kosovo, where democratic rights would be policed by the world 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Outgunned by the Yugoslav army and in need of Western support,  
Selimi and many other rebels are now willing to accept the world's 
vision of NATO-enforced autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia, the main 
Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence for the ethnic Albanian-majority province remains  
their ultimate goal. But there is a growing recognition among rebel 
ranks that time is on their side -- that they can achieve that 
objective through other means than fighting heavy tanks with 
submachine guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Serbs' superior firepower, Kosovo's Albanian rebels  
seem to hold the better cards. 
</P>
<P>
	If Serbs refuse to sign the internationally endorsed peace plan,  
they risk being bombed into compliance by NATO. If the Serbs do 
sign, the bet is that in a province where ethnic Albanians are a 90 
percent majority, autonomy is bound to mutate into independence 
over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not how you fight the war, it's whether you win it that  
counts,'' a gap-toothed fighter who identified himself only as Remi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few days, reinforced Yugoslav army and Serb police  
forces have driven a wedge between guerrilla areas north of 
Pristina and the rebel region of Drenica, southwest of the 
provincial capital. Dirt roads are dotted with tractor-pulled 
trailers carrying weeping women and children fleeing homes left 
unprotected by retreating rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Selimi, in his first interview since he was appointed supreme  
commander last month, said the Serbs want to ``cut Kosovo and take 
a piece of it'' before any possible NATO strike. They then hope to 
hold on to the mineral-rich north in any negotiations over the 
future of the province.

<HEADLINE>  Albanians Seek Peace, Await War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The red Albanian flag flutters over  
the ruins of Likovac, and the devastated village that serves as 
Kosovo Liberation Army headquarters swarms with black-uniformed 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	They're ready for more war, yet they seek peace.  
</P>
<P>
	As the battle for Kosovo heads into its second year, even  
hardened KLA commanders are ready to suspend their struggle for 
independence and settle for autonomy, as laid out in the 
U.S.-sponsored peace accord signed Thursday by ethnic Albanian 
delegates in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Even KLA supreme commander Sulejman Selimi says he's happy to  
hang up his gun and become ``a free civilian'' in an autonomous 
Kosovo, where democratic rights would be policed by the world 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Outgunned by the Yugoslav army and in need of Western support,  
Selimi and many other rebels are now willing to accept the world's 
vision of NATO-enforced autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia, the main 
Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence for the ethnic Albanian-majority province remains  
their ultimate goal. But there is a growing recognition among rebel 
ranks that time is on their side -- that they can achieve that 
objective through other means than fighting heavy tanks with 
submachine guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Serbs' superior firepower, Kosovo's Albanian rebels  
seem to hold the better cards. 
</P>
<P>
	If Serbs refuse to sign the internationally endorsed peace plan,  
they risk being bombed into compliance by NATO. If the Serbs do 
sign, the bet is that in a province where ethnic Albanians are a 90 
percent majority, autonomy is bound to mutate into independence 
over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not how you fight the war, it's whether you win it that  
counts,'' a gap-toothed fighter who identified himself only as Remi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few days, reinforced Yugoslav army and Serb police  
forces have driven a wedge between guerrilla areas north of 
Pristina and the rebel region of Drenica, southwest of the 
provincial capital. Dirt roads are dotted with tractor-pulled 
trailers carrying weeping women and children fleeing homes left 
unprotected by retreating rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Selimi, in his first interview since he was appointed supreme  
commander last month, said the Serbs want to ``cut Kosovo and take 
a piece of it'' before any possible NATO strike. They then hope to 
hold on to the mineral-rich north in any negotiations over the 
future of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Yugoslav army also wants to seize control of the  
rugged mountain region between Drenica and the north to set up 
anti-NATO air defenses there. 
</P>
<P>
	His fighters in the Cicavica Mountains have already seen  
antiaircraft missiles being unloaded from Yugoslav army trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon says 16,000 to 21,000 Yugoslav army troops are now

<HEADLINE> Regulator Warns of Fraud Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Retirees, recent immigrants and other  
investors are losing hundreds of millions of dollars as 
off-exchange currency fraud reaches ``epidemic proportions,'' the 
outgoing chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
warned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooksley Born, in a speech before futures and options industry  
participants, urged Congress to give her agency authority to 
regulate the estimated $70 trillion over-the-counter derivatives 
market, calling a current lack of supervision dangerous to the U.S. 
and world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Institutional supervisors focus on the tree; market regulators  
see the forest,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress should provide ``clear and unequivocal enforcement  
authority to pursue off-exchange foreign currency fraud imposed on 
the retail public, which has reached epidemic proportions,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have indicated they intend to undertake a  
comprehensive review of the Commodity Exchange Act as they decide 
whether to reauthorize the CFTC by Sept. 30, 2000. Currently, 
foreign currency trades are exempted from most oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Born, who is scheduled to step down at the end of her term on  
April 13, has for years urged lawmakers to give the commission the 
same policing powers it has over the U.S. futures and options 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission have argued  
they should control oversight of over-the-counter markets, while 
those firms have argued their self-policing activities should be 
enough to prevent fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	But Born said ``bucketshops'' operating in New York, Washington,  
D.C., Florida, Arizona, Nevada and California have fleeced 
thousands out of their retirement money by promising to invest it 
in foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they put the money in offshore accounts where it cannot  
be recovered and have virtually no fear of federal action, she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Mother Studied As Fire Killed Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A 17-year-old mother was working toward a  
high-school equivalency degree when her apartment caught fire, 
killing her infant son who was alone at home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and an official at the school where Tiffany Bennett was  
studying said she was taking classes to meet welfare requirements, 
a claim disputed by state welfare officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Melvin Rudolph III died of smoke inhalation Wednesday -- a week  
short of his first birthday -- in a second-floor bedroom of the 
apartment in suburban Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allegheny County coroner classified the death as accidental.  
The fire began in an electrical cord leading to a space heater, 
Deputy Fire Marshal Thomas Hitchings said. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother was at the Pittsburgh Job Corps Center. She left the  
boy home with the space heater on in the bedroom to keep him warm, 
police said. The child was not in a crib. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bennett was questioned but no decision on charges had been  
made Thursday afternoon, said Sgt. Lee Torbin, a county homicide 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was very much a preventable death,'' Fire Marshal Robert  
Full said. ``Earlier detection of the fire could have saved this 
baby's life. ... We know the baby was left unattended. We know it's 
a tragic loss of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bennett had performed well in classes toward her general  
equivalency degree, said Allen Crawford, the center's acting 
director. Classes, which run from 7:50 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily, 
were required so Ms. Bennett could receive benefits from the state 
Welfare Department, Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Department spokeswoman Mary Ellen Fritz said Ms. Bennett was not  
on the state's cash assistance program, and she added that the 
state provides child care for parents whom the program requires to 
attend vocational training or classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a case of welfare reform gone astray. In no way  
was this woman required to go to school as part of a 
cash-assistance program. This is something she chose to do,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A smoke alarm outside Ms. Bennett's apartment did not have a  
battery. Her landlord, Al Smith, said he tested the smoke alarm 
when Ms. Bennett moved in January. He said she had not told him 
about the dead battery since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Diane Green smelled smoke, heard a first-floor smoke  
alarm, called an emergency dispatcher and pounded on the door. She 
fled after getting no response.

<HEADLINE> 'Via Dolorosa' Is Masterful Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most playwrights reveal themselves through their  
work. David Hare is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	But the British writer, author of ``Plenty,'' ``Racing Demon,''  
``Skylight'' and other works, has done one better. He has put 
himself on stage in ``Via Dolorosa,'' a masterful meditative 
monologue on his 1997 visit to Israel and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a fascinating journey, not only for what it reveals about  
Hare, but for what it says about a situation that has defied 
solutions for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
	At Broadway's Booth Theater, Hare paints his picture from scores  
of interviews with Jews and Palestinians alike. It is a fragmented, 
often surreal portrait, made up of contradicting ideas hurled at 
him with a ferocity that could make one despair for any resolution 
of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Hare, a gangly gentleman casually dressed in a  
white shirt and charcoal gray slacks, is no actor. ``I've always 
tried to get Judi Dench to do this sort of thing,'' he says of the 
profession he abandoned at age 15 after a school production of ``A 
Man for All Seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his slow, almost stiff delivery contributes to the  
effectiveness of the evening. His speech is deliberate, carefully 
measured as he moves across the nearly barren stage of the Booth, 
which is filled only with a wooden playing area, two desks and two 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The author reveals that he finally has discovered the subject of  
his many plays (there are more than a score). Faith, the need for 
belief, dominates most of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israel is, first and foremost, a cause ... the cause being a  
patch of land ... lying like a small brown anchovy set down on a 
school atlas,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause has created intractable conflict, battles that are  
championed by an astonishing parade of characters in ``Via 
Dolorosa.'' The author re-creates some vivid interviews in his 
90-minute lecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Hare starts in Israel, visiting settlers in Hebron, a Jewish  
settlement surrounded by Arabs. He stays with Danny and Sarah 
Weiss, American Jews who came to Israel to reconnect with their 
spiritual values. As for their living on disputed land, Danny 
contends Israel must have roots. ``It has to be the place where 
life goes right down deep into the soil,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	That soil is claimed just as defiantly by the Palestinians,  
although there are as many shades of opinion among the Arabs as 
there are in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider Abdel Shafi, the most popular politician in Gaza,  
declares, ``Our most urgent task is to reform ourselves.'' Shafi 
laments the lack of principles in his society and criticizes Yasser 
Arafat for being ``a man who buys peoples' allegiance,'' creating a 
corrupt society. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone has an opinion, including Hare who celebrates the  
argumentative environments in which he finds himself. He discovers 
joy in the fact that people stand for something, unlike folks in 
his own country. 
</P>
<P>
	Hare chides British Prime Minister Tony Blair for being ``all  
things to all men'' and thus not letting people know what he really 
stands for. 
</P>
<P>
	The title of the evening comes from Hare's need to walk the Via  
Dolorosa in Jerusalem, ``to follow the Stations of the Cross, which 
represent the steps on Christ's journey to his death.'' The 
playwright is bewildered by the narrow unimpressive walkway, its 
postcard shops and the hordes of ``American evangelicals dressed in 
shell suits and baseball caps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wants more, but gradually realizes it is not the stones that  
are important but the ideas they represent that matter, ideas that 
have led to the life-and-death struggle in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Hare has become something of a growth industry on Broadway. Last  
year, New York saw ``The Judas Kiss,'' the author's drama about 
Oscar Wilde starring Liam Neeson. Earlier this season, Nicole 
Kidman, riding waves of publicity, sold out in ``The Blue Room.'' 
Next month could be the best of all, Dench, returning to Broadway 
after more than 30 years, in ``Amy's View.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, we have the playwright in the flesh, courtesy of  
Lincoln Center Theater. ``Via Dolorosa'' makes a plea for 
understanding or, at the least, attempting to understand. It is a 
lively, literate evening that like the rest of Hare's plays, 
celebrates belief, even if no agreement is in sight on what belief 
is the one true faith.

<HEADLINE>  Terrapins, Red Storm Go High-Octane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Coach Mike Jarvis wants the St. John's  
Red Storm to enjoy what he calls a fantastic voyage. For Maryland, 
taking in the sights just won't do anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins are in the round of 16 for the fourth time in six  
years. Getting this far is no longer a thrill for a program that 
hasn't been to a regional championship game since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the focus is reaching the first Final Four in Maryland's  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maryland definitely is on the cusp of greatness this year,''  
senior Laron Profit said. ``We feel this is our opportunity. There 
is a sense of urgency, not only for Maryland basketball, but we're 
being selfish. This is our last time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this is our opportunity to go out and do well and win  
and be remembered in Maryland as the team that got us there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second-seeded Terrapins (28-5), who already have the most  
wins in school history, must get past third-seeded St. John's 
(27-8) tonight in the first South Regional semifinal at 
Thompson-Boling Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Auburn plays No. 4 Ohio State in the second game.  
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis is trying to pass along some of the excitement of playing  
in the semifinals in his first year coaching the Red Storm. He 
knows how fleeting success can be since he took George Washington 
to a regional semifinal in 1993, only to fall short three other 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I asked them to do ... is no matter how much they  
want to win a game and no matter how far they want to go, to enjoy 
the experience and have some fun because these things don't happen 
very often for many people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans could have the most fun from a semifinal that features two  
teams that love to push the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm can nearly match Maryland, the nation's  
fifth-highest scoring team this season with an 85.6 average, 
point-for-point on offense. Jarvis has five starters scoring in 
double figures, with the Red Storm averaging 79.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Williams, one victory short of 400 for his career, said he  
hopes both teams play at the level that got them to the round of 
16. But he won't be picky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take an ugly game ... if we win,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins are used to being quicker than most opponents, an  
advantage they won't have against St. John's. Williams said 
preparation will be the key, but that doesn't mean major changes 
for Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out and play Maryland basketball,'' Maryland  
guard Terrell Stokes said. ``That's what got us 28 wins, so I don't 
think we should change anything at this point of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland basketball this season has meant defense as much as  
balanced offense. The Terrapins already have a school-record 423 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm has shown some versatility in the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	St. John's, making its first appearance in the round of 16 since  
1991, switched from its preferred man-to-man defense to a zone 
against Indiana, despite the players' reservations. The result was 
an 86-61 victory, the worst tournament loss in Indiana's history. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his Red Storm will need to play with the same kind of  
discipline to keep up with Maryland and contain Steve Francis (17.2 
points). That doesn't mean playing tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage of the game, unless you're Duke, you better play  
attack and you better play disciplined; otherwise, you're going 
home,'' Jarvis said.

<HEADLINE> Dow 10k Party Will Have To Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The party hats will have to wait for another  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	A gleeful celebration was cut short at the New York Stock  
Exchange Thursday as the Dow Jones industrial average edged past 
the 10,000-point mark -- again -- just as the closing bell was rung, 
then dipped below as late trades were settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior exchange officials cheered from an observation platform  
above the trading floor as a retiring member of the exchange, 
William Schnurr, slammed the final gavel together with Peter Kann, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Dow Jones &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Kann and NYSE Chairman Richard A. Grasso began flinging out blue  
baseball caps emblazoned with the words ``Dow 10,000'' as it 
appeared that the market's best-known indicator would close above 
the historic benchmark just two days after piercing it for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	But they stopped just seconds later as the ticker board  
indicated that the average was falling below the magic number, 
ending at 9,997.62, up 118.21 points on the day and less than three 
points shy of the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more than a close call -- we were there,'' said Robert  
B. Fagenson, vice chairman of the exchange and a managing director 
of a specialist firm. ``But then it ticked back. It just gives us 
an a opportunity to do it again tommorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange had prepared thousands of the hats to give away on  
the day that the average closed above 10,000, and several officials 
were standing at the ready Thursday with bags of the hats on the 
trading floor just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Grasso and Kann on the platform above, the officials began  
handing out the hats as the closing bell was rung, but then stopped 
again just a minute later as the indicator dipped back below 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, well.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are plenty more hats,'' Fagenson said.

</P>
<P>
	He said his Red Storm will need to play with the same kind of  
discipline to keep up with Maryland and contain Steve Francis (17.2 
points). That doesn't mean playing tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage of the game, unless you're Duke, you better play  
attack and you better play disciplined; otherwise, you're going 
home,'' Jarvis said.

<HEADLINE> Recession, Austerity Hits Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The row of single mothers straggled out of  
the small Quito garment factory. They had come to sew shirts, but 
there were no orders to fill. Rows of aging sewing machines on 
chipped school desks sat idle. 
</P>
<P>
	Since President Jamil Mahuad socked Ecuadoreans with a harsh  
austerity package last week, the number of orders Martha Vallejos' 
small garment factory receives has fallen from 400 a week to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand has died. Nobody has money. I no longer dream of  
profit, only surviving the crisis,'' said Vallejos, who employs 30 
women, all single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	From small businesses to large textile factories, Ecuadorean  
industry is being choked by harsh austerity measures, partially 
frozen bank accounts and a collapsing currency, the sucre. 
</P>
<P>
	Most damaging to businesses was the government's decision to  
freeze all dollar checking accounts over $500 for one year, and 
most sucre accounts for six months to a year to protect a run on 
deposits in Ecuador's shaky banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also doubled gas prices, setting off a strike by  
bus and taxi drivers who paralyzed the country for three days, 
blocking roads with taxis and burning tires. Factories could not 
distribute their goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests diminished Thursday after Mahuad revoked the gas  
price increase in exchange for promises from leftist and 
center-left legislators to pass tax increases needed to ease a 
massive budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Vallejo had $10,000 frozen by the measure for a year -- money  
earmarked for workers' wages and to pay a button supplier. She is 
now trying to negotiate a solution with her bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Texsa S.A. on Quito's southern outskirts employs 150 workers to  
make acrylic yarn. Texsa president Monica Sevilla said 50 percent 
of her company's working capital has been frozen for a year. All 
Ecuador's textile companies are in the same boat, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have to cut our costs to a minimum. Forget buying new  
machinery, investing or upgrading. This has been a brutal blow to 
the industry,'' she said. ``We have enough money to pay workers 
their 15-day salaries but suppliers will have to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of Texsa's buyers also had money frozen, and have  
canceled orders, causing the company's yarn sales to fall by half 
in the past week, Sevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	The austerity measures, which also promise to bring higher  
taxes, come on top of a deep recession in Ecuador sparked by $2.6 
billion in damage by El Nino's floods last year and falling world 
prices for oil, its major export. 
</P>
<P>
	The sucre has lost more than 40 percent of its value this year  
and importing costs have soared. Economic growth fell to 0.7 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Mahuad ended fuel subsidies, causing the price of  
electricity to rise by 400 percent which has hurt Ecuadoreans' 
pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of all this, Ecuadoreans have little money with  
which to buy products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on the verge of a quasi-collapse of the small business  
sector due to these measures,'' said Raul Mendizabal, director of 
Quito's Small Business Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks will pay 40 percent interest on frozen sucre bank  
accounts, but with inflation at 50 percent and expected to rise, 
businesses fear that the freeze on bank accounts will decimate 
their savings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a year, we could receive a fraction what we started out  
with,'' Sevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders recognize that the crisis is a product of years  
of mismanagement by governments that has left Ecuador with a 
bloated bureaucracy, protected, inefficient industries and a 
massive budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this helps us dig ourselves out of this whole, ''  
Sevilla said. ``Because we are suffering a lot of pain.''

<HEADLINE> Unions Lose Case Vs. Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- The embattled tobacco industry has picked up  
a big win in federal court, with jurors rejecting a $2 billion 
lawsuit accusing cigarette makers of unfairly targeting blue-collar 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury sifted through three weeks of testimony and thousands  
of documents before concluding Thursday that the tobacco industry 
hadn't concealed the dangers of smoking from the public since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``This jury's verdict should send a loud message that these  
lawsuits have no factual basis,'' said Gregory Little, a lawyer for 
Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action lawsuit was brought by 114 Ohio union health  
funds in an attempt to recoup the costs of treating workers' 
smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first of at least 14 such lawsuits around the nation  
to go to trial. Two similar lawsuits are set to go to jury trials 
this year in Washington and New York, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Coughlin, attorney for the union health funds, said he  
was disappointed by the jury, which deliberated for two days before 
ruling for the tobacco industry on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to understand how somebody could look at all that  
activity and then say that's all right or that didn't impact 
millions and millions of people,'' he said. ``It's tough to lose 
this case, but there will be more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several similar cases have been thrown out around the country,  
with some judges saying the unions have no legal standing unless 
they file separate lawsuits on behalf of every smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry came to a $206 billion legal settlement  
with states in November, but cigarette makers still face 
class-action lawsuits and individual lawsuits by smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has been ordered to pay damages in only four  
liability cases brought by smokers, and three verdicts were thrown 
out on appeal. The fourth, a $51.5 million award last month for a 
former three-pack-a-day smoker in California, is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough is enough. It's time to stop kicking the tobacco  
industry. Smokers make their own choices in they way they choose 
their lifestyles,'' said Robert Weber, a lawyer for R.J. Reynolds, 
another defendant in the Ohio case. 
</P>
<P>
	The health funds were led by Iron Workers Local Union No. 17  
Insurance Fund, which brought the case in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry was accused by the health funds of using  
promotional gimmicks and images such as Joe Camel and the Marlboro 
Man, ``aware that people with lower incomes and less education are 
more susceptible to the advertising,'' said Mike Withey, lead 
attorney for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco companies contended there was nothing illegal about  
their ad campaigns and disputed the idea that blue-workers were 
more likely to be swayed by them. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett Group chief executive Bennett LeBow testified during  
that trial how he broke ranks with other companies by admitting 
publicly that nicotine is addictive, smoking causes cancer and 
cigarette makers target adolescents with their advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett was dropped as a defendant in the lawsuit after the  
company settled out of court and agreed to testify for the 
prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Funds Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With little support for renewing the  
independent counsel law, Democrats who once favored the statute 
want not only to let it expire but also to cut off money this year 
for Kenneth Starr and other outside investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic amendment by Sens. Robert Torricelli of New  
Jersey and Tom Harkin of Iowa would shift the investigations to the 
Justice Department at the end of the year. But with no Republican 
sponsors, it has little chance of being approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about restoring confidence in those investigations,''  
Torricelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to give them six months to get their stuff together  
and turn it over to the Justice Department,'' Harkin added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic measure would cut off federal money for Starr's  
investigation of President Clinton and for four other independent 
counsels on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senior Republican officials who demanded anonymity said  
there was no desire among Senate GOP leaders to change and renew 
the law when it expires June 30, despite a push by a small group of 
moderate senators of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Simply allowing the law to expire as scheduled would permit  
Starr and other special prosecutors to continue their 
investigations until they are finished. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a draft of their bill, the Democratic sponsors  
would cut off federal funding of investigations by independent 
counsels appointed before June 30, 1996, which would include Starr, 
who still has several areas of unfinished business relating to the 
Clinton investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not our intention by ending these appropriations to end  
these investigations,'' Torricelli said. ``They should continue 
professionally and thoroughly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, battered by Starr's five-year probe, and others in his  
administration who once supported the independent counsel law have 
joined Republicans in advocating its death. Attorney General Janet 
Reno on Wednesday became the latest member of the administration to 
advise Congress to let the Justice Department handle probes of 
high-level officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though she was arguing a position widely held among  
lawmakers in both parties, Reno met with skepticism Wednesday from 
Republican senators who believe the Justice Department can't 
investigate members of its own administration with credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	'' If you appoint a special counsel, as long as you are the  
appointing authority, isn't there at least a perception of a 
conflict of interest that is harmful to public confidence?'' asked 
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I have come face to face with, senator, is that the  
conflict exists in the act now,'' replied Reno, who has been 
accused of protecting Clinton in her decisions on whether to seek 
outside probes. 
</P>
<P>
	Having seen the statute's structure ``probably closer up than  
anybody in American history,'' Reno told the Senate panel she has 
given up looking for ways to fix the statute -- and the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the attorney general from the independent counsel  
process would be unconstitutional, she said, so the Justice 
Department is the right place for such probes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't figure out how to avoid a conflict and still have  
constitutional muster,'' she told Collins. Having the Justice 
Department conduct such probes would be an imperfect system, Reno 
allowed. But, she added, ``It can't get any worse, senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of the panel took issue with that statement,  
pointing out the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' in which President 
Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating 
the Watergate scandal. That incident inspired the independent 
counsel law.

<HEADLINE> Starr Witness Is Subpoenaed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Attempting to put Kenneth Starr's  
tactics on trial, lawyers for Susan McDougal reached an agreement 
today to question the Whitewater prosecutor's top deputy on the 
witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Independent Counsel Hickman Ewing was served a subpoena  
Wednesday at the back of the courtroom where Mrs. McDougal is on 
trial for refusing to answer questions before Starr's grand jury 
investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors raised questions today about what Ewing would be  
asked but agreed not to fight the subpoena after the judge ordered 
Mrs. McDougal's team to provide more details about the planned 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The questioning will be limited pretty much to the  
investigation of Susan McDougal,'' prosecutor Mark Barrett said. 
After talking to defense lawyers, ``We think we all are on the same 
page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulations require that the defense disclose ahead of  
time what information is being sought when a U.S. attorney is 
called as a witness, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, contends she refused to  
answer grand jury questions because she felt prosecutors were 
pressuring her to give false testimony against President and Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos also says prosecutors withheld information from the  
grand jurors who indicted Mrs. McDougal that would have decreased 
the credibility of other witnesses, including Mrs. McDougal's 
former husband, James. 
</P>
<P>
	She is charged with criminal contempt and obstruction of  
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal wrangling came as Mrs. McDougal's lawyers prepared to  
call their first witnesses, beginning with Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution rested its case after seven days, ending this  
morning with testimony from an Arkansas banker, Ron Proctor, who 
dealt with the original loan for the Whitewater land development. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ewing watched from the rear of the courtroom as  
the prosecution closed its case by summoning three former members 
of the Whitewater grand jury before whom Mrs. McDougal had refused 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the day, Bill Henley, Mrs. McDougal's brother,  
reached through a crowd of reporters and handed Ewing a subpoena, 
saying, ``Hick, I've got something for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt really good,'' Bill Henley said a few moments later.  
``It's about time we got to ask them a few questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos would not rule out summoning Starr as well. ``First let  
me deal with Hick Ewing,'' he said. ``One at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making a prosecutor a defense witness was the second unusual  
turn of the day. The first was putting on the witness stand three 
members of the grand jury that indicted Mrs. McDougal after she 
refused to answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said that in 25 years as a federal prosecutor he had never  
seen grand jurors testify at a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jury foreman John Washam testified that the death of Mrs.  
McDougal's former husband, James McDougal, in 1998 made her 
testimony even more crucial than it had been before. 
</P>
<P>
	With his death, ``one link of the chain was gone'' of people who  
knew what went on in Whitewater, said Washam. McDougal had been 
Starr's chief cooperating witness in his investigation of the 
Whitewater land deal in which the Clintons and McDougals were 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos focused on the fact that Starr's office didn't tell  
grand jurors James McDougal had changed his story a number of 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't you have wanted to hear that?'' Geragos asked grand  
juror Marsha High. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' she responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Geragos argues that his client didn't want to answer questions  
because overzealous prosecutors were trying to force her to give 
false testimony against the president and first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Federated Completes Fingerhut Buy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Federated Department Stores Inc. said Thursday  
it has completed a $1.7 billion purchase of Fingerhut Cos. Inc., 
strengthening the retailer's ability to reach shoppers through 
catalogs and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based parent company of such retail chains as  
Bloomingdale's and Macy's is paying $300 million in cash and 
assuming $1.4 billion in debt in the deal, Federated spokeswoman 
Carol Sanger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated is looking to benefit from Fingerhut's expertise in  
handling orders through catalogs and the Internet, in addition to 
database management and direct marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated already operates the direct-mail catalogs  
Bloomingdale's By Mail and a Macys.com Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Dayton Hudson Corp., another large department store  
chain, purchased direct-seller Rivertown Trading Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Fingerhut's core catalog generates most of the company's roughly  
$2 billion in annual sales. It also has a food and gift catalog 
called Figi's; the apparel catalogs named Arizona Mail Order and 
Bedford Fair; and a membership-based general merchandise catalog 
named Popular Club. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its own Web sites, Fingerhut has minority  
interests in four electronic-commerce companies: PC Flowers &AMP; 
Gifts; FreeShop.com; The Zone Network, parent of mountainzone.com; 
and Roxy Systems, an Internet marketer of digital communications 
and entertainment services. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated has annual sales of more than $15.8 billion. The  
retailer operates more than 400 department stores in 33 states 
under the names Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdines, 
Goldsmith's, Lazarus, Macy's, Rich's and Stern's.

<HEADLINE> Airlines React to Passenger Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline officials, responding to legislation  
that would give passengers greater rights, said Thursday they are 
moving on their own to improve service and don't need new laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Driscoll, president of the National Air Carrier  
Association, told the House Transportation aviation subcommittee 
that the legislation will hurt small carriers that lack the 
resources to meet the requirements of the proposed bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in both the House and the Senate, as well as the White  
House, have introduced ``passenger bill of rights'' bills that 
would require airlines to provide their customers more information 
about delays, bumping and pricing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Committee last week heard from passengers  
with stories of mistreatment and neglect at the hands of airlines. 
The hearing Thursday gave the airlines a chance to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	One concern was that they would be penalized for delays and  
cancellations that are out of their control. Robert Warren, senior 
vice president of the Air Transport Association of America, also 
denied that airlines cancel flights with few passengers. ``Flights 
are not canceled because that flight will not turn a profit,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren, answering complaints about the failure of airlines to  
keep passengers informed of flight changes, said employees many 
times are not aware of a changing situation but are trained to 
provide information to the best of their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect everyone would rather airlines exercise delays in  
order to be safe rather than sorry,'' said Andrew Card, former 
transportation secretary, who now represents the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	A pilot for Northwest Airlines, which was criticized for keeping  
passengers in planes sitting on runways for hours during a 
snowstorm in Detroit in January, also pointed to the need for 
airports to improve their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Joseph Gilroy said infrastructure improvements are crucial  
to avoiding a repeat of the problems arising out of the Detroit 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren said airlines have taken the views of Congress into  
account and have reaffirmed their commitment to customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y., said the legislation would serve  
as a wake-up call to airlines needing to operate more efficiently 
and show more respect for consumers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, an independent federal agency released a report  
Thursday concluding that people with disabilities still face 
difficulties when traveling by air and the Transportation 
Department lacks the clout to enforce existing access rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``People with disabilities continue to encounter frequent,  
significant violations of their civil rights,'' said Marca Bristo, 
head of the National Council on Disability, at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 was supposed to guarantee the  
flying rights of the disabled, but the report said the 
Transportation Department lacks the staff and funds to enforce the 
law or investigate complaints of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing at the news conference were a wheelchair-user who said  
she was refused a wheelchair to go to the restroom during a flight, 
a visually impaired woman who spoke of her cane being taken away 
and a deaf man who said he had been given directions written in 
Braille. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, in a letter to the  
council, said a passenger rights bill drafted by the administration 
would make it easier for the disabled to sue airlines over civil 
rights violations, give the department the authority and resources 
to pursue civil rights cases and make foreign airlines flying in 
the United States subject to the 1986 law.

<HEADLINE> Basket Maker Dies of Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, Ohio (AP) -- David Longaberger, who developed his  
family's basket weaving tradition into a $700 million-a-year 
business bearing his name, has died of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Longaberger, who had been battling kidney cancer for nearly two  
years, died Wednesday at his central Ohio farm. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded The Longaberger Co. in 1973 with five weavers. Today  
the company employs more than 7,000 people and 47,000 independent 
sales associates who sold 8.3 million baskets in 1998. He had 
remained chairman of The Longaberger Co. during his illness, but 
promoted his daughter, Tami, as president and chief executive in 
July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Longaberger's father owned a basket company and taught all of  
his 12 children to make the baskets. But business waned as 
cardboard and paper sacks began to replace baskets and the business 
closed in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	David Longaberger owned a restaurant and grocery store in nearby  
Dresden, where he grew up, when he founded his company. In 1978, 
Longaberger decided to sell the baskets exclusively through home 
shows, which have since spread throughout the United States 
</P>
<P>
	Longaberger turned the 20-mile stretch between the corporate  
office and Dresden into a destination place for basket lovers, some 
of whom have bought so many that they had to add rooms to their 
homes. The baskets are popular collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
	Longaberger was an unlikely success story. He spent two years in  
the first grade and three years in the fifth. He stuttered so badly 
as a child that he took a job as a door-to-door salesman when he 
got out of high school to improve his speech.

	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Despite the arrival of weaker than  
expected economic data, European Central Bank policy-makers kept 
interest rates unchanged at 3 percent at their regular meeting 
Thursday.

<P>
	While the bankers did not act Thursday, many economists expect  
them to lower the key refinancing rate in the 11 nations that share 
the euro, the new single currency, to 2.75 percent later in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, a German think tank, the Ifo institute,  
reported that business confidence in western Germany was less 
optimistic in February than January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Munich-based Ifo tracks sentiment and prospects in the  
manufacturing, construction and wholesaling sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was the latest in a series of weak economic data that  
should persuade the central bank to lower rates, said Stefan 
Pelgrim, an analyst at Commerzbank. ``They're so weak that there's 
need to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, in its March monthly report released Wednesday, ruled  
out any near-term action, saying that the current economic picture 
did not suggest a need to change rates. The report noted that the 
outlook for inflation -- the bank's key monetary goal -- remained 
``favorable,'' and that the risks of rising prices were ``broadly 
unchanged on balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, all these factors argue in favor of an  
unchanged monetary policy stance,'' the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden resignation of German Finance Minister Oskar  
Lafontaine last week removed the main political proponent of 
lowering rates, diminishing any suggestion that a rate change would 
be politically influenced.

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble To Sell Online Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. and Bertelsmann AG plan to  
sell up to a 20 percent stake in their jointly owned online 
division, barnesandnoble.com, raising needed cash to go up against 
rival Amazon.com and other Internet booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble and Bertlesmann, a German book-publishing giant,  
each own half of barnesandnoble.com, the No. 2 online bookseller 
after Amazon.com. Each would own about 40 percent of the business 
after a public stock sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies did not say Thursday how much they hoped to raise  
or give other details. Barnes &AMP; Noble filed last September to take 
the online business public but shelved the plans after Bertlesmann 
bought a 50 percent stake in barnesandnoble.com for $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertlesmann will contribute $50 million to barnesandnoble.com  
after the stock is publicly offered, the remaining part of $100 
million it had pledged to contribute to the joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The online venture widened its operating loss to $84 million  
last year on net sales of $62 million, amid soaring marketing and 
sales costs, the filing said. That compared to a $14 million loss 
on $12 million in net sales in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, investors in Internet stocks focus more on potential  
growth than current losses of companies that are well-positioned to 
benefit from the explosion of Internet traffic and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The barnesandnoble.com business boosted its number of customers  
to 1.5 million last year and offered more than 8 million titles, up 
from 3 million the year before.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Ford Unit Suspends Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian subsidiary of Ford Motor  
Co. is suspending production for two weeks because of a scarcity of 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of difficulties in obtaining parts and components we  
will stop production between March 22 and April 5,'' a company 
spokeswoman said Thursday, refusing to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leader Alfredo Cavalcanti said Ford's troubles were due to  
the recent devaluation of the country's currency which has made 
imported parts more expensive. He did not know what percentage of 
the parts used by Ford were imported. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency, the real, has lost 35 percent of its value since  
it was devalued on Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavalcanti said that because of the lack of parts, Ford has been  
unable to complete about 3,000 unfinished vehicles at its plant in 
the industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo on the outskirts of 
Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford is negotiating with local auto parts suppliers who are  
also having trouble because of the devaluation'', Cavalcanti said. 
``Hopefully the situation will be normalized by April 5.''

<HEADLINE> Northwest Faces Flood Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pacific Northwest and the Red River area  
of North Dakota top the potential flood warning areas this spring, 
the National Weather Service reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, it looks like a relatively mild spring flood season is  
developing for most of the nation, Frank Richards, head of the 
National Weather Service's Hydrologic Information Center, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But, added Richards, ``One of the things I've learned in the  
time I've been a hydrometeorologist: Never trust Mother Nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Floods will occur this year in this nation,'' said John J.  
Kelly, director of the Weather Service. ``Now is the time to be 
thinking about what to do when the warning comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed out that every year floods claim 100-140 American  
lives and do an average of $4.5 billion in damage, accounting for 
three-quarters of presidential disaster declarations. 
</P>
<P>
	The area of greatest flooding potential is along North Dakota's  
Red River of the North, which suffered record floods in 1997, and 
Devil's Lake, N.D., said Richards. But the maximum expected crest 
is well short of the level reached two years ago and the primary 
threat is from Grand Forks north, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is greater than average potential this spring for  
flooding in Oregon and Washington east of the Cascades due to snow 
melt,'' he said, as well as in Idaho and adjacent streams in Oregon 
and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Richards said, ``Dryer than average conditions this  
spring may result in water concerns for Southern California, 
Arizona, New Mexico, southern Utah, western Texas and Hawaii.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly urged people not to be complacent, however. ``Every  
spring, short-lived downbursts cause flash floods. This type of 
rapid onset, localized flooding can even strike areas that are 
considered extremely dry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The nation's spring flood potential is consistent with a La  
Nina pattern,'' said Richards. La Nina, the climatic opposite of El 
Nino, is characterized by cooler than normal sea-surface 
temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean that impact global 
weather patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weather Service's annual spring flood forecast also  
reported: 
</P>
<P>
	--There is a slightly higher than normal flood potential in  
northern New England, where substantial snow cover is combined with 
higher than normal streamflows and wet soils in parts of Maine, New 
Hampshire and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	--Moist soil conditions make Kentucky and southern Indiana  
susceptible to flooding in the event of moderate or heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
	--Very wet conditions in western Washington and Oregon may be of  
some concern over the next several weeks, though the main threat is 
east of the Cascades. 
</P>
<P>
	--There are growing indications that flooding may be possible in  
the Klamath Basin of Oregon and California, but it is too early to 
draw firm conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Localized areas on the east slopes of the Sierra Nevada in  
Nevada and California may have some flood potential depending on 
the pattern of warming and amount of rainfall received.

<HEADLINE> Ford Recalls 887,000 Minivans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is recalling about 887,000  
Aerostar minivans from model years 1992 through 1997 to replace 
potentially defective electrical parts that could short-circuit and 
cause a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker said Thursday that in a small number of the vans  
the electrical load on the device that distributes power to the 
van's accessories may create a short, potentially resulting in 
overheating, smoke or a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also issued an additional recall for 29,000 Aerostars from  
model years 1994 and 1995 because of a potential problem with the 
electrical connection at the fuel pump. In some cases, the 
connection may develop a short circuit and cause a loss of power, 
smoke and possibly fire in the passenger area or under the van. 
</P>
<P>
	No reports of accidents or injuries have been attributed to  
either problem, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners will be notified by mail to take their vans to their  
dealer for the repairs at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford stopped production of the Aerostar in 1997 after it was  
replaced by the Windstar.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Has New Internet Explorer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is releasing a new version of  
its Internet Explorer software today that appears less integrated 
with the Windows operating system, making it easier to separate 
some Web navigation features from computer desktop functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the features in Internet Explorer 5.0 are  
inconsistent with Microsoft's steadfast contention in its antitrust 
battle that its Web browser is an essential part of the Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, in an ongoing suit, accuses Microsoft of using  
its dominance of the personal computer market to illegally force 
consumers who use Windows to also use its browser, dissuading them 
from using the popular Netscape Navigator browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 90 percent of the world's personal computers run on the  
Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly inconsistent with the proposition that Internet  
Explorer is inherently and always a distinct part of the operating 
system,'' said Jonathan Jacobson, an antitrust attorney with the 
New York law firm of Akin Gump. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft official rejected suggestions that the new Explorer  
is less closely integrated with Windows, reiterating the company's 
position that it merely gives consumers what they want. Shawn 
Sanford, product manager for Internet Explorer, said the underlying 
source code was still shared by the new browser and Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about integration you're talking about  
underlying (code),'' he said. ``Those processes are still as 
tightly integrated in IE 5.0 as they were in (the previous 
version).'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The new Internet Explorer offers a variety of minor improvements  
such as faster viewing of Web pages and a reduced tendency to 
``crash'' when retrieving Internet information. Another browser 
feature, a radio ``toolbar,'' lets users listen to radio stations 
over the Internet while they browse other sites. 
</P>
<P>
	When installed on computers running with Windows 95, users also  
will find fewer Web-related features meshed with desktop functions. 
Gone is Microsoft's ``Active Desktop,'' which makes files stored in 
the computer look and act like Web pages with links to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The new browser ``seems to be less ambitious in terms of  
integration compared to 4.0, which made itself part of the 
operating system,'' said Barry Parr, an analyst with International 
Data Corp., based in Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you originally installed 4.0, it became your desktop.  
Anytime it opened a file, it would open a browser window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 95 users who try to disable the new browser after  
installing will no longer see the process referred to as 
``uninstall.'' Instead, the computer says, ``restore previous 
Windows configuration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to say it's a Windows configuration and not a  
separate product,'' said Jim Rapoza, who tested the browser for the 
PC Week trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said the wording was changed because it more accurately  
reflected the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of Windows 98 machines, which build Web-related features  
into the desktop functions, won't see the same desktop changes as 
Windows 95 machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Yusuf Mehdi, the director of marketing for Internet Explorer,  
said that Microsoft is expected to release an upgrade of Windows 98 
by late summer or fall that will include Explorer 5.0 along with 
other new Internet technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Internet Connection Sharing, software that will  
allow consumers to run up to four different computers 
simultaneously over a single Internet access account. It is aimed 
at multiple computer families where parents and kids compete for 
Internet time, Mehdi said.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Bomb Probe Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The outside police chief  
charged with overseeing the probe into the assassination of a 
Catholic lawyer has arrived in Northern Ireland to begin work, amid 
cries for the province's predominantly Protestant force to 
completely sever itself from the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the family of Rosemary Nelson, killed earlier this  
week by a bomb rigged in her silver BMW, planned to bury her today 
in her hometown of Lurgan, 30 miles southwest of Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nelson, 40, successfully represented a number of  
high-profile Irish Republican Army suspects, including one charged 
with killing two police officers, and had a harassment complaint 
pending against the Royal Ulster Constabulary at the time of her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to public outrage, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the RUC's  
chief, took the unprecedented step of calling in an outside officer 
-- David Phillips, chief constable in the English county of Kent -- 
to supervise the murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips arrived Wednesday night to begin preliminary  
consultations. 
</P>
<P>
	An anti-Catholic terror group calling itself the Red Hand  
Defenders has claimed responsibility for Mrs. Nelson's death, which 
appeared to be aimed at ensuring the formation of Northern 
Ireland's new Protestant-Catholic coalition government remains 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	But many Catholics have called for the RUC to completely cede  
the investigation to outside authorities, accusing members of the 
force of colluding in her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups, too, have questioned the appropriateness of  
the RUC force playing a role in the hunt for her killers, 
especially after Mrs. Nelson said before her death that officers 
made a number of death threats against her. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation must be seen to be above reproach,'' said  
Maggie Beirne of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, a 
Belfast-based group. ``RUC officers will still be gathering 
forensic evidence and doing other front-line work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions have run high in Northern Ireland since Mrs. Nelson's  
death. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, several people were injured, including a  
police officer, when Protestants and Catholics clashed in 
Portadown, the town near Lurgan where Mrs. Nelson was representing 
Catholic residents in their contentious fight to block a Protestant 
march through their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Police responded to a barrage of Molotov cocktails and stones by  
firing plastic bullets in an attempt to quell the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a former leading member of the Red Hand Commando, a  
Protestant paramilitary group observing a cease-fire, was shot dead 
in west Belfast. The motive was not immediately clear, but 
authorities believed fellow Protestants were behind the killing.

<HEADLINE> Big Budget Films No Oscar Recipe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Advice to actresses with Academy Award  
ambitions: Stay out of the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence is there. Of the past six winners, only one -- Helen  
Hunt in last year's ``As Good As It Gets'' -- appeared in a 
big-budget film released by a major studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Take a look at the nominees for best actress of 1998. Only  
perennial nominee Meryl Streep starred in a major studio release, 
Universal's ``One True Thing,'' and it was modestly budgeted. Three 
of the other films were made independently in England, one came 
from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' for which Gwyneth Paltrow was  
nominated, was originally developed by Universal Pictures. Casting 
and other problems made the studio drop it, and Miramax Films 
snapped it up. Universal retained an interest in the film, which 
turned out to be an immense success. 
</P>
<P>
	A glance at the nominees for best actress in a leading role:  

</P>
<P>
                  	 *CATE BLANCHETT, ``Elizabeth''    	
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth I of England must be the most portrayed monarch in  
film history. Her filmography dates back to Sarah Bernhardt in the 
1912 ``Queen Elizabeth.'' Other Elizabeths have included Bette 
Davis (twice), Flora Robson (twice), Florence Eldridge, Agnes 
Moorehead, Jean Simmons and Glenda Jackson (in ``Mary, Queen of 
Scots'' and a TV series). 
</P>
<P>
	And now in the 1998 Academy nominations, a young Elizabeth, Cate  
Blanchett in ``Elizabeth,'' and an older one, Judi Dench in 
``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Geoffrey Rush, who portrays the queen's unscrupulous  
promoter, Miss Blanchett emerged from the Sydney theater, having 
graduated from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Arts in 
1992. After appearing in television dramas and a couple of feature 
films, she attracted international attention in Gillian Armstrong's 
``Oscar and Lucinda'' with Ralph Fiennes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Academy nominees luncheon, Miss Blanchett was asked how  
she managed to speak like an English queen. Her reply: ``I think 
the Australian sound sits between the English and the American. We 
have been so inundated by British and American television that we 
know what both accents sound like.'' 

</P>
<P>
             	 *FERNANDA MONTENEGRO, ``Central Station''    	
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian actress has charmed reporters with her effusive  
comments about her nomination: ``I'm not young, I'm not beautiful, 
but this is so exciting. ... I'm like a child, I play like a child. 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Montenegro is a veteran of the Brazilian stage and of  
Brazilian TV and films, having appeared in more than 50 plays and 
dozens of movies and soap operas. Among the titles: ``They Don't 
Wear Black Tie,'' ``Hour of the Star'' and ``See This Song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 71st Oscar nominations mark the first time two in the  
leading actor and actress categories gave non-English-speaking 
performances. Miss Montenegro spoke Portuguese in ``Central 
Station,'' Roberto Benigni Italian in ``Life Is Beautiful.'' Only 
one lead has won the Oscar in a foreign language: Sophia Loren in 
``Two Women'' in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Central Station,'' Miss Montenegro plays Dora, a woman who  
makes her living in an airport by writing letters for travelers. 
One of her clients is a woman with a small boy. When the woman is 
killed in a traffic accident, Dora forms a relationship with the 
boy. 

</P>
<P>
             	 *GWYNETH PALTROW, ``Shakespeare in Love''    	
</P>
<P>
	If ``Shakespeare in Love'' had stuck to plan, Julia Roberts  
would have played Viola, the playwright's fictional lover and 
inspiration for ``Romeo and Juliet.'' But two years ago the 
producers were stymied in their search for a young, romantic Will, 
and filming was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the film was reorganized, another American, Gwyneth  
Paltrow, was cast as Viola. ``She was our first choice,'' says 
producer Donna Gigliotti. ``I had done a picture with Gwyneth 
called 'Emma.' I had loved her since the first time I saw her at 16 
with her mom in the theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Los Angeles, Miss Paltrow grew up in movies and theater,  
her mother being the actress Blythe Danner, her father film 
producer Bruce Paltrow. As a teen-ager, she appeared with John 
Travolta in ``Shout.'' A chance meeting with Steven Spielberg led 
to her casting as Wendy in his grown-up version of Peter Pan, 
``Hook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an adult, she has appeared in ``A Perfect Murder'' opposite  
Michael Douglas, ``Seven'' with Brad Pitt, ``Great Expectations'' 
with Ethan Hawke and ``Jefferson in Paris'' with Nick Nolte. 

</P>
<P>
                 	 *MERYL STREEP, ``One True Thing''    	
</P>
<P>
	The question wasn't whether Meryl Streep would be nominated as  
best actress; it was which picture she would be cited for: ``One 
True Thing'' or ``Dancing at Lughnasa.'' The voters chose ``One 
True Thing,'' in which she plays a small-town housewife devoted to 
her home and club life. She faces death by cancer with the same 
orderliness she has insisted on in her married life. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the late 1970s, Miss Streep has been nominated 11 times,  
tying with Jack Nicholson (Katharine Hepburn holds the record with 
12). Her Oscars came for a supporting role in ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' 
in 1979 and lead in ``Sophie's Choice,'' 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Educated at Vassar College and the Yale Drama School, Miss  
Streep made her film debut as Jane Fonda's society friend in 
``Julia.'' Her second movie, ``The Deer Hunter,'' brought her first 
Oscar nomination as supporting actress. During the 1980s and 1990s 
she has reigned as the premier actress of American films. 

</P>
<P>
                	 *EMILY WATSON, ``Hilary and Jackie''    	
</P>
<P>
	Besides Meryl Streep, only Emily Watson has been nominated  
before among the best actress nominees -- for ``Breaking the Waves'' 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Watson plays the British cellist Jacqueline du Pre, whose  
brilliant career was ended by multiple sclerosis in 1987. The movie 
traces the often stormy relationship of du Pre and her older sister 
Hilary (played by Rachel Griffiths). It was based on the book by 
Hilary and her brother Piers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hilary and Jackie'' became engulfed in controversy when famed  
classical musicians, including violinists Itzhak Perlman and Yehudi 
Menuhin, wrote a letter to the London Times condemning the 
portrayal of their late colleague as ``selfish, spoiled and 
manipulative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the Jacqueline du Pre that we, as her friends and  
colleagues, knew,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	When Miss Watson appeared at the recent nominees luncheon, she  
dismissed the complaint as ``a spot of bother.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Torre Has Cancer Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre will spend a  
few days recuperating in a St. Louis hospital after surgeons 
successfully removed his cancerous prostate gland. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon who removed the gland, Dr. William Catalona, said  
Torre's prognosis is excellent, and the doctor believes the disease 
has not spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very routine,'' Catalona said Thursday. ``I think he  
had a very early prostate cancer and it went very smoothly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lab tests on the removed gland and surrounding lymph nodes won't  
be complete for a few days, but Catalona said, ``The way it looked 
to the naked eye, the prognosis is excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona, a pioneer in the detection and treatment of prostate  
cancer, said Torre's cancer was so small he couldn't see it even as 
he held the removed gland in his hand. It was diagnosed by the 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test that Catalona developed a 
decade ago, and confirmed by a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in  
American men and the second deadliest behind lung cancer. The 
walnut-sized gland is at the base of the bladder in men. Men 50 and 
older are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	In cases where cancer is confined to a removed prostate, the  
patient's prognosis is essentially as good as for a man who never 
had the disease, Catalona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, 58, underwent the 2 1/2-hour surgery at Barnes-Jewish  
Hospital, where he was expected to remain for 3-4 days. Torre will 
then recuperate in Florida, said Jeff Wehling, a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona pioneered a surgical technique known as nerve-sparing  
radical prostatectomy, which he used on Torre. The procedure 
generally results in fewer problems, including impotence, than 
conventional prostate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona said there appeared to be very little damage to the  
nerves surrounding Torre's prostate. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's wife, Ali, was ``ecstatic'' after learning about the  
successful surgery, Wehling said. She then called family members 
and acquaintances, including Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona said Torre seemed at ease prior the surgery, talking  
baseball and joking with doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very upbeat, cracking a lot of jokes -- he was really  
very amusing,'' Catalona said. ``I can see now why everybody likes 
him so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes-Jewish spokeswoman Kathryn Holleman said the hospital has  
received hundreds of calls from well-wishers. Wehling said Torre 
has also received numerous flowers and cards, many from St. 
Louisans who watched Torre when he played for, and later managed, 
the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's found greater success in New York, but the people in St.  
Louis still have incredibly fond memories,'' Wehling said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no timetable for Torre's return to the World Series  
champions, but Catalona said his patients typically go back to work 
6-12 weeks after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to encourage him not to go back too soon,'' Catalona  
said. ``He's got a very stressful job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was a four-time All-Star for the Cardinals, for whom he  
played from 1969 to 1974. He was the National League's Most 
Valuable Player award winner in 1971, when he hit .363 with 137 
runs batted in, both tops in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre managed the Cardinals from 1990, when he replaced Whitey  
Herzog, until he was fired in 1995. He earlier managed the Atlanta 
Braves and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona was recommended to Torre by former Yankees general  
manager Bob Watson, and by Cardinals Hall-of-Famer Stan Musial, 
hospital officials said. Catalona performed prostate cancer surgery 
on both men. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's cancer was diagnosed early because of an annual PSA  
exam, Catalona said. The problem was found during a checkup at the 
Yankees' spring training camp in Tampa, Fla., and announced last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're dealing with a tumor that doesn't let its presence be  
learned unless you're looking for it,'' Catalona said.

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Southwest Missouri State enters the  
East Regional semifinals with some impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12th-seeded Bears allowed their two opponents in the NCAA  
tournament an average of 41 points and the wins over fifth-seeded 
Wisconsin and fourth-seeded Tennessee were by a combined 41 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke enters the East Regional semifinals with some very  
impressive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-ranked Blue Devils won their first- and second-round  
games by an average of 41 points. Over the last 11 games, the 
average margin of victory has been 31 points and it stands at 26.3 
for the season. Duke has lost just one game this season and has won 
a school-record 29 straight games. The Blue Devils lead the nation 
in scoring at 93.6 points per game and their 51.7 shooting 
percentage is second best. 
</P>
<P>
	When the teams meet Friday night at Continental Airlines Arena  
before sixth-seeded Temple and 10th-seeded Purdue play in the other 
semifinal, the only numbers that matter will be on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are dominant,'' Southwest Missouri State coach Steve  
Alford said of Duke. ``We came here with a 20.5 winning margin and 
now I'm trying to figure out how to leave East Rutherford with a 
winning margin. There are a long list of underdogs who have been 
successful in the history of this tournament. But this is a whole 
new level, the number 1 team in the nation playing extremely 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (34-1) hasn't had anybody stay even close since St. John's  
lost 92-88 in overtime on Jan. 24. Since Feb. 11, only North 
Carolina State has been closer than 20 points and that was a 
15-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough task for us in that one, they are a very good  
basketball team and two, everybody has already said we're going to 
win,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``We have to make sure we 
focus on the actual game and not on what everyone else says. For 
the entire year our team has pretty much done that and will have to 
again. We haven't overlooked anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Missouri State (22-10) has been overlooked quite a  
bit. One of three teams from the Missouri Valley Conference to make 
the field of 64, the Bears don't have the name, the stars or the 
history to compete with Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're a great team, they've been a great team all  
year, the number one team in the polls,'' Bears junior guard Kevin 
Ault said. ``We just have to put all that behind us. There are 16 
teams left in the country and we're one of them and we have to play 
that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Missouri State held both Wisconsin and Tennessee to  
less than 30 percent shooting. Duke's worst outing of the season 
was 41 percent against North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Bears center Danny Moore was chosen first team in the Missouri  
Valley. Duke center Elton Brand was a unanimous first-team 
All-America selection while guard Trajan Langdon was voted to the 
second team and guard William Avery was an honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Southwest Missouri State's sixth appearance in the NCAA  
tournament and its second trip past the first round. Duke won 
consecutive national championships in 1991 and 1992 and have made 
five other Final Four appearances under Krzyzewski, whose 45 NCAA 
wins leave him only behind Dean Smith and John Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this is a great opportunity and a weekend where we  
could have some fun,'' Alford said. ``We are coming into this game 
to compete hard. Just as Duke has a mindset of winning, our mindset 
is of winning. You can't have any other mindset other than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Blue Devils, the first team to ever go 16-0 in the  
Atlantic Coast Conference, don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach has instilled the will to win in us, to play our hardest  
every time out,'' Brand said. ``We don't look at the name of the 
team we're playing. As long as Duke's playing, we're out there to 
play our best.''

<HEADLINE> Grains Lower; Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures were mostly lower and soybeans  
mixed in early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of overnight export business was supportive to soybeans,  
but generally the trade was uninspiring. Likewise, rumors of a 
last-minute acreage set-aside by the government this year was 
dismissed by most market participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell as traders digested news of low net export  
sales. Reports of problems with the Chinese winter wheat crop were 
supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn was mixed at the open after rallying Wednesday on news the  
United States may lift its ban on agricultural sales to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was off 2 1/4 cents to $2.75 1/2 a bushel; May  
corn was off 1/2 cent to $2.25 1/4 a bushel; May oats were unchanged at 
$1.11 1/2 a bushel; May soybeans were up 3/4 cent to $4.82 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle futures were mostly higher on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs and pork bellies were 
also higher. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures rose 0.38 cent to 67.25 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle were off 0.05 cent to 71.95 cents per pound; 
April lean hogs were up 0.65 cent to 41.62 cents a pound; and May 
pork bellies were up 0.43 cent to 50.90 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Seek Federal Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 100 independent oil and natural gas  
producers have fanned out across Washington this week, clamoring 
for federal help for an industry battered by low crude oil prices 
stemming from a worldwide glut. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond seeking tax relief and other legislative help, the  
marginal producers and their allies on Capitol Hill are calling on 
the Clinton administration to change its policies toward Iraq. 
Under a U.N. policy supported by the United States, Iraq is allowed 
to sell up to $10.4 billion of oil a year in order to purchase food 
and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is assembling a task force, to be headed by  
presidential economic adviser Gene Sperling, to examine the state 
of the oil industry and possible relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers have seen their industry shrink by 50,000  
jobs in the last year and seen more than 136,000 oil wells shut 
down since November 1997. They contend the oil-for-food program is 
serving mainly to aid Saddam Hussein while harming U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our rights are being violated by politicians taking care of  
the Middle East,'' complained Ruben Ramirez, a 34-year oil industry 
veteran from Kermit, Texas, who has been laid off amid the 
industry's current woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq can use $600 million a year  
to rebuild its oil infrastructure and drill new wells, adding to 
the current oversupply and potentially handing Iraq a tool to 
destabilize oil markets, producers said at a Capitol news 
conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to argue against ... some kind of relief for  
the Iraqi people,'' said New Mexico producer George Yates, chairman 
of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. ``But what 
we're saying is that the oil-for-food program is skewed. It is 
government at work, it is not the market at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before Senate committees Wednesday, Energy Secretary  
Bill Richardson said Iraq's 2.5 million barrel-a-day production has 
a negligible impact on U.S. oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But that view was dismissed by the chairman of the Senate Energy  
and Natural Resources Committee, Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska, 
who noted oil prices rose sharply when OPEC last week proposed 
production cuts of 2 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to recognize that old reality that charity begins at  
home,'' Murkowski said at Thursday's news conference, organized by 
IPAA. ``We've got to support our domestic petroleum industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IPAA, which represents thousands of marginal producers, is  
backing legislation that would provide tax credits and return 
inactive wells to production. IPAA members met Tuesday at the White 
House with Vice President Al Gore, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, 
Richardson and other top administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Marginal producers account for 20 percent of domestic production  
-- a large share for a nation that depends on foreign oil for more 
than half of its energy needs, the independents note. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message has to be that the administration will not let  
this industry collapse,'' Yates said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Army General Hale Is Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- A retired Army general who admitted to  
adulterous affairs with the wives of four subordinates has been 
reprimanded and fined -- and will not spend any time behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Maj. Gen. David Hale, 53, was ordered to pay a $10,000  
fine and forfeit $12,000 of his $75,744 annual pension for one 
year. He had faced up to 11 years in prison and prosecutors had 
wanted him jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, who tearfully apologized in court, did not meet with  
reporters after Wednesday's hearing. Donald Mancuso, the Defense 
Department official who oversaw the investigation, said the 
sentence was enough to send a warning to other officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high-profile cases ``do in fact cause officers to think  
twice,'' Mancuso said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was the highest-ranking Army officer to face court-martial  
since 1952. His case led to allegations the Pentagon had a double 
standard for dealing with sexual misconduct when it came to 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was allowed to retire with honor last year despite claims  
of improprieties he committed while he was a top NATO commander in 
southern Europe. The resulting furor led the Pentagon to change its 
rules to bar top officers from retiring while facing allegations of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale had faced up to 56 years in prison before prosecutors  
dropped nine charges in exchange for his guilty pleas to seven 
counts of conduct unbecoming an officer and one count of making 
false official statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's civilian lawyer, Frank Spinner, said his client was ``not  
pleading guilty to any non-consensual sexual offenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations concerned relationships Hale had from 1996 to  
1998 when he held the NATO post in Turkey. He and his wife 
separated in 1995 and divorced in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was forthright in admitting guilt.  
</P>
<P>
	He told of how he ordered two Caesar salads and a bottle of wine  
to a Connecticut hotel room, then had sex with Donnamaria Carpino 
Madden. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon afterward, the two shared a flight to Turkey, where they  
were met at the airport by Col. Everett Madden -- the woman's 
husband and Hale's chief of personnel and administration. Hale did 
not tell him of their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Court-martial judge Col. Stephen Saynisch asked whether that  
constituted unbecoming conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sir, it's an understatement,'' Hale replied, adding he was  
ashamed, embarrassed and unable to look the colonel in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Madden who sparked Mancuso's investigation with  
public complaints that Hale had forced her into a four-month sexual 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale testified that his life unraveled after his 29-year  
marriage ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I let my compassion overrule my sense of propriety,'' he said,  
describing gifts of money to help another subordinate's recently 
divorced wife rebuild her life. He had sex with her in a Las Vegas 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, he said, his relationships with the women overlapped,  
but maintained all intimate acts grew out of friendship. He 
socialized with the women in scuba diving clubs, bowling clubs and 
on shopping trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot express how sorry I am, how embarrassed I am, for the  
pain I have brought on the U.S. Army, my fellow soldiers and my 
family and friends,'' he said, reading from a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Maj. Michael Mulligan recommended a jail sentence  
``to send a message there is no difference ... between the lowliest 
private and a general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Spinner said the embarrassment was enough. And even Mrs.  
Madden -- who also has filed a civil action against the Army and Air 
Force officials, alleging they tried to discredit her in the 
investigation -- suggested the sentence was an adequate deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale ``is now forever a convicted felon and proven liar,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While some may debate whether the sentence appropriately  
matches the crimes, I am very pleased to see that not even a 
two-star general is above the law,'' Mrs. Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other case in which an Army general faced court-martial  
since Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1951 
was in 1952, when Maj. Gen. Robert Grow, military attache in 
Moscow, was tried on charges of dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	He was reprimanded and suspended from command for six months.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, then the Army's  
highest-ranking enlisted man, was reduced in rank and reprimanded 
after he was convicted of obstruction of justice in a sexual 
misconduct case. He was acquitted of 18 counts alleging sexual 
harassment of six military women. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, Air Force Lt. Kelly Flinn, the nation's first  
and only female B-52 pilot, was given a general discharge after 
being charged with adultery for having an affair with the husband 
of a female airman in North Dakota.

<HEADLINE> FDX Earnings Up; Stock To Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The parent company of Federal Express  
Corp. posted better-than-expected profits Thursday despite the drag 
of $90 million spent on preparing for a strike. FDX also announced 
a 2-for-1 stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	FDX earned $78 million, or 52 cents per share, in its third  
quarter ended Feb. 28, exceeding Wall Street forecasts by a wide 
margin. In the same period a year ago, FDX earned $18 million, or 
12 cents a share, including one-time acquisition costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues totaled $4.1 billion, a 3 percent  
increase from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong showing boosted FDX shares, which closed up $5.18 3/4,  
or 6 percent, to $98.12 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest earnings data reflects contingency expenses related  
to a threatened pilot walkout during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
	FDX spent $90 million leasing planes and crews from other  
companies in preparation. The strike was averted when negotiators 
for the two sides reached an agreement in early December. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time factors, per-share earnings for the  
just-ended quarter amounted to 87 cents, up from 65 cents in the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Express founder and chairman Frederick Smith said the  
company is benefiting with more businesses sending smaller 
shipments frequently to keep inventory down. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cited an increase in business-to-business electronic  
commerce and ``supply chain reengineering,'' which aims to move an 
order from manufacturer to customer quicker with fewer go-betweens. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDX board of directors authorized a stock split in which FDX  
investors of record on April 15 will receive two shares for every 
one they hold. The split will take effect on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx, based in Memphis, Tenn., is the world's largest cargo  
airline. It has 145,000 employees worldwide and ships more than 3 
million items to 211 countries each day.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets fell Thursday after a 3.3  
percent drop in the region's largest market, Tokyo, prompted 
investors elsewhere to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, shares fell after a strong rally this week that had  
propelled the blue chips to an eight-month high. The U.S. dollar 
was lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 550.19 points,  
or 3.38 percent, to finish the day at 15,717.92. On Wednesday, the 
average rose 1.22 percent -- its highest close since July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors bailed out after the Dow Jones industrial average  
fell overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in Japanese stocks among foreign investors remained

<HEADLINE> LA Tries To Get NFL Groups Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A day after NFL owners voted to give Los  
Angeles a new franchise, two competing groups were being urged to 
get together behind one proposal that would have the team play at a 
renovated Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Riordan was said to be trying to broker  
cooperation between the two investment groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coliseum is head and shoulders above any other venue,''  
Riordan said. ``We're going to have a team here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan has already talked to members of both camps and is  
setting up meetings intended to end competition, the Los Angeles 
Times reported today, citing sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our door is open,'' said Eli Broad, a leader in the coliseum  
bid said Wednesday. ``We'd be delighted to get together and talk 
about it. I would hope that we would end up with a unified bid 
behind the Coliseum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz, who heads the group  
backing a stadium in Carson, said it was too soon to determine if 
his group would be willing to give up its original plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to assess that right now,'' he said. ``We're  
thrilled that L.A. is in the running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL team owners voted 29-2 Tuesday to award Los Angeles the  
league's next expansion franchise. But they made it a conditional, 
six-month offer. If no acceptable stadium and franchise proposal is 
produced by Sept. 15, it's back to the drawing boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's group wants to build a new stadium in Carson, about 18  
miles south of downtown Los Angeles. The other group, led by real 
estate developer Ed Roski wants to overhaul the downtown Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic Johnson, one of Ovitz's partners, said Wednesday it may be  
time for his group to merge with the Coliseum effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's the Coliseum, I'm for that,'' he said. ``What I want  
is football, and it sounds like the Coliseum may be the way to get 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum appears to be the owners' choice, but with  
reservations. The main question they seem to have is how much 
money, especially public money, would be available for redoing the 
Coliseum and the area around it.

<HEADLINE> Investigator Sparks Amtrak Spat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the months after the deadly wreckage of  
Amtrak's City of New Orleans is cleared from the Illinois town 
where it slammed into a tractor-trailer, one of the top issues 
facing federal officials will be how to quickly get accurate 
passenger lists from a train crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief federal investigator into Monday night's deadly  
collision about 50 miles south of Chicago suggested Wednesday that 
new federal rules might be on the way to ensure railroads quickly 
and sensitively pass along information to families of disaster 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been conflicting reports of how many people were on  
board the fated train traveling from Chicago to New Orleans. Even 
the death count was revised down Wednesday by National 
Transportation Safety Board member John Goglia to 11 from 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is an issue we are going to look into,'' Goglia said in a  
news conference near the crash site in Bourbonnais, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB spokesman Jamie Finch said that though Amtrak has been  
working hard to get the most up-to-date passenger list possible, 
accurate manifests are particularly difficult for rail accidents 
because of trains' many entry and exit points. And that is exactly 
the reason that the NTSB may eventually recommend new regulations 
after it completes its evaluation of the Illinois crash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stricter requirements were enacted over the past three years for  
the aviation industry after complaints about how airlines treated 
families in the wake of plane crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation passed by Congress in 1996 and 1997 requires U.S.  
and foreign air carriers to develop plans for addressing the needs 
of plane crash victims and their families. New federal rules that 
took effect last fall also require next-of-kin information on all 
U.S. citizens on all international flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia also touched off a public squabble with Amtrak by  
accusing the passenger railroad of giving out conflicting passenger 
information that hampered efforts to determine whom had died and 
was still missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak denied it had been anything less than completely  
cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	And Goglia later backpedaled from his earlier criticism, saying  
in a statement issued at NTSB's headquarters here that he had met 
with Amtrak officials and was satisfied with its efforts to provide 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be inappropriate to leave the impression that Amtrak  
was failing in its duties to passengers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Goglia had told reporters he was ``very concerned''  
about how long it took Amtrak to get an accurate list of those on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a wide gulf between many of the documents provided us  
by Amtrak with how many passengers were on the (train) and how many 
are missing still today,'' he said. ``At this point, all that I can 
say is that all of that is unreliable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak spokeswoman Noreen Ellis reacted with surprise, saying  
Amtrak had worked ``around the clock'' to give the NTSB accurate 
and extensive information. By Wednesday night all 216 people aboard 
the train had been accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the passenger rail line said, ``In response to a  
public comment from an NTSB official, Amtrak has made an official 
request for clarification about what further information may be 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak also said it is trying to help passengers and families of  
those on the train by assigning two company representatives to each 
victim's family, paying for relatives' travel expenses and 
providing grief counselors.

<HEADLINE> Census Measures Head to Full House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local officials would get to review and  
challenge census figures under a Republican bill headed to the full 
House under threat of a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argue that the bill and six other census measures  
that were approved by the House Government Reform Committee on 
Wednesday would help to reduce the inaccuracies that plagued the 
1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
	That count, which missed 8.4 million people and counted 4.4  
million people twice, was the first to be less accurate than the 
one before it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats insisted that the proposals will just cause  
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley, whose department oversees the  
count, also said this week that three of the bills actually ``would 
reduce the accuracy and seriously disrupt the schedule of Census 
2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this legislation were presented to the president, I would  
recommend that he veto it,'' Daley wrote in a letter Tuesday to 
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the committee's senior Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which advanced on a 23-21 vote, would let local  
officials review and challenge the census figures before they are 
finalized. A similar program was dropped after the 1990 count and 
the Census Bureau says the current plan already relies on input 
from local officials before the census begins on April 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few thousand people might not make a difference in  
Washington but they make a huge difference in smaller local 
communities,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., the bill's sponsor and 
chairman of the committee's census panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Census officials had planned to use a scientific method known as  
``statistical sampling'' to improve next year's count but 
Republicans objected. 
</P>
<P>
	The census figure is calculated every 10 years and is used to  
redistribute the 435 seats in the House and dole out federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insisted on the ``enumeration'' outlined in the  
Constitution and have suggested that a number produced by sampling 
could be manipulated to shift House seats and federal aid to 
Democratic-leaning areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argue that sampling would produce a more accurate  
count. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans went to court and the Supreme Court ruled in January  
that sampling is unconstitutional for the purpose of redistributing 
House seats. But the high court said the law requires it for other 
purposes, such as giving out financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau director, subsequently  
announced the census would use two counts. One will be based on the 
traditional method of door-to-door counting and be used to 
determine how many House seats each state gets; the other will use 
sampling to find people missed during the first count and produce 
what officials say will be a more accurate census. 
</P>
<P>
	The process involves mailing questionnaires to some 100 million  
households and then sending workers to find those who fail to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also object to the two-track plan, which Miller  
described as ``an absolute disaster. It's terrible public policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., a sampling advocate, said  
Republican attempts to ``micromanage'' the census would cause 
breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The professionals at the Census Bureau cannot conduct the best  
census possible if Congress is in their way,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other census bills approved by the committee but facing a  
veto would require census forms to be printed in 34 languages and 
mandate a second mailing of census forms. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining bills the committee passed would allow welfare  
recipients to work as temporary census employees without losing 
benefits; provide $26 million in grants to municipalities and 
tribal governments to promote the census; authorize $300 million 
next year for Census Bureau advertising; and expand a program for 
promoting the census in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are HR 472; HR 683; HR 928; HR 929; HR 1009; HR 1010;  
and HR 1058.

<HEADLINE> White House Attacks GOP Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and the White House traded charges  
over Social Security and tax cuts as the GOP pushed a $1.74 
trillion budget for fiscal 2000 through the Senate Budget 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., shoved the package through his  
committee by an 11-9 party-line roll call vote on Thursday after 
spending two days beating back Democratic attempts to kill or 
shrink GOP tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a similar version the House Budget Committee approved on  
Wednesday, the Senate measure pledges to cut taxes by $778 billion 
over 10 years and provide more money for schools and defense while 
heeding required spending limits. It would also use Social Security 
surpluses to trim the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our priorities are very good in this budget,'' Domenici said  
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before its passage, though, Vice President Al Gore accused  
the GOP of resorting to ``Republican retronomics'' resembling 
President Reagan's budgets of the 1980s, which he said ``created 
the deepest recession since the Great Depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have said Republicans would do nothing to reinforce  
Social Security and Medicare for the baby boomers' retirements and 
would bestow overly large tax cuts and force deep spending cuts -- 
all the while imperiling the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican plan puts risky tax schemes first and Social  
Security last,'' Gore told black newspaper publishers visiting the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said it was President Clinton, who would give  
Treasury bonds to the Social Security trust funds, who was not 
helping that program or Medicare. By proposing to reserve 77 
percent of surpluses over the next 15 years for those two programs, 
the president was merely trying to prevent Republicans from cutting 
taxes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has handed over the budget situation to the next  
election,'' Domenici told reporters. ``Instead of trying to get 
things done, they're trying to electioneer for Vice President Gore 
already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional budget provides lawmakers with overall tax and  
spending limits for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, but leaves 
decisions on specifics for future bills. It does not require the 
president's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Before approving Domenici's budget, Sen. Christopher Bond,  
R-Mo., tweaked Democrats by forcing the panel to vote on the budget 
Clinton proposed last month. It was rejected 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they support the main principle of the  
president's budget: reserving most of the surplus for Social 
Security and Medicare. But with the two parties competing this year 
over protecting Social Security, they were reluctant to vote for 
the Clinton plan because it would allow some Social Security funds 
to be spent for domestic programs in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The full House and Senate are expected to approve both budgets  
next week and pass a compromise plan next month. In the months to 
come, though, the Republicans and the president seem certain to 
battle over spending and tax legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate continued to debate a $1.9 billion  
spending bill containing funds for Central American countries 
battered by Hurricane Mitch and other natural disasters, for U.S. 
farmers and for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators killed two amendments that would have told states how  
to spend their tobacco settlement money and cut off funding to 
prosecutor Kenneth Starr and other independent counsel probes. 
</P>
<P>
	By 79-21, the Senate rejected an amendment by Sen. Arlen  
Specter, R-Pa., that would have required states to spend 50 percent 
of the money they receive from their settlement with tobacco 
companies on health related matters. 
</P>
<P>
	On voice vote, senators rejected an amendment by Democratic  
senators that would have stopped federal funding to Starr and four 
other independent counsels six months if the statute providing for 
their jobs expires June 30.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Lab Threat Analysis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moving to counter congressional complaints of  
lax security, President Clinton is ordering a review at the 
nation's nuclear weapons laboratories even as relations with China 
falter over espionage suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brushed aside in the clamor were urgent appeals from Beijing to  
maintain the strong ties Clinton has championed in six years in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has become -- or rather the Sino-U.S. relationship has  
become -- the victim of party politics in the United States,'' a 
Chinese diplomat told reporters here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am determined to do all that is necessary to protect our  
sensitive national security information and to prevent its 
diversion to foreign countries,'' Clinton said in a statement a few 
hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	The review will be undertaken by his Foreign Intelligence  
Advisory Board, a bipartisan and independent panel headed by former 
Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese diplomat, He Yafei, a minister-counsel at the  
Chinese Embassy, denied his government stole nuclear secrets at the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. He said the 
allegations were rooted in Cold War thinking and ``political 
atmospherics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China's prime minister, Zhu Rongai, has called the allegations a  
``fallacy'' and part of an ``anti-China wave.'' He is due here next 
month for talks designed to reinforce the administration's policy 
of good relations with Beijing and to reinforce China's bid to join 
the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu said this week he expected critics to ``vent anger'' at him.  
Clinton, meanwhile, hopes the review and Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson's plans for tightened security at the laboratories will 
dampen the political firestorm touched off by suspicions that Wen 
Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born American engineer, helped China in the 1980s 
to learn the design of an advanced nuclear warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence  
Committee, this week complained that security at Los Alamos and at 
other facilities has been ``too loose too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice chairman, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., also was critical,  
saying of security measures, ``I no longer have confidence we are 
doing it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, in a joint letter to Sandy Berger, the president's  
national security adviser, the two senators complained about the 
way the administration was briefing congressional intelligence 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acted on Berger's recommendation in ordering the review.  
Some Republicans have called for Berger's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president asked Rudman for a report within 60 days. The  
inquiry will be conducted by the former senator and four other 
members of the 12-member board. 
</P>
<P>
	Two were identified Thursday as Anthony S. Harrington, a  
Washington lawyer, and Dr. Sidney D. Drell, a professor and deputy 
director of the Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center. The 
two other members have not been named. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also asked Rudman to consult with Congress before  
conducting his review, and then to share his findings with Congress 
and the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're under no illusions about China or any other country that  
tries to acquire our sensitive technologies, whether friend or 
foe,'' David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, 
said. ``What we need to do is be vigilant to protect our secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, making his first major foreign  
policy speech as a potential presidential candidate in 2000, 
criticized the Clinton administration for removing the link between 
human rights and trade policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton has consistently supported granting China  
most-favored nation status, no matter how egregious the human 
rights abuses documented by his own State Department,'' Quayle 
charged in a speech prepared for delivery today in Los Angeles to 
the World Affairs Council. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department spokesman, James Foley, said, meanwhile, that  
concern about the espionage reports was deep and ``shared widely by 
both branches, the executive and legislative branches of 
government, by both political parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no division there. The Chinese should not read our  
concern over espionage as a partisan matter or a matter that's 
manufactured by opponents of U.S.-China relations.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Flies 3rd Group To Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq sent a third -- and possibly last --  
group of pilgrims to Saudi Arabia today aboard a Russian-made cargo 
plane, violating U.N. sanctions against air travel in and out of 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The Il-76 took off this afternoon with 124 ``elderly and sick  
men and women pilgrims,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia -- a main dropoff point for  
Muslims performing the hajj, or annual pilgrimage -- would be the 
last, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Il-76 plane had flown to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and  
Wednesday, transporting 221 pilgrims in the two flights. That plane 
was seized Wednesday by Saudi Arabia, which asked the U.N. 
sanctions committee for instructions, diplomats said at the United 
Nations. U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the committee took no action, Saudi Arabia got the green  
light to release the plane, as it said it would do today, said 
Peter Mollema, a diplomat from the Netherlands, which chairs the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not been able to reach consensus and as a consequence  
... we understand the Saudis will let the plane go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi officials and an air force pilot at the air base had  
earlier claimed that today's flight was by the same Il-76 that had 
flown on the previous two days. 
</P>
<P>
	But an Iraqi diplomat at the United Nations said it was a  
different Il-76 that flew to Saudi Arabia today. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports also refuted claims by Iraqi officials that the  
country had only one operational civilian plane at its disposal. 
Most of the country's planes have been parked abroad since the 1991 
Gulf War or are not operational. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters were not invited to cover today's departure of the  
plane as they were for the last two trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Libyan passenger jet said to be carrying Muslim  
pilgrims flew to Saudi Arabia today on a flight that apparently 
also would violate a U.N. embargo. Libya has defied the embargo 
every year since 1994 to ferry Libyans to Saudi Arabia for the 
hajj. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Security Council imposed limited sanctions on Libya in  
1992 after it refused to hand over for trial two suspects wanted 
for the bombing of a U.S. plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. 
The blast killed 270 people, including 198 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from those ferried by air, Iraq is sending 18,000 pilgrims  
by land. They are camped at the border post of Arar, waiting to be 
allowed to proceed to the Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina, Islamic 
holy cities where millions of Muslims gather each year for the 
hajj. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal between Iraq and the United Nations to provide each  
pilgrim with $2,000 from the country's oil-for-food money fell 
through on Tuesday because of a disagreement over distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq, a predominantly Muslim nation, says the 8 1/2-year-old  
sanctions infringe its people's religious rights. Islam requires 
every able-bodied person who can afford it to travel at least once 
to Mecca to perform the hajj. The hajj season this year culminates 
at the end of March.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Has New Internet Explorer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is releasing a new version of  
its Internet Explorer software today that appears less integrated 
with the Windows operating system, making it easier to separate 
some Web navigation features from computer desktop functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the features in Internet Explorer 5.0 are  
inconsistent with Microsoft's steadfast contention in its antitrust 
battle that its Web browser is an essential part of the Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, in an ongoing suit, accuses Microsoft of using  
its dominance of the personal computer market to illegally force 
consumers who use Windows to also use its browser, dissuading them 
from using the popular Netscape Navigator browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 90 percent of the world's personal computers run on the  
Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly inconsistent with the proposition that Internet  
Explorer is inherently and always a distinct part of the operating 
system,'' said Jonathan Jacobson, an antitrust attorney with the 
New York law firm of Akin Gump. 
</P>
<P>
	A Microsoft official rejected suggestions that the new Explorer  
is less closely integrated with Windows, reiterating the company's 
position that it merely gives consumers what they want. Shawn 
Sanford, product manager for Internet Explorer, said the underlying 
source code was still shared by the new browser and Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about integration you're talking about  
underlying (code),'' he said. ``Those processes are still as 
tightly integrated in IE 5.0 as they were in (the previous 
version).'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The new Internet Explorer offers a variety of minor improvements  
such as faster viewing of Web pages and a reduced tendency to 
``crash'' when retrieving Internet information. Another browser 
feature, a radio ``toolbar,'' lets users listen to radio stations 
over the Internet while they browse other sites. 
</P>
<P>
	When installed on computers running with Windows 95, users also  
will find fewer Web-related features meshed with desktop functions. 
Gone is Microsoft's ``Active Desktop,'' which makes files stored in 
the computer look and act like Web pages with links to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The new browser ``seems to be less ambitious in terms of  
integration compared to 4.0, which made itself part of the 
operating system,'' said Barry Parr, an analyst with International 
Data Corp., based in Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you originally installed 4.0, it became your desktop.  
Anytime it opened a file, it would open a browser window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 95 users who try to disable the new browser after  
installing will no longer see the process referred to as 
``uninstall.'' Instead, the computer says, ``restore previous 
Windows configuration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to say it's a Windows configuration and not a  
separate product,'' said Jim Rapoza, who tested the browser for the 
PC Week trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford said the wording was changed because it more accurately  
reflected the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Users of Windows 98 machines, which build Web-related features  
into the desktop functions, won't see the same desktop changes as 
Windows 95 machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Yusuf Mehdi, the director of marketing for Internet Explorer,  
said that Microsoft is expected to release an upgrade of Windows 98 
by late summer or fall that will include Explorer 5.0 along with 
other new Internet technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them is Internet Connection Sharing, software that will  
allow consumers to run up to four different computers 
simultaneously over a single Internet access account. It is aimed 
at multiple computer families where parents and kids compete for 
Internet time, Mehdi said.

<HEADLINE> Court: Immigrants Can Vote in Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ruled that  
illegal immigrants working for a company can vote in union 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 decision Wednesday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals upheld the National Labor Relations Board's 
conclusion that all regular employees -- including those who may be 
subject to termination in the future -- are eligible to vote on 
whether they want to be represented by a union. 
</P>
<P>
	A contrary ruling would allow employers to manipulate elections  
by deciding who could vote and by using threats of deportation to 
discourage union support, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, companies that had violated the law by employing illegal  
immigrants could take advantage of their own wrongdoing by 
nullifying otherwise valid union elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The court upheld an order requiring a 50-employee sauna and  
furniture manufacturer in Redwood City to recognize and negotiate 
with a Carpenters Union local that won a 1996 representation 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the company, Kolkka Tables and Finnish-American  
Saunas, said an appeal was likely.

<HEADLINE> Feds Not Funding Disabled Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The school district in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, had  
already overspent its special education budget by $1 million when 
the Supreme Court ruled it had to pay for one-on-one nursing for a 
student -- adding $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Garret Frey, the 16-year-old sophomore on a ventilator because  
of an accident that left him paralyzed, isn't the issue, said 
Superintendent Lew Finch. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is really about the federal government creating rules  
requiring schools to educate children with disabilities, but not 
sending enough money to ensure they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	If schools don't get more help, they may need to raise local  
taxes, Finch said. ``This might be the case that opens a lot of 
eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Special education is one of the most emotional issues schools  
face, and one of their fastest-growing costs. States have long 
fought with local schools and the Education Department over costs. 
Now Republicans and Democrats in Congress are debating how much the 
federal government should help. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6 million children receive special education instruction  
and services costing $60 billion, about $5 billion of that from the 
federal government. About $55 billion comes from states and local 
districts, which follow strict rules stemming from the 1975 federal 
law covering special education. 
</P>
<P>
	States get anywhere from 7 percent to 12 percent of their  
special education money from the federal program. The law allows 
the federal government to contribute up to 40 percent -- or about 
$11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first obligation is to fulfill the needs demanded from the  
laws already on the books,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who has 
proposed increasing the federal contribution to at least $9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first education debate this year, Republicans and  
Democrats sparred over a bill that would let schools spend money 
sought by the Clinton administration for new elementary school 
teachers on special education instead. The Senate approved the 
idea, but the House didn't consider it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, not usually known for increasing education  
spending, have criticized President Clinton's request for a 1 
percent increase in special education funding. Giving the states 
more special education money frees local money for other needs such 
as new computers, new teachers and new school buildings, Gregg 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats want federal money spent on the teachers and other  
early education programs that they say could help reduce the number 
of children classified as learning disabled, the biggest category 
of special education students. 
</P>
<P>
	If budget restraints were gone, the administration would support  
more special education money, said Judith E. Heumann, who runs the 
Education Department's special education programs. But states also 
should manage their own dollars better, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heumann, who is in a wheelchair, says of Republicans: ``They are  
scapegoating disabled kids. We have serious concerns that one group 
should be pitted against the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the federal special education law was passed in 1975, there  
were approximately 4 million children who needed special education, 
approximately 8 percent of school-age children. Nearly 2 million of 
them, some with severe disabilities, were excluded from financially 
strapped public schools, and the law was passed to ensure they were 
educated. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 5.8 million special-needs children nationwide  
representing 12 percent of the school-age population. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics suggest schools are placing into special education  
more students who simply can't read well, who speak another 
language or who have behavior differences that prevent them from 
fully functioning in a classroom setting. 
</P>
<P>
	The National School Boards Association estimates that 17,000  
children nationwide have high-cost needs. The Education Department 
says 600 to 2,000 need ventilators like Frey. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cedar Rapids, for example, the average expense per special ed  
child is $7,800 -- $3,800 above its average for non-special-needs 
children. The district has about 50 severely disabled students who 
cost at least $15,000 each a year to educate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in the rights of those students, but we're getting  
to the point that we're not always protecting the rights of other 
children who are not disabled,'' said Dolorita Reandeau of the 
South Kitsap schools in western Washington state, which recently 
paid a $20,000 legal bill in a due process hearing for one student. 
``Our hands are tied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents of special ed students say they and their children are  
paying, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheryl Watson of Harrisburg, Pa., has spent years struggling  
with her district over the cost of services, such as tutoring and 
computer software, for her 13-year-old son, who has Tourette's 
syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is you have to look at the severity of the  
impact on the child's learning,'' Watson said.

<HEADLINE> Auburn-OSU More Than Porter &AMP; Penn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien doesn't  
have to be convinced that Auburn is more than Chris Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien is particularly impressed by what Scott Pohlman has done  
for Auburn in the NCAA tournament. The 6-foot-2, 160-pound guard 
known as ``Opie'' matched the scoring output of Ohio State's 
leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at our team and they look at Michael Redd, and  
everybody equates Michael Redd with a guy that's going to score 
points,'' O'Brien said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at them, you don't normally look at Pohlman as a  
guy that is going to score a lot of points. You never hear about 
him when you talk about Auburn, so I think that is an indicator 
that they certainly have more than just one player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is the only new starter this season for an Auburn team  
that has had five straight winning records, but is in the NCAA for 
the first time since 1988. He was the Southeastern Conference's 
newcomer and player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Porter, having gained the attention of extra defenders  
during the postseason, is Auburn's fourth-leading scorer in the 
NCAA tournament with 9 points a game -- seven below his team-leading 
season average. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for Pohlman's career-high 28 points in an 81-74 victory  
over Oklahoma State last weekend, top-seeded Auburn (29-3) might be 
at home instead of playing Ohio State (25-8) tonight in the South 
Regional semifinals at Thompson-Boling Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opie, he's been like that. He knows the game, doesn't take bad  
shots and takes advantage of his opportunities,'' Auburn coach 
Cliff Ellis said. ``He doesn't look like he can, but he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Pohlman and Redd have been key postseason scorers for  
their teams -- each scoring a combined 42 points in the first two 
NCAA games -- newcomers Porter and Scoonie Penn get most of the 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Players of the year in their respective conferences -- Porter in  
the SEC and Penn in the Big Ten -- the junior transfers helped 
Auburn and Ohio State end extended absences from the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Porter, Penn is also the only new starter on his team, but  
has struggled in the postseason. After shooting 47 percent in the 
regular season, Penn is a combined 31 percent (15-of-48) in the Big 
10 and NCAA tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Penn is one of the reasons the Buckeyes are in the NCAA  
tournament for the first time since 1992. And it was something he 
told his teammates even before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how the other kids on the team responded, but I  
was the one that responded like I thought he was off the wall,'' 
said O'Brien, who had Penn for NCAA appearances at Boston College 
in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn experienced some success before Porter. Ohio State was  
8-22 and finished last in the Big Ten at 1-15, while Penn sat out 
last season following his transfer from Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted us to be better than we were a year ago. But  
Scoonie's mentality is that when March comes around, you play in 
the NCAA tournament,'' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redd, the Buckeyes' leading scorer (19.6) and with five career  
30-point games already to his credit, said Penn was the needed 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie brought a winning attitude to this program, brought a  
lot of leadership to this team and was another scoring weapon for 
our team, which we didn't have last year,'' Redd said. ``That is 
why we are winning this year.''

<HEADLINE> Joe Torre Undergoes Prostate Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The surgeon who removed Joe Torre's cancerous  
prostate gland Thursday believes the disease had not spread, and 
said the prognosis is ``excellent'' for the New York Yankees 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very routine,'' said Dr. William Catalona, a pioneer in  
the detection and treatment of prostate cancer. ``I think he had a 
very early prostate cancer and it went very smoothly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lab tests on the removed gland and surrounding lymph nodes won't  
be complete for a few days, but Catalona said, ``The way it looked 
to the naked eye, the prognosis is excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona said the cancer was so small he couldn't see it even as  
he held the removed gland in his hand. It was diagnosed by the 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test that Catalona developed a 
decade ago, and confirmed by a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in  
American men and the second deadliest behind lung cancer. The 
walnut-sized gland is at the base of the bladder in men. Men 50 and 
older are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	In cases where cancer is confined to a removed prostate, the  
patient's prognosis is essentially as good as for a man who never 
had the disease, Catalona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, 58, underwent the 2 1-2-hour surgery at Barnes-Jewish  
Hospital, where he was expected to remain for 3-4 days. Torre will 
then recuperate in Florida, said Jeff Wehling, a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona pioneered a surgical technique known as nerve-sparing  
radical prostatectomy, which he used on Torre. The procedure 
generally results in fewer problems, including impotence, than 
conventional prostate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona said there appeared to be very little damage to the  
nerves surrounding Torre's prostate. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's wife, Ali, was ``ecstatic'' after learning about the  
successful surgery, Wehling said. She then called family members 
and acquaintances, including Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona said Torre seemed at ease before the surgery, talking  
baseball and joking with doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very upbeat, cracking a lot of jokes -- he was really  
very amusing,'' Catalona said. ``I can see now why everybody likes 
him so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes-Jewish spokeswoman Kathryn Holleman said the hospital has  
received hundreds of calls from well-wishers. Wehling said Torre 
has also received numerous flowers and cards, many from St. Louis 
residents who watched Torre when he played for, and later managed, 
the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's found greater success in New York, but the people in St.  
Louis still have incredibly fond memories,'' Wehling said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no timetable for Torre's return to the World Series  
champions, but Catalona said his patients typically go back to work 
6-12 weeks after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to encourage him not to go back too soon,'' Catalona  
said. ``He's got a very stressful job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona was recommended to Torre by former Yankees general  
manager Bob Watson, and by Cardinals Hall-of-Famer Stan Musial, 
hospital officials said. Catalona performed prostate cancer surgery 
on both men. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's cancer was diagnosed early because of an annual PSA  
exam, Catalona said. The problem was found during a checkup at the 
Yankee's spring training camp in Tampa, Fla., and announced last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're dealing with a tumor that doesn't let its presence be  
learned unless you're looking for it,'' Catalona said.

<HEADLINE> Hilfiger Settles Over Care Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tommy Hilfiger USA Inc. has agreed to pay a  
$300,000 civil penalty and set up a toll-free hotline to answer 
questions about cleaning its garments after federal regulators 
charged that care labels on the company's clothing violated the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission alleges that the New York-based  
company sold garments with care labeling instructions that, when 
followed, caused the clothing to bleed and fade. The complaint and 
a proposed consent agreement was filed Wednesday by the Justice 
Department at the request of the FTC in U.S. District Court in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based Tommy Hilfiger  
Corp., said it entered into the agreement to avoid a costly trial 
and denied that the problems were a result of its labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the FTC was unable to confirm any specific problems with  
our garment care labeling, we agreed to settle the matter in order 
to avoid the time and expense of litigation,'' Joel Horowitz, chief 
executive officer of Tommy Hilfiger Corp., said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Hilfiger agreed to place a toll-free number on its care  
labels so consumers can contact the company directly with questions 
about cleaning a particular garment. The company also must follow 
certain record-keeping and reporting requirements to help the FTC 
monitor future compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since we believe the reported problems were caused by improper  
laundering, we are taking steps to ensure that consumers and 
professional laundries and cleaners are better aware of the proper 
laundering procedures for our clothing,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the reported problems related to only a small  
fraction of the garments it produced between 1993 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the FTC's Care and Labeling Rule, manufacturers and  
importers of clothing apparel must attach care labels to the items 
that state ``what regular care is needed for the ordinary use of 
the product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer must have a reasonable basis for any care  
instructions, including warnings, that it attaches to the product, 
according to the statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC alleged that Tommy Hilfiger did not have a reasonable  
basis for the care instructions it attached to its products and 
that when followed, the instructions resulted in garments bleeding 
into one another and fading. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty is the highest the FTC ever sought in a case of  
alleged violations of the Care Labeling Rule. 
</P>
<P>
	But Federal Trade Commissioner Mozelle Thompson said in a  
separate statement that it might not be enough to deter companies 
as large as Tommy Hilfiger, noting its more than $840 million in 
sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``These penalties should be substantially higher in cases like  
this one where the volume of sales and the nature of the customer 
may warrant more relief,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury to consumers is ``especially egregious in cases like  
this one where the products are being heavily marketed and sold to 
young people who may not be able to effectively obtain redress for 
faulty goods,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The consent decree, which does not constitute an admission of  
wrongdoing by the company, is subject to court approval.

<HEADLINE> Army Reviews Roosevelt Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army said Thursday it will solicit  
information from the public before recommending to President 
Clinton whether former President Theodore Roosevelt should get the 
Medal of Honor for leading his Rough Riders in battle at Cuba's San 
Juan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Clinton signed legislation asking him to award  
Roosevelt the medal posthumously. Clinton said he would not act 
until letting Army experts complete a final review of Roosevelt's 
qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army's Center of Military History will accept submissions of  
information from the public from April 1 to May 31. It said it is 
looking for ``information about then-Colonel Roosevelt's 
battlefield courage'' in the attack on San Juan Heights 100 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cover all the bases,'' Army spokeswoman Elaine  
Kanellis said, including the possibility that private researchers 
have information unknown to the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	She said an independent panel of historians would review the  
submissions and provide a recommendation to Secretary of the Army 
Louis Caldera by late summer. Caldera then will make a 
recommendation to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Roosevelt repeatedly made clear in his private letters and in  
official papers that he felt he deserved the Medal of Honor for his 
actions under fire on July 1, 1898, during the Spanish-American 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	He led his volunteer regiment into action alongside Army  
regulars up Kettle Hill, one of two hills comprising San Juan 
Heights, then mustered a force to advance up San Juan Hill. He 
arrived after regulars had taken it. 
</P>
<P>
	Roosevelt's friend, Col. Leonard Wood, original commander of the  
Rough Riders and later military governor of Cuba, recommended the 
future president for the medal. But the War Department denied it, 
perhaps because of personal friction between Roosevelt and the Army 
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am entitled to the Medal of Honor, and I want it,''  
Roosevelt wrote at the time.

<HEADLINE>  Amtrak 'Witness' Is Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- A potential witness has come forward  
who claims to have seen the crash of an Amtrak passenger train that 
rammed a truck, killing 11 people, an investigator said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorist contacted Amtrak late Wednesday, saying he was  
driving behind the truck, and representatives of the National 
Transportation Safety Board will attempt to interview him in detail 
later today, the NTSB's John Goglia told a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators ``believe that this witness has valuable  
information'' and is credible, Goglia said, though he declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there may be other witnesses to this accident,'' he  
said, based on the witness's report that other vehicles were in the 
area at the time of the crash. He encouraged any witnesses to come 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also discussed their re-enactment of the crash,  
conducted late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights earlier at the same site and at about the same time,  
Amtrak's City of New Orleans train plowed into a tractor-trailer 
loaded with steel. This time, investigators -- using the same truck 
cab -- to help figure out what happened in the seconds before the 
nation's deadliest train wreck in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main purpose is to see who could see what and when,'' said  
Robert Lauby, NTSB director of railroad safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have also talked again to the engineer, who  
remained in the hospital, and the driver of the truck, John Stokes 
of Manteno. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB spokesman Phil Frame would not comment on what the engineer  
said or the nature of his injuries, or what information the brief 
telephone interview with Stokes produced. The engineer remained 
hospitalized today and on medication. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports Tuesday that the engineer said immediately  
after the crash that the truck driver had tried to zigzag his 
semitrailer through the crossing gates after they had come down. 
</P>
<P>
	Goglia said authorities are analyzing two tire tracks in the mud  
at the crossing that ``would indicate that somebody tried to go 
around the gates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The re-enactment was conducted at about 9:45 p.m. -- almost the  
same time the City of New Orleans approached the crossing 50 miles 
south of Chicago on Monday. This time, a single engine moved slowly 
down the tracks, sounding its horn while crossing gates came down 
and warning lights flashed. A tractor-trailer sat parked behind the 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of freight cars was also placed on a nearby side track  
to see if they could have impaired the truck driver's view. The cab 
of the truck involved in the accident was used, with an identical 
trailer carrying the same amount of steel bars, Frame said. 
</P>
<P>
	The large truck was able to get around the gates without  
knocking them down, investigators said today. During the 
re-enactment, investigators timed how many seconds it took the 
truck to cross the tracks at various speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, who was driving on a probationary license after three  
speeding violations in Indiana, told investigators he had already 
driven into the crossing when the gates came down. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities said there was no indication the gates had  
failed to work, reiterating today that testing found no problem. 
The red signal light flashes for five seconds before the gates 
descend and then drivers already in the crossing have 26 seconds to 
clear it. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, family members of those who died boarded two buses and  
were driven from their motel to the crash site. They gathered in a 
massive hug and placed a wreath and pink, yellow and white roses 
near the front of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Some brought dental records to help identify the victims.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, an attorney for passengers David and Laura Roe  
of New Orleans filed a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court against 
Amtrak, Illinois Central Railroad, Stokes and his employer, Melco 
Transfer Co., seeking $300,000 in damages for their injuries.

<HEADLINE> NFL Brings Back Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Instant replay is back in the NFL, and almost no  
one is unhappy, not even George Young, the league vice president 
who was against replay for 14 years before helping to develop a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	A system that will allow each team two challenges per game to  
officials' calls was implemented 28-3 by the owners Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	What put it over the top was a suggestion by commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue to use a ``replay assistant'' for the final two minutes 
of each half and any overtime. Tagliabue developed the idea with 
help from Young, who as general manager of the New York Giants 
always voted ``no'' against replay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing the coaches objected to was the last two  
minutes,'' Tagliabue said. ``So I said `Why not make it 28 and two, 
going to something like the old replay system in the final two 
minutes and letting the coaches coach?' 
</P>
<P>
	``George Young said `That might do it' and break the logjam in  
terms of votes, and it did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new system will have to be renewed next season, but if it  
avoids the kinds of bad calls that decided several games last 
season, that will be a formality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are implementing this system to correct the major, major,  
big mistake,'' said Seattle coach Mike Holmgren, co-chairman of the 
competition committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, as coach of the Packers, Holmgren was the victim of  
a controversial call, an apparent fumble by San Francisco's Jerry 
Rice that probably would have led to a Green Bay victory in a game 
the 49ers went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Replay was in effect from 1986 until 1991, but was voted out in  
1992, in large part because it was delaying games. It's been voted 
down every year since. 
</P>
<P>
	The old system used a replay official who could stop the game on  
a questionable call and make the decision. In this one, he'll only 
challenge calls in the final two minutes of each half and in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the time, the coaches will have two challenges,  
losing a timeout if they're found wrong and getting it back if 
they're right. If they don't have a timeout left, they won't be 
able to challenge a call. 
</P>
<P>
	But coaches won't have much time -- they'll have to make the  
decision in the 40 seconds between plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were willing to take a shot for one year,'' said Tampa  
Bay's Tony Dungy, one of the few coaches with questions about 
replay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Replay has been very close the last three or four years. Now  
we had teams that maybe were burned on a call and changed their 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was Buffalo, which was hurt by questionable calls in  
a regular-season loss in New England and a playoff loss in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a lot of strategy for us to think about,'' Bills  
coach Wade Phillips said. ``We'll be doing a lot of studying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not likely we're going to challenge something in the  
middle of the field in the second quarter,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone tells me our receiver was in on a 10-yard play on  
which he was ruled out in the second quarter, I'd probably let it 
go. But if it's something that can get us points, then we'd 
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All that swayed teams like the Bills and the Giants, who changed  
their vote when Young retired and went to the league office. 
Co-owner Wellington Mara made the call on that one, casting his 
``yes'' vote without telling coach Jim Fassel, general manager 
Ernie Accorsi or even his son John, the team's vice-president. 
</P>
<P>
	``John and I were talking just before the vote and he said `Even  
I don't know what the old man's gonna do.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The three ``no'' votes came from Cincinnati, the New York Jets  
and Arizona. ``I was afraid of the disruption,'' said Mike Brown, 
the Bengals' president. ``The attention would be on the call and 
not the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plays covered by replay will be like those in the old  
system, applicable to goal-line and sideline plays and possession, 
but not to penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The league also put off a decision on the $800 million sale of  
the Washington Redskins to Howard and Edward Milstein until early 
April. Tagliabue said there weren't enough votes to approve the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other rule change was on clipping near the line of  
scrimmage, which now will apply all over the field. In the past, 
clipping was legal in a small area between the tackles near the 
line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners also formally took away the 2003 Super Bowl from San  
Francisco and invited San Diego, south Florida and other locations 
to submit bids.

<HEADLINE> House Debates Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the Senate gave its overwhelming  
endorsement, legislation to commit the United States to a 
nationwide defense against ballistic missiles headed today toward 
expected bipartisan passage in the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The House turned to its version of the missile-defense bill --  
long a top GOP policy initiative -- after hearing the missile threat 
to the United States outlined in a rare closed-door national 
security briefing by members of a commission that studied the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, chairman of the panel,  
said after the secret session in the House chamber that from 25 to 
30 nations now have, or are the process of trying to obtain, 
ballistic-weapons capability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an accident that these countries are spending a great  
deal of money'' in developing such weapons, Rumsfeld said. He 
noted, in particular, heavy spending by North Korea to develop its 
missile program ``while people there are starving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea's test last Aug. 31 of a three-stage ballistic  
missile, on a trajectory over Japan, helped build bipartisan 
support in Congress for developing a defense against incoming 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Will rogue nations like North Korea use their missiles? ``No one  
can predict that,'' Rumsfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., the chief sponsor of the House version  
of the missile-defense bill, said that there ``won't be any wiggle 
room'' for Democrats to seek cover on the measure, as he suggested 
there was in the Senate-passed bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to force people to make a decision about the  
president's policy,'' Weldon said in an interview. The House began 
debating the bill a day after the overwhelming 97-3 Senate passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the measure had considerable support in both parties,  
not all Democrats were ready to give the measure their backing. 
Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich, D-Ohio, said the bill ``threatens years of 
progress in nuclear arms reduction agreements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A renewed arms race would threaten our national security far  
more than the perceived threat from rogue states,'' Kucinich said 
in a letter to other House members. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the legislation, both in the Senate and the House,  
said reports of the North Korean missile tests and of possible 
espionage by China at a U.S. nuclear laboratory helped solidify 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has opposed legislation to commit the military  
to deploying a national missile defense. He vetoed an earlier 
version in 1995, and Senate Democrats had kept the measure from 
coming to a floor vote since. But Democrats and the president 
relented this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued a statement applauding Wednesday's Senate vote.  
``We are committed to meeting the growing danger that outlaw 
nations will develop and deploy long-range missiles that could 
deliver weapons of mass destruction against us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill states that ``it is the official policy of the  
United States to deploy a national missile defense.'' It does note 
specify which type of system or set a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	Weldon said it commits the administration to a deployment.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the legislation have said it would violate terms of  
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which severely restricts 
the kind of missile defense either the United States or Russia can 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
	But Weldon, just back from Moscow where he met with members of  
the Russian Duma, said Russian officials and lawmakers ``are not 
exactly embracing our position, but they know we're doing it to 
protect ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> House Committee Approves Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for  
fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday and were a hair's 
breadth from prevailing in a Senate panel after GOP lawmakers 
crushed Democratic attempts to block tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 22-18 party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved  
a spending plan by panel Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that 
promises to leave Social Security surpluses alone while reducing 
taxes and increasing defense, education and several other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can do much better than that,'' Kasich said.  
</P>
<P>
	Simultaneously, the Senate Budget Committee moved toward  
approving a similar plan. That panel planned to complete its work 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On both sides of the Capitol, Democrats proposed requiring that  
Social Security and Medicare be overhauled before Republicans could 
get the tax cuts they want -- $15 billion next year and $778 billion 
over the next decade. The GOP majority prevailed by party-line 
votes, 12-10 in the Senate Budget Committee and 23-19 in the House 
Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats designed their amendments to the 2000 budget in order  
to cast Republicans as more eager to cut taxes than to fortify 
Social Security and Medicare for the looming retirement of baby 
boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a desperation to claim tax cuts as a primary thing  
they have to focus on,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, the 
Senate budget panel's ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that projected federal surpluses -- which  
they say will total $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years -- make it 
possible to do many things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get it straight,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman  
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``There are many priorities. We're going to 
save Medicare'' and Social Security. ``And in addition we are going 
to give the American people a welcome, needed tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the GOP flexed its muscle in committee, they ran into a  
Clinton administration veto threat over a GOP plan to ensure that 
Social Security's vast surpluses over the next decade -- before baby 
boomers start retiring -- be set aside for debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican proposal -- which will move as separate  
legislation from the budget resolution -- would require that Social 
Security surpluses be used to buy down the debt. Doing otherwise 
would require votes of 60 of the 100 senators, a tough hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Democratic leaders, Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin said the plan could hinder the government from issuing new 
debt if needed, threatening its credit rating and perhaps requiring 
it to stop paying Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will recommend that the president veto the bill if it  
contains the debt limit provisions,'' Rubin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the GOP tax reductions, the similar budget plans by  
Domenici and Kasich would set aside $1.8 trillion in Social 
Security surpluses through 2009 for debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress' budget sets overall spending and tax limits, leaving  
decisions about specifics for later bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the GOP budget would boost defense spending to $289  
billion, $9 billion more than this year and $8 billion more than 
Clinton has proposed. They would also increase spending for primary 
and secondary schools by more than $2 billion next year, and 
provide more for some agriculture and veterans programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they could afford those increases while  
honoring a tight spending limit for next year set by the 1997 
budget-balancing pact. Neither committee provided much detail about 
which programs they would cut to heed that spending ceiling, but 
both chairmen said they could do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these numbers are achievable,'' said Kasich. He  
added later, ``Every program can't go up if we're going to stay'' 
within the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Democrats said that to afford the GOP's proposed  
increases, the remaining programs affected by the spending limits 
would face 12 percent reductions. That could mean cuts to popular 
programs such as Head Start, food inspections and the FBI, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were an over-the-counter drug, it would have to say,  
'Warning: Could be harmful to elderly, children and working 
families,''' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said of 
the GOP plan. ``It is really a disappointment. They've given us an 
offer that we must refuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this plan would leave wreckage in its path,'' said  
Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management 
and Budget.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Surges to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit soared to an all-time  
high of $17 billion in January as global financial troubles pushed 
U.S. exports down further while imports of autos, consumer goods 
and food were climbing to record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit shot up  
21 percent from December's $14.1 billion level and surpassed the 
old monthly record of $16.7 billion set last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe the deficit in 1999 will easily surpass the  
record $169.3 billion imbalance set last year as the global 
financial crisis further depresses the ability of American 
manufacturers and farmers to sell in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on today's report, Commerce Secretary William Daley  
noted that the decline in U.S. exports was accelerating as the 
global troubles that began in Asia have now spread to Russia and 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must all focus on improving economic conditions abroad  
while ensuring that foreign markets are open to American firms,'' 
Daley told reporters at a briefing on the trade report. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports today showing low inflation and continued strong  
labor markets helped push stocks and bond prices higher on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the loss of markets for U.S. exporters, the  
plunge in currency values and recessions overseas triggered a flood 
of products into the United States, which has continued to post 
strong economic growth despite the global troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	That strong growth has sent U.S. unemployment to its lowest  
level in three decades despite the fact that manufacturing has 
eliminated 337,000 jobs over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the  
exceptionally good labor conditions are continuing with the number 
of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment 
benefits holding under 300,000 for the seventh consecutive week -- 
the longest such streak since 1974. Claims last week were 298,000, 
up 6,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	And the U.S. economy has seen benefits from the overseas  
troubles, especially on the inflation front where the flood of 
cheaper imports and weakened global demand for commodities such as 
oil has dampened prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Confirming that trend, the Labor Department said today that  
consumer prices edged up just 0.1 percent in February, leaving 
prices so far this year rising at a rate of just 1.1 percent, even 
better than last year's 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For January, U.S. exports dropped 1.4 percent to $76.8 billion,  
the lowest level since August. The weakness reflected declines in 
sales of farm products, including corn, cotton and wheat, civilian 
aircraft and autos. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports soared 2 percent to $93.8 billion last month as demand  
for autos and auto parts, consumer products and food all rose to 
all-time highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The widening gap in what America is able to sell overseas vs.  
what it imports has become a major political headache for President 
Clinton. Critics charge that Clinton's free trade policies have 
been a failure that has cost thousands of American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rebuke to the administration's free trade policies, the  
House on Wednesday passed by a lopsided 289-141 vote a bill that 
would clamp tight limits on the amount of steel that could be 
imported into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	While opponents argued that the bill violates global trade rules  
administered by the World Trade Organization, supporters won the 
House vote with the potent political argument that America's steel 
industry was being decimated by a flood of cheap imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel quota bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate,  
but its passage in the House sends a signal that protectionist 
pressures are growing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has argued that America, with the strongest  
economy in the world, must do its part to restore global growth by 
accepting higher imports. The administration is offering U.S. 
steelmakers more limited relief by expediting cases the industry 
filed to raise tariffs on a case-by-case basis on steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	For January, America's trade deficit with China shot up 23  
percent to $4.9 billion, as U.S. exports to that country fell to 
their lowest level in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Japan narrowed by 22 percent in January  
to $4.7 billion. Clinton warned Japan in his State of the Union 
address that unless its shipments of steel into the United States 
dropped dramatically, his administration would open its own unfair 
trading investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Pacific Rim countries, the epicenter of  
the global crisis, rose by 7.8 percent in January to $12.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe that with one-third of the globe in  
recession, the U.S. deficit will continue to widen this year. Many 
believe that the key to a global recovery lies in Japan, the 
world's second largest economy, adopting policies to halt its worst 
downturn in 50 years.

<HEADLINE>  Boxing Judge Discusses Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The judge at the center of the controversial  
Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield draw said Thursday that her view of 
the fight was obscured at times by photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying during a New York state Senate hearing, Eugenia  
Williams also said that after watching a tape of Saturday's 
heavyweight unification fight, she would have scored it a draw, 
instead of 115-113 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	That scoring, however, would not have changed the outcome. If  
Williams had scored the fifth round for Lewis, her card would have 
been 114-114, and the decision would have been a majority draw. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, of Atlantic City, N.J., appeared for the state Senate  
Committee on Investigations hearing and held fast in her belief 
that she had correctly judged the fight 115-113 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by state Sen. Roy Goodman if she had second thoughts about  
her opinion, Williams replied: ``No sir. I scored what I saw when I 
saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After watching a replay, Williams said she would have scored the  
fifth round for Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	But she added, ``What I saw that night is not what the camera  
saw. They were at a differrent angle than I was. I only score the 
blows I see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also said that during several rounds, including the  
fifth, her vision was sometimes blocked by ringside photographers 
whom she had to push aside. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a 10-year veteran of judging who works as a  
$39,200-a-year accounts clerk for Atlantic City, confirmed reports 
that she had filed for bankruptcy recently, but denied that there 
had been any attempt by anyone to help her financially in exchange 
for influencing her judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams listed assets of $56,889 and liabilities of $72,109 in  
her Chapter 7 filing, made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, 
N.J., on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, an accounts clerk for the city of Atlantic City who  
works part-time as a boxing judge, owes more than $33,000 on credit 
cards, according to court records obtained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the investigation got under way, the still furious Lewis  
returned home to London and demanded that ``everything should be 
looked into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Holyfield to hand over the WBA and IBF titles.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Evander's a man, he should admit that he got beat and give  
me my belts,'' the WBC champion said. ``But he's not that kind of 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say that Evander Holyfield is holding my belts right  
now for me. They're actually my belts, but he's holding them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has  
convened a grand jury to issue subpoenas and gather testimony about 
Saturday's unification bout. In additio, the New York state 
Athletic Commission also is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other judges, South Africa's Stan Christodoulou, scored  
the fight 116-113 for Lewis and Britain's Larry O'Connell scored it 
115-115. Most who watched the fight thought Lewis had clearly won. 
</P>
<P>
	IBF president Bob Lee, whose organization selected Williams,  
defended her work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure they aren't going to find anything irregular at  
all,'' he said. ``It is a subjective viewing of a fight and you 
can't tell these judges what to see or what not to see. All I tell 
them is, `Do the best you can.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' manager Frank Maloney said he didn't believe bribes had  
been paid, but he questioned Williams' competence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe there was any illegal payment, they wouldn't  
have been that stupid,'' Maloney said. ``They may not find money in 
her bank account, but there was definitely something wrong with her 
judging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after touching down at London's Heathrow Airport, Lewis  
maintained he had been the victim of a ``conspiracy'' and that the 
judges had been ``incompetent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everything should be looked into,'' Lewis said.  
``There was definitely something going on, some kind of conspiracy 
we don't know about. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this particular fight the public got hurt as well ... I say  
Don King should apologize and definitely the judges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next time I'm going to definitely bring my two judges, my own  
two judges,'' Lewis added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, criticized for not being more aggressive -- particularly  
in the fifth when he had Holyfield on the ropes -- said going for 
the knockout would have been risky. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the fifth he wasn't as hurt as I thought. I wasn't  
satisfied I could go in there and feel safe,'' Lewis said. ``He was 
definitely playing possum and he admitted it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if I had realized it was going to be like that, I would  
have went out there ... and realized my only hope was a knockout 
and go after it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, Holyfield was quoted as saying he understood the  
judges' decision perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judges said it was a draw. Realistically, he didn't knock  
me out, and I didn't knock him out. It's all based on a decision,'' 
Holyfield told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield said Lewis didn't do as well as some people said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even with the punch stats, people say, `Well, this man hit you  
600 times.' But if he hit me that much, why didn't I fall? How come 
I was never staggered or hurt? Obviously because a lot of times he 
was tapping me,'' he said in an interview published Thursday.

<HEADLINE> US Must Pay UN $250M To Keep Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States must pay the United  
Nations at least $250 million by the end of December to avoid 
losing its vote in the General Assembly, a senior U.N. official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least -- and underline it,'' said Joseph Connor, the world  
body's undersecretary-general for management. 
</P>
<P>
	Connor said that nearly $1.7 billion owed by Washington has left  
the world body without capital -- and a perennial borrower. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of unpaid assessments has become intractable,''  
Connor said. ``Unstable conditions hold hostage the financial 
future of the United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of a vote in the General Assembly would be an  
embarrassment, but it would not affect Washington's veto power in 
the Security Council, the most powerful decision-making body at the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven former secretaries of state from the Nixon, Ford, Carter,  
Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations on Thursday expressed 
concern in a letter to Congress that the United States ``is 
squandering its moral authority'' by failing to pay what it owes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's simply unacceptable that the richest nation on Earth is  
also the biggest debtor to the United Nations,'' said the letter, 
which is also running as an advertisement in several newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter came as the Clinton administration launched its  
annual effort to get Congress to pay overdue bills to the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's undermined our leverage in the U.N. on a broad range of  
political and management issues,'' the deputy U.S. ambassador Peter 
Burleigh told a House panel in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Connor said more of the U.N.'s 185 member nations are paying  
their dues on time -- 117 in 1998 compared with 75 in 1994 -- and for 
the first time in four years, the United Nations is borrowing less 
from a separate peacekeeping fund to cover operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the end of February, member states still owed the United  
Nations over $2.9 billion for current and past assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	By far the largest debtor, the United States owes $1.69 billion,  
nearly 60 percent of the total. The U.S. debt includes $620 million 
for the regular budget and slightly more than $1 billion for 
peacekeeping and tribunals. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress -- which had conditioned payments on financial and other  
reforms at the United Nations -- authorized legislation last year 
that would have paid off a chunk of the arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton vetoed the bill because it contained  
unrelated abortion restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on a formula used to calculate what nations owe, Connor  
said Washington must pay $250 million this year.

<HEADLINE> Bucs' Martin Might Be Odd Man Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates are trying to  
wedge four outfielders into three positions, and it looks more and 
more like the odd man out is Al Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, nearly traded to Arizona last month, now seems to have  
definitely lost his left fielder's job to Brian Giles. He 
apparently won't unseat Jose Guillen in right field, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Gene Lamont confirmed Thursday that Martin likely will  
be on the bench when the season starts, barring an unexpected 
injury or trade before the Pirates play the Montreal Expos on April 
5. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles would start in left, with Brant Brown in center and  
Guillen in right field despite missing more than two weeks of 
spring training in a visa dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Martin's status following the Pirates' 7-6 victory  
against the Philadelphia Phillies, Lamont said, ``We got two guys 
(Giles and Brown) in trades and Guillen drove in 84 runs last year. 
If Guillen is ready, he'll probably start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates initially were concerned that Guillen's late arrival  
might force him to start the season at Triple-A Nashville to make 
up the time he missed in camp. But he has swung the bat well during 
his first seven days in camp and had two hits in his first 
exhibition start Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looked fine. He's come out swinging, and that doesn't  
really surprise me,'' Lamont said. ``I think he'll be fine when the 
season starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen was hitless in two at-bats Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin admittedly fretted after being demoted to a platoon role  
while batting a career-low .239 in 1998, and his offseason was 
equally unsettled as the Pirates tried unsuccessfully to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates were within minutes of dealing him to Arizona until  
Diamondbacks outfielder Bernard Gilkey declined to rework minor 
contract language that would allow the trade to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin said he is tired of worrying where he will be on  
opening day -- in left field, on the bench -- or in another city. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I'm just trying not to think about it very much,''  
Martin said. ``Whether I'm in the lineup or not, if I worry about 
it I'll get upset or mad, so I'll just let it go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has not talked to general manager Cam Bonifay to  
determine if any other teams have shown interest in a .280 career 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard anything,'' Martin said. ``Everybody's just  
going about their business and ... well, I don't know, I'm tired of 
worrying about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his own undefined role, Martin said the addition of five  
veteran position players -- even the one who has taken his job -- has 
created a more major-league attitude in the Pirates' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin likes not having to be a nursemaid, confidante and big  
brother to a platoon of inexperienced players, as he was last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely more major league,'' Martin said. ``Last year  
was a lot different, just telling guys how to act. This year, it's 
much more of a big league atmosphere, and that's half the battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other half? Perhaps it's returning to the lineup as an  
everyday player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things could surely change during the season if one of them  
isn't swinging well,'' Lamont said. ``These things usually have a 
way of sorting themselves out.''

<HEADLINE> Friends Toast John Glenn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- For a change, John Glenn wasn't in  
a parade, wasn't getting a medal, wasn't even being praised as the 
great geriatric hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he was among old friends and fellow astronauts, and the  
mood was anything but reverential as they toasted him -- not just 
for his space-shuttle flight last October, but for the 37th 
anniversary of his first rocket ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, portrayed Glenn  
in a skit as a feeble-minded old geezer bound for space. ``I hear 
they're going to let me preboard,'' Cernan deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Mercury astronauts Scott Carpenter, Wally Schirra and  
Gordon Cooper took aim at the recently retired senator's squeaky 
clean image. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Larry Flynt report on John Glenn shocked the public  
today,'' Schirra intoned. ``Mr. Flynt revealed that he has 
photographs of the astro-senator using his salad fork on his steak 
and confirms sightings of John wearing white shoes after Labor 
Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn, who became the oldest person in space at age 77, aboard  
the shuttle Discovery, plunged right into the spirit of things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space could well be an old folks' home,'' he told 550 guests  
who paid up to $1,000 each to attend the charity fund-raiser at a 
Walt Disney World hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you spill food, it doesn't go on your tie or anything.  
You don't need a cane or a walker or a wheelchair, you just float. 
Drive in no traffic and leave the turn signal on, it doesn't make 
any difference. Balance? Who cares, you're upside down anyway. No 
falls, no broken hips. If you can't sleep, don't worry about it, 
night will be coming along in about 45 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn got his first taste of celebrity in February 1962, when he  
became the first American to orbit the Earth. Reaction to his 
second trip, aboard Discovery, was just as intense. Wherever he 
goes -- Majorca, Barcelona, Rome, Osaka, Kyoto, Disney World -- he's 
recognized. Whenever he stops, he's mobbed by well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he never expected it, isn't courting it, and isn't sure  
why it's happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's because of age, or his Senate background, ``or the  
fact that we were the first orbital flight, or whatever 
combination,'' the former Democratic lawmaker tells reporters, 
almost apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe you can give me a better analysis of it than I can give  
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astronaut Hall of Fame near the Kennedy Space Center  
collected more than 40,000 notes to Glenn between September and 
March, enough to fill 21 books. 
</P>
<P>
	He's one of this year's winners of the Ellis Island Medal of  
Honor, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City gave him a ticker tape parade, and he's the first  
astronaut to have a NASA center named after him. The Lewis Research 
Center in Cleveland is now the John H. Glenn Research Center at 
Lewis Field. 
</P>
<P>
	He has signed with Bantam Books to write his autobiography, due  
out this fall, and he celebrated Christmas two months late because 
of post-flight obligations and his departure from the Senate after 
24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn and his six much younger crew mates went on a world tour  
and were feted by prime ministers and chancellors, even a king and 
queen. (One crew member is from Spain, another from Japan.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone figured we were in 11 different hotels in 13 days, so  
it wasn't exactly a pleasure trip,'' Glenn says. ``I was recognized 
most places,'' he adds. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn says he's indifferent to the spotlight: ``I don't run to  
cameras. I don't run away from cameras. I just try and live my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Johnson Space Center in Houston are still studying  
Glenn to see what they can learn about geriatrics in space, and the 
tests will continue until about May. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusual for an astronaut, Glenn suffered no motion sickness or  
other ailment during his nine days in orbit. The moment he got 
back, though, nausea struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning astronauts often suffer dizziness and stiffness. In  
Glenn's case it lasted only a day. By the fourth day after his 
return -- and every day since -- he has felt completely normal, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn plans to spend his retirement working with students at  
Muskingum College in his hometown of New Concord, Ohio, and at Ohio 
State University. His goal is to encourage young people to go into 
public service. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd love to go back into space but doubts his wife, Annie,  
would approve. His two children certainly wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	His family gave him a stack of books for Christmas figuring  
reading ought to keep him on the ground. And his colleagues, as 
demonstrated at the roast, will keep his ego in check. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glenn had the last laugh.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no truth whatsoever to the fact that NASA refused to  
let me have a spacewalk because they were afraid I'd wander off 
someplace,'' Glenn said. ``And there's also no truth to the claim 
that I was the first 77-year-old to leave Florida in something 
other than a Winnebago.''

<HEADLINE> Term Limits Backer Rethinks Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- George Nethercutt may be having second  
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican congressman, who rode a wave of term-limit  
populism that ousted Democratic House Speaker Tom Foley in 1994, is 
rethinking his pledge to resign after three terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Nethercutt has recently floated trial balloons throughout his  
eastern Washington district, trying to gauge voter reaction if he 
abandons his stance and mounts a campaign next year for a fourth 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a Pullman High School class in February, ``Only fools  
and dead people don't change their minds'' when asked about his 
apparent change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in an interview with The Associated Press earlier this  
month, Nethercutt said of his term limits pledge: ``I wish I hadn't 
said it. But I believed it. I meant it when I said it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nethercutt's apparent backtracking has perplexed his 5th  
Congressional District constituents and angered the pro-term limit 
lobby that helped get him elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a quandary,'' said Rick Melanson, who served as  
Nethercutt's chief fund raiser in 1994 and remains a strong 
proponent of term limits in Congress. The stockbroker says he is 
neither Republican nor Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quandary I'm in is that George made a promise to run three  
times and them come home,'' Melanson said. ``Do I throw the guy 
over the side and risk getting a Democrat who's never supported 
term limits?'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Term Limits, a Washington, D.C.-based group, is pouring  
money into television and radio spots to convince Nethercutt to 
``keep his word'' and step down after his third term ends next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has sent a staffer to Spokane to help organize  
opposition to a fourth Nethercutt term, spokesman Jason Miller said 
from Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congressman Nethercutt ran on the term limits issue in '94. If  
it was not for term limits, he never would have toppled Congressman 
Foley,'' Miller said. ``We're still hoping Congressman Nethercutt 
is not going to break his pledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller refused to say how much the organization is spending in  
Nethercutt's district, but U.S. Term Limits Director Paul Jacob has 
said it has $20 million nationally to attract ``self-limiting'' 
candidates and criticize those who waffle on their pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Term Limits also is targeting three others from the class  
of 1994 who have either reneged, or are considering abandoning 
their term limits pledges: Reps. Scott McMannis, R-Colo., Tillie 
Fowler, R-Fla., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the group has produced hundreds of radio and  
television commercials urging residents to call Nethercutt's office 
and tell him to keep his 1994 promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Loren ``Kay'' Morse, a Republican who has backed Nethercutt  
since 1994, said constituents who want to castigate the congressman 
for flip-flopping on term limits are missing the larger picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``My point is, so George has been caught in an untruth,'' said  
Morse as he prepared to send a letter to the editor defending the 
congressman. ``It's not like he's the first politician that has.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Critic Sees IOC Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- While Olympic leaders have made  
some progress, much more needs to be done to overcome the taint of 
the Salt Lake bribery scandal, said the IOC's harshest critic among 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't hear any reform yet,'' said David D'Alessandro,  
president and chief operations officer of John Hancock insurance. 
``What I heard was they are going to study reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said he had seen nothing from the two days of  
Olympic meetings that would cause him to resume TV ad negotiations 
with NBC for the games or return the Olympic rings to company 
reports and billboards, two actions he took as the scandal 
unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	No other top-level sponsor has backed away.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have not seen anything to change our mind,'' he said  
Thursday in a telephone interview from his Boston office. ``They 
made some progress and bought time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also said he ``didn't see anything that would cause  
me to bolt'' from the four-year, $50 million deal that allows John 
Hancock to use the Olympic logo worldwide, 
</P>
<P>
	But he warned that a reform commission to be appointed by IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``must move definitely further'' 
by its interim report in June or the committee will be in serious 
trouble with sponsors and the public. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for institution of term limits for IOC members,  
changes and openness in filling the ruling executive board and 
release of financial records that the public can understand. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would mean a bit more leadership is being shown,''  
D'Alessandro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, in an emergency session here, expelled six delegates  
and adopted changes in choosing host cities and policing ethics as 
the first steps to bouncing back from its worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, this is actually progress for the IOC,'' D'Alessandro  
said. ``It would be moving the ball 5 yards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that the committee appeared to have learned some  
lessons while being buffeted by allegations that a fifth of its 
membership took improper gifts and other inducements from Salt Lake 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three to five months ago, the IOC would have been incapable of  
doing anything along these lines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro shared these feelings in a call Thursday with Dick  
Pound, the IOC vice president, marketing chief and head corruption 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him it was progress but there was more work to do,''  
D'Alessandro said. ``He agreed and said wait for the study group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The John Hancock chief said he agreed with Sen. John McCain's  
campaign to keep pressure on the IOC for meaningful change. McCain 
has issued a string of critical statements about the IOC this week 
and holds hearings on the Olympic scandal next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation is pending in Congress to strip the IOC's tax-exempt  
status, cut sponsors' deductions for fees and take U.S. TV rights 
money directly out of the IOC's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of tax deductions for sponsorships would drive  
corporations away from the Olympics, which get 70 percent of 
sponsorship money from U.S.-based companies, D'Alessandro said. The 
IOC already charges premium prices to be connected with a 
supposedly sparkling image, 
</P>
<P>
	``It would raise costs 30-40 percent,'' he said. ``The value  
just wouldn't be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But D'Alessandro disagreed with McCain's criticism of  
Samaranch's role in hand-picking the two-dozen members of the 
reform commission, called IOC 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who else is going to choose? Clinton? Yeltsin? McCain?'' he  
asked. ``If he puts people on who are all cronies, that's one 
thing. But let's see who he puts on it.''

<HEADLINE> Pope's First Pop CD, Video Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Spreading the word worldwide with a world  
beat, Vatican Radio and Sony Classical are introducing a first-ever 
music CD and video featuring Pope John Paul II, praying to the 
accompaniment of Celtic flutes and African drums. 
</P>
<P>
	The target audience: MTV and the pop charts, as well as 1  
billion faithful around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers will release the first 1 million copies of ``Abba  
Pater'' around the world on Tuesday, timing it for the Easter 
holidays and the upcoming 2,000th anniversary of Christianity. The 
pope got his copy, the first one produced, at his general audience 
Wednesday in St. Peter's Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Culled from Vatican Radio recordings over John Paul's 20-year  
papacy, ``Abba Pater'' features the pope reciting psalms, Gospels 
and other inspirational passages -- occasionally singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mixed in the recording studio is a world beat music background  
as eclectic as it is ecclesiastic: Everything from chants from 
Uganda with African percussion, to Slavonic liturgy from 
Bratislava, to Celtic flutes to classical. 
</P>
<P>
	They showed one video Wednesday: MTV-paced, digitally doctored,  
rapid-fire cuts of John Paul embracing children, strolling 
mountains and dunes, greeting the faithful, appearing pensive, all 
to an orchestral background. 
</P>
<P>
	The spirit of the video is upbeat and warm, although there's a  
jarring moment in which a man and woman appear in profile -- naked 
or near enough to count as such, for the few seconds they show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abba Pater'' -- one of the cuts on the CD as well as the title  
-- is the Aramaic and Latin for ``Father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a pope who's already embraced the Internet, the pop CD,  
singles and video are just another way of spreading the word, 
church officials said at a Vatican news conference with the 
president of Sony Classical. 
</P>
<P>
	``His mission is essentially the transmission of the message,''  
said Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, president of the Vatican's 
committee for 2000 Jubilee celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	The production is a mix of God and Mammon, however. Sony will  
pay royalties to Radio Vatican and the religious media firm 
Audiovisivi San Paolo. Sony Classical President Peter Gelb and 
church officials deflected repeated questions at the packed news 
conference about just how any profits will be split. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony expects it to sell millions, Gelb said. It will pitch the  
video to MTV and VH1 in the United States, among many other 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has ventured into the commercial world of mass media  
before with his book ``Crossing the Threshold of Hope.'' He 
earmarked his royalties from the book to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	For his pop debut, the pope had no direct involvement -- all the  
work used existing recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though several trade magazines said we had signed the  
pope, unfortunately, that is not true,'' Gelb said.

<HEADLINE> FBI May Curtail Rudolph Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI may reduce the number of agents  
assigned to the year-old hunt for a suspected bomber in a remote 
area of North Carolina, Director Louis Freeh said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 investigative officers from the FBI, the Bureau of  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local sheriffs departments are 
hunting for fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph in the 530,000-acre 
Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area at the state's western 
tip. 
</P>
<P>
	The two federal agencies have a total of about 50 investigators  
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents of the area, while grateful for the lengthy  
manhunt, nevertheless are feeling a little overwhelmed, said Rep. 
Charles Taylor, R-N.C.. 
</P>
<P>
	``My office gets complaints about helicopters flying over church  
and about being stopped by uniformed officers all the time. They 
wonder how long the FBI is going to be in there,'' said Taylor, who 
serves on the House Appropriations Committee's panel on commerce, 
justice, state and judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, testifying before the panel, said: ``We are very  
sensitive to the community. ... We try to be as low-profile as you 
can be conducting a search like this. We are looking to modify 
those resources to some degree in terms of downsizing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not captured Rudolph, but the manhunt has had  
some positive results, Freeh told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do feel that our presence there has prevented him from  
committing more bombings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta-area bombings,  
including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in Atlanta, in which a 
woman died. Investigators also suspect he was involved in a January 
1998 explosion that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at the 
New Woman All Women Health Care in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reported sighting of Rudolph since July 11,  
when health food store owner George Nordmann told authorities 
Rudolph had come to his home in nearby Nantahala and taken six 
months' worth of food and supplies.

<HEADLINE>  Auburn-OSU More Than Porter &AMP; Penn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien doesn't  
have to be convinced that Auburn is more than Chris Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien is particularly impressed by what Scott Pohlman has done  
for Auburn in the NCAA tournament. The 6-foot-2, 160-pound guard 
known as ``Opie'' matched the scoring output of Ohio State's 
leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at our team and they look at Michael Redd, and  
everybody equates Michael Redd with a guy that's going to score 
points,'' O'Brien said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at them, you don't normally look at Pohlman as a  
guy that is going to score a lot of points. You never hear about 
him when you talk about Auburn, so I think that is an indicator 
that they certainly have more than just one player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is the only new starter this season for an Auburn team  
that has had five straight winning records, but is in the NCAA for 
the first time since 1988. He was the Southeastern Conference's 
newcomer and player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Porter, having gained the attention of extra defenders  
during the postseason, is Auburn's fourth-leading scorer in the 
NCAA tournament with 9 points a game -- seven below his team-leading 
season average. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for Pohlman's career-high 28 points in an 81-74 victory  
over Oklahoma State last weekend, top-seeded Auburn (29-3) might be 
at home instead of playing Ohio State (25-8) tonight in the South 
Regional semifinals at Thompson-Boling Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Opie, he's been like that. He knows the game, doesn't take bad  
shots and takes advantage of his opportunities,'' Auburn coach 
Cliff Ellis said. ``He doesn't look like he can, but he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Pohlman and Redd have been key postseason scorers for  
their teams -- each scoring a combined 42 points in the first two 
NCAA games -- newcomers Porter and Scoonie Penn get most of the 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Players of the year in their respective conferences -- Porter in  
the SEC and Penn in the Big Ten -- the junior transfers helped 
Auburn and Ohio State end extended absences from the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Porter, Penn is also the only new starter on his team, but  
has struggled in the postseason. After shooting 47 percent in the 
regular season, Penn is a combined 31 percent (15-of-48) in the Big 
10 and NCAA tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Penn is one of the reasons the Buckeyes are in the NCAA  
tournament for the first time since 1992. And it was something he 
told his teammates even before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how the other kids on the team responded, but I  
was the one that responded like I thought he was off the wall,'' 
said O'Brien, who had Penn for NCAA appearances at Boston College 
in 1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn experienced some success before Porter. Ohio State was  
8-22 and finished last in the Big Ten at 1-15, while Penn sat out 
last season following his transfer from Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted us to be better than we were a year ago. But  
Scoonie's mentality is that when March comes around, you play in 
the NCAA tournament,'' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redd, the Buckeyes' leading scorer (19.6) and with five career  
30-point games already to his credit, said Penn was the needed 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie brought a winning attitude to this program, brought a  
lot of leadership to this team and was another scoring weapon for 
our team, which we didn't have last year,'' Redd said. ``That is 
why we are winning this year.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Helps High-Speed Internet, Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies that provide high-speed Internet and  
data services would be helped by action Thursday by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission agreed to tighten rules  
making it easier for companies to install equipment at major local 
phone companies' central offices to provide high-speed services. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised rules should take effect in one or two months.  
</P>
<P>
	The order would help companies, including Covad Communications  
and NorthPoint Communications, which provide connections letting 
businesses access information from computers at speeds considerably 
faster than regular phone lines. It also would help other companies 
that want to provide just local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's order is designed to make it cheaper and faster for  
companies that compete or want to compete against the nation's five 
Bell companies, GTE and other major local phone providers to put 
equipment inside the major companies' offices in order to provide 
competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies need to do that to provide their own competing  
phone, data or Internet access services. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said the order should spur more  
competition for all these services. 
</P>
<P>
	The order, among other things, lets the competing companies  
install a wider range of equipment than previously allowed in those 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The order also gives the competing companies, for the first  
time, the option of being able to rent a tiny amount of space, 
rather than being forced to rent a 10-foot by 10-foot fenced 
enclosure, which can be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it lets competing companies that have been denied space to  
inspect the major companies' offices for verification. 
</P>
<P>
	Covad said the FCC's order could help the company provide  
services to more areas by ``reducing some of the bureaucracy and 
cost'' of installing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth does not believe the revised rules are necessary,  
saying it already offers rivals some of the options. Bell Atlantic 
said it needs to study the details of the FCC's order before taking 
a position on the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the FCC proposed licensing rules for companies that  
want to provide telephone and data services by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC said it has enough airwaves space to accommodate all  
nine companies -- including Iridium, Globalstar and Boeing -- that 
have expressed interest in getting a license. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also said it would look into whether licensed companies  
should have to provide 911 service that lets emergency dispatchers 
know the location of callers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC hopes to have a final licensing plan by the fall or  
winter and would start licensing companies shortly after that.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Firefighters Declare Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THEDFORD, Neb. (AP) -- Hundreds of exhausted firefighters  
declared victory today over flare-ups from a massive prairie fire 
that has consumed more than 50,000 acres of range land. They also 
mourned one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas County Attorney Warren Arganbright said 45-year-old  
Charles J. Vodak, a volunteer firefighter from nearby Dunning, died 
of an apparent heart attack while battling the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodak, who was single, died at 9:20 p.m. CST Tuesday at the Reed  
Hamilton Ranch headquarters, about nine miles north of the 
junctions of State Highways 83 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was being done today in Kearney.  
</P>
<P>
	Another firefighter suffered smoke inhalation and several other  
minor injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news after two nearly-sleepless days for hundreds of  
firefighters was that all flare-ups were declared under control or 
out by 8 p.m. CST Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it looks like a done deal,'' said Duane Morrow of  
the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency. ``We're just doing a 
little mop-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said all fires were out this morning. They revised  
the number of acres burned to 60,000 to 70,000 acres, including 
2,000 acres that burned late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Carpenter, District Ranger at the Nebraska National Forest  
and the McKelvie National Forest, said his crews, as well as some 
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, were patrolling the area today to guard against any 
flare-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the crews consisted of about 19 people using seven grass  
trucks, each of which carry about 300 gallons of water. 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday evening, firefighters had nearly extinguished a  
flare-up about three miles west of Thedford. Flames sent dozens of 
firefighters scurrying in small trucks over the charred hills to 
reengage the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Thick black, brown and white smoke obscured the setting sun as a  
wall of fire roared over the Middle Loup River valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Crop dusters from nearby towns -- pressed into service to pour  
water and fire retardant on hot spots -- buzzed the fire like 
divebombers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanned by gusty winds Tuesday and Wednesday, the fire charred a  
40-mile long swath of north-central Nebraska grassland about 300 
miles northwest of Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 300 people were evacuated in and around Thedford before  
emergency managers declared victory over the blaze Wednesday 
morning. Wind gusts up to 45 mph caused problems soon after. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds diminished at sunset, and scores of firefighters swarmed  
local gas stations and stores for much-needed refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Johanns declared a state of emergency to make state  
resources available to help fight the fire. National Guard members 
were alerted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen some prairie fires, but this was truly incredible,''  
Johanns said. ``That ranchland is burned up, and it's not going to 
grow back for a while. Any cattle and calves that got in the way of 
that fire in all likelihood are lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said some $2 million in state emergency funds could be  
available. The state also established a hotline for people 
interested in helping ranchers who lost stores of feed in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire, believed to have started Tuesday, was not  
immediately known. The governor said a charred -- and apparently 
abandoned -- farmstead 10 miles north and five miles west of Mullen 
appeared to be the starting point. 
</P>
<P>
	The starting point was five miles east of a ranch owned by media  
mogul Ted Turner, who raises bison in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The path of the fire was up to 10 miles wide in places. One  
rural house was destroyed and officials said an unknown number of 
cattle perished in the sparsely settled region. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Westover of the Nebraska Forest Service said the estimated  
damage made the fire Nebraska's second largest. The first also 
started near Mullen in 1972. Satellite images showed that fire 
burned about 75,000 acres.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury To Get Fight Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight is  
over. The investigations into the result are just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	While a district attorney is already looking into possible  
criminal activity surrounding the bout, many of the principals 
involved in the bout were due to testify today at a state Senate 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has convened a  
grand jury to issue subpoenas and gather testimony about the 
controversial draw at Saturday's heavyweight championship 
reunification fight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgenthau's spokeswoman, Barbara Thompson, declined Wednesday  
to discuss what illegalities, if any, he thinks were involved in 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be  
identified, said: ``We could be looking at tampering or illegal 
payments. Then again, maybe we're looking at lousy judging, which 
is not a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those to appear in New York City at a hearing of the state  
Senate Committee on Investigations are promoters Don King and Dino 
Duva, Lewis' American promoter; Bob Lee, the IBF president; referee 
Arthur Mercante Jr., and Eugenia Williams, the IBF-picked judge who 
had Holyfield winning the fight many believed Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	Slated to testify by phone were Larry O'Connell of England, the  
WBC judge who scored the fight a draw; Stanley Christodoulou of 
South Africa, the WBA judge who declared Lewis the winner; and WBC 
president Jose Sulaiman. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's hearing was expected to focus on the judging of  
Saturday's fight, the relationships between the sanctioning bodies 
and the boxing industry and health issues involving fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer canceled a public hearing  
scheduled for Friday involving many of the same people who were to 
appear today and will offer Morgenthau's investigators ``any and 
all assistance in their attempt to pursue a criminal case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York state Athletic Commission is also investigating the  
Holyfield-Lewis draw. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who sat ringside at the bout,  
said Wednesday that state athletic commissions must take the lead 
in reforming professional boxing and not wait for the federal 
government to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, the IBF president, defended the work of Williams, the judge  
his organization selected for the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure they aren't going to find anything irregular at  
all,'' he said. ``It is a subjective viewing of a fight and you 
can't tell these judges what to see or what not to see. All I tell 
them is, `Do the best you can.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a $39,200-a-year municipal employee in Atlantic City,  
N.J., filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 25, according to a story in 
today's New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
	When Williams was asked about the filing she said, ``I don't  
know what you're talking about,'' according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, the Star-Ledger of Newark said federal  
investigators are looking into allegations of corruption in 
professional boxing, including kickback schemes between fighters 
and promoters. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe also is investigating whether the International Boxing  
Federation and Lee sold rankings and arranged for fights in return 
for kickbacks from fighters and their promoters, according to the 
Star-Ledger. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a former New Jersey boxing commissioner removed from office  
in 1985 after a state panel ruled he violated ethics regulations, 
confirmed that the investigation exists, but denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't done anything wrong,'' Lee said in today's editions  
of the newspaper. ``We try to promote the interests of boxing. What 
they are talking about, I don't know.''

	TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Two prison inmates who claim  
they are being held for political reasons doused themselves with 
alcohol and set themselves on fire, officials in the southern state 
of Chiapas said. 
</P>
<P>
	One inmate, Daniel Diaz Perez, suffered first- and second-degree  
burns after setting himself on fire Wednesday, said Febronio 
Tovilla, medical director at Cerro Hueco prison in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, the state capital. The other inmate, Jose Cruz de la 
Porte, suffered less serious burns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men are charged with kidnapping and arms trafficking.  
They have denied the accusations and claim they are being held 
because they are activists in a group that promotes indigenous 
rights. They have been on a hunger strike for a month. 
</P>

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela and Iran agreed Thursday to  
swap some oil customers in Europe and the Americas, hoping to cut 
transportation costs and boost profits for both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, announced by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal  
Kharrazi, Iran will distribute oil to some of Venezuela's customers 
in Europe. In return, Venezuela will supply some of Iran's 
customers in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the two countries are to meet March 21 in London  
to work out details of the agreement, Venezuelan Energy and Mines 
Minister Ali Rodriquez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low in recent months,  
helping provoke economic troubles that include a $9 billion fiscal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kharrazi, in Venezuela for a three-day visit, and Venezuelan

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's Congress voted Thursday to  
approve a financial transactions tax seen as key to the success of 
the government's fiscal reform program. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which slaps a 0.38 percent tax on all banking  
transactions, passed the Chamber of Deputies 357-125 with one 
abstention. The measure was approved by the Senate earlier this 
year and should go into effect in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The government expects the tax to yield about $4.8 billion this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax was the last piece of a broad government fiscal program  
that formed the backbone of an agreement with international lenders 
for $41.5 billion in aid. Approval of the tax should pave the way 
for release of a second tranche of funding, worth about $9 billion, 
in early April, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement between Brazil and the IMF requires stiff  
austerity measures.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Balk at Kosovo Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration warned that ``NATO  
will act'' against Serb targets if Yugoslav leader Slobodan 
Milosevic doesn't accept the peace accord ethnic Albanians signed 
in Paris on Thursday. Those warnings drew a skeptical response on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs will be responsible for the consequences,'' said  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Republican leaders, unhappy with the administration's  
depiction of developments, late Thursday demanded a face-to-face 
meeting with President Clinton on Friday to discuss the escalating 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were not satisfied with what they heard'' at a  
closed-door briefing for senators by Albright and other top 
administration officials, said John Czwartacki, spokesman for 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. He said both Republican 
and Democratic senators had voiced their frustrations at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	He said sentiment in the GOP-ruled Congress had changed from  
``qualified support'' for administration policy ``to real serious 
debate over whether we should be heading into a long, drawn-out 
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president agreed to see the leaders at 10:30 EST Friday, a  
White House spokesman said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be making clear that the United States has a clear  
national interest in preventing a wider war from spreading in 
Kosovo,'' said spokesman David Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the Air Force's chief of staff, Gen. Michael Ryan, said  
Milosevic's forces are well-prepared and well-equipped for a U.S. 
airstrike. ``There is a distinct possibility we will lose 
aircraft,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan and other top military commanders testified at a Senate  
hearing as negotiators on the Albanian side of the Kosovo dispute 
signed a peace agreement in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the talks teetering on the verge of collapse because of  
the Serbs' refusal to sign the accord, Yugoslav forces appeared to 
be mobilizing for all-out war. The ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo 
Information Center reported large movements of Yugoslav army and 
police forces throughout Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart warned that  
``NATO will act if President Milosevic and the Serbs, through their 
intransigence at the talks or through further aggression, resist 
finding some political settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of a Serbian buildup of troops along the Kosovo border, Lockhart  
said, ``Any buildup is of concern. Any further aggression here we 
would view as a grave mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Albright, speaking with reporters as she prepared to brief  
senators on the latest developments, said she had a message for 
Milosevic: ``NATO stands ready to take whatever measures are 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate had been poised to debate a move by Sen. Kay Bailey  
Hutchison, R-Texas, to sharply restrict funds for any U.S. military 
operation in Kosovo. But Senate leaders late Thursday postponed the 
debate until Monday after hearing from the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would be binding and would deny funds for any  
U.S. involvement in a peacekeeping operation unless approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, emerging from the closed-door briefing, said he continues  
to have ``significant reservations'' about the possibility of NATO 
airstrikes followed by possible U.S. ground troops in Kosovo. ``We 
need to be advised what the risks are. And the American people need 
to have a better understanding what the United States national 
security interests are, if any.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison told reporters, ``I am more convinced than ever that  
this is a mistake at this time.'' She said she would move ahead to 
try to get a Senate vote on whether the United States should become 
involved again militarily in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she had spoken to Kosovo's Albanian leaders by  
phone, ``and I congratulated them for their courage and vision in 
signing the agreement negotiated in Paris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, she said, ``the Serbian negotiators have gone  
backwards,'' refusing to even discuss the possibility of a NATO 
peacekeeping force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there can be no agreement if the Serbs do not sign,  
and right now there is no sign that the Serbs will agree,'' 
Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is as clear as it could be. The Albanians have  
said yes to the accords and the Serbs are saying no,'' she added. 
She said if Belgrade doesn't reverse course, ``the Serbs will be 
responsible for the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's air defenses are sophisticated and heavily  
defended, Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, told the Senate Armed 
Services Committee earlier Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are very good. So taking on these defenses with air  
power will not be easy,'' he said. ``There is a distinct 
possibility we will lose aircraft in trying to penetrate those 
defenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said that the air-defense capability ``not just in Kosovo  
but within the whole Yugoslav land mass'' includes many 
surface-to-air missiles and other weaponry capable of shooting down 
U.S. warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This defense array is much more substantive than'' in Bosnia  
by a factor of two or three times, Ryan said. Airstrikes helped 
bring about peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, which in 1995 helped end 
civil war in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be tremendously dangerous,'' Marine Corps  
Commandant Gen. Charles Krulak agreed. Serbian air defense systems 
``are, in many instances, mobile. The terrain is very tough. And 
the weather cannot be underestimated. That can be a show-stopper in 
many ways,'' Krulak said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some ``bottom-line questions'' still need to be  
answered: ``What is the endgame? How long will the strike go on? 
Will our allies stay with us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes against Serbian positions if the  
Albanian side in the peace talks signs the proposed peace 
settlement and Milosevic's Serbian delegation does not -- the 
current situation. 
</P>
<P>
	While first strikes would likely be sea-launched and  
air-launched missiles, warplanes flown by pilots probably would 
have to eventually go in, the military commanders suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations, told the panel,  
``We should be under no illusions that this would be easy. The risk 
is high, in my view.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil TV Host Snarls Ransom Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- He is Brazil's answer to Jerry  
Springer, a TV ``shockmeister'' who thrives on the outrageous. But 
now, Carlos Massa may have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	Massa is accused of thwarting the release of a kidnapping victim  
by going on national TV with an offer to create a telephone hotline 
to help raise money for the ransom. After Massa got involved, the 
kidnappers upped their demand -- from $300,000 to $2 million -- and 
sent a piece of the victim's ear to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident pushed the kidnapping of Wellington Camargo, the  
brother of Brazilian country music star Zeze di Camargo, from the 
crime page to the front page of Brazilian newspapers. The case has 
drawn the attention of top Cabinet ministers and raised a debate 
about media ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	Camargo, who is paraplegic, was kidnapped in December near his  
home in the midwestern state of Goias. Negotiations between the 
kidnappers and Camargo's relatives had dragged on for months, 
until, the family says, a ransom of $300,000 was finally agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last week, Massa -- known to millions of TV viewers by his  
stage name ``Ratinho,'' Portuguese for Mouse -- got involved, 
calling on his viewers to make donations toward the ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw that, I said: It's all gone down the drain,'' Zeze  
di Camargo said in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the program aired, the kidnappers left a note outside  
a TV station with their new ransom demand -- and the piece of ear 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Massa's meddling sparked a national outcry.  
</P>
<P>
	An editorial in the Rio newspaper O Globo said Massa's actions,  
``in addition to breaking the law, violates the code of ethics of a 
TV announcer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Communications Minister Jose Pimenta da Veiga called the  
proposal ``hasty, inopportune and irresponsible.'' Justice Minister 
Renan Calheiros said he would study ways to punish Massa. 
</P>
<P>
	Camargo, accompanied by his brother and singing partner Luciano,  
met Thursday with Pimenta da Veiga and Senate President Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes in Brasilia, the capital, where they reportedly 
discussed a new law with tougher rules on media ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	Massa said he has apologized to Camargo but felt the outcry was  
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a mistake, but it was involuntary,'' Massa said in a  
radio interview. ``It's tremendously unfair to blame this whole 
kidnapping thing on a TV show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camargo said the family was waiting for the kidnappers to get in  
touch again -- and praying they would not make good on their threat 
to cut off his brother's other ear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just hope the bandits will negotiate, and we'll start all  
over again from zero,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Rejects U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Vietnam issued a sharp rebuke Thursday to  
a U.N. report on religious freedom, saying it will no longer allow 
investigations into human-rights issues or religious affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came two days after U.N. investigator  
Abdelfattah Amor reported that Vietnam maintains elaborate controls 
over all religious groups to prevent the emergence of any 
organization that might rival the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Amor said state interference includes controls over the programs  
of religious organizations, the training and recruitment of clergy, 
the building of places of worship and the printing of religious 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	While welcoming foreigners engaged in business and  
``humanitarian purposes,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Le Sy Vuong 
Ha said outside investigators were not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vietnam does not accept any individual or organization going  
to Vietnam with the intention of carrying out an investigation... 
because it interferes into Vietnam's internal affairs,'' he told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement comes amid concern about a conservative backlash  
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissident Nguyen Thanh Giang was arrested March 4 for allegedly  
possessing anti-communist documents, a move that some Western 
diplomats saw as a warning to authors of recent letters criticizing 
the party for alleged corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Amor said despite government guarantees of access to anyone he  
wanted to see, he was prevented from meeting some leaders of 
unsanctioned religions. 
</P>
<P>
	Any religion not officially recognized by the Vietnamese  
government is considered superstition that must be stamped out. 
That includes unsanctioned sects of Buddhism and other religions. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, Vietnam claimed Thursday that Amor had unfettered  
access. It called his 30-page report, which is to be presented next 
week to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, ``not objective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups say church leaders have been jailed because  
of their religious practices. Officials deny they hold any 
religious or political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddhism is the primary religion among Vietnam's 78 million  
people. Important minority religions include the Roman Catholic and 
Protestant churches, and the indigenous Cao Dai and Hoa Hao. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations with the Vatican thawed slightly last year. The  
Vatican's deputy foreign minister, Celestino Migliore, wraps up a 
five-day visit on Friday that has been aimed at establishing 
diplomatic relations and paving the way for a pope visit.

<HEADLINE> Wood Has Always Feared Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood had been dreading this since he  
was 12 years old, when replays of Dave Dravecky's chilling injury 
flashed over and over on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	While vendors sold spring training programs with Wood's picture  
on the cover, his season is over after just 26 spring training 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	If he's lucky, he'll be back early in 2000. If he's not -- well,  
there's no telling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about this from the first time I saw the video --  
I can't remember his name now -- he threw one pitch and his arm 
broke,'' Wood said, remembering Dravecky's injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's teammates were on the field, getting ready to play the  
Arizona Diamondbacks. Wood, in blue jeans and a cap as black as the 
Cubs' mood, was up in a luxury suite, talking about how doctors 
will take a ligament from his left wrist and transplant it into his 
right elbow to replace the one he tore Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old right-hander, the NL Rookie of the Year, is not  
even sure if he'll return for the start of the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even had the surgery yet. It's too early to think  
about when I'm going to be back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His 95 mph fastball, the one that delighted baseball last  
summer, the one that enabled him to strike out a record-tying 20 
against Houston last May, might never come back. He talked about 
how it was the work ethic of the individual that would make the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played with guys who had the surgery,'' he said.  
``Sometimes guys were throwing harder and pitching better than 
before they were hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehabilitation usually takes about a year, but sometimes it's  
less and sometimes it's more. He's had elbow pain since high 
school, but refused to blame the injury on his coaches, amateur and 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say it was inevitable,'' he said. ``From the time  
my velocity picked up and I started to throw harder, I felt it 
could happen on any given day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood had only 13 of the Cubs' 90 wins last season, but he  
brought excitement to Wrigley Field and everywhere he went. He was 
the next Nolan Ryan, the next Roger Clemens, a flamethrower from 
Texas who grabbed headlines with his heater. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the day he pitched, you'd go to the ballpark with an extra  
bounce in your step,'' Cubs president Andy MacPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood will get a second opinion, just to make sure he needs the  
transplant, then choose Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Anaheim Angels team 
physician, or Dr. James Andrews to put his elbow back together. 
</P>
<P>
	When he comes back, he'll have to change his delivery some more,  
taking stress off the reconstructed elbow. The Cubs had tried to 
get him to stop throwing across his body, to plant his left foot 
another seven or eight inches toward the middle of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to change when you're throwing the ball good,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came his first warmup pitch before the second inning  
against Anaheim at Tempe. It was about 10 feet above the ground. 
Wood knew something was wrong but kept on pitching, still throwing 
95 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't something that startled me or gave me a great deal  
of pain,'' he said. ``Pitchers have kinks early in the spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kink turned out to be a major breakdown, a torn ulnar  
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	With opening day nearly three weeks away, Wrigley's bleachers  
bums already had reason to cry in their beers. 
</P>
<P>
	For a franchise searching for its first pennant since 1945 and  
its first World Series title since 1908, Wood was the hope. Yes, 
Sammy Sosa provided the power, but pitching wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Cubs fans are ready to write off the team for the rest of  
the century, not surprising given its history. Wood says they 
shouldn't give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because one player goes out, to say the whole season is  
shot, that's not fair,'' he said. ``We have a great team and I 
think we're going to bounce back.''

<HEADLINE> House Ponders Own Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top House leaders are weighing a plan to help  
lawmakers to a cost of living increase, a boost that could add 
about $5,000 to an annual salary of $136,673. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., raised the issue at a meeting  
earlier this year with Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, according 
to aides to the two men. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert told reporters today that current law permits members of  
Congress to have a raise and that many of them need it to support 
families with children, some of whom are in college. ``They need to 
have a life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters today that leaders in both  
parties are consulting with their rank and file. He said he thought 
a periodic cost of living increase ``is appropriate.'' He added 
that the House should vote publicly on any recommended increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress last received an increase two years ago,  
after the Republican and Democratic leadership agreed not to make a 
political issue of the subject. In other years, lawmakers have 
voted to stop the increase from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no noticeable public backlash against the 1997  
pay increase, some lawmakers objected at the time. The issue would 
almost certainly provoke debate on the House floor again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1989 law, lawmakers are entitled to a cost of living  
increase that is pegged to the pay raise the president proposes 
each year for federal workers. President Clinton recommended a 4.4 
percent increase for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. A 4 
percent increase in congressional pay would amount to more than 
$5,400 and raise the salary to more than $142,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While aides said a cost-of-living increase stands a good chance  
of taking effect, a separate proposal for an increase in 
compensation seemed to be faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion, floated by Rep. Bill Thomas of California, would  
allow most lawmakers to claim a $125 per day allowance to defray 
their living expenses in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The allowance could be claimed for any day the House meets, to  
be paid from the funds set aside for office expenses. Thus, any 
money the lawmaker claimed personally would have to come from staff 
salaries or other expenses such as equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Congress met for little more than a third of the year,  
lawmakers would be eligible for more than $14,000 in increased 
compensation -- an increase of more than 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has suggested making the change administratively by a  
vote of the House Administration Committee, which he chairs, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senior aides, as well as some lawmakers, said Thomas'  
proposal had attracted interest among the members, particularly 
from lawmakers who received a similar benefit when they were 
members of state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert distanced himself from the proposal during the day.  
``There are a lot of proposals out there and the speaker does not 
endorse this one,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for the speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas issued a written statement late in the day saying the  
panel would consider the proposal ``only at the request of the 
House leadership. ... The House Administration Committee, appointed 
by the speaker and the minority leader, would be responsive to the 
leadership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other aides and lawmakers noted that any lawmaker could force a  
vote on the proposal when the regular spending bill covering 
congressional expenses goes to the floor, regardless of what action 
the House Administration Committee took. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, a cost-of-living increase has greater appeal to  
some lawmakers than the suggested per diem. Congressional pensions 
are calculated on the basis of pay, and one official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said some veteran lawmakers would rather 
have a cost of living increase than the per diem allowance, even 
though it would cost them money in the short run.

<HEADLINE> Report: Farrakhan Battling Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is gravely  
ill with an undiagnosed condition, according to the Muslim group's 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is a virus. Several doctors that were working on me have  
not found that. It's an assumption,'' The Final Call newspaper 
quoted Farrakhan, 65, as saying during a Feb. 28 speech in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, who has been treated for prostate cancer in the past,  
has been ill since early January, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan said in the speech that he lost 20 pounds and most of  
his muscle mass in less than two weeks and had ``no appetite, night 
sweats, dealing with the aftereffects of radiation therapy (for 
prostate cancer) and other things,'' according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the current illness ``took me down so fast, that it  
concerned me greatly because, though I'm nearing 66, I have never 
been sick like this in my life,'' the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking comment today from the newspaper and Farrakhan  
were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The article appears in a March 10 update of the newspaper's Web  
site.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Theft Costs Companies $4B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. businesses lose an estimated $4 billion  
annually due to high-tech theft, according to the most far-reaching 
study yet released on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But increased security by the industry's largest high-tech  
manufacturers firms has dramatically reduced their losses in recent 
years, said the study released today by an electronics trade group 
and a consortium of high-tech executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The large firms, including Texas Instruments Inc. and Intel  
Corp., are taking steps that range from improved background checks 
of employees to more discreet packaging of products in transit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trends are going in the right direction,'' said Mike  
McQuade, a senior vice president of the American Electronics 
Association. ``It's pretty good news, although the problem has not 
gone away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The electronics association and the International Electronics  
Security Group sponsored the two-year study, which was carried out 
by Santa Monica, Calif. think tank Rand Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Rand surveyed 95 high-tech manufacturers that together account  
for 40 percent of sales volume in the computer, semiconductor, hard 
disk drive and cellular telephone industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine months ending June 1998, the 95 firms reported 1,704  
thefts of equipment and parts worth nearly $35 million globally, 
including more than $17 million worth of losses in the United 
States. The incidents ranged from truck hijackings to thefts from 
the companies' offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on that data, the study estimated that $125 million worth  
of high-tech goods is stolen annually in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	The study then projected that high-tech theft costs American  
businesses $4 billion annually. The total includes the value of 
lost goods as well as indirect costs including insurance, security 
and lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not include data on theft of consumer goods from  
homes or stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, high-tech firms have begun to tighten security in recent  
years, researchers noted. Improvements include more television 
cameras and secure doors on loading docks, better inventory 
controls and more discreet packaging for shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Instruments, for example, in the last year began checking  
the backgrounds of contractors before hiring them, said Skip 
Williams, vice president of worldwide security. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also recently brought together risk management,  
security, legal and logistics departments to study how to better 
protect semiconductors in transit, said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken a few losses of our own, mostly in transit,'' said  
Williams. ``We have worked with carriers and transporters to change 
the methods in which they handle our product both at warehouses as 
well as aboard airplanes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A single shipment of semiconductors -- the components that are  
critical to making cellular phones and other electronics goods -- 
can be worth several million dollars. Thefts of such goods in 
transit has been a growing problem for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible how this property is treated. It should be  
treated like cash, but it's treated like a can of peas,'' said Rich 
Bernes, executive director of the nonprofit Technology Theft 
Prevention Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Following security improvements and other changes including more  
attention to the problem by law enforcement, 18 large firms in the 
study cut theft losses 75 percent in one year. Losses cost $80 
million in 1996 and only $21 million a year later, the study 
reported.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plan Includes $6B for Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers have included $6 billion  
in their budget resolutions to overhaul a crop insurance program 
for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Budget Committee was expected to approve the plan  
today, a day after the House Budget Committee endorsed a similar 
package. Both would allow $6 billion for the crop insurance program 
from 2001 through 2005, though the annual amount would vary. The 
program currently costs about $1.6 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing less than a triumph for America's farmers and  
ranchers,'' said the House Agriculture Committee chairman, Rep. 
Larry Combest, R-Texas. ``The $6 billion contained in the budget 
resolution guarantees us the fiscal means to strengthen the 
financial safety net for farmers. I'm confident we'll now have the 
tools to improve the risk management system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The budget resolutions are essentially a blueprint for things  
GOP leaders would like to accomplish. But they face hurdles as they 
go through the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton did not include crop insurance in his budget  
proposal but has expressed a commitment to making reforms. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has unveiled a plan that would 
cost between $2 billion and $2.5 billion more per year than current 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The commitment to overhaul crop insurance comes as farmers face  
another year of low prices in a sagging agricultural economy. Last 
year, Congress approved $6 billion in disaster insurance to help 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	With low prices expected to continue, lawmakers want to use crop  
insurance as a safety net to help farmers through the tough times. 
</P>
<P>
	That was what they envisioned when they phased out decades of  
government subsidies in the 1996 farm law. But many farmers don't 
have crop insurance, saying it's inexpensive or inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP leaders have expressed concern about whether crop  
insurance is the right way to help farmers, and many Democrats have 
maintained that even with a crop insurance overhaul, farmers will 
need millions more in assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The budget resolution clearly does not respond to the present  
crisis in agriculture,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., who chairs the Senate Agriculture  
Committee, said during a hearing Wednesday on crop insurance that 
he is unsure whether insurance is the best solution. ``Before 
committing additional funds, I believe we should consider 
fundamental questions about crop insurance and the government's 
role,'' Lugar said.

<HEADLINE> Derby Favorite Exploit Is Retired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- A third Kentucky Derby victory for  
trainer Bob Baffert would be quite an exploit. 
</P>
<P>
	If it is achieved, however, it will be without one of his best  
3-year-old prospects, Exploit. 
</P>
<P>
	The early favorite for the Derby has been retired because of a  
bone chip in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had surgery it would be eight or nine months before he  
could come back, and after knee surgery they don't come back as 
good,'' Baffert said Wednesday. ``He's worth more money at 
breeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred Saturday when Exploit finished second to  
Prime Timber, another Baffert-trained Derby hopeful, in the San 
Felipe at Santa Anita. It was Exploit's first loss in six starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert, who won the 1997 Kentucky Derby with Silver Charm and  
last year with Real Quiet, said that after the colt walked Tuesday 
morning, a filling was discovered in the knee. X-rays disclosed the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploit, owned by Bob and Beverley Lewis, won all four starts as  
a 2-year-old and began his 3-year-old campaign by winning the San 
Vicente on Feb. 6 at Santa Anita. Two of his victories at 2 were in 
the Iroquois and the Kentucky Jockey Club at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also trains two other Derby hopefuls -- Straight Man,  
also owned by the Lewises, and General Challenge. Straight Man is 
unbeaten in two career starts. Top 3-year-old fillies 
Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting also are trained by Baffert. 
Neither is headed for the Derby at this time.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Invests $1.4B in Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp.'s $1.4  
billion Spaceway satellite system, scheduled to debut in 2002, will 
give consumers access to inexpensive, high-speed computer links, 
including Internet and video conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will be able to transmit and receive data, voice,  
video, audio and multimedia via a pair of satellites orbiting Earth 
but only pay for the amount of bandwidth needed to communicate with 
high-speed corporate networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be as easy as picking up your telephone today,''  
Hughes chairman Michael T. Smith said Wednesday during a telephone 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will no longer have to go through a retransmission  
service or hub but will be able to communicate directly via 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Spaceway ``the most advanced satellite platform in the  
world,'' Smith said users will see a 20 percent to 30 percent cost 
reduction over current land-based systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Spaceway will provide access for everyone from large businesses  
to home office users to two-way, high speed applications including 
desktop video conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large businesses, telecommuters, small office, home office or  
solo users and consumers will have easy access to two-way, 
broadband multimedia applications such as desktop 
videoconferencing, interactive distance learning, commuter 
networking and many other intra- and internet services,'' said 
Pradman P. Kaul, chief operating officer of Hughes Network Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, through its Hughes Network Systems unit, will develop  
terminals and ground infrastructure. Another subsidiary, PanAmSat, 
will operate the telemetry and Hughes-owned DirecTV will market 
several data services to subscribers. DirecTV has about 4.5 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two operational Spaceway satellites and one spare, built by  
Hughes in El Segundo, will be placed in geosynchronous orbit in 
late 2001, Kaul said. The launch site has yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The first system is expected to begin in North America in 2002  
and eventually be marketed in regions worldwide.

<HEADLINE> FCC Approves New Phone Rate Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a few clicks of a computer mouse,  
telephone customers could scan the Internet for the current prices 
that long-distance companies charge for their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, in a 4-1 vote Thursday,  
adopted rules that eventually could require AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, 
Sprint and other long-distance carriers to post such information on 
their corporate Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The major long-distance companies say they already voluntarily  
provide information about rates on their Web sites. But the FCC 
plan, assuming it takes effect, would force them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's requirement would cover a wide range of services, from  
domestic long-distance calls to calling-card calls to directory 
assistance. It would not include information on international 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should be able to do comparison shopping for  
long-distance service just as easily as they can do it in the 
grocery store,'' FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would have to provide information on domestic  
rates -- including the terms and conditions of service -- in a timely 
manner and updated regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	If rates or services are changed, that would have to be posted,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the FCC would not specify when information must be  
posted, how often it must be updated or where it would appear on 
the companies' corporate Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, who dissented, said  
long-distance companies ``don't need any federal mandates to say, 
`If you don't do this you'll be in big trouble.' ... They want to 
tell consumers what their prices are because that's what consumers 
demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's requirement goes hand-in-hand with a 1996 order, which  
never took effect, intended to free long-distance companies from 
having to file federal tariffs outlining their rates or service 
changes to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, long-distance companies continue to file that  
information with the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's action Thursday does not affect that 1996 order, which  
is being challenged by MCI WorldCom and others in federal court 
here. But the public disclosure requirement would not take effect 
unless the court upholds the FCC's 1996 order involving federal 
tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's Washington  
office, said the public disclosure requirement would help make 
consumers more aware of rate changes. But he noted it would not 
help those who do not own computers. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the FCC also required long-distance companies to  
post current rate information in some of their offices. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T said they are not opposed to the public  
disclosure, but repeated their opposition to getting rid of federal 
tariffs. Sprint, however, doesn't like the disclosure requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the century-old doctrine, long-distance companies may  
charge only the rates for services they have filed with the FCC. 
The tariff trumps all other agreements with customers, verbal or 
otherwise. Some critics contend the arrangement lets companies slip 
rate changes by customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T contend that in the absence of  
tariffs, companies would have to enter into some other contract 
with customers each time rates or services were changed. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make it harder for them to offer new discount plans  
or promotions featuring free or cheap calls, they note. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kimmelman and other critics said that consumers would be  
better served by posting rate information online than by putting it 
in tariffs, which the average long-distance customer does not see. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming the court upholds the FCC on its decision to eliminate  
tariffs, officials contemplate that long-distance companies 
voluntarily would move toward a more ``contractual relationship'' 
with customers -- along the lines of credit-card companies that 
provide notice in the mail when terms change.

<HEADLINE> GOP Questions Farm Disaster Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, appearing  
before exasperated lawmakers Thursday, defended an expected 
eight-month delay in getting $2.3 billion in emergency disaster aid 
to farmers. ``We're doing the best we can,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman informed Congress last week it would probably be June  
before the money could be distributed to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers, who included the money in a $6 billion emergency  
disaster aid package passed in October, were openly frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress wrote the nation's farmers and ranchers a check,''  
said House Agriculture Committee chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas. 
``Mr. Secretary, when are you going to cash it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not rocket science. This is not splitting the atom.  
This is something the department has done before,'' Combest said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rep. Bill Barrett, R-Neb., ``There's a lot of hurt out  
there. I think USDA is adding to that hurt and this is 
disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Glickman said the massive aid package, which  
included provisions for everyone from dairy to grain farmers, was 
``complex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have gotten the money out in January,''  
Glickman said. ``We created a program from scratch. We're doing the 
best we can under these circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the criticisms, many GOP lawmakers said they were open  
to the possibility of another disaster package this year. The low 
prices that plagued the agricultural economy last year are expected 
to continue through much of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem hasn't gone away,'' Combest said. He said the  
situation was as bad or worse than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year, prices for commodities like soybeans and corn  
have slipped to record lows while livestock prices have also 
lagged. Hog prices, for instance, at one point fell to $8 per 
hundred pounds -- the lowest in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA distributed $2.8 billion in payments to compensate for low  
prices shortly after the package was passed. But distributing the 
disaster payments, which cover disasters and disease, has become a 
more complex task, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	One complication is that the emergency package covered farmers  
who have suffered crop losses over several years before 1998 or who 
had losses only in 1998 -- a provision that has taken an enormous 
amount of time to compile, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the disaster package included seven new programs,  
including aid for livestock and dairy farmers, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	As lawmakers debated the delay, a few Republicans were trying to  
draw attention to the problems in agriculture in hopes of pushing 
even more reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Thune of South Dakota, along with Reps. Jo Ann Emerson  
of Missouri, Rick Hill of Montana and Wes Watkins of Oklahoma, have 
been lobbying GOP leaders for a series of steps to help farmers, 
including price supports that could cost billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the agitators,'' Thune said at a news conference  
Thursday. ``You've got to start somewhere when you want to start a 
revolution.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Scores With Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Maybe commissioner Paul Tagliabue was watching ESPN last month  
and saw the Pro Bowlers' Tour using instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
	Or he might have been one of the few tuned in to NHL games and  
saw them go to the tape to see if a skate was in the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the case, the NFL has finally brought back instant  
replay. It was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	The league abandoned it after the 1991 season because the system  
didn't work smoothly and games were lagging. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a poor year for officiating, and everyone agrees  
they need instant replay,'' said Fox analyst John Madden. ``What 
surprises me with all the people and all the brains, they haven't 
come up with a system that works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they should have called PBA commissioner Mark Gerberich.  
</P>
<P>
	The PBA implemented instant replay in the mid-1990s and used it  
in February's Columbia 300 to correctly determine that one of its 
bowlers fouled by crossing the line before releasing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to use everything possible to make the right  
decision,'' Gerberich said. ``We have also used it to see if a 
pinsetter caused a pin to fall or if it fell on its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL began using it the same year it was removed from the  
NFL. It wasn't without faults, but instead of giving up on the 
system, they altered it. 
</P>
<P>
	When it first began, the referee was the only one allowed to  
decide whether to review a goal. This year, the video goal judge, 
stationed upstairs, also has the authority to decide to look at the 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's decision came at least one year too late, but it's  
nice to see that the NFL is finally placing the game's integrity 
ahead of its length. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *CLEANING UP:* HBO's Lou DiBella isn't saying that boxing's  
sanctioning bodies have taken money. But in the wake of the 
controversial draw between heavyweights Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis, he says reform is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sport doesn't stink, but the governance of the sport  
does,'' said DiBella, HBO Sports' senior vice president. ``The 
problem is with the sanctioning bodies and the promoters, who 
license the judges. The selection has to change. It's dirty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiBella also believes Eugenia Williams should never judge  
another fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying she took a check, but there is no way a  
competent person could judge the fifth round to Holyfield.''

continues to shine as the anchor of CBS' sports coverage.

<P>
	He nearly single-handedly kept the NFL pregame show afloat  
despite working with three rookies, all of whom have been either 
reassigned or fired. 
</P>
<P>
	After the AFC championship game in mid-January, Nantz worked the  
golf beat for most of February. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked only four college basketball games with Final Four  
partner Billy Packer prior to the NCAA tournament, but hasn't 
missed a beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think at a very young age, he's about the best I've ever  
been involved with,'' Packer said. ``He's a consummate professional

Bob Costas and Dick Enberg.''

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Surges to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit soared to an all-time  
high of $17 billion in January as global financial troubles pushed 
U.S. exports down further while imports of autos, consumer goods 
and food were climbing to record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit shot up  
21 percent from December's $14.1 billion level and surpassed the 
old monthly record of $16.7 billion set last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe the deficit in 1999 will easily surpass the  
record $169.3 billion imbalance set last year as the global 
financial crisis further depresses the ability of American 
manufacturers and farmers to sell in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Commenting on today's report, Commerce Secretary William Daley  
noted that the decline in U.S. exports was accelerating as the 
global troubles that began in Asia have now spread to Russia and 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must all focus on improving economic conditions abroad  
while ensuring that foreign markets are open to American firms,'' 
Daley told reporters at a briefing on the trade report. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports today showing low inflation and continued strong  
labor markets helped push stocks and bond prices higher on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the loss of markets for U.S. exporters, the  
plunge in currency values and recessions overseas triggered a flood 
of products into the United States, which has continued to post 
strong economic growth despite the global troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	That strong growth has sent U.S. unemployment to its lowest  
level in three decades despite the fact that manufacturing has 
eliminated 337,000 jobs over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the  
exceptionally good labor conditions are continuing with the number 
of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment 
benefits holding under 300,000 for the seventh consecutive week -- 
the longest such streak since 1974. Claims last week were 298,000, 
up 6,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	And the U.S. economy has seen benefits from the overseas  
troubles, especially on the inflation front where the flood of 
cheaper imports and weakened global demand for commodities such as 
oil has dampened prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Confirming that trend, the Labor Department said today that  
consumer prices edged up just 0.1 percent in February, leaving 
prices so far this year rising at a rate of just 1.1 percent, even 
better than last year's 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For January, U.S. exports dropped 1.4 percent to $76.8 billion,  
the lowest level since August. The weakness reflected declines in 
sales of farm products, including corn, cotton and wheat, civilian 
aircraft and autos. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports soared 2 percent to $93.8 billion last month as demand  
for autos and auto parts, consumer products and food all rose to 
all-time highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The widening gap in what America is able to sell overseas vs.  
what it imports has become a major political headache for President 
Clinton. Critics charge that Clinton's free trade policies have 
been a failure that has cost thousands of American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rebuke to the administration's free trade policies, the  
House on Wednesday passed by a lopsided 289-141 vote a bill that 
would clamp tight limits on the amount of steel that could be 
imported into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	While opponents argued that the bill violates global trade rules  
administered by the World Trade Organization, supporters won the 
House vote with the potent political argument that America's steel 
industry was being decimated by a flood of cheap imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel quota bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate,  
but its passage in the House sends a signal that protectionist 
pressures are growing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has argued that America, with the strongest  
economy in the world, must do its part to restore global growth by 
accepting higher imports. The administration is offering U.S. 
steelmakers more limited relief by expediting cases the industry 
filed to raise tariffs on a case-by-case basis on steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	For January, America's trade deficit with China shot up 23  
percent to $4.9 billion, as U.S. exports to that country fell to 
their lowest level in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Japan narrowed by 22 percent in January  
to $4.7 billion. Clinton warned Japan in his State of the Union 
address that unless its shipments of steel into the United States 
dropped dramatically, his administration would open its own unfair 
trading investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Pacific Rim countries, the epicenter of  
the global crisis, rose by 7.8 percent in January to $12.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe that with one-third of the globe in  
recession, the U.S. deficit will continue to widen this year. Many 
believe that the key to a global recovery lies in Japan, the 
world's second largest economy, adopting policies to halt its worst 
downturn in 50 years.

</P>
<P>
	WATERTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Hampartzoum Berberian, a composer of  
vocal, choral, operatic, symphonic and chamber works, died Saturday 
of cancer. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Berberian's compositions included ``Lincoln at Gettysburg,'' a  
choral work inspired by the Gettysburg Address, and ``Requiem 
Aeternam,'' based on a poem by Yeghishe Charentz commemorating the 
massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks from 1915 to 
1920. 
</P>

<P>
	DENISON, Texas (AP) -- Claud Easterly, a newspaperman for more  
than half his life and editor of The Denison Herald for 30 years, 
died Tuesday of pneumonia after undergoing surgery. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 47 years as a journalist, Easterly interviewed five  
U.S. presidents, Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn, bandleader John 
Philip Sousa, magician Harry Houdini, Father Flanagan of Boys Town, 
New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, heavyweight boxing champion Joe 
Louis, and many other state and national dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Easterly began his career at the Herald in 1925.  
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1940s he was named editor of the newspaper, but he  
also continued to write throughout even beyond his retirement in 
1972. He contributed several stories to the Herald Democrat since 
the merger of his old newspaper with the Sherman Democrat in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, David Easterly, is a member of The Associated Press  
board of directors and president and chief operating officer of Cox 
Enterprises, an Atlanta-based media company that owns and operates 
more than a dozen newspapers, about a dozen TV stations and more 
than 50 radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his son, Easterly is survived by his wife,  
Ophelia; a stepson, a stepdaughter, a brother, 10 grandchildren and 
one great-grandchild.

	SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Oscar-winning composer Ernest Gold, who  
wrote scores for ``Exodus,'' ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,'' 
``On the Beach'' and ``The Secret of Santa Vittoria,'' died 
Wednesday of complications from a stroke. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's most recognized work was the score of the 1960 movie  
``Exodus,'' for which he won an Academy Award and two Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	He received Academy Awards nominations for best score and best  
song for the 1963 film ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,'' and 
also received nominations for 1959's ``On the Beach'' and the 1969 
movie ``The Secret of Santa Vittoria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His credits also included ``Smooth As Silk,'' ``Wyoming,''  
``Witness for the Prosecution,'' ``The Pride and the Passion,'' 
``Too Much Too Soon,'' ``The Defiant Ones,'' ``Inherit the Wind,'' 
and ``The Runner Stumbles.''

                         *Jean Pierre-Bloch    	
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Jean Pierre-Bloch, a former Resistance leader and  
one of France's most outspoken human rights advocates, died 
Wednesday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre-Bloch, was a well-known writer who denounced racism and  
oppression of minorities worldwide. He was honorary president of 
the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
	He began a career in journalism in 1930 and wrote for several  
French newspapers, but eventually turned to politics. In 1936, at 
31, he became the youngest member of parliament in the leftist, 
Popular Front government led by Leon Blum. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1939, Pierre-Bloch joined the French military and was  
captured after the outbreak of World War II, later escaping to join 
the French Resistance headed by Gen. Charles de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1941 he organized the first parachute drops of men and  
supplies in Nazi-occupied France and became one of the Gestapo's 
most wanted figures. He was arrested in Spain and sentenced to 
death by the pro-Nazi Vichy regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Again Pierre-Bloch managed to escape, fleeing to London to join  
de Gaulle, under whom he held numerous posts, including head of 
intelligence operations until France was liberated in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Pierre-Bloch sat on an honor board that ruled in favor  
of Maurice Papon's claim that he worked for the Resistance while 
acting as local official under the Vichy government. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, Pierre-Bloch reversed himself. Rebutting a key  
defense argument, he testified at the former Vichy official's war 
crimes trial that Papon was not a member of the Resistance. Papon 
was found guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity and 
sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre-Bloch was a frequent contributor to Le Monde, and wrote  
several books including ``Charles de Gaulle'' (1944), ``The Causes 
of Anti-Semitism in France'' (1956) and ``London, The Capital of 
Free France'' (1985).

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- G.B. Van Dusen, founder of Van Dusen Air  
Inc., a worldwide distributor of aircraft supplies and airport 
services, died Monday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1940, Van Dusen borrowed $300 to start his company at  
Wold-Chamberlain Field, the original name of the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1985, when the company entered a merger agreement with APL  
Limited Partnership, sales had reached $200 million. The company 
operated 54 branch sales and distribution offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Van Dusen was inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall  
of Fame.

<HEADLINE> 'Oscar' Likes Character Actresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is the character actress making a comeback in  
the Academy Awards? Nominations for best supporting actress of 1998 
suggest just such a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	When the awards for supporting players were introduced in the  
ninth Academy Awards in 1936, the Board of Governors sought to 
reward those actors who contributed greatly to films but were 
overshadowed by the stars. The first 10 awards went to such 
polished veterans as Alice Brady, Fay Bainter, Hattie McDaniel, 
Jane Darwell, Mary Astor and Ethel Barrymore. 
</P>
<P>
	That has changed over the years. In the past decade, the award  
has been presented to relative newcomers: Whoopi Goldberg, Marisa 
Tomei, Anna Paquin, Mira Sorvino, Juliette Binoche, Kim Basinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for Rachel Griffiths, this year's nominees represent  
decades of experience in films, theater and television. 

</P>
<P>
                 	 *KATHY BATES, ``Primary Colors''    	
</P>
<P>
	The only Oscar winner among the five and the only native-born  
American, Kathy Bates was nominated for her portrayal of Libby 
Holden, the blunt talking, pistol-packing adviser to Clintonesque 
candidate John Travolta in ``Primary Colors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Bates has been in movies since 1971 when she appeared in  
``Taking Off,'' Milos Forman's first American film. She kept busy 
in character roles in movies and theater, then in 1990 achieved her 
triumph with ``Misery.'' Her startling performance as the wacko who 
imprisons her favorite author (James Caan) won her the Oscar as 
best actress in a leading role. 
</P>
<P>
	Her films since then include ``Fried Green Tomatoes,'' ``At Play  
in the Fields of the Lord,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Prelude to a Kiss,'' 
``A Home of Our Own'' and notably, as the unsinkable Molly Brown in 
``Titanic.'' 

</P>
<P>
                 	 *BRENDA BLETHYN, ``Little Voice''    	
</P>
<P>
	A veteran of British theater and television, Brenda Blethyn is  
having her second go at the Oscar; two years ago she was nominated 
as lead actress in ``Secrets &AMP; Lies.'' This year she was chosen for 
her role in ``Little Voice'' as the boozing, man-chasing harridan 
whose relentless put-downs of her willowy daughter (Jane Horrocks) 
have made the teen-ager a recluse. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a desperate woman,'' Miss Blethyn says of her character.  
``She is someone who is lamenting her loss of figure and looks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Miss Blethyn appeared here for the Golden Globes and Oscar  
nominees, onlookers were surprised by how sleek and attractive she 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	``People ask me if I have lost weight,'' she said. ``I haven't.  
They also said I looked so much shorter. I say, 'There's no way I 
could have lost height.''' She'll be able to appear as her own 
lovely self in her next film, ``Night Train'' with John Hurt. 

</P>
<P>
                	 *JUDI DENCH, ``Shakespeare in Love''    	
</P>
<P>
	She was nominated last year as another English queen, Victoria,  
in ``Mrs. Brown,'' and now she plays the aging Elizabeth I. And 
even though the current Elizabeth has bestowed upon her the title 
of dame, there is nothing regal about her off-stage and off-camera. 
``Don't call me Dame Judi,'' she insists. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in the theater in the 1950s, she has played everything  
from Juliet to Lady Macbeth, Portia to Cleopatra, as well as Sally 
Bowles in ``Cabaret.'' Her films include ``Room With a View'' and 
``Henry V,'' and she plays the British secret service chief in the 
James Bond movies. She even appears in the BBC sitcom ``As Time 
Goes By.'' 
</P>

	Miss Dench's appearance in ``Shakespeare in Love'' may have set  
a record for the least amount of screen time to warrant an Academy 
nomination. She was asked how she managed to make such an 
impression in such brief time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make up for it when you've only got eight  
minutes,'' she replied. ``You have to make the best of it. First, 
you get a good costume.''

	``It's incredibly exciting,'' says Rachel Griffiths of her  
nomination, ``especially since I was not on anyone's tip list. Now 
I can have an international career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian beauty is the least known of the five nominees,  
but Oscar magic is likely to change that. She was chosen for her 
role as Hilary, the stable older sister of the erratic, dying cello 
genius Jacqueline du Pre (Emily Watson). 
</P>
<P>
	The real Hilary du Pre and her brother Piers wrote the book on  
which the film was based. Jackie's famous colleagues in the music 
world attacked the film for depicting the cellist as ``selfish, 
spoiled and manipulative.''

<P>
	Miss Griffiths is a product of the Australian theater, having  
appeared in ``A Doll's House,'' ``The Sisters Rosensweig'' and 
others. Her most notable films have been ``Muriel's Wedding'' and 
``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' as a Southern belle.

	Some of those who viewed ``Gods and Monsters'' without knowing  
the cast credits were astonished to learn that Lynn Redgrave had 
played the role of the loyal, sympathetic housekeeper for the 
homosexual director of horror films, James Whale. Usually glamorous 
in the height of fashion, the actress had transformed into a dowdy 
servant. 
</P>
<P>
	``People ask me how I had done it,'' she says. ``Did I gain  
weight? Did I have a prosthesis on my chin? I did none of that. I 
simply did what I have done many, many times in the theater: I 
became the character with expressions, my posture and my 
attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress can call on such techniques as a third-generation  
member of Britain's acting dynasty that includes her parents, 
Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, sister Vanessa and brother 
Corin. She has had a busy 37-year career in theater and films, 
scoring a 1966 Oscar nomination as lead actress in ``Georgy Girl.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Rips GOP Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today ripped a $1.74  
trillion budget plan offered by Republicans, calling it a rehash of 
bad economic policies that pushed the country into recession a 
decade ago. ``We don't need more Republican retronomics,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the White House to a group of black newspaper  
publishers, Gore said he was disappointed that the House Budget 
Committee approved a plan which he said ``puts risky tax schemes 
first'' ahead of Social Security overhauls. He said that is a 
budgetary tactic straight out of the 1980s -- one blamed in part for 
a recession that did not turn around until Clinton's first budget 
was approved in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried this kind of budget before, and it nearly wrecked  
the United States. It drove our economy into the ditch,'' Gore 
said. ``I appeal to the Republican leadership to drop this 
nostalgia for the recessions of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House panel's 22-18 vote along party lines Wednesday night  
capped a day of political maneuvering on both sides of the Capitol 
as Democrats unsuccessfully sought to put off tax cuts until both 
Social Security and Medicare are overhauled. Republicans argued 
that projected budget surpluses will make it possible to accomplish 
many things. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think what we're going to do is take away from the tax  
cut -- we're not going to support that,'' said Rep. John Kasich, 
R-Ohio, chairman of the House committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate budgets envision unspecified tax cuts of  
$15 billion next year and $778 billion over the next decade. Other 
rejected proposals would have shifted some of that money into 
spending programs Democrats favor, such as Head Start or hiring 
more teachers to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the tax cuts, the plans crafted by Kasich and Senate  
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., would set aside 
$1.8 trillion in projected surpluses over the next decade to ensure 
Social Security's solvency when the huge baby boom generation 
begins retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares to $1.3 trillion over 10 years for Social Security  
in President Clinton's proposed budget, but Clinton's plan also 
would lock up part of the remaining surplus to keep Medicare 
afloat. The popular health program for senior citizens faces a 
financial crunch beginning in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican budgets, which set overall tax and spending  
limits that are filled in by later congressional action, also would 
boost defense spending to $289 billion for fiscal 2000, $9 billion 
more than this year and $8 billion more than Clinton proposed. They 
would also increase spending for primary and secondary schools by 
more than $2 billion next year, and provide more for some 
agriculture and veterans' programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they could afford those increases while  
honoring a tight spending limit for next year set by the 1997 
budget-balancing pact. Neither committee provided much detail about 
which programs they would cut to heed that spending ceiling, but 
both chairmen said they could do it. 
</P>
<P>
	But that also imposes some limits on spending priorities.  
Kasich, for example, agreed with the thrust of a Democratic 
amendment to boost spending for research at the National Institutes 
of Health but said the proposal cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be all things to all people,'' Kasich said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Democrats said that to afford the GOP's proposed  
increases, the remaining programs affected by the spending limits 
would face 12 percent reductions. That could mean cuts in popular 
programs such as Head Start, food inspections and the FBI, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were an over-the-counter drug, it would have to say,  
'Warning: Could be harmful to elderly, children and working 
families,''' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said of 
the GOP plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Clinton administration threatened to veto a  
GOP proposal to set aside Social Security's vast surpluses over the 
next decade -- before baby boomers start retiring -- for debt 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	That proposal, which will move separately from the budget  
resolution, would require that Social Security surpluses be used to 
buy down the debt. Doing otherwise would require votes of 60 of the 
100 senators, a tough hurdle to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Democratic leaders, Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin said the plan could hinder the government from issuing new 
debt if it needed to, threatening its credit rating and perhaps 
requiring it to stop paying Social Security benefits.

<HEADLINE> New Solheim Format To Debut in 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The sixth Solheim Cup will be played Oct. 6-8,  
2000 at Loch Lomond Golf Club in Glasgow, Scotland, under a new 
format, the Ping organization announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ping also said LPGA Hall of Famer Pat Bradley would be the  
captain for the American team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Solheim Cup has become the pinnacle of women's  
professional golf, steeped in tradition,'' Bradley said. ``I want 
to continue the standard of excellence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-hitting Laura Davies of England said Bradley, who has won  
31 LPGA Tour titles, exemplifies the successful U.S. teams in the 
cup competition, because she is nearing the end of a great career. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a short history, so the inspirational players are  
still active,'' Davies said about the European LPGA that provides 
the competition for the LGPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by Karsten Manufacturing Corp. of Phoenix, which makes  
Ping golf equipment, the Solheim Cup is a match-play event that has 
featured four four-ball groups and four foursomes playing on the 
first two days of competition, with 12 singles matches on the 
concluding Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the format calls for eight foursomes the first day,  
six four-ball matches the next and then the 12 singles-matches at 
the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was made primarily to increase the available hours of  
daylight and help everyone finish, Ping CEO John Solheim said.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Dept. Sued Over Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina's attorney general said  
Thursday he might drop a lawsuit against a state agency for sending 
Social Security numbers to a New Hampshire company because the 
company said it will delete the numbers from its fraud prevention 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashua, N.H.-based Data LLC also said it would delete  
driver's license photos of the more than 80,000 South Carolinians 
who have opted out of the company's database. 
</P>
<P>
	Image Data purchased 3.9 million South Carolina driver's license  
photos for its system, which briefly shows merchants the picture of 
a credit card holder or check writer as a fraud deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
	After a public outcry when news of the sale broke, Attorney  
General Charlie Condon sued to get out of the contract. A judge has 
not ruled on that suit yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this means there's a new spirit with the company,''  
said Condon, who has asked Image Data President Robert Houvener 
company to switch to a system where people voluntarily opt in. 
</P>
<P>
	``A citizen's Social Security number is one of his or her most  
important personal possessions,'' Condon said. ``It is the duty of 
state agencies to protect, not pawn, a person's Social Security 
number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Houvener said Image Data did not request the numbers  
from the Public Safety Department, once the agency sent them, the 
company used them to distinguish between people with the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the company will use other information -- like addresses -- to  
do that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Condon's suit filed Thursday against the Public Safety  
Department raised questions about how one state agency can sue 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who we're going to get to defend us,'' Public  
Safety Director Boykin Rose said. ``Under the constitution, 
(Condon) is supposed to defend us.''

<HEADLINE>  German Poet Had Remains Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- No one is more revered in German literature than  
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, so it was with some surprise that a 
leading German newspaper broke the news Thursday that the national 
hero had been secretly exhumed some 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The macabre revelation -- published on the front page of the  
conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung -- came as Germany 
prepares to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Goethe's birth later 
this year, on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thuringia state culture minister, Gerd Schuchardt, demanded  
an investigation into the report, while the foundation that 
oversees the Goethe archives, where the newspaper found the files 
detailing the exhumation, went into damage control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was agreed to handle this situation very discreetly. And it  
wasn't to hide it, or to keep it quiet, rather for reasons of 
piety,'' said Juergen Seifert, the head of the Weimar Classics 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert confirmed that scientists in the former East Germany  
removed Goethe's remains from his Weimar tomb in 1970, but he 
denied it was done surreptitiously. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose, he said, was to preserve the remains for posterity.  
</P>
<P>
	By then, some 140 years after his death, the remains were too  
fragile to consider mummification. The scientists instead opted to 
preserve the skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining tissue was cremated, the skeleton cleaned,  
enclosed in foam and returned to the tomb, the Frankfurter 
Allgemeine Zeitung reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the exhumation, the scientists discovered they  
were not the first to have opened the tomb since Goethe's burial in 
1832. One of the tomb's interior seals had been opened, and the 
lead lining had been cut, leading them to speculate that the tomb 
had been tampered with at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert, for one, reserved judgment on the scientists.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only people qualified to judge this would be a body of  
scientists at home in this field. All the others would be 
frivolous, reckless or biased,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Charges vs. First Lady Were Drafted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The chief deputy for Whitewater  
prosecutor Kenneth Starr testified that he drew up a draft 
indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton after concluding that she and 
the president had been dishonest and untruthful. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Thursday in Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's criminal  
contempt trial if he ever had said the Clintons were ``crooks and 
liars,'' W. Hickman Ewing said he had ``made that statement 
in-house'' to another member of Starr's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had to do with conflicting stories given by people in the  
Rose Law Firm'' about work Mrs. Clinton did for Madison Guaranty 
Savings and Loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;L was owned by Mrs. McDougal's late husband, James  
McDougal, who was partner with then-Gov. Bill Clinton and Mrs. 
Clinton in the Whitewater land development. Questions were raised 
over whether Clinton had asked McDougal to take his legal business 
to the Little Rock firm where Mrs. Clinton was a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	A moment later, however, Ewing added: ``I don't believe I used  
the L-word or the C-word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said that at dinner one evening with other Starr aides he  
graded the president and the first lady on their responses to 
questioning by Whitewater investigators, after observing her 
answers during a July 1995 deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said the president was about a `C' and Mrs. Clinton about an  
'F,''' Ewing testified. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave those grades, he said, after Mrs. Clinton said ``I don't  
recall'' about 50 times during the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing did not say what charge might have been included in an  
indictment of Mrs. Clinton, and said no such indictment was ever 
presented to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's private lawyer, discounted Ewing's  
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mere fact that this prosecutor's office drafted a  
frivolous indictment three years ago has no significance 
whatsoever,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, called Ewing as his first  
witness as he continued his strategy of putting the conduct of 
Starr and his deputies on trial. Mrs. McDougal is charged with 
refusing to answer questions posed by Starr's office before a 
Whitewater grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos is trying to demonstrate that prosecutors wanted to use  
Mrs. McDougal to get to the Clintons, even if there was not enough 
evidence to charge them. Mrs. McDougal says she refused to testify 
because she was convinced she would be charged with perjury even if 
she testified truthfully. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial continues Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said he arranged a meeting in May 1995 with Mrs.  
McDougal's lawyer at the time, Bobby McDaniel, to explore 
possibilities for her cooperation with the Whitewater prosecutor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Mr. McDaniel talked about total immunity ... and we  
were not in a position at that time to agree to that,'' Ewing said. 
Instead, he said, he and two assistants at the meeting suggested 
that McDaniel or his client make an offer specifying what Mrs. 
McDougal would be able to testify about, so the Whitewater 
prosecutor's office might consider making a deal by letting Mrs. 
McDougal plead guilty to a relatively minor charge. 
</P>
<P>
	But no such offer was ever forthcoming from Mrs. McDougal or her  
lawyer, Ewing said. Her position was that she had done nothing 
wrong, he said, and would therefore not agree to plead guilty to 
any charge, even a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said he drew up the draft indictment against Mrs. Clinton  
sometime after September 1996. Early that year, Mrs. Clinton's 
long-sought law firm billing records mysteriously surfaced in the 
White House, revealing that she had worked on a failed land 
development that James McDougal was trying to use to prop up his 
failing S&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	Until those records emerged following their disappearance during  
the 1992 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton had not revealed work 
she had done on the McDougals' Castle Grande development, which 
federal regulators said was riddled with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing also said the president had changed his responses to  
questions about whether he had asked McDougal to hire Mrs. 
Clinton's law firm to represent Madison Guaranty in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related matter Thursday, a federal judge in Washington  
dismissed one of Starr's criminal counts against presidential 
friend Webster Hubbell in a fraud indictment. The count accused 
Hubbell of scheming to conceal work done by him and Mrs. Clinton, 
his former law partner at the Rose Law Firm, on the Castle Grand 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson agreed with Hubbell that the  
allegations in the count were too vague. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had obtained a 15-count indictment of Hubbell in November  
in connection with Castle Grande. Federal regulators said the deal 
was riddled with ``insider dealing, fictitious sales and land 
flips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was referred to 36 times in the original indictment  
against Hubbell, signifying that her name could be brought up 
repeatedly in the trial set to begin June 14.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Learns Lesson About Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two young computer entrepreneurs made a pretty  
profit off Steve Forbes by beating the millionaire publisher and 
presidential candidate to his own name. 
</P>
<P>
	They reserved the Internet domain name ``www.forbes2000.com''  
back in 1997 as Forbes was preparing a second consecutive campaign 
for the White House. So before he launched his campaign Tuesday 
with a splashy announcement on that Web site, Forbes first had to 
obtain it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Segal, a Cincinnati-based Internet marketer who represented  
the Forbes campaign, said he purchased rights to three Web sites -- 
including ``www.forbes2000.com'' -- for a total of $6,500. He said 
the price was ``extremely reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the sellers, Greg Trangmoe, said the agreement with  
Forbes prevents him from revealing how much money was paid. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trangmoe last year turned down five-figure offers from  
prospective buyers and says now that he does not regret that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good investment,'' he said, ``definitely a good  
investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The practice of ``cyber-squatting'' -- reserving names that  
others might need -- is going strong in politics. The speculation is 
fairly low-risk, since rights to a ``domain name'' are available 
for $70 for two years. The Forbes case shows there is money to be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	And even technologically savvy politicians are prone to make a  
www.mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore is a technophile who drew chuckles last  
week by claiming he ``took the initiative in creating the 
Internet.'' He's been a likely candidate for president in 2000 for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he lost the race to ``www.gore2000.com'' to Market Vision  
Inc. of Kansas City, Mo., which uses the site to sell political 
memorabilia, including the ``Gore 2000 Election Kit'' -- a bumper 
sticker and six buttons for $20. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospective candidate best prepared for the Internet seems  
to be Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose exploratory committee 
controls ``www.bush2000.com'' as well as ``www.georgewbush.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Elizabeth Dole is trying to attract support with  
``www.edole2000.org'' but does not have control over 
``www.dole2000.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trangmoe and Brian Keys, partners in Adega LLC, are auctioning  
off several other domain names. 
</P>
<P>
	They are asking $4,000 for ``www.alexander2000.org,'' even  
though Republican Lamar Alexander is already on the Web at 
``www.lamaralexander.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are asking $1,000 for ``www.bradley2000.org,'' although  
Democrat Bill Bradley already has a site up and running at 
``www.billbradley.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And they are testing the market to see how high the bids might  
be on ``www.mccain2000.com,'' a site that could come in handy for 
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, even though McCain already 
has ``www.mccainforpresident.org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is some risk in having a Web site fall into hostile hands.  
Adega underscored the threat for a time last year by linking the 
``www.forbes2000.com'' page to three other sites -- one of them 
pro-Forbes, the other two anti-Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	As she considers whether to run for Senate in New York, first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton might be unsettled to learn that 
``www.hillary2000.com'' is in the hands of a Republican. But Chris 
Hayden, a California environmental consultant, says he reserved the 
site in hopes of making money rather than trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd use it to try to sell items, as opposed to say anything  
bad about her or good about her,'' said Hayden, who added he would 
entertain offers from a Hillary Clinton campaign interested in 
buying the site. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, also considering a bid for  
Senate, probably would prefer that ``www.whitman2000.com'' be 
controlled by someone other than Dan Parisi, a New Jersey computer 
entrepreneur known for establishing a raunchy pay site at a Web 
address similar to the official one for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But Parisi said he voted for Whitman and would let her use the  
site if she wants it.

<HEADLINE> New Tires Make Andretti Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- Michael Andretti can't get over a  
statistic that his public relations representatives recently 
brought to his attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we led only 31 fewer laps than Alex Zanardi, but  
finished seventh in the points, indicates that we had more 
opportunities to win or at least finish higher in the 
championship,'' Andretti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two CART seasons have been very frustrating for the  
36-year-old former series champion. He has begun each of those 
years with victories in the Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami and gone 
the rest of the season without a win. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, he has had terrible luck -- crashing while leading,  
breaking while running near the front and generally falling into a 
miserable rut by the middle of each season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday, he will try to make it three in a row on the 1 1/2-mile  
oval at Miami-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex. More important, 
Andretti says he expects this season to be far better to the end of 
the 20-race schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	A big reason for his optimism is the Newman-Haas team's recent  
switch from Goodyear tires to Firestones. Teams racing with 
Firestone radials dominated the Champ Car series last year, with 
only Andretti winning on Goodyears. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very difficult decision to make, Andretti said.  
``Goodyear has been great supporters over the years, and they are a 
company that is going to get it right. But it is probably going to 
take them 10 races to catch up, and we don't have the time to wait 
right now. We have to look out for ourselves and our sponsors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti fully expects to be a contender for the PPG Cup title  
that is up for grabs since Zanardi, who won the last two titles for 
Target-Chip Ganassi Racing, returned to Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is 25-year-old Dario Franchitti who is generally  
considered the man to beat for the 1999 championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if they label me a championship contender or no  
hope,'' Franchitti said. ``One thing I learned last year is that 
you have to be consistent over the course of the season. It's a 
balancing act between being aggressive and using your head. I'm 
just happy to be considered a championship possibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti is hardly alone as a title contender, though. At  
least eight drivers are considered legitimate threats to replace 
Zanardi at the top of the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Franchitti, the name mentioned most is Zanardi's former  
teammate, Jimmy Vasser, who hopes to give Ganassi's team its fourth 
straight series championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competition, it's there and it's deep,'' the 1996 series  
champion said. ``There's built-in pressure just to perform at the 
highest level that you can, to keep your team and your sponsors 
happy and to keep your job. 
</P>
<P>
	``So there's not really any more pressure because there is a  
fourth championship possible for our team. I think we may have a 
shot at it, but it's just going to take a little while for the 
whole scenario to unfold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Franchitti being the man to beat, Vasser said, ``Anybody  
would be an idiot not to consider Dario Franchitti a championship 
contender. He won three races last year, and the fashion in which 
he won them, the consistency and the speed he had, that was 
impressive. But he's going to have to get it done on the racetrack. 
Nobody is going to give him anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Franchitti, Vasser and Andretti, the drivers expected to  
challenge for the title include Greg Moore, Adrian Fernandez, Bryan 
Herta, Gil de Ferran and, the driver who was fastest in winter 
testing, Patrick Carpentier. Among them, all are on Firestones 
except de Ferran. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore agrees winning the title will be an uphill climb, but  
said, ``You can't look at any of those guys and say there's no way 
they are going to win the championship. But, hopefully, I'm at the 
top of it. Dario and all those guys can fight for second.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Skiers Get Tropical Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- The United States' top skiers won't have  
to worry about chapped lips and frostbitten fingers during the 
national Alpine and Freestyle Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, unseasonably balmy weather in the Utah mountains could  
change the nature of competition for an American team finishing a 
season marked by retirements and injuries in its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature reached 60 degrees under mostly clear skies on  
Thursday as the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association announced a 
lucrative long-term extension of its sponsorship deal with Chevy 
Trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety minutes north at Snowbasin Ski Resort, the second day of  
training concluded on the Bernhard Russi-designed downhill course 
which will be used in competition for the first time Friday. 
Snowbasin will be the site of downhill competition in the 2002 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Olympic venues at Snowbasin, Park City Mountain Resort  
and Deer Valley Resort will all be used over the six days of 
events. It's the first time Salt Lake City's new Olympic ski venues 
will be featured in a multi-sport event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to give our athletes any advantage we can, and  
one thing we can do is take advantage of the facilities here,'' 
USSA president Bill Marolt said. ``Any experience we can give our 
skiers on the Olympic courses will pay off down the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To combat the annoyingly beautiful weather, the downhill  
competitions on Friday will begin 2 1/2 hours earlier than previously 
scheduled to take advantage of early morning snow conditions. The 
snow softening that occurs with each passing hour slows the racers 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
	The fastest downhill training runs on Thursday were turned in by  
Megan Gerety of Anchorage, Alaska, who finished eighth in the 
downhill World Championships at Vail last month, and developmental 
program skier Travis Svensrud. 
</P>
<P>
	Russi, the 1972 Olympic champion who has designed practically  
every major modern downhill course, will be on hand to study the 
skiers' reaction to his latest creation. The course has received 
high marks from both skiers and coaches during training, but the 
real tests will come Friday in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like the way it was set, but the course is awesome,''  
said Chad Fleischer, who finished second at last month's World Cup 
downhill finals in Sierra Nevada, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some great sections. If they remove a couple of  
gates to provide for some big, sweeping turns, it'll be a better 
race, but the course will be a lot of fun with some steeps, some 
air (jumps), all the good stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the top U.S. alpine and freestyle skiers will take part  
in the competitions -- or rather, all of the top skiers still 
healthy and competing. The ranks of American skiing have been 
thinned considerably in the last year, but the national 
championships could be a stage for new faces to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic gold medalist Picabo Street, still recovering from  
injury, will miss her second straight U.S. Championships. Gold 
medalist Tommy Moe leads the list of skiers who have hung up their 
skis recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of young skiers on both teams who are looking  
for an opportunity to shine, and they could have that here,'' said 
four-time national champion Kristina Koznick, who won her second 
World Cup slalom race this season. ``Of course, the old ones like 
me are still going to try to hang on to our titles, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national championships are back in Utah for the first time  
since 1995, when the alpine events were held at Park City and on 
Snowbasin's previous downhill course. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, the races received scant attention from the  
local community and suffered from organizational problems, not the 
least of which was an infamous information tent near the bottom of 
the Snowbasin runs which blew over several times during the events. 
</P>
<P>
	Much has changed. Over 350 community volunteers will be working  
at Snowbasin alone during the first dry run for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> House Leaders Consider Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top House leaders are weighing a plan to help  
lawmakers to a cost of living increase, a boost that could add 
about $5,000 to an annual salary of $136,673. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., raised the issue at a meeting  
earlier this year with Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, 
according to aides to the two men. 
</P>
<P>
	John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman, noted that under current law,  
members of Congress are entitled to an annual cost of living 
increase. The speaker, he said, ``is in favor of having that law 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, D-Mo., was noncommittal, according to an aide, Laura  
Nichols. She said any proposal to increase compensation would have 
to be aired in the party caucus, and be subject to a vote in the 
full House. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress last received an increase two years ago,  
after the Republican and Democratic leadership agreed not to make a 
political issue of the subject. In other years, lawmakers have 
voted to stop the increase from taking effect. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was no noticeable public backlash against the 1997  
pay increase, some lawmakers objected at the time. The issue would 
almost certainly provoke debate on the House floor again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1989 law, lawmakers are entitled to a cost of living  
increase that is pegged to the pay raise the president proposes 
each year for federal workers. President Clinton recommended a 4.4 
percent increase for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. A 4 
percent increase in congressional pay would amount to more than 
$5,400 and raise the salary to more than $142,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While aides said a cost of living hike stands a good chance of  
taking effect, a separate proposal for an increase in compensation 
seemed to be faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion, floated by Rep. Bill Thomas of California, would  
allow most lawmakers to claim a $125 per day allowance to defray 
their living expenses in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The allowance could be claimed for any day the House meets, to  
be paid from the funds set aside for office expenses. Thus, any 
money the lawmaker claimed personally would have to come from staff 
salaries or other expenses such as equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Congress met for little more than a third of the year,  
lawmakers would be eligible for more than $14,000 in increased 
compensation -- an increase of more than 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has suggested making the change administratively by a  
vote of the House Administration Committee, which he chairs, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senior aides, as well as some lawmakers, said Thomas'  
proposal had attracted interest among the members, particularly 
from lawmakers who received a similar benefit when they were 
members of state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert distanced himself from the proposal during the day.  
``There are a lot of proposals out there and the speaker does not 
endorse this one,'' said Feehery. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas issued a written statement late in the day saying the  
panel would consider the proposal ``only at the request of the 
House leadership. ... The House Administration Committee, appointed 
by the speaker and the minority leader, would be responsive to the 
leadership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other aides and lawmakers noted that any lawmaker could force a  
vote on the proposal when the regular spending bill covering 
congressional expenses goes to the floor, regardless of what action 
the House Administration Committee took. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, a cost-of-living increase has greater appeal to  
some lawmakers than the suggested per diem. Congressional pensions 
are calculated on the basis of pay, and one official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, said some veteran lawmakers would rather 
have a cost of living increase than the per diem allowance, even 
though it would cost them money in the short run.

<HEADLINE> Study: Lack of Sleep Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	People who have a sleep disorder that causes them to wake up  
repeatedly during the night run a higher risk of getting into 
traffic accidents, researchers reported today in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The research linked sleep apnea to car crashes in Spain.  
</P>
<P>
	With apnea, breathing is briefly and repeatedly cut off during  
sleep, often causing a person to wake up. Sufferers can be awakened 
hundreds of times a night, leaving them feeling tired the next day. 
Habitual snoring can be a symptom. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Wisconsin study two years ago found that that  
people with undiagnosed sleep apnea were seven times more likely to 
have multiple traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest study, doctors in Spain looked at drivers who  
received emergency treatment at two hospitals after getting into 
accidents. About 30 percent of them were found to have sleep apnea. 
That suggests that apnea sufferers are six times more likely to get 
into an accident, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Paul Suratt from the  
University of Virginia Medical Center and Larry Findley of the 
Sleep Disorders Center of Northern Colorado noted that an estimated 
80 percent of sleep apnea cases go undiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors ``have an important role in helping to prevent accidents  
through identifying people with sleep apnea, providing treatment 
and education, and reporting patients who have had accidents to 
state authorities according to applicable laws,'' they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Lesbian Custody Case in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Like many children, a 9-year-old girl in  
Golden divides her time between two parents who no longer share a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike most, she calls one parent ``Mom'' and the other  
``Nana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an unusual family situation that is bound by an even more  
unusual court order requiring Kelly Cunningham, or ``Mom,'' and 
Leanne Bueker, or ``Nana,'' to share custody of the girl in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, which has been hailed by gay rights advocates as a  
landmark custody ruling, was back in county court today. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a motion to close the hearing, Jefferson County  
District Judge Christopher Munch ruled the public would be 
permitted to attend parts involving nonemotional issues, such as 
jobs and finances, but that testimony about the child's emotional 
welfare would be kept private. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to do a balancing act here,'' Munch said. The motion to  
close had been brought by attorneys for both sides, who said 
publicity about the case already has led other children to tease 
the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Munch must decide whether Ms. Cunningham may take the child to  
Albany, N.Y., to create a family with her new husband, Michael 
Naylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cunningham has contended the joint custody order has denied  
her daughter the opportunity to live in a stable, loving 
environment. Ms. Bueker claimed it is in the best interest of the 
girl to remain in Colorado, where both women may play an active 
role in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone message seeking comment from Ms. Cunningham's  
attorney was not returned, and Ms. Bueker's current attorney 
declined comment. But Mara Pawlowski, who represented Ms. Bueker 
until recently, said the key is the finding the best interest of 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``This child is a very bright, gifted child who does not want to  
move to New York,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cunningham and Ms. Bueker began a relationship and moved in  
together in 1987. They decided the next year to have a child, 
according to court records, and Ms. Cunningham was artificially 
inseminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter was born in July 1989. Seven years later, Ms.  
Cunningham, a computer programmer, informed Ms. Bueker that she had 
met Naylor through the Internet, fallen in love and wanted to 
pursue a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	The women separated and Ms. Bueker, a mortgage banking  
supervisor, sued for custody even though she was not listed on the 
birth certificate and did not adopt the girl legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records indicate the child loved both women equally and  
feared losing one through the breakup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Jefferson County District Judge Frank Plaut awarded  
the two women joint custody, calling Ms. Cunningham the girl's 
``biological'' mother and Ms. Bueker the ``psychological'' mother. 
</P>
<P>
	He based the decision on a state law granting custody rights to  
an unrelated person who has had physical custody of a child for at 
least six months prior to a separation. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaut also said the girl should remain in Colorado, where she  
could be nurtured by both women. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was one of a handful nationwide in which a court  
has legally recognized a family with parents of the same sex, said 
Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past five years, the number of lesbian custody cases  
nationwide has grown from three to as many as 15 a year, she said. 
Custody is awarded the biological parent in about 70 percent of 
those cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important issue is that this family be treated by the  
court in the same way the court would treat a heterosexual-headed 
household with the very same issues presented,'' Kendell said.

<HEADLINE> Domingo Triumphs in New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's been quite a week for aging tenors at the  
Metropolitan Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Luciano Pavarotti returned in Puccini's ``Tosca,''  
sounding in better voice at age 63 than he had in several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Then two nights later, Placido Domingo, a mere 58, scored a  
triumph as he sang the part of Ghermann in Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of 
Spades'' for the first time -- the 112th role of his amazing career. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Thursday's revival of the Russian masterpiece was a  
one-man show. The Met's revival of Elijah Moshinsky's superb 1995 
production was strongly cast down to the most minor roles. And with 
Valery Gergiev again conducting, the orchestra played with dazzling 
virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tchaikovsky's opera, adapted from Pushkin, tells of Ghermann, an  
impoverished army engineer, who becomes obsessed with forcing an 
old countess to divulge a magic formula for winning at cards. 
Trying to learn her secret, he ends up frightening her to death and 
destroying the life of her granddaughter, Lisa, with whom he has 
carried on an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The role of Ghermann is a daunting one, filled with sustained  
high notes and requiring an actor who can make convincing the 
character's descent into madness and eventual suicide. Domingo rose 
to the challenge admirably. His voice sounded strong and sure 
throughout the long night, and his portrayal was harrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lisa, soprano Galina Gorchakova brought great artistry to the  
part of an impetuous young girl caught in the snares of a passion 
beyond her control. Her great third-act aria of despair was deeply 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a treat having baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky return in the  
relatively small role of Prince Yeletsky, Lisa's jilted suitor. He 
has one big moment -- his second-act aria, set to one of 
Tchaikovsky's most haunting melodies -- and his burnished tone made 
it memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Mezzo Olga Borodina nearly stole the show as Lisa's friend,  
Pauline. She has the wide range required for the melancholy ballad 
she sings to their friends, and she has the charm and lightness to 
pull off her part as the faithful shepherd in the pastoral 
opera-within-the-opera that is performed for the guests in the 
ballroom scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo wasn't the only old-timer in the cast. The crucial role  
of the countess was taken by Elisabeth Soederstrom, returning to 
the Met at age 71 -- some 12 years after she gave her ``farewell'' 
performance as the Marschallin in Richard Strauss' ``Der 
Rosenkavalier.'' She brought great dignity and even humor to the 
part, making her a less fearsome but more sympathetic character 
than she sometimes seems. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Domingo, he shows no signs of slowing down. Next fall  
he'll open the Met season in Leoncavallo's ``I Pagliacci,'' and it 
will be his 18th opening night -- breaking the record he currently 
shares with Enrico Caruso.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- When two women first asked him to bless their  
``holy union'' -- in essence, their wedding -- the Rev. Gregory Dell 
was hardly fazed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one beat and I said, 'Why not?''' said Dell, who was a  
pastor at a United Methodist church in Evanston when he got the 
request more than 15 years ago. ``There wasn't a whole lot of fuss 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That has not been the case since Karl Reinhardt and Keith  
Eccarius stood before Dell and exchanged vows at their church on 
Chicago's North Side last September, about a month after Methodist 
leaders had outlawed same-sex ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Dell is to go on trial before a jury of 13 peers.  
If he's found guilty, jurors may revoke his ordination, ending 
</P>
<P>
	his 30-year career) as a Methodist minister.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is tragic,'' said the Rev. Stephen C. Williams, a Methodist  
minister from the Chicago suburb of Franklin Park who is serving as 
church prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	While he cares about Dell ``as a friend and a human being,''  
Williams said, ``I feel that he's broken a basic vow that all 
pastors take. No pastor is larger than the covenant we are part 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, those on both sides of the issue say this trial will be  
a defining -- and possibly dividing -- moment for the United 
Methodist Church and its 8.5 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many are beginning to talk about irreconcilable differences,''  
said the Rev. James Heidinger, president of Good News, a 
conservative United Methodist group that wants a church based more 
in ``historic, scriptural Christianity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Dell isn't punished, he said, ``there's going to be people  
across the church who say, 'That's it. I can't stay.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Others see the issue very differently.  
</P>
<P>
	Even Chicago Bishop C. Joseph Sprague, who filed the charges  
against Dell, said he did so only grudgingly. Before the new law 
took effect, he had performed same-sex unions as a pastor in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, an Oklahoma pastor resigned amid furor over  
a same-sex union she blessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still others remain defiant, including more than 90 Methodist  
ministers who gathered at a Sacramento, Calif., church in January 
to bless the union of a lesbian couple. Charges have been filed 
against an Iowa minister who participated, and other charges are 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dell's trial will be the first to test the new church law --  
a law he said he broke out of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it as some spectacular, courageous thing to do,''  
the 53-year-old minister said. ``If it's a faithful expression, 
then you do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was celebrating the gift of constructive, affirming love.  
... I was doing a service for two guys who love each other,'' said 
Dell, who was a classmate at Duke University's Divinity School of 
another controversial Methodist minister, the Rev. Jimmy Creech. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Creech's 1998 trial over a same-sex union at his former  
Nebraska church that prompted Methodist leaders to codify a 
``social principle'' that had only advised against blessing 
same-sex unions. Creech, who was not defrocked, is on leave from 
the Methodist church. 
</P>
<P>
	A key to Dell's defense will be the notion that church founder  
John Wesley would have wanted issues such as homosexuality to be 
handled on a church-by-church basis -- the approach taken by the 
Episcopal Church and United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dell, knowing the community around the church is important.  
When he was posted in the 1970s to a congregation in Minooka, a 
small Illinois farming town, he prayed for the Lions Club and 
joined in the Harvest Festival. His current posting is very 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Boys Town,'' he said, using the nickname for Chicago's  
gay enclave and home to Dell's Broadway United Methodist Church, 
where about a third of the 181 members are homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the reason I've come back to church,'' said Reinhardt,  
whose union was the 33rd that Dell has blessed. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Reinhardt said, church members have been  
meeting to devise an emergency plan in case Dell is defrocked. They 
are considering buying the building from the church, but only as a 
last resort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you leave the church if they refuse you? Our response is,  
'No, you don't,''' Reinhardt said. ``The church has been so good 
and positive in our lives. Instead of walking away, I'd rather stay 
and change it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's prosecutor does not think that is possible.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the church is to uphold its role in society as a guardian  
of moral instruction, then pastors are obligated wherever they are 
to present the Christian faith as we understand it,'' Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Dell's understanding of that faith is different, ``then maybe  
he should join another denomination,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the trial's outcome, Dell expressed confidence, and he  
said, ``This is about something a whole lot more than one pastor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's already chosen a theme for his Palm Sunday sermon, which  
likely will immediately follow the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He's calling it, ``We've Only Just Begun.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Ready for Gators' Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- They are as diverse as schools get in the NCAA  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga, named for a 16th-century Jesuit priest considered the  
patron saint of youth, has about 4,800 students on its campus in 
the chilly, windswept eastern Washington city of Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
	At opposite corner of the country, Florida has 42,000 students  
and a bushel of national sports championships, most notably in 
football. Gonzaga doesn't even field a football team. 
</P>
<P>
	But both play basketball, and when the Zags and Gators meet  
tonight in the NCAA West Region semifinals, they will play with 
styles that are much alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have incredible similarities,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson  
said. ``Both are superior shooting teams with tremendous skill 
people. Both can step out four guys that shoot quality 3s. We are 
two of the more skilled teams as far as being skilled offensively 
at five positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida will try to rattle the Bulldogs with defensive pressure,  
a tactic that could backfire against Gonzaga's two-headed 
point-guard system, with Quintin Hall and Matt Santangelo as 
co-playmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can handle any press,'' Hall said. ``I don't think it  
really can stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida coach Billy Donovan acknowledges that Gonzaga is  
equipped to survive the press, but that won't change the style he 
learned as a player and later as an assistant coach under Rick 
Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've pressed Kentucky this year. We've pressed Arkansas.  
We've pressed Tennessee,'' he said. ``That's who we are. That's 
what we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing a press is as foreign as a March week in Phoenix for  
Monson's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a concern of mine because in our league we've been this  
invincible team that can't be pressed because we have two point 
guards on the floor at the same time,'' he said. ``We haven't been 
challenged with full-court pressure much this year at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``So whether we're good at it or not, we haven't had a lot of  
repetitions at it. That's scary as a coach because we only have 40 
minutes tomorrow to figure it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps of more concern is how Gonzaga will handle Florida's  
size inside, especially 6-foot-7, 260-pound freshman Udonis Haslem, 
while at the same time defending the Gators' 3-point shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to throw bodies at him just like we did last week  
(against Stanford),'' Monson said. ``That's probably about as scary 
as anything because he keeps you honest coming off of anybody else 
and helping out because they put four shooters around a guy like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have had opposite experiences the past few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga, the West's No. 10 seed, emerged as one of the darlings  
of the nation's media and basked in the unfamiliar spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an overwhelming week for myself and our kids, one  
that we'll cherish forever,'' Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators, meanwhile, came directly to Phoenix from Seattle and  
have quietly spent the past few days practicing and staying low-key 
at a hotel near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been practicing, watching films and resting,'' said  
guard Eddie Shannon, one of just two seniors on the team. ``It's 
been a perfect situation. There need not be any distractions. We 
want to be prepared to play.''

<HEADLINE> Campaigns Explore Cyberspace, Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- In Missouri's U.S. Senate race, they  
were the mouse clicks that roared. 
</P>
<P>
	It started last week, when Daryl Duwe was surfing Democratic  
Gov. Mel Carnahan's new taxpayer-funded Web page for children. The 
state Republican spokesman thought he had struck political gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few mouse clicks from the children's page, with no  
warning, was a chat room that was definitely not for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were gleeful about linking the raunchy site to  
Carnahan, the leading challenger to freshman GOP Sen. John Ashcroft 
in next year's election. Duwe rushed with his finding to The 
Associated Press, which asked Carnahan about the links. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's office immediately ordered the links severed,  
Carnahan said, ``because you don't want inappropriate material out 
there that children might reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly didn't stop there.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement calling the two-term governor ``Sexman  
Carnahan,'' Steve Law, executive director of the Republican 
Senatorial Campaign Committee, suggested Carnahan had ``hired Larry 
Flynt as his campaign manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remark infuriated backers of Carnahan, who is a Southern  
Baptist deacon, husband of 44 years, grandfather and children's 
advocate untouched by even a whisper of sexual impropriety in 
nearly four decades in public office. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan's campaign consultant, Marc Farinella, decided to  
strike back. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent hours on Ashcroft's publicly financed Senate Web page  
and the senator's political action committee page last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a link from both sites that led to the Washington, D.C.,  
chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and lesbian political 
club, Farinella made his way to a homosexual online newspaper with 
explicit personal ads, contacts for escorts and offers of phone 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Farinella also clicked from Ashcroft's sites to a ring of  
conservative Web pages about sniper training, militias and white 
separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultant sent a letter to Ashcroft about the links, asking  
whether the senator was ``prepared to meet the same standard that 
you have set for Governor Carnahan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All outside links were dropped from Ashcroft's sites the day the  
letter arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft hasn't offered any public comment. But the senator's  
spokesman, Steve Hilton, said Wednesday that the links were shut 
down because of a ``routine review'' that started before what he 
dismissed as Farinella's ``all-night mouse click-a-thon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That research upset many backers of Ashcroft, a gospel-singing  
son of an Assemblies of God minister, a new grandfather married for 
more than three decades and one-time presidential favorite of 
Christian conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are either amused or irritated that the clash of  
Missouri's most popular politicians has gone so negative so early. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of them are squeaky clean,'' said Ken Warren, a Saint  
Louis University political scientist professor who has tracked the 
careers of Carnahan and Ashcroft since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither one could conceivably be guilty of anything associated  
with illicit sex, so these allegations from both camps are bogus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton, the Ashcroft spokesman, said his boss deserves credit  
for offering an on-screen warning when a visitor is about to leave 
the Senate site for the wide-open paths of cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan's site had no such warning, but it is being discussed.  
</P>
<P>
	Greg Johnson, chief programming analyst for the computer system  
at the University of Missouri-Columbia, scoffed at the notion that 
screen warnings stop the curious from online surfing, including 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just a fig leaf for Ashcroft's protection, not the  
child's,'' Johnson said. ``I think it's an unnecessary step -- a 
mother hen approach that may actually incite a child to look. This 
is like your mom saying don't go to the pool hall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Biegel, director of UCLA's Online Institute for  
Cyberspace Law and Policy, countered that on-screen warnings ``are 
a reasonable thing to ask'' of a government site's offramps to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``But anybody who knows anything about the Web knows if you  
follow links, you will come to places you hadn't intended to go,'' 
Biegel said. ``Is this really the most important issue that could 
be debated in the Senate race in Missouri?''

<HEADLINE> Ireland Has New Singer Sinead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Women often react as if they're hearing a  
feminist anthem when singer Sinead Lohan performs the title cut to 
her album, ``No Mermaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hypnotic chorus certainly sounds like a defiant statement of  
self-sufficiency in a patriarchal society: ``I am no mermaid, and I 
am no fisherman's slave,'' she sings. ``I am no mermaid, I keep my 
head above the waves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Lohan is uncomfortable when women cheer and sing along in  
solidarity with sisterhood. In those moments, she's apt to switch 
personal pronouns and make the mermaid a man. 
</P>
<P>
	She began writing the song with the image of a person going down  
to the water's edge, faced with the prospect of swimming out of his 
or her depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people would take the challenge and go for it and others  
would be too conflicted,'' she explained over a cup of coffee one 
cold afternoon in Manhattan. ``I was thinking that no matter how 
far you go out into the water, you're still a person, you still 
have to go back on the land. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what it was,'' she said. ``It wasn't about women at  
all. I was just making an observation about human nature. I leave 
that sort of hidden political message to another Sinead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lohan's not about to have her music hijacked by anyone. Her  
American debut album, one of last year's best, exhibits that 
resolve. It's a sturdy collection of folk-rock, impressive in its 
maturity and sense of craft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lohan, 28, grew up in County Cork, Ireland, the daughter of a  
school administrator and a father who used to play in show bands. 
She was a fan of classical music, but was also moved by 
contemporary artists like Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and 
that other Sinead -- Sinead O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I admired them for being themselves,'' she said. ``It wasn't  
like I could sing like them or write like them. I discovered you 
could be yourself and still be that strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from high school, she took a college course in  
music and began singing her own songs in a pub back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Lohan even had a chance to decide whether music was what  
she wanted to do with her life, her songs started getting noticed 
and she made a record. That 1995 album, ``Who Do You Think I Am,'' 
was a Top 10 hit in Ireland and was eventually released throughout 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``No Mermaid'' represents Americans' first chance to hear her  
music. She's signed to Interscope Records in the United States, one 
of the most successful labels of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Her songs are infused with ambivalent characters. ``Sometimes  
you give me all you've got to give me,'' Lohan sings, ``and 
sometimes you act like you don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She says she's fascinated at how everyone can relate to the  
emotions in music, regardless of language or nationality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really only trying to capture a feeling that you might  
have had for a minute in a song,'' she said. ``It's like trying to 
take a photograph of a particular feeling or a time. I'm writing 
about really small things. I'm not writing about any things that 
are unusual -- it's just basic human emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And don't worry if you can't understand what's going on in a  
particular song. Sometimes you're not meant to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to create a mood in a song and it doesn't matter  
what the words mean, really,'' she said. ``Maybe I get a feeling 
from someone else's songs and I wouldn't necessarily know what they 
are talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In producer Malcolm Burn, Lohan found a distinctive, though not  
overwhelming, partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Burn is a disciple of producer Daniel Lanois, whose spooky  
soundscapes are heard on albums like Bob Dylan's ``Time Out of 
Mind.'' The drawback to Lanois is sometimes his work is more 
recognizable than the artist he's producing. Burn had intriguing 
production ideas but they were all in service to the song. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed a producer who would take what I produced and build a  
picture around me instead of a collaborator,'' she said. ``I sang 
as best I could and he filled it in. His production ideas were 
amazing, he made every sound sound different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lohan's career was boosted by an association with Joan Baez. She  
opened concerts for Baez on a British tour and the veteran folkie 
was so impressed with Lohan's work she recorded two of her songs, 
including ``No Mermaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it as a huge compliment, that somebody who has been  
around so many great songwriters would choose to record some of my 
songs,'' Lohan said. ``She's in a different scene, but she appeals 
to a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lohan is methodically trying to build her audience.  
She's done three separate concert tours in the United States since 
the album's release, each time playing to bigger crowds. She was 
even amenable to playing in the Northeast during the winter even 
while pregnant with her first child. She brought along her 
childhood sweetheart, an accountant, for company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still very exciting for me to come over from Ireland and  
play,'' she said. ``It's still a big adventure.''

<HEADLINE> Galarraga Determined To Beat Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Andres Galarraga didn't have to put on  
his uniform and swing a bat to inspire the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The slugger, diagnosed with cancer last month, visited the  
team's spring training complex Wednesday, and his teammates like 
what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga was cheerful, confident he'll beat his illness and  
return to the club next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to put it this way. It's just like you got hurt,''  
said infielder Ozzie Guillen, like Galarraga a native of Venezuela. 
``It's like you broke your leg or Kerry Wood being out eight 
months. Just think of it like that. I think Andres will come back 
pretty soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old first baseman began chemotherapy last month and  
is scheduled to start his second treatment on Friday. The initial 
session made him nauseous with headaches for several days. But he's 
not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first three days are probably the most difficult,'' said  
Galarraga, who spoke with reporters for about 45 minutes in his 
first public appearance since doctors found a cancerous tumor in a 
bone in his lower back on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``But after awhile I began to feel better. If that's what's  
going to make me better, then I can hang with those three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attitude Galarraga brought for his brief visit to spring  
training was the same one teammates encountered when they made a 
surprise visit to the slugger's West Palm Beach home on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love baseball so much,'' Galarraga said. ``To be here is  
special ... Just talking to these guys about the game helps a lot. 
I think it helps them, too. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans gave Galarraga a standing ovation before Wednesday's game  
between the Braves and Detroit Tigers. Walt Disney World, where 
Atlanta holds camp, presented him with a 14-by-6 foot get-well card 
bearing more than 2,500 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Since news of his illness broke, the first baseman has received  
thousands of letters and also heard from Darryl Strawberry, Eric 
Davis and Brett Butler, who all came back from stints with cancer 
to play baseball again. 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga will undergo treatment every three weeks the next few  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say I will have about five or six treatments, but it all  
depends on my body's reaction to each one,'' he said. ``I have been 
through the first treatment, but it is too early to see the 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen said the slugger's illness is a huge story in their  
native country. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the worst news we've heard in a long time. A lot of  
people didn't believe what happened,'' Guillen said. ``When you say 
cancer, people think you're going to die. The country was really in 
shock, and they're still talking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galarraga, who hit .305 with 44 homers and 121 RBIs in 1998,  
signed a $24.75 million, three-year contract with the Braves before 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talk to him like he doesn't have any disease. I still don't  
want to think about him having cancer. I don't want to bring out 
any more emotion,'' catcher Javy Lopez said. ``To me, he looks 
fine. We feel like he's still with us in our hearts.''

<HEADLINE> Toyota To Open Theme Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hoping to convince young buyers that Toyotas aren't  
boring cars for their parents, Japan's top auto company is opening 
a theme park with games and rides to show that cars can be fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's $126 million facility is part of a futuristic  
waterfront amusement complex in Tokyo called Palette Town, which 
has a concert hall, adventure rides and a giant Ferris wheel. The 
carmaker's park, which is dubbed Mega Web, opens to the public on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota is hoping that Mega Web will jazz up its image as a staid  
automaker and attract younger car buyers at a time when a stubborn 
recession has been sending auto sales plunging in Japan. In January 
alone, Toyota's production tumbled 14 percent from the same month a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The park includes exhibits of Toyota models from the 1950s, as  
well as Dodges and other makes. Visitors can also try designing a 
car on computers, play with clay models, and take a jaunt in a tiny 
electric car that showcases an automated driving system. 
</P>
<P>
	A test-drive course allows visitors to try out actual Toyota  
models, but one thing you can't do here is actually buy a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want people to see, drive and experience our cars,'' said  
Toyota President Hiroshi Okuda. ``One reason we decided on this 
project is the attraction of the waterfront. It's vibrant and a big 
hit with the young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's waterfront is a favorite dating spot for young Japanese,  
and the raging success of Tokyo Disneyland has shown how effective 
amusement parks can be at attracting children and young couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts, however, have reservations about the  
project. ``It's a very expensive way to go about altering their 
image,'' said Steve Usher, an auto analyst with Jardine Fleming. 
Usher said Toyota still needs to come up with models that appeal to 
young buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mega Web park offers several types of virtual driving  
machines, which resemble arcade games. The ``Mission Triangle'' 
flashes jungle scenes with dinosaurs on a screen as the car dips 
and shakes depending on how you drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Future World'' pavilion will feature a high-tech roller  
coaster, but that exhibit wasn't ready for the press tour Thursday. 
Officials said it would open soon. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Toyota, the Palette Town amusement complex also  
gets backing from Mori Building Co. and other companies. The area 
has a bowling alley, restaurants, and a hall for rock concerts. A 
shopping mall opens in the summer, and a colorful Ferris wheel 
offers a view of Mt. Fuji on a clear day.

<HEADLINE> Seating for Oscar Is a Real Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget Steven Spielberg, Michael Eisner and  
Michael Ovitz. The most powerful person in Hollywood these days is 
a guy named Otto. 
</P>
<P>
	You know, Otto Spoerri.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, yes. I am the most powerful,'' chuckles the  
66-year-old financial controller of the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Spoerri's job to ration out Oscar tickets when the  
ceremony squeezes into the 2,850-seat Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on 
Sunday after the last two years at the cavernous Shrine Auditorium, 
which seats 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Let the whining begin.  
</P>
<P>
	``You hear it every year,'' Spoerri says with a sigh. ``You  
know, `My mother is dying of cancer' or `My parents are flying in 
from New Zealand.' I've heard it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 23 years, Spoerri has decided who gets in, who sits where  
and who gets left out. With fewer than half as many seats available 
this year as in 1998, there's a lot of arm-twisting to get into the 
71st Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just say, `Guess what? Each nominee is offered two  
tickets,''' he says. That means there are 157 people eligible for 
the $250 tickets, and Spoerri is willing to listen to pleas for 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some nominees ask for extra seats for parents, grown-up kids,  
whatever it might be. If you can accommodate them, you do. But it's 
tight this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six staffers handle all ticket-related calls, but Spoerri  
usually becomes the target of the dissatisfied since his signature 
is on each rejection letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been threatened, but they can get angry and let  
their steam out. I'll listen. I really feel for these people,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoerri admits he was ``pretty awed by the star power'' when he  
first took over the job. Now, denying an A-list phenom is almost 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said `no' to stars,'' he says, refusing to identify  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, ever vigilant  
about interlopers to their ultra-private party, pounces on brokers 
who sell Oscar tickets to non-sanctioned guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets found in the wrong hands are traced and offending  
Academy members forever blacklisted from the Oscars. There are two 
or three such expulsions each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is simple: ``If we have a member whose ticket request  
is rejected, then he looks on the TV and sees somebody's 
hairdresser in a seat, they are unhappy,'' Spoerri says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy has 6,000 members, yet only 300 seats are dedicated  
for them. Members are picked by lottery and ``people who are a name 
sometimes don't get picked,'' Spoerri says. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenters, of course, get tickets and so do their dates.  
Studios, telecast advertisers, performers, past Academy governors, 
Academy friends and the news media get still more. 
</P>
<P>
	California Gov. Gray Davis, Mayor Richard Riordan and police  
Chief Bernard Parks got tickets this year, as did the mayor and 
fire chief of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding who sits where is yet another ordeal for Spoerri, who  
must decide if guests sit on the more prestigious main floor or in 
the balcony. Separating feuding stars is another headache. 
</P>
<P>
	So where will the most powerful man in Hollywood be Sunday  
evening? 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I have tickets,'' he says. ``I can enjoy the show  
once it starts.''

<HEADLINE> China Denies Spy Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Chinese diplomat, flatly denying allegations  
his country stole nuclear weapons data from an American laboratory, 
blamed Cold War thinking and partisan politics for the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are sorry there is no more Soviet Union and they don't  
know how to act,'' He Yafei, a minister-counsel at the Chinese 
Embassy, said of those making the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese diplomat said the dispute could harm improving  
relations between the United States and China, and that some 
Chinese scientists are questioning whether to continue scientific 
exchanges ``to advance our knowledge of nuclear science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some people in the United States who do not want to  
see progress in the Sino-U.S. relationship,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official did not identify anyone, and specifically excluded  
Sandy Berger, the U.S. national security adviser, who supports 
closer ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the allegations that a Chinese-American scientist  
provided Beijing with sensitive material, He replied that ``nothing 
of this sort has ever happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, FBI Director Louis Freeh said nuclear secrets could  
leak inadvertently and added that the Energy Department is taking 
steps to make sure that a casual e-mail or fax doesn't give away 
sensitive military secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Clinton administration and Congress struggled to close  
holes in the security surrounding the nation's nuclear weapons 
laboratories, top officials said sophisticated spies might not be 
the only outlet for classified information on nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh told a House hearing Wednesday that the FBI still is  
trying to determine whether a leak to China of weapons information 
from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico occurred through 
the actual passing of documents or simply from viewing and 
memorizing information that was seen or read. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh said he could not rule out information getting into  
Chinese hands by ways in which a person ``is not intending to 
transmit secret information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes ``information gets transferred between two scientists,  
and at least one of them ... had no intent at all to transfer top 
secret information,'' making the investigations more difficult, 
Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Security at federal weapons labs has been troublesome for years,  
the FBI chief said. ``The culture has not been a 
security-conscious, or certainly never a counterintelligence 
security-conscious one,'' he said. ``That's been the greatest 
vulnerability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to change that culture, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson  
imposed new security measures for e-mail and other electronic 
communications from the national weapons labs Wednesday. He also 
ordered an internal investigation of allegations that a department 
official was prevented from briefing Congress on evidence of 
Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of blame to go around,'' Richardson told  
reporters following a closed meeting of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee. ``This started during the Reagan-Bush years. ... There 
are also problems on our side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said he had no evidence that secrets have been  
leaking out via e-mail, but he said such a scenario ``is a 
potential problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee was questioning Richardson on how the  
administration responded when it first learned of an inquiry into 
the alleged Chinese theft of top-secret nuclear warhead technology 
from Los Alamos in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``China did get information relating to the (warhead) which is  
damaging to our national security,'' Richardson said. ``The extent 
of that damage is not yet known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intelligence officials first learned of the apparent security  
breach in 1995 and an FBI investigation began in early 1996. A 
scientist at Los Alamos was fired March 8 after being the target of 
the FBI investigation. He has not been charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson rejected a proposal by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,  
chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that the administration 
impose a moratorium on exchange programs involving lab scientists 
going overseas and foreign scientists coming to the labs. But he 
said former CIA Director John Deutch would review the weapons labs' 
foreign visitors program to ensure it ``meets the highest standards 
of security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The foreign visitors program is important to our national  
security,'' Richardson said. ``We want Russian scientists to know 
how they should control their nuclear weapons. ... Let's not get 
hysterical and overreach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby, emerging later from the closed-door meeting, said no one  
was getting hysterical and that the issue was not being 
politicized. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about Democrats or Republicans,'' Shelby said. He  
questioned whether the security measures imposed by Richardson, 
particularly on e-mail, would provide sufficient protection.

<HEADLINE> C-Span Marks 20 Year Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When C-Span debuted on March 19, 1979, the  
cable TV network had four employees, a $450,000 budget and one 
telephone line to yield calls from creditors and viewers alike. It 
operated only during business hours because the satellite it shared 
showed sporting events at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, the network boasts gavel-to-gavel coverage of  
Congress, a staff of 250 and a $33 million budget. But ask chairman 
Brian Lamb to describe other differences between then and now and 
he'll say the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network he founded 
remains virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than the fact we offer a lot more programs, the mission  
is exactly the same,'' Lamb said in an interview. ``And the 
product, by and large on most days, is exactly the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	C-Span premiered with funding from the cable industry and to  
fears about the impact of televising proceedings in Congress. But 
the now-24-hour network soon became so popular among political 
junkies that senators began to complain about all the attention 
going to their House counterparts. Thus, the debut seven years 
later of C-Span 2 to telecast live sessions of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb said he always knew he'd find an audience for his network.  
C-Span has attracted a small but loyal group of viewers who crave 
more news than a 30-second sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 74.6 million households can view C-Span on their cable  
or satellite TV systems, a 1997 survey by Statistical Research Inc. 
estimated that just 22 million people watch C-Span each week. But 
nearly all of them -- 94 percent -- were registered to vote and did 
so in the last general election. C-Span viewers also were more 
likely to contact lawmakers, volunteer in campaigns and make 
political contributions, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience can be a somewhat fanatical bunch: Tune in at 7  
a.m. on the East Coast to the network's daily ``Washington 
Journal'' program hosted by Lamb and it wouldn't be unusual to hear 
from a wide-awake caller from California. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain percent of the public, a thinking public and  
voting public that wants the discussion, that wants the challenge, 
that wants the information,'' said Lamb, a stolid presence who 
could be called the Joe Friday of cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
	His unemotional, ``just the facts'' interviewing style has  
helped make Lamb, 57, the most recognizable personality on the 
deliberately anti-personality C-Span. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamb served as a Pentagon spokesman during the Johnson  
administration and as a press secretary for Republican Sen. Peter 
Dominick of Colorado. He is a former reporter for UPI Audio and a 
past Washington bureau chief for CableVision magazine, which is 
where he was working when he came up with the idea for C-Span and 
its gavel-to-gavel coverage of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Using simple, stationary camera angles, C-Span attempts to  
provide the most neutral view of every event it telecasts. In 
addition to sessions on the House floor, the network also shows 
congressional hearings, speeches at the National Press Club and 
press briefings by federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The only cameras C-Span cannot control are the ones in the House  
and Senate chambers -- the network must tap into a government feed -- 
but they are consistent with the network's speaker-and-podium 
style. 
</P>
<P>
	C-Span offers Americans a more realistic look at politicians  
than the usual polished image supplied by evening news clips and 
Sunday TV talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, C-Span has shown American that Congress consists of  
``flawed human beings,'' said John Pitney, a government professor 
at Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not every member is 'Mr. Smith Going to Washington.' The House  
is noticeably short of Jimmy Stewarts,'' Pitney said of the famed 
movie. Like many college instructors, Pitney uses C-Span 
extensively in class. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Levinson, a communications professor at Fordham University,  
recalled the shock of watching members of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice 
Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here they were considering very important issues -- should this  
man become a Supreme Court Justice, and sexual harassment,'' he 
said. ``Just the expressions on some of the faces of the senators, 
yawning and looking uninterested. It was something I don't think 
anyone had seen before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Frantzich, co-author of ``The C-Span Revolution,''  
agreed that the network has affected the way the public sees its 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's set up this kind of expectation that, hey, we ought to be  
doing things in public, that there's a sense of illegitimacy if 
it's done behind closed doors,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> House Committee Approves Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for  
fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday and were a hair's 
breadth from prevailing in a Senate panel after GOP lawmakers 
crushed Democratic attempts to block tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 22-18 party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved  
a spending plan by panel Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that 
promises to leave Social Security surpluses alone while reducing 
taxes and increasing defense, education and several other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can do much better than that,'' Kasich said.  
</P>
<P>
	Simultaneously, the Senate Budget Committee moved toward  
approving a similar plan. That panel planned to complete its work 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On both sides of the Capitol, Democrats proposed requiring that  
Social Security and Medicare be overhauled before Republicans could 
get the tax cuts they want -- $15 billion next year and $778 billion 
over the next decade. The GOP majority prevailed by party-line 
votes, 12-10 in the Senate Budget Committee and 23-19 in the House 
Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats designed their amendments to the 2000 budget in order  
to cast Republicans as more eager to cut taxes than to fortify 
Social Security and Medicare for the looming retirement of baby 
boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a desperation to claim tax cuts as a primary thing  
they have to focus on,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, the 
Senate budget panel's ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered that projected federal surpluses -- which  
they say will total $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years -- make it 
possible to do many things. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get it straight,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman  
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``There are many priorities. We're going to 
save Medicare'' and Social Security. ``And in addition we are going 
to give the American people a welcome, needed tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the GOP flexed its muscle in committee, they ran into a  
Clinton administration veto threat over a GOP plan to ensure that 
Social Security's vast surpluses over the next decade -- before baby 
boomers start retiring -- be set aside for debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican proposal -- which will move as separate  
legislation from the budget resolution -- would require that Social 
Security surpluses be used to buy down the debt. Doing otherwise 
would require votes of 60 of the 100 senators, a tough hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Democratic leaders, Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin said the plan could hinder the government from issuing new 
debt if needed, threatening its credit rating and perhaps requiring 
it to stop paying Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will recommend that the president veto the bill if it  
contains the debt limit provisions,'' Rubin wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the GOP tax reductions, the similar budget plans by  
Domenici and Kasich would set aside $1.8 trillion in Social 
Security surpluses through 2009 for debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress' budget sets overall spending and tax limits, leaving  
decisions about specifics for later bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the GOP budget would boost defense spending to $289  
billion, $9 billion more than this year and $8 billion more than 
Clinton has proposed. They would also increase spending for primary 
and secondary schools by more than $2 billion next year, and 
provide more for some agriculture and veterans programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they could afford those increases while  
honoring a tight spending limit for next year set by the 1997 
budget-balancing pact. Neither committee provided much detail about 
which programs they would cut to heed that spending ceiling, but 
both chairmen said they could do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these numbers are achievable,'' said Kasich. He  
added later, ``Every program can't go up if we're going to stay'' 
within the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Democrats said that to afford the GOP's proposed  
increases, the remaining programs affected by the spending limits 
would face 12 percent reductions. That could mean cuts to popular 
programs such as Head Start, food inspections and the FBI, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it were an over-the-counter drug, it would have to say,  
'Warning: Could be harmful to elderly, children and working 
families,''' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said of 
the GOP plan. ``It is really a disappointment. They've given us an 
offer that we must refuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this plan would leave wreckage in its path,'' said  
Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management 
and Budget.

<HEADLINE> Allman's Child Sues His Record Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Duane Allman's only child has sued his record  
company for at least $1 million, charging that her late father's 
estate is owed royalties for his work on the ``Layla'' recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	The rock guitarist played in 1970 with the group Derek and the  
Dominoes, featuring Eric Clapton, during sessions that produced an 
album entitled ``Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Allman died on Oct. 29, 1971, following a motorcycle  
accident in Georgia, Atlantic Records Co., which distributed the 
album in this country on PolyGram's behalf, continued to pay 
royalties to his estate. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed in New York on Wednesday, Galadrielle  
Allman of Berkeley, Calif., says a contract between her father and 
record producers called for him to get 2 percent of retail sales of 
any recordings that came out of the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Allman says PolyGram was supposed to continue payments after  
1981 but did not. A lawyer for Universal Music Group, which 
recently absorbed Polygram, did not return calls for comment.

<HEADLINE> 3M: Strong Dollar Will Hurt Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing's  
profits will be shy of analyst expectations in the first quarter 
due to the strength of the dollar against currencies in Europe and 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials told analysts Wednesday that the dollar's  
increasing strength against other currencies in the first two 
months of the quarter have cut earnings from sales by about 1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong dollar hurts American exporters by making U.S. products  
more expensive in other currencies and making foreign revenues less 
valuable when converted into dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	3M, best known as the maker of Scotch brand tape and Post-It  
Notes, makes more than half of its sales abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of 3M fell $2.31 1/4, or 3 percent, to $74.06 1/4 by early  
Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The profit 
update by 3M came after the close of trading on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 3M struggled throughout 1998 against unfavorable  
exchange rates, the company's latest annual report to shareholders 
said currency pressures were a ``minimal'' threat to this year's 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, 3M said it would eliminate 4,500 jobs, or 6 percent  
of its work force, to reduce operating costs. About half of those 
cuts had been made by the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Govt.: Y2K Costs To Top $6 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government's estimated price tag  
for fixing its most important computers to avoid the Year 2000 
technology problem rose $400 million to $6.8 billion, and that 
amount is expected to go up again in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	In the government's latest status report on its Y2K efforts, the  
White House Office of Management and Budget said Wednesday that 
only 80 percent of its 6,399 most important computers have been 
repaired, replaced or never were vulnerable -- even with only weeks 
before the government's self-imposed deadline of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said three of the government's 24 largest agencies  
are making inadequate progress -- the Transportation Department, 
Health and Human Services and the Agency for International 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
	Work at AID, one of the worst agencies for repairs, slowed after  
a computer failed testing what officials believed had already been 
fixed. The government predicted that five of that agency's seven 
most important computers won't be fixed by the March 31 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, posted on the Internet late Wednesday, said the $400  
million increase to fix all systems government-wide was 
anticipated, and it blamed the rise in agencies finding that some 
computer systems need to be reworked after initial repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that agencies encounter additional difficulties  
through testing ... costs are likely to rise,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when machines will assume it is 1900. Some computers can be 
reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded microchips that must 
be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report said agencies are facing few problems because  
of these embedded chips, which aren't typically used for systems 
operating federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This area does not appear to be of great concern,'' it said.  
</P>
<P>
	The government also said it doesn't expect to experience  
problems in its federal buildings, some of which feature 
computer-controlled elevators and heating and security systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``No catastrophic Y2K building system potential failures have  
been identified,'' the report said, adding that ``nearly all such 
systems allow for manual override.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the largest 24 federal agencies have completed work  
already: the Environmental Protection Agency, National Science 
Foundation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Small Business 
Administration and Social Security Administration.

<HEADLINE> Admin. Criticizes Crop Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and the Clinton administration  
fired opening salvos in the growing debate over how to pay for an 
overhaul of a farm crop insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican plan to spend an extra $6 billion over four years  
for the reforms doesn't seem possible, the Clinton administration 
charged Thursday. The White House hasn't even offered a plan, 
Republicans countered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to make pie-in-the-sky promises about things,''  
Sylvia Mathews, deputy director of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget, said in an interview. ``What is real is the 
commitment and when you deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., called the administration's  
complaints ``ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton did not include additional money for crop  
insurance in his budget, even while maintaining his commitment to 
passing reforms, Chambliss said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty strong signal he had no intention of making  
any changes to crop insurance,'' Chambliss said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate Budget Committees included the $6 billion  
in their budget resolutions. The amount spent each year would vary 
but it would be in addition to the $1.6 billion now spent on the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget resolutions are essentially blueprints for things GOP  
leaders would like to accomplish. The actual spending will be 
determined by legislation to be considered later. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have said the Republican crop insurance  
proposal would require drastic cuts elsewhere in the budget. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has proposed a plan that would 
cost $2 billion to $2.5 billion more a year than current spending, 
but administration officials said they wanted to work with GOP 
leaders to develop a substantive funding plan. 
</P>
<P>
	With low crop prices expected to continue, lawmakers want to use  
crop insurance as a safety net to help farmers through the tough 
times. Reforms, they maintain, will help boost participation in the 
program. Many farmers don't have crop insurance, saying it is 
expensive or inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, taxpayers' dollars cover 60 percent of the  
program while farmers' premiums pay for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, Glickman appeared before exasperated  
lawmakers and defended an expected eight-month delay in getting 
$2.3 billion in emergency disaster aid to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is part of a $6 billion disaster aid package passed in  
October. Glickman said last week that the ``complex'' process of 
disbursing the money to farmers meant checks probably wouldn't go 
out until June. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not rocket science. This is not splitting the atom.  
This is something the department has done before,'' said House 
Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have gotten the money out in January,''  
Glickman said. ``We created a program from scratch. We're doing the 
best we can under these circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> Editor of Hip-Hop's Blaze Is Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The editor of the hip-hop magazine Blaze says he  
was fired after he wrote an editorial defending the man who was 
acquitted in the slaying of the son of Time Warner chairman Gerald 
Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin founded the music magazine Vibe, which in turn spawned  
Blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Washington, who was fired Tuesday, said he had a  
falling-out with his employers after writing an editorial about 
Montoun Hart, who was acquitted in the killing of Jonathan Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington and Hart are friends, and about a week ago Washington  
hired him as a $8-an-hour intern at Blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington said his editorial -- which never ran -- asserted that  
police had forced Hart to sign a confession of their own invention. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart had been accused of being an accomplice in torturing  
31-year-old Jonathan Levin with a knife for his bank card number, 
looting his account of $800, then killing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington said that after the editorial was spiked, he wrote a  
second editorial ``lambasting the owners of the magazine for 
killing the first editorial.'' He added that he knew the second 
editorial would not run. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaze's spokeswoman, Audrey Addison, had no comment other than  
to confirm that Washington had been let go. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, Washington was kicked in the face and head in his  
office in November by four men. Two men have been charged with the 
assault, including rap producer Deric ``D-Dot'' Angellettie. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington said he believes Angellettie was angry because the  
magazine had identified him as being the performer known as the 
Madd Rapper. Angellettie denied any part in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Washington accused Fugees guitar player Wyclef Jean  
of pointing a gun at him inside a recording studio because Jean 
didn't like Blaze's review of an album he had produced. Jean denied 
the incident happened and called it a publicity stunt by 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, 29, is a former assistant chief of bureau for The  
Associated Press in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington said he is working on several book projects and is  
weighing other job offers.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average cracked 10,000  
six times today but pulled back each time, finishing a nail-biting 
session less than three points below the mark. The blue-chip index

gains -- on Tuesday, the index briefly traded as high as 10,001.78, 
but slipped back and closed with a loss. Broad market indexes made 
substantial gains as well today, indicating a perhaps more durable

	Unions Lose Case Vs. Tobacco Firms  
</P>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- A federal jury handed the tobacco industry a  
big victory today, rejecting a $2 billion lawsuit brought by union 
health funds to recover the costs of workers' smoking-related 
illnesses. The jury ruled for the industry on all counts in the 
first of about 12 such lawsuits around the country to go to trial. 
The 114 Ohio union health funds argued that the tobacco industry 
concealed evidence of the dangers of smoking and went after 
less-educated blue-collar workers with images of the Marlboro Man 
and Joe Camel. The tobacco companies contended there was nothing 
illegal about their ad campaigns and disputed the idea that 
blue-workers are more susceptible to advertising.

	Monthly Trade Deficit Sets Record  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government had mixed economic news today:  
a new high in the monthly trade deficit in January and only a tiny 
rise in consumer prices last month. Consumer prices rose just 0.1 
percent despite a few scattered trouble spots such as meat, oranges 
and airline fares. February marked the third consecutive monthly 
rise of that tiny magnitude in the Consumer Price Index, the Labor 
Department said. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the United 
States' monthly trade deficit soared to an all-time high of $17 
billion in January as global financial troubles pushed U.S. exports 
down further while imports of autos, consumer goods and food were 
climbing to record highs. The deficit was up 21 percent from 
December's $14.1 billion level and surpassed the old monthly record 
of $16.7 billion set last August.

in its third quarter ended Feb. 28, exceeding Wall Street forecasts 
by a wide margin. In the same period a year ago, FDX earned $18 
million, or 12 cents a share, including one-time acquisition costs. 
Third-quarter revenues totaled $4.1 billion, a 3 percent increase

tendency to ``crash'' when retrieving Internet information. A 
Microsoft official rejected observations by some that the new

	FCC Approves New Phone Rate Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a few clicks of a computer mouse,  
telephone customers could scan the Internet for the current prices 
that long-distance companies charge for their services. The Federal 
Communications Commission, in a 4-1 vote today, adopted rules that 
eventually could require AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, Sprint and other 
long-distance carriers to post such information on their corporate 
Web sites. The major long-distance companies say they already 
voluntarily provide information about rates on their Web sites. But 
the FCC plan, assuming it takes effect, would force them to do so.

Federal Communications Commission agreed to tighten rules making it 
easier for companies to install equipment at major local phone 
companies' central offices to provide high-speed services. The 
revised rules should take effect in one or two months. The order 
would help companies, including Covad Communications and NorthPoint 
Communications, which provide connections letting businesses access 
information from computers at speeds considerably faster than 
regular phone lines.

plan. The move affects 30,000 retirees and 22,000 current 
employees, but company officials said everyone will be taken care 
of. The retirees are being offered the option of receiving an 
annuity from an insurance company equal to the value of the pension 
they were receiving or a lump-sum payout. About 25 percent of the 
excess funding in the old pension plan will be used to fund a new

incomes may be overlooking an IRS provision aimed at cutting or 
even eliminating their federal income taxes. And the sheer 
complexity of the earned income tax credit leads to errors by many 
of those who do try to claim it. Simply determining eligibility for 
the credit requires completion of a 12-question checklist, which is 
then followed by a nine-line worksheet and an eight-line form. All 
of this requires constant reference to several pages of Internal 
Revenue Service instructions.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Preparing To Borrow Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp., which just acquired cable TV giant  
Tele-Communications Inc., is about to go on a borrowing binge with 
the planned sale of at least $6 billion in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a new look for a company that has long been the most widely  
held stock in America. For generations, Americans have bought and 
held shares in the company they regarded as reliable old Ma Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next week, investors can purchase a piece of AT&AMP;T's  
debt as well. But will investors who have coveted AT&AMP;T for its 
stability and steady profits be so quick to embrace a security 
based on debt? 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Thursday they expect the cachet of the AT&AMP;T name  
to make the bond offering a hot ticket, perhaps stimulating the 
entire $2.4 trillion U.S. corporate bond market. While the company 
plans to offer $5 billion to $6 billion in bonds, outsiders say the 
deal could easily balloon to $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That would surpass the $6.10 billion of debt taken on in August  
by upstart rival WorldCom Corp. as it gobbled up MCI Communications 
to become MCI WorldCom Inc. The biggest corporate bond issue ever 
was by RJR Holdings Capital, which sold $6.11 billion in May 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T needs the money to foster its growth in a booming, highly  
competitive industry, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T's goals take vision, money and execution,'' said Jeffrey  
Kagan, an independent industry analyst in Atlanta. ``They have the 
vision and can certainly execute their plans. They just need 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T officials said proceeds from the offering will first be  
used to help pay for its recently completed $42 billion purchase of 
TCI and its $4 billion stock buyback program. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, AT&AMP;T will need the funds to help convert TCI's cable lines  
into local phone lines, a cornerstone of AT&AMP;T's plan to move back 
into local service. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond sale isn't AT&AMP;T's first foray into selling debt.  
Spokeswoman Eileen Connolly said the company has moved in and out 
of the bond market for years, although the last offering was a 
relatively paltry $300 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The time is right for borrowing by big business. Interest rates  
are low. In addition, as federal surpluses grow, the government is 
cutting back on its borrowing and the bond market is able to absorb 
more debt from businesses without pumping up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good time for us to get back into it,'' Connolly  
said, citing the TCI deal. By contrast, the mid-1990s featured the 
sale or divestiture of AT&AMP;T's credit card assets, Lucent 
Technologies Inc. and NCR Corp., which left the company flush with 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength and competitiveness of rivals like MCI WorldCom  
have spurred AT&AMP;T to keep growing and keep spending, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an expensive time for all the phone companies,'' Kagan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond offering will allow AT&AMP;T to pay for its deals without  
dipping into cash on hand or issuing more stock, which would dilute 
earnings. Just Wednesday, the company's board approved a 3-for-2 
stock split, effective April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper Petagna, president of American Municipal Securities in  
St. Petersburg, Fla., said shareholders shouldn't necessarily be 
scared off by the prospect of debt. While corporate bonds are more 
frequently purchased by institutional investors, individuals can 
buy them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``A company can really enhance its value by borrowing to finance  
growth,'' he said. ``It all has to do with the way the business is 
managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, as AT&AMP;T began a push to attract institutional  
investors to the bonds, company executives emphasized their 
intention to protect AT&AMP;T's credit rating. That's an important 
gauge for any investor, Petagna said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's long-term debt now receives stellar reviews from  
credit-rating agencies like Standard &AMP; Poor's and Moody's Investors 
Services Inc. Tim Caffrey, an S&AMP;P analyst who covers AT&AMP;T, said the 
big new bond offering isn't likely to affect the company's 
creditworthiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an offering of this size came as a surprise, that would be  
a problem,'' Caffrey said. ``But AT&AMP;T has always kept us pretty 
well-informed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AT&AMP;T fell $1.87 1/2, or 2 percent, to close at $82.12 1/2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> IOC Releases Financial Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- In a new sign of openness, the  
International Olympic Committee released its financial books to the 
public Thursday and offered a rare peak into the lifestyle of its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's net worth at the end of 1998 was listed as $136  
million, according to the audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash, bank deposits and television-rights trust funds totaled  
$237 million, and the committee finished the year with a $40 
million operating surplus on income of $86 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Olympic Foundation -- a reserve fund set up in  
the event of the games being canceled -- has $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had not issued a unified audit in four years, although  
its records were available to the public in various forms. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee has been under pressure to open its books as part  
of a reform process in the wake of the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal. On Thursday, it released the figures on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said that from now on, the audits would be released  
every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as it was clear there was world attention to this  
matter, we released the report,'' spokesman Franklin 
Servan-Schreiber said. ``We are complying with the best 
international business practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report showed that the IOC paid $204,000 last year to cover  
the living expenses of president Juan Antonio Samaranch when he was 
in Lausanne. Samaranch, who does not receive a salary, lives in a 
suite at the Lausanne Palace hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Under persistent questioning from reporters, the IOC also  
disclosed how much its members receive in per diem and other 
allowances. 
</P>
<P>
	Rank-and-file members get $105 a day in Lausanne and $150  
elsewhere for expenses other than room and board during IOC 
meetings, including the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive board members get $1,000 expense checks for an entire  
meeting, with all other expenses paid for. The figure had been $500 
until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch described the stipends for executive board members as  
``pocket money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thierry Sprunger, the IOC's comptroller, said the total expenses  
for executive board members, who meet at least four times a year, 
totaled $88,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also covers all airfares -- first class only for  
executive board members, and business or first class for the 
rank-and-file.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Bill Blasted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia and China on Thursday criticized the  
Senate's approval of a U.S. anti-missile defense system, saying the 
move would threaten the globe's strategic balance. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill overwhelmingly approved by the Senate on Wednesday  
commits the Pentagon to building a national defense against limited 
ballistic missile attack ``as soon as technologically possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That poses a serious threat to the whole process of nuclear  
arms control, as well as strategic stability, for which major 
international agreements have been worked out for decades,'' the 
Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. bill was based on a new assessment of the threat of  
attack from countries such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said the  
measure is counterproductive for arms control and disarmament and 
will ``have an impact on global strategic balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China fears the system could spark a costly arms race, would  
strengthen U.S. military alliances with Japan and South Korea and 
may be used to protect Taiwan, thereby obstructing reunification. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have long expressed concern over the U.S. plan  
to develop anti-missile defenses that would violate the 1972 
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty between the United States and the 
Soviet Union. They have resisted U.S. proposals about possibly 
amending the treaty to allow for limited missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev sounded less harsh,  
expressing hope that the United States and Russia would be able to 
reach agreement on the anti-missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue must be studied seriously, and the Senate's  
decision analyzed, but I haven't lost hope, '' Sergeyev said, 
according to the Interfax news agency. ``It's a flexible 
statement,'' he said of the Senate's move.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Uveils Crime Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are unveiling an anti-crime  
agenda that would protect programs the Clinton administration wants 
to eliminate and impose harsher sentences on illegal drug users. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, clashed  
with Attorney General Janet Reno last week on her proposal to cut 
several anti-crime grants from her budget. Reno said crime was down 
significantly nationwide, and she wanted to shift money to other 
priorities that need boosting. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the programs she proposes cutting, which Hatch vows to  
protect: 
</P>
<P>
	--A grant used for equipment and technology for state and local  
law enforcement crime-fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federal assistance to states for prison-building and  
incarceration of violent and repeat offenders for at least 85 
percent of their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	--Juvenile crime block grants for youth detention centers, drug  
testing and improved record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch and other Republican senators also are proposing  
increasing penalties for the most serious drugs, including powder 
cocaine and methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP senators also are calling for the ratification of a  
constitutional amendment that would improve restitution laws and 
steer federal money toward efforts to fight violence against women 
and children.

	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 14.15 at 9,893.84. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow average fell 51.06 to 9,879.41, after  
briefly crossing 10,000 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, broader stock indicators were higher as well, with  
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up 5.47 at 1,303.29 , and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index up 10.93 at 2,439.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported consumer prices  
rose a tiny 0.1 percent last month, a signal that inflation is 
under control. That news boosted prices in the bond market, where 
the 30-year Treasury bond was up 9/32 point and its yield, which 
moves opposite the price, was at 5.48 percent, down from 5.5 
percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were not bothered by a separate report from the  
Commerce Department that the nation's trade deficit shot up 21 
percent in January. John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist 
at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn., said the higher deficit might be 
a good sign, because it means a steady stream of cheap imports can 
keep domestic prices down and contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors' main focus, Shaugnessy said, will be Friday's triple  
expiration of options and futures contracts, which typically 
provides an upward bias to trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals of the market remain solid. Inflation is  
benign, the economy is in good shape, profits will start to pick up 
this quarter,'' Shaughnessy said. He predicts the Dow will rise to 
10,600 by the end of the year.

<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,172 to 1,110 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 105.64 million

	In overseas stock markets, Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped  
3.38 percent, as sellers rushed in to lock in gains before the 
close of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. In Europe, The DAX 
index in Frankfurt was down 1.28 percent, the FT-SE 100 in London 
eased 0.66 percent, and the CAC in Paris declined 1.52 percent.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Tenn. Law Office Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- A gunman apparently upset over a  
legal matter entered his attorney's office Thursday and fatally 
shot the longtime Johnson City lawyer and a client. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Walter V. Shell entered the law office of John D.  
Goodin about 3:30 p.m. and shot the lawyer in the head. Goodin, 81, 
died a short time later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The client, 35-year-old Paul S. Keyser III, was shot in the  
chest and killed instantly. A secretary in the building was not 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell apparently was upset over one of his relative's estate  
settlements being handled by Goodin, police Chief Ron Street said. 
He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and was  
being held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodin, a decorated World War II veteran, opened his law firm in  
Johnson City in 1939. He was a city judge from 1980-85 and was a 
past president of the Washington County Bar Association. He 
specialized in probate cases.

<HEADLINE> Italian-Brit Helicopter Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British engineering group GKN PLC and Finmeccanica  
SpA of Italy signed an agreement today to merge their helicopter 
operations, marking another step in the consolidation of Europe's 
arms industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies first announced in April 1998 that they were  
negotiating a merger of the businesses, GKN Westland Helicopters 
and Agusta. Regulatory approval still is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said that Westland's emphasis on military  
applications would compliment Agusta's performance in the civilian 
aviation market. 
</P>
<P>
	A name for the new company and a site for its headquarters have  
yet to be decided, but neither company envisages having to 
eliminate jobs, said Westland spokesman Peter Baillie. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about building a larger, more competitive business in  
the longer term. If you look at the business profile, Westland's 
production is increasing quite sharply. We are in a recruiting 
mode,'' Baillie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would have about $8.5 billion in orders under  
contract, similar to U.S. competitors Bell Helicopter Textron and 
Boeing Co. and more than its main European rival, the Franco-German 
concern Eurocopter, according to Jane's Information Group, a 
British-based defense industry specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-50 merger awaits regulatory approval, although GKN  
foresees no problems in light of the approval European governments 
have given to consolidation of defense companies. 
</P>
<P>
	GKN's share price ended trading at 9.66 British pounds, or about  
$15.74, Thursday on the London Stock Exchange, down about 35 U.S. 
cents from Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Finmeccanica's share price finished at 0.97 euros, or $1.07, in  
Milan, Italy, down about 1.1 U.S. cents from Wednesday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	Since British Aerospace PLC scuppered a potential mega-merger  
with Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace earlier this year, defense 
analysts have predicted that further integration in Europe's arms 
industries will take place piecemeal, across different segments of 
the business, rather than in a series of big bangs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new venture's first chairman will be David Wright, managing  
director of GKN's aerospace portfolio. Amedeo Caporaletti, 
president and chief executive of Agusta, has been named chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The backbone of the deal will be the two companies'  
long-standing relationship in development of the three-engined 
EH101 medium-lift helicopter. A total of 98 EH101s have been 
ordered by the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, the Italian Navy, 
the Canadian Armed Forces and a customer in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Special Education Spending Examples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The federal government estimates that this year it will spend  
about $702 per child for each student nationwide with a disability 
requiring special education. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools nationwide spend an average of about $6,000 a year per  
student, but about twice that amount on average per student with a 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	However, such averages often mask low costs, such as the case of  
a student who might need some equipment or occasional help for less 
than $1,000 a year. And they also mask high costs, amounting to 
tens of thousands of dollars for severe or multiply disabled 
children who need steady, personal attention and expensive medical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal funding has varying effects on state and local spending:  
</P>
<P>
	--Pennsylvania spends about $680 million on special education and  
gets about $83 million in federal money. State officials say a 40 
percent contribution would bring in an additional $343 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools in North Carolina, it  
costs $1,024 a year to provide one student with one hour a week of 
speech and language therapy. The district gets about $539 in 
federal money a year for all services to such a student, even if 
the student needs much more assistance.

</P>
<P>
	Chen died of an undisclosed illness, the Health Ministry's

</P>
<P>
	A native of Hangzhou city in eastern China, Chen was schooled

<P>
	NEWARK, Ohio (AP) -- David Longaberger, who turned handmade woven  
baskets into a $700 million-a-year company that bears his name, 
died Wednesday of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chairman of The Longaberger Co., which he founded in 1973  
with five weavers. Today the company employs more than 7,000 people 
and 47,000 independent sales associates who sold 8.3 million 
baskets in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Longaberger's father owned a basket company and taught all of  
his 12 children to make the baskets. But business waned as 
cardboard and paper sacks began to replace baskets and the business 
closed in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	David Longaberger owned a restaurant and grocery store in nearby  
Dresden, where he grew up, when he founded his company. In 1978, 
Longaberger decided to sell the baskets exclusively through home 
shows, which have since spread throughout the United States.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Walter E. Rauffenbart, former president and  
editor of The Legal Intelligencer, died Tuesday of heart failure. 
He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Rauffenbart joined The Legal Intelligencer in the 1930s when his  
father, Joseph, was treasurer and general manager of the newspaper. 
He spent more than 60 years with the Intelligencer, the nation's 
oldest law journal and the daily record of Philadelphia courts. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named editor and president in 1971. He was editor  
emeritus and consultant from 1977 until his retirement in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Rauffenbart helped the Philadelphia Bar Association launch the  
monthly magazine Shingle, now known as The Philadelphia Lawyer. He 
also helped found the Retainer, a biweekly tabloid, in 1972. The 
Retainer became a monthly called the Philadelphia Bar Reporter in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intelligencer research library was named in his honor in  
1987.

</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Wei Lung-hau, a master of exchanging jokes  
in an art form known as ``xiang sheng,'' died March 7 of prostate 
cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	His death ended an era of Chinese arts and culture that  
prevailed under Taiwan's policy of seeking unification with 
mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei was among hundreds of actors, actresses and other performers  
brought to Taiwan in 1949 after Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist 
government lost a civil war to the Communists on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Wei and his longtime performing partner, Wu Chao-nan, attracted  
large audiences with ``xiang sheng,'' an entertainment form where 
two people exchange rapid-fire jokes with incredible language 
skills, sing songs and tell humorous tales. They made the 
cross-talking art popular in Taiwan at a time when entertainment 
was rare. 
</P>
<P>
	They succeeded also because they made Chinese matters the theme  
of their cross-talk, coinciding with an official policy to promote 
Chinese culture and arts to reinforce the Nationalists' claim to be 
the sole legitimate government of all China.

<HEADLINE> Truth Coming Out in Boxing Travesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Now they tell us.  
</P>
<P>
	For the past few days, International Boxing Federation judge  
Eugenia Williams told one story and stuck to it. She insisted she 
saw what she saw, which was Evander Holyfield narrowly beating 
Lennox Lewis in last weekend's heavyweight championship fight. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thursday, appearing before a New York state Senate committee  
investigating the controversial draw, Williams allowed that maybe 
she didn't see everything. Maybe the ringside photographers got in 
her way during several critical junctures in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	And next week, maybe she'll say she spent most of the fight  
crawling under her desk, searching for a pencil that the referee 
kept kicking onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Funny, isn't it, how an investigation or just a whiff of scandal  
will jog people's memories, loosen their lips, screw up their 
courage or makes the lightbulbs over their heads suddenly switch 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past few days, Holyfield kept insisting there was no  
excuse for his less-than-inspired performance that night. Now he 
admits he was weakened by a virus in the days leading up to the 
fight, that his stomach ached and his legs cramped in the locker 
room just before he entered the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	And the reason he kept it to himself until now?  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would be a short fight,'' Holyfield said, ``so I  
didn't think it would matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, he wasn't the only one.  
</P>
<P>
	World Boxing Council judge Larry O'Connell of Britain now admits  
his decision to score the fight even was clouded not by 
partisanship or a failure of nerve, but by simple reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When someone said my scorecard added up to a draw, my heart  
sank,'' O'Connell said, ``I was surprised as anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the wee hours of Sunday morning, the result of  
Holyfield-Lewis seemed indecipherable. Several days later, no hard 
evidence has yet surfaced to support suspicions the bout was rigged 
or even that any of the people connected to it exerted undue 
influence on the judging. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, though, with the New York state Senate investigation under  
way, a grand jury in Manhattan about to take the matter up, and two 
other state agencies ready to do the same, people are tripping over 
each other to say they saw it coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Lewis is talking about a ``conspiracy,'' and his promoter,  
Panos Eliades, says he would like to stage the rematch without 
rival promoter Don King in the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis and Eliades both know there is virtually no chance of a  
conspiracy being found or of King disappearing. But the longer and 
louder the controversy calls attention to the sorry state of the 
sport, the more the momentum will swing toward Sen. John McCain's 
effort to pass federal legislation reforming the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republican, who has invested months of time and  
effort trying to refine the measure, was ringside in Madison Square 
Garden for the fight and saw his worst fears confirmed. He has been 
warning any one who will listen that the sport practically invites 
fraud by giving so much authority to the sanctioning bodies and the 
promoters. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they do,'' he wrote in a letter to Eliot Spitzer, New  
York's state attorney general, ``boxers are subject to manipulation 
and the public is cheated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injustice of this fight didn't so much touch a nerve as grab  
it, twist it, and refuse to let go. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, fight fans have been subjected to one outrage after  
another, then left to shake their heads and paraphrase what a 
crooked alderman once said about Chicago: ``This town ain't ready 
for reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, there is a real sense that could change. It may  
not be as sweeping as McCain envisions, but a hopeful sign has 
already surfaced. On Wednesday, the influential Nevada boxing 
commission said it would consider a proposal by promoter Bob Arum 
to announce the judges' scoring following each round of a scheduled 
May 8 WBC super bantamweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not much, but it's a start. Especially considering the  
source was Arum, who once replied to a tough question with a quote 
that describes his racket better than any other: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling the truth today. I was lying to you yesterday.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Georgia Leads NCAA Women's Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Because Stanford didn't have a scholarship  
for Martina Moravcova of Slovakia three years ago, Georgia and 
Southern Methodist were perched atop the 18th NCAA Swimming and 
Diving Championships after the first day of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Moravcova led SMU to second place by winning the 200-yard  
individual medley and leading off the winning 200-freestyle relay 
team. She was also on the second-place 400 medley relay. Counting 
the preliminaries, she swam the maximum six races Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Georgia led with 143 1/2 points, followed by SMU with 137 1/2.  
Defending champion Stanford was third with 129 points. With 
Moravcova, they would have easily have been way out front. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are going to pick a way to go to sleep, I guess this  
would be it,'' Georgia coach Jack Bauerle said. ``Certainly, we are 
excited to be where we are, but Stanford has some great stroke 
people, as does SMU.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia's Kristy Kowal was the only other swimmer to swim the  
maximum six races Thursday. In the medley relay, she was only 
swimmer to break 1 minute on the breaststroke split, and she did it 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could let her swim that one event, there is no doubt she  
would break the American record,'' Bauerle said. ``But we have to 
hitch our wagon to her and go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moravcova's win in the 200 individual medley was the eighth  
individual title of her college career. Only two collegians, 
Florida's Tracy Caulkins with 12 and Stanford's Jenny Thompson with 
nine, have won more. Moravcova can pass Thompson if she defends 
individual titles in the 100 and 200 freestyle events. 
</P>
<P>
	Her time of 1:55.64 was one-tenth of a second off the 7-year-old  
NCAA record set by Olympian Summer Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hoped I could beat that record,'' Maravcova said. ``I  
usually bring that last 50 free home a lot faster. But I'm pleased. 
It was my best time ever, and we had an awesome day as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moravcova found her way to SMU after she called Stanford and was  
told it wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mustangs also got important points from diver Jenny  
Lingamfelter, who won the 1-meter event with 444.40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the top 10 were Southern Cal with 93 points,  
Arizona with 90, California with 89, Northwestern with 68, Michigan 
with 54, Virginia with 50 and Auburn with 48. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia led without winning a race, capitalizing instead on its  
depth. Julie Varozza finished fourth in the 500 freestyle, which 
Bauerle called the ``most remarkable swim of the day.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Has Plan To Rescue Penguins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Former Pittsburgh Penguins star Mario Lemieux  
on Thursday promised to raise $50 million as part of his plan to 
buy the team and rescue it from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The promise came in a reorganization plan Lemieux submitted to  
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz, who is overseeing the 
team's Chapter 11 procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan valued the Penguins at about $94 million and  
promised to pay off the team's debts, which he estimated at $110 
million to $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who led the Penguins to Stanley Cups in the 1991-92 and  
1992-93 seasons, released a statement calling the reorganization 
plan ``the beginning of a new Penguin dynasty in which financial 
commitments are well-negotiated and honored, players are paid and 
fans get their money's worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins co-owners Howard Baldwin and Roger Marino did not  
immediately return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux did not publicly disclose the names of his financial  
backers, but said he would reveal them to the bankruptcy judge. A 
hearing on Lemieux's reorganization plan was scheduled before 
Markovitz on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins filed for protection from their creditors in U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court just as the NHL season began in October, citing 
debt amounting to as much as $124 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz is expected to rule sometime next month on whether the  
plan paints an honest picture of the team's financial position, 
said Douglas Campbell, Lemieux's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditors will then decide whether to accept the plan and award  
Lemieux and his investors ownership of the team. It is up to 
Markovitz to decide whether to affirm their vote, said Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	A history of the bankruptcy filed with the plan says the  
Penguins were ``undercapitalized,'' or didn't have enough money to 
operate, since Baldwin bought the team in 1991. Marino bought into 
the team in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's filing also said the team suffered from negotiating a  
poor lease with SMG, which manages the Civic Arena, and a cheap 
broadcast contract with Fox Sports Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	His plan calls for renegotiating both contracts.  
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said the low lease and broadcast contract made it  
difficult for the Penguins to pay players' salaries, the team's 
greatest expense, and that the 1994-95 lockout only made the team's 
situation more bleak. The plan would pay the deferred salaries owed 
to some former players, as well as banks, insurance companies, 
attorneys and other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan includes a payment schedule for the $32.6 million  
he said he's owed in deferred salary and penalties. The schedule 
calls for a $6 million cash payment, a promissory note for $4.9 
million and a second note for payments of $11.4 million over eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants another $5.2 million when the team's other debts  
are settled, and reserves the right to sue former Penguins owner 
Roger Marino ``or any other third party'' for the remaining $5.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's attorney said earlier this month he would walk away  
from the Penguins if Lemieux and his investors shoulder the team's 
annual losses, don't gut the team's high-priced talent, and repay 
$5 million of the $42.5 million Marino invested in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment consultant Chip Gesner and Michigan trucking company  
owner Harvey Gainey are also interested in buying the team.

	Clinton Orders Analysis of Lab Threat  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today ordered an analysis of  
the counterintelligence security threat at U.S. nuclear labs in the 
wake of suspicions that China stole nuclear weapons designs. 
Clinton directed the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory 
Board to conduct a review. Former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., the 
head of the panel, will lead the investigation. ``I am determined 
to do all that is necessary to protect our sensitive national 
security information and to prevent its diversion to foreign 
countries,'' Clinton said in a statement.

	Missile Defense Bill Passes House

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill committing the United States to a  
nationwide defense against ballistic missiles easily passed through 
the House of Representatives today. The 317-105 vote came a day 
after the Senate gave strong bipartisan support to similar 
legislation. The House turned to its version after hearing the 
missile threat to the United States outlined in a rare closed-door 
briefing by members of a commission that studied the threat. 
Government officials say that from 25 to 30 nations now have, or 
are in the process of trying to obtain, ballistic-weapons 
capability.

six times but pulling back each time. On Tuesday, the Dow briefly 
traded as high as 10,001.78 before slipping back. A spark for 
today's advance was the report that consumer prices rose 0.1

Tuesday to issue a stay that could have delayed enforcement of his 
court order striking down Proposition 16, which mandated that 
freshmen attain a minimum standardized test score to play in 
Division I athletics. In his initial ruling last week, Buckwalter 
declared that minimum score requirements have ``an unjustified 
disparate impact against African-Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Some Don't Recognize New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What's all the fuss over the approaching new  
millennium? Big deal. For lots of people around the world, it's 
pretty much ``been there, done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West's way of measuring the passing centuries is by no means  
universal. Under Chinese and Jewish calendars, for example, the 
Year 2000 milestone came and went millennia ago. Still other 
peoples have centuries to wait for the big day. 
</P>
<P>
	And Jan. 1 as New Year's Day is no more absolute -- if you want  
to give New Year's greetings to an Iranian, you should do it this 
Sunday by saying ``Happy Nowrooz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole story of the calendar and how we measure time is  
hugely coincidental,'' says David Ewing Duncan, author of 
``Calendar: Humanity's Struggle to Determine a True and Accurate 
Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One fluke Duncan cites is how the calendar based on Jesus' birth  
as year one -- even though most scholars agree he was likely born 
between 3 and 5 B.C. -- came to dominate the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just so happens that ours is the calendar the colonists  
used, and that it became common internationally in a technological 
age in which we needed a standard,'' Duncan says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western standard applies in day-to-day business, but in many  
cases other calendars dictate religious holidays and often how 
peoples view their distinctive pasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``These other calendars are still very much alive wherever  
there's a strong religion or culture,'' Duncan says. ``It's almost 
like having two languages. A lot of people use one language for 
business and speak another language as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So for Jews, the calendar starts with the year the world was  
created according to the Bible. Thus their second millennium began 
in 1761 B.C. by the Western, or Gregorian, calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	For Muslims, time is measured in lunar cycles beginning with  
Prophet Mohammed's founding of the first Islamic community in 
Medina on the Arabian peninsula. Under the Islamic calendar, the 
year 2000 will come in the West's 2562 A.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims will celebrate New Year's this year on April 17 or, if  
the crescent moon is not sighted by then to signal the start of the 
lunar month, a day later. The Chinese had their New Year's Feb. 17, 
Jews on Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Many peoples -- Iranians, Kurds and some Afghanis -- mark New  
Year's on the spring equinox, usually March 20 or 21. Nowrooz 
predates Islam; Iranians celebrate it by feasting at a table set 
with seven items starting with the letter ``s'' in Farsi, including 
``sonbol'' (flowers) and ``sekkeh'' (coins). 
</P>
<P>
	Americans once marked New Year's in March, too. Britain, and  
American colonists, did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 
1752, or 170 years after the calendar was reformed at Pope 
Gregory's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregory's calendar was one of many attempts to deal with the  
problem of the earth revolving around the sun in a pesky 365.24199 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Leap years, invented millenia earlier by the Egyptians, helped  
solve the problem, but they threatened to put the calendar year 
ahead of the solar year. Gregory's calendar dropped future leap 
years at the turn of most centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the international frenzy surrounding the Year 2000,  
millennial transitions apparently didn't mean much to those who 
lived through them earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I know the year 5000 was nothing special for Jews,''  
says Benjamin Gampel, a professor of Medieval Studies at the Jewish 
Theological Seminary in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, whose calendar dates to the 15th or 16th century  
before Christ, account for their years not in centuries but in 
12-year cycles that they do not bother to number, says Irene Bloom, 
a professor of Asian culture at Barnard College in New York. Each 
year is given an animal zodiac sign; this is the year of the hare, 
last year was the tiger, and next year will be the dragon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayans, parts of whose calendar are still used in remote areas  
of Mexico and Guatemala, had ``great cycles'' of about 5,000 years 
each. According to Duncan, Mayans believed the world will end in a 
huge flood during the next great cycle -- which starts in 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western 2000 could still provide lessons for alternative  
calendars when computers on those systems face the perplexing ``Y2K 
problem,'' the moment when digits turn from 99 to 00 but computers 
mistakenly think it's the beginning of the past century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some computers in Islamic countries may face glitches in 2076,  
when the Islamic year, now 1419, shifts from 1499 to 1500. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a century bug. So any computer ... keeping dates  
on the Islamic calendar will go to 00 in 2076. I think the only 
country with computers on that system, though, might be Saudi 
Arabia,'' says Dr. Imad-Ad-Dean Ahmad, an Islamic astronomer based 
in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug is unlikely to alter the traditions of other  
calendars. That's why Kani Xulam, who works for the Kurdistan 
American Information Network in Washington, expects to be standing 
in front of the White House listenting to Kurdish music this Sunday 
-- Nowrooz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very much a part of our identity,'' he says. ``It is our  
New Year. For us, Jan. 1 of the year 2000 doesn't signify a great 
deal.''

<HEADLINE> House Passes Missile Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators now must produce  
compromise legislation to commit the United States to a national 
defense against a limited ballistic missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Thursday approved its version 317-105, a day after  
the Senate passed similar legislation 97-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House once threatened to veto the legislation -- long a  
GOP priority and part of the Republicans' 1994 ``Contract With 
America.'' But members of the Clinton administration no longer are 
talking that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they plan to monitor a House-Senate conference  
committee that will come up with the final version, in hopes the 
finished product will more closely resemble the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China were quick to criticize Congress' action.  
</P>
<P>
	``That poses a serious threat to the whole process of nuclear  
arms control, as well as strategic stability, for which major 
international agreements have been worked out for decades,'' the 
Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said the  
measure is counterproductive for arms control and disarmament and 
will ``have an impact on global strategic balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a bill to become law, both chambers of Congress must pass  
identically worded legislation, which the president must sign. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration favors the Senate bill because it promotes  
continued negotiations with Moscow to reduce nuclear warheads and 
stresses that missile-defense funds must be reviewed annually by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill also states that the missile defense be deployed  
``as soon as technologically possible,'' a phrase not included in 
the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure is but 15 words: ``It is the official policy  
of the United States to deploy a national missile defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a deceptively simple bill. But it speaks volumes to the  
entire planet that we will not shy away from the challenge to make 
the United States and its people safe from ballistic missile 
attack,'' Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House 
intelligence committee, said during House debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no defense today against any missile system. It is a  
national priority that this Congress needs to address,'' Rep. Curt 
Weldon, R-Pa., chief sponsor of the legislation, told colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed a similar measure in 1995 and Democratic leaders  
previously opposed a commitment to such a system. But lawmakers 
from both parties said recent missile tests by North Korea and Iran 
and reports of nuclear weapons espionage by China helped rally huge 
support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Senate bill, the House measure envisions a scaled-back  
version of the Strategic Defense Initiative proposed in 1983 by 
then-President Ronald Reagan -- and derided by Democrats as ``Star 
Wars'' -- for a space-based defense against ballistic missile 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	While that plan was geared mainly at the former Soviet Union,  
the system now being promoted deals more with an accidental launch 
-- or by the deliberate launch by a rogue or terrorist state. It 
would not be space-based. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has spent over $50 billion on research and limited  
tests on such a system, even though one still has not been 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The president put $10.5 billion in his budget for such a program  
over the next five years -- an increase of $6.6 billion -- but wanted 
to wait until June 2000 before deciding whether to actually deploy 
such a system.

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A woman who said she had sex with her  
husband in front of her two young daughters for ``educational 
purposes'' was sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old woman, whose name was withheld to protect her  
children, pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child. 
She was sentenced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did this for educational purposes,'' she told police. ``What  
went on in our household is our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One daughter, now 15, testified that she and her sister, now 14,  
were forced to watch their mother and stepfather have sex and were 
told how to perform sex acts themselves. The incidents began about 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger daughter testified that her stepfather assaulted her  
repeatedly from age 10 or 11, but that her mother did not 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old stepfather was sentenced last week to 99 years  
in prison.

<HEADLINE> Reps. Condemn Conservative Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A resolution condemning the Council of  
Conservative Citizens for ``racism and bigotry'' has drawn the 
support of 138 members of the House, its sponsor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Council of Conservative Citizens attempts to mask its  
hateful ideology by posing as a mainstream conservative think tank 
but the racist agenda of this group is undeniable,'' Rep. Robert 
Wexler, D-Fla., told a news conference. Among his co-sponsors are 
11 Republicans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Council of Conservative Citizens has an insidious and  
treacherous agenda,'' Wexler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Formed 13 years ago and claiming a membership of 15,000, the St.  
Louis-based council gained national attention this year when it was 
revealed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Rep. Bob 
Barr, R-Ga., had addressed the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The council advocates an end to school busing, the right to bear  
arms, stricter immigration restrictions and ``preserving our 
heritage by fighting efforts to destroy America's honored cultural 
traditions'' citing the Confederate flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Jared Taylor, a council board member, talking to reporters  
later, said his group unfairly is being targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't censured the KKK or the Symbionese Liberation  
Army or other groups. The reason they are coming after us is that 
we have had a number of people from Congress to our group,'' Taylor 
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. 2, Norway 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUFEIRA, Portugal (AP) -- Kristine Lilly's second-half goal  
lifted the United States women's soccer team to a 2-1 victory over 
world champion Norway on Thursday and into the Algarve Cup 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, who have never won the tournament, will play  
China on Saturday. The U.S. team finished 2-0-1 in its group and 
had to beat Norway to advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory also avenged a 4-1 loss to Norway in the tournament  
last year, the only loss of 1998 for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	China beat Australia 2-0 in the other group, but had already  
clinched the spot in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway took a 1-0 lead just 11 minutes into the match on a goal  
by Ann Kristin Aarones off a corner kick. That lead lasted one 
minute before Julie Foudy tied it. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal ended goalkeeper Briana Scurry's streak of 740  
scoreless minutes, but it took less than 60 second for the 
Americans to equalize. 
</P>
<P>
	They worked the ball into Norway's penalty box off the kickoff.  
Lilly ran onto a bouncing ball on the right side. With her back to 
the goal, she popped the ball back over her head to Foudy, who sent 
a left-footed shot just inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so angry that we let in a goal, I was on a rampage,''  
Foudy said. ``The games with Norway are always such physical 
battles, but our defense did a great job and we were really solid 
in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women, who will be hosts of the World Cup this summer,  
almost scored just two minutes later. Mia Hamm's shot from a sharp 
angle in the left side of the penalty box skimmed off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly got the winning goal in the 55th minute on a  
counter-attack. The ball was cleared by the U.S. defense, and when 
Hamm got it at midfield, she sidestepped a defender and embarked on 
a 50-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
	She then fed the cutting Tiffeny Milbrett in the left side of  
the penalty box. Milbrett beat her defender to the end line and 
crossed on the ground to the far post, where Lilly put it home from 
7 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a match that we had to win against the best,'' said  
U.S. coach Tony DiCicco. ``We had more chances to score, we had 
better chances, and I think we deserved to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Defender Carla Overbeck had to leave the game in the 62nd minute  
after injuring her neck while challenging for a header. The U.S. 
captain was sore after the game, but is listed as probable for the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm suffered a mild shoulder separation in the first half, but  
also should be ready for the final.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Need Hasek for Playoff Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres avoided losing much  
ground without Dominik Hasek. Now they're looking forward to going 
places with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is close to returning from a strained groin that has  
sidelined him since Feb. 17. The goalie has resumed practicing with 
the team and might play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a good practice,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said  
Wednesday. ``He went a little bit longer today, a few more shots. I 
thought at times he was still a little tentative, but he got 
through it OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said Hasek might start against the New York Rangers on the  
first stop of the team's four-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I could go even harder from post to post, more splits,''  
Hasek said. ``I hope it feels the same tomorrow. I'll have one more 
practice and I hope I'll play in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres did their part to get Hasek in shape when Curtis  
Brown took a blistering slap shot that dented the goalie's face 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are loose after wins over Boston and the New York  
Islanders. They are seventh in the Eastern Conference playoff race, 
within two points of sixth-place Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a logjam in the middle of our conference,'' Sabres  
captain Michael Peca said. ``You put some wins together and you're 
going to put yourself in a better position in the playoffs and 
possibly get home-ice advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are in the thick of the playoff race despite their  
recent struggles. They tumbled from the top of the conference after 
a strong start and looked at last Thursday's loss to Tampa Bay as 
their season low. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe for awhile there we weren't doing the small things, and  
sometimes it's tough to even notice what those are,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as teams make a playoff push, Tuesday's trade deadline has  
players around the league a little edgy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a nervous time,'' Ruff said. ``Any time there's a  
possibility that players might get moved, there's some anxiety 
around the team. There's nothing you can do about it. You worry 
about how you play and your effort on the ice, and that's all you 
can control really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of Stu Barnes, sent from Pittsburgh in a recent  
trade for Matthew Barnaby, has provided a lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a lot of chances and he creates a lot of chances for  
guys around him, so he's a welcome addition to this team,'' said 
Barnes' linemate Geoff Sanderson, who is trying to break out of a 
scoring slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting the chance play a lot, which is something that I  
wasn't getting in Pittsburgh this year,'' Barnes said. ``I'm 
playing center now, which is a little bit different, too, because 
I'm handling the puck a little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The return of Hasek would be another boost, even though Dwayne  
Roloson and rookie Martin Biron have played well. ``No disrespect 
to Dwayne or Marty, but when you're adding the best goaltender that 
possibly ever played the game, you've got to feel better about your 
chances,'' Peca said.

<HEADLINE> Low Prices Hurt Cranberry Growers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) -- Cranberry growers have become bogged down  
by overproduction, victims of their own success. 
</P>
<P>
	Small farmers once had the cranberry market mostly to  
themselves, and for decades berry prices increased or at least held 
steady. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, supply has outgrown demand. Cranberries are pouring in  
from huge farms in Chile, Ireland, Eastern Europe and especially 
Canada. That is good for consumers looking for low juice prices, 
but not so good for U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a tough year,'' said Malcolm McPhail, who  
farms 63 acres of bogs near Ilwaco in southwest Washington. ``There 
will be some people who go bankrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His farm is part of the Ocean Spray Cranberries cooperative, a  
group of 750 growers who control about 70 percent of the U.S. crop 
and nearly all of the cranberries grown in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The cranberry bog business has not grown much recently in  
Washington, where the average farm measures 10 acres. The 
difficulty and expense of dealing with the loss of wetlands has 
dampened bog growth in the United States -- and encouraged foreign 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge new plantings have flooded the market. Also, new cranberry  
plantings yield double or triple the amount per acre that old bogs 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic growers say they saw the price drop coming. Still, some  
were shocked when Ocean Spray announced it overpaid farmers in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean Spray cooperative farmers deliver their crops in October  
and are paid periodically as the company sells berries through the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the going rate was 61 cents a pound. Late in the fall,  
the price dropped to 55 cents a pound. The price continues to 
plummet, and Ocean Spray estimates farmers will get 42 to 48 cents 
per pound this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Ocean Spray suspended payments to former co-op  
growers who were required to buy shares in the company. The shares 
are redeemed over a six-year period when the grower leaves the 
co-op. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Hatton, a Grayland cranberry farmer and chairman of Ocean  
Spray's board of directors, says the company will resume payments 
when the market improves. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the decision leaves some cranberry farmers with a bitter  
taste in their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arrogance of the company is just unreal,'' said former  
Ocean Spray grower Roy Peters of Bandon, Ore. ``We have been 
wronged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time cranberries have taken a slide.  
</P>
<P>
	Old-timers remember the big Army contract that fell through  
during World War II and hurt prices. Then there was the infamous 
1959 scare, when cranberries briefly and falsely were linked to 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The current price woes are the worst in many farmers' memories,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a fun time for us,'' said Hatton, a cranberry grower  
since 1972. ``But we've had some good times, and we expect more in 
the future.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Find Nursing Home Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government inspections and penalties aren't  
deterring health and safety violations in nursing homes, 
congressional auditors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a three-year period, the General Accounting Office found  
virtually no change in the percentage of nursing homes nationwide 
with health and safety violations causing harm to residents -- such 
as bed sores or accidents -- or placing the residents at risk of 
death or serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad homes stay bad,'' said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, one of  
the lawmakers who requested the study that was released Thursday. 
``The government is not doing enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last summer announced a campaign to improve  
enforcement of nursing home standards and has asked Congress for 
$60 million more for such efforts in 2000 than will be spent this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, who chairs the Senate's Special Committee on Aging,  
said he has asked the administration for monthly progress reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Health Care Association, which represents nursing  
homes, said it welcomes closer scrutiny of the government oversight 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest problems that we face is that the  
government inspection process simply doesn't work,'' said AHCA vice 
president Linda Keegan. ``The process is focused on punishing 
facilities rather than correcting problems. Inspectors cannot even 
give advice on how to fix a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO -- Congress' investigative branch -- surveyed government  
inspection reports from July 1995 to October 1998 for the nation's 
17,000 nursing homes that receive federal Medicare and Medicaid 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors found the percentage of homes with the most serious  
health and safety violations dropped only 1 percent, from 28 
percent to 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of the homes that had problems cited in the  
earliest inspection reports reviewed had equally serious 
deficiencies in later reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most frequent violations were inadequate attention by  
staff to prevent residents from developing bedsores and lack of 
supervision or special equipment such as alarms to avert accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	To determine whether government intervention led to improvement,  
the auditors studied 74 nursing homes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, 
Texas and California that state inspectors had referred to federal 
regulators for possible sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, the GAO found, homes threatened with fines or  
denial of federal payments never had to face those penalties 
because the law gave them a grace period to correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	One Michigan home, for example, went unpunished after failing to  
prevent a confused resident from leaving unaccompanied. The 
patient's absence was not noticed until relatives returning from a 
vacation learned from police that their loved one had been stabbed 
to death while roaming the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 74 troubled homes audited, 69 were referred for penalties  
again after subsequent inspections, and some went through this 
``yo-yo pattern of compliance'' half a dozen times, the GAO found. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the federal Health and Human Services Department  
unveiled new regulations subjecting nursing homes to immediate 
fines of up to $10,000, eliminating the grace periods of the past. 
State inspection agencies will also be required to respond more 
quickly -- within 10 days -- to complaints alleging harm to nursing 
home residents.

<HEADLINE> Seating for Oscar Is a Real Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget Steven Spielberg, Michael Eisner and  
Michael Ovitz. The most powerful person in Hollywood these days is 
a guy named Otto. 
</P>
<P>
	You know, Otto Spoerri.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, yes. I am the most powerful,'' chuckles the  
66-year-old financial controller of the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Spoerri's job to ration out Oscar tickets when the  
ceremony squeezes into the 2,850-seat Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on 
Sunday after the last two years at the cavernous Shrine Auditorium, 
which seats 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Let the whining begin.  
</P>
<P>
	``You hear it every year,'' Spoerri says with a sigh. ``You  
know, `My mother is dying of cancer' or `My parents are flying in 
from New Zealand.' I've heard it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 23 years, Spoerri has decided who gets in, who sits where  
and who gets left out. With fewer than half as many seats available 
this year as in 1998, there's a lot of arm-twisting to get into the 
71st Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just say, `Guess what? Each nominee is offered two  
tickets,''' he says. That means there are 157 people eligible for 
the $250 tickets, and Spoerri is willing to listen to pleas for 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some nominees ask for extra seats for parents, grown-up kids,  
whatever it might be. If you can accommodate them, you do. But it's 
tight this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six staffers handle all ticket-related calls, but Spoerri  
usually becomes the target of the dissatisfied since his signature 
is on each rejection letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been threatened, but they can get angry and let  
their steam out. I'll listen. I really feel for these people,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Spoerri admits he was ``pretty awed by the star power'' when he  
first took over the job. Now, denying an A-list phenom is almost 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have said `no' to stars,'' he says, refusing to identify  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, ever vigilant  
about interlopers to their ultra-private party, pounces on brokers 
who sell Oscar tickets to non-sanctioned guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets found in the wrong hands are traced and offending  
Academy members forever blacklisted from the Oscars. There are two 
or three such expulsions each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is simple: ``If we have a member whose ticket request  
is rejected, then he looks on the TV and sees somebody's 
hairdresser in a seat, they are unhappy,'' Spoerri says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy has 6,000 members, yet only 300 seats are dedicated  
for them. Members are picked by lottery and ``people who are a name 
sometimes don't get picked,'' Spoerri says. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenters, of course, get tickets and so do their dates.  
Studios, telecast advertisers, performers, past Academy governors, 
Academy friends and the news media get still more. 
</P>
<P>
	California Gov. Gray Davis, Mayor Richard Riordan and police  
Chief Bernard Parks got tickets this year, as did the mayor and 
fire chief of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding who sits where is yet another ordeal for Spoerri, who  
must decide if guests sit on the more prestigious main floor or in 
the balcony. Separating feuding stars is another headache. 
</P>
<P>
	So where will the most powerful man in Hollywood be Sunday  
evening? 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I have tickets,'' he says. ``I can enjoy the show  
once it starts.''

<HEADLINE> Web Sites To Play Role in 2000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to capitalize on the Internet craze,  
presidential hopefuls are building Web sites that offer everything 
from candidate biographies and issue papers to online chats and 
information on how to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 2000 campaign Web sites are remarkably similar, both  
in layout and content. But Steve Forbes and Rep. John Kasich offer 
a bit more, giving voters daily reports and photos from the 
campaign trail and mass e-mail updates on the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes declared his candidacy for the GOP presidential  
nomination Tuesday in an announcement carried first on his Web 
site. Lamar Alexander made a similar declaration during the 1996 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet combines the best of American ingenuity,  
innovation and high tech,'' Forbes said at a New Hampshire campaign 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the presidential hopefuls who have formed exploratory  
committees, Vice President Al Gore and Gary Bauer are the only ones 
without active campaign Web sites. Both plan to have sites on the 
World Wide Web soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's site will be ``fresh and dynamic'' and should be up  
before the end of March, said Roger Salazar, spokesman for Gore's 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The implications of Internet campaigning could be significant,  
bringing voters and candidates together in a way previously 
unimaginable. Some think that the power of the Internet will come 
to rival other mediums. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet will be to the 2000 campaign what television was  
to the 1960 campaign,'' says Todd Harris, communications director 
for Kasich. ``It is a crucial medium that you have to employ to get 
your message out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the focal point for campaign activity in a high-tech  
world,'' said Jonathan Baron, communications director for former 
Vice President Dan Quayle. ``Any campaign that makes full use of 
the Internet will have a competitive advantage over those who 
don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush of Texas inaugurated his campaign Web site  
the day he announced formation of a presidential exploratory 
committee. Computers were set up at the announcement site and 
people were able to log on to his page -- offered both in English 
and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign Web sites are designed to cater to activist voters  
-- ones who will take the initiative to seek out a candidate and 
vote in the crucial party primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who use the Internet to garner information on  
candidates are much more invested in the political process,'' 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 3,000 people have signed up with Kasich on the World  
Wide Web and are ``now in a dialogue with the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites give candidates an advantage in building and  
organizing a grass-roots organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Bill Bradley's campaign site has an extensive ``get  
involved'' section that garners information such as age, job and 
e-mail address -- all voluntarily submitted. It will undoubtedly 
help the campaign to organize its volunteers in ways previously 
untapped before the Internet became such a force. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great way to put an instant organization together,''  
says Larry Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia. He 
points to Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's successful campaign as the 
model for using Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ventura used his Web site to build his organization and get  
people to his events,'' says Sabato. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology is there for grass-roots efforts,'' said Mark  
Smith, spokesman for Bauer. ``You might as well take advantage of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Web sites also allow the campaigns to communicate with  
voters directly. Candidates can offer a range of policy positions, 
statements, speeches and information without editing or 
interpretation by the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole's site, for example, has video of her entire  
speech announcing her formation of an exploratory committee. Her 
campaign will eventually allow voters to ``customize'' the site, 
giving them the speeches, issue positions and other information 
they are most interested in. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the Web sites cannot do is directly raise money for  
candidates through credit card donations, which are prohibited 
under Federal Election Commission rules. They, however, can take 
pledges and tell voters where to send checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabato thinks that the Internet's role is being somewhat  
overestimated and that it will be a tool primarily of underdog 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real revolution will be when we have Internet voting,''  
says Sabato, a phenomenon he thinks will occur within 10 years -- 
changing the face of politics.

<HEADLINE> Pasadena Is Not Wooing Raiders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A Pasadena councilman says the city is  
making no effort to lure the Oakland Raiders, who played at the Los 
Angeles Coliseum from 1982-94, to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders owner Al Davis said Wednesday during the NFL owners  
meetings in Phoenix he isn't currently in negotiations with anyone 
about a return by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when asked by The Associated Press if the Pasadena City  
Council had contacted the Raiders, he replied, ``Oh, you heard 
about that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I know, there has been no contact between the City  
of Pasadena, the Pasadena City Council, or any of the Pasadena city 
council members,'' city councilman Paul Little told The AP. ``As 
far as I know, there's certainly no effort to try to bring Mr. 
Davis and his team to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping the city of Pasadena will support the Los Angeles  
Coliseum effort to bring an expansion team there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL gave Los Angeles a conditional expansion franchise  
earlier this week during its winter meetings. Davis, who moved the 
Raiders back to Oakland before the 1995 season, reiterated he 
believes that he owns the rights to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't have an interest in permanently housing a  
professional football team,'' Little said. ``Temporarily, I think 
that's something we would look at, but I think we'd look at it very 
closely with an eye toward the bottom line for Pasadena and if it 
would help support the Coliseum effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to do a service by temporarily housing a team, but  
I think that's as far as it would go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan urged the two  
groups competing for the expansion franchise to get together behind 
one proposal that would have the team play at a renovated Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coliseum is head and shoulders above any other venue,''  
Riordan said. ``We're going to have a team here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan has already talked to members of both camps, and is  
setting up meetings intended to end competition, the Los Angeles 
Times reported Thursday, citing sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our door is open,'' said Eli Broad, a leader in the Coliseum  
bid. ``We'd be delighted to get together and talk about it. I would 
hope that we would end up with a unified bid behind the Coliseum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz, who heads the group backing a  
stadium in Carson, said it was too soon to determine if his group 
would be willing to give up its original plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to assess that right now,'' he said. ``We're  
thrilled that LA is in the running.''

<HEADLINE>  Adams Can't Deliver IRA Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leader of the Irish Republican Army's  
affiliated political party said today he ``simply can't deliver'' a 
start now to the outlawed group's disarmament, one of the 
long-postponed goals of the Northern Ireland peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	The blunt talk from Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams came on Capitol  
Hill after a particularly candid half-hour meeting Wednesday night 
inside the White House with his political nemesis, Ulster Unionist 
Party leader David Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said Trimble had asked him for ``an event'' in which a  
substantial range of IRA weaponry would be handed over to Northern 
Ireland's disarmament commission, which has waited nearly a year 
for the IRA to move. While Adams said he welcomed Trimble's 
``clearest definition yet of what he requires,'' he called the 
demand ``a complete hindrance and precondition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I can't stress enough, as I stand here, that I simply  
can't deliver that,'' said Adams, who was flanked by three 
congressional supporters, Reps. Peter King, R-N.Y., Joe Crowley, 
D-N.Y., and Richard Neal, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble, the Protestant assigned to form a new  
Protestant-Catholic government for Northern Ireland, is refusing to 
support Sinn Fein's eligibility for office unless the IRA starts 
disarming first. Their deadlock has jeopardized that central goal 
of last year's Good Friday peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton brought the quarreling leaders together  
Wednesday night after a ceremony honoring negotiator George 
Mitchell. The president asked prayers for victims of the violence 
in Northern Ireland, including Catholic lawyer Rosemary Nelson, who 
was being buried today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood of my meeting with Gerry Adams was very serious,''  
Trimble said in an interview before Adams' press conference. 
``While nothing was resolved, it was a good talk. I was glad to see 
that Adams this time was seriously thinking about the issue of 
decommissioning (weapons), rather than just repeating his old 
script.'' 
</P>

	``I feel quite optimistic that, in the end, we will overcome  
this difficulty -- because there really is no alternative,'' said 
Trimble, calling the IRA's gradual disarmament and dissolution ``a 
question now not of whether, but when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a comment suggesting he had little influence over IRA  
policy, Adams said Trimble's position was leaving the supporters of 
both their parties ``dependent on an organization over which they 
have no influence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The British government has set this year's Good Friday, April 2,  
as a potential make-or-break deadline for a deal. Trimble's hold on 
Protestant opinion is so shaky he presumes he would be ousted as 
Ulster Unionist leader if he offers Sinn Fein an olive branch 
without getting something concrete in return. Adams emphasizes this 
isn't an explicit condition for his party to hold office. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wednesday night's St. Patrick's Day reception on the White  
House's South Lawn, Trimble and Adams sat 10 seats apart in the 
audience as former Senator Mitchell, chairman of the peace talks, 
warned them and other key negotiators: ``What you do, or don't do, 
could mean life or death for many of your fellow citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton asked the several hundred guests -- most of  
the key Irish, British and Northern Irish peacemakers among them -- 
to say prayers for those hundreds of people slain and maimed by 
dissident terrorists trying to tear apart the Good Friday 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The reception also featured a brief piano appearance by Claire  
Gallagher, 17, who was blinded in the IRA dissident car-bombing of 
the Northern Ireland town of Omagh in August. That blast killed 29 
and wounded 370. The Clintons originally met Claire while visiting 
the shattered town in September.

<HEADLINE>  Adams Can't Deliver IRA Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leader of the Irish Republican Army's  
affiliated political party said today he ``simply can't deliver'' a 
start now to the outlawed group's disarmament, one of the 
long-postponed goals of the Northern Ireland peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	The blunt talk from Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams came on Capitol  
Hill after a particularly candid half-hour meeting Wednesday night 
inside the White House with his political nemesis, Ulster Unionist 
Party leader David Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said Trimble had asked him for ``an event'' in which a  
substantial range of IRA weaponry would be handed over to Northern 
Ireland's disarmament commission, which has waited nearly a year 
for the IRA to move. While Adams said he welcomed Trimble's 
``clearest definition yet of what he requires,'' he called the 
demand ``a complete hindrance and precondition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I can't stress enough, as I stand here, that I simply  
can't deliver that,'' said Adams, who was flanked by three 
congressional supporters, Reps. Peter King, R-N.Y., Joe Crowley, 
D-N.Y., and Richard Neal, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble, the Protestant assigned to form a new  
Protestant-Catholic government for Northern Ireland, is refusing to 
support Sinn Fein's eligibility for office unless the IRA starts 
disarming first. Their deadlock has jeopardized that central goal 
of last year's Good Friday peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton brought the quarreling leaders together  
Wednesday night after a ceremony honoring negotiator George 
Mitchell. The president asked prayers for victims of the violence 
in Northern Ireland, including Catholic lawyer Rosemary Nelson, who 
was being buried today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood of my meeting with Gerry Adams was very serious,''  
Trimble said in an interview before Adams' press conference. 
``While nothing was resolved, it was a good talk. I was glad to see 
that Adams this time was seriously thinking about the issue of 
decommissioning (weapons), rather than just repeating his old 
script.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel quite optimistic that, in the end, we will overcome  
this difficulty -- because there really is no alternative,'' said 
Trimble, calling the IRA's gradual disarmament and dissolution ``a 
question now not of whether, but when.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clintons Honored at White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remembering Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak  
Rabin at a White House ceremony, President Clinton on Thursday 
called for new champions of Middle East peace to fill the gap left 
by the deaths of Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still here the strong voice of Yitzhak Rabin and King  
Hussein speaking to us today,'' Clinton said at a ceremony at the 
South Lawn pavilion. ``Today their voices must be embodied by 
others all across the Middle East.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need friends of peace,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were awarded the  
inaugural Shalom Chaver Award for International Leadership by 
Rabin's widow, Lea, and daughter, Dalia Rabin-Pelossof, who also 
announced that two gardens at the Yitzhak Rabin Center for Israel 
Studies in Tel Aviv will be named for the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, the name of which means ``godbye friend,'' takes its  
name from Clinton's farewell after Rabin was assassinated. It was 
created to honor people who have worked for peace in the Middle 
East.

<HEADLINE> Miami's Coles Savors Tournament Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One year after coach Charlie Coles collapsed on the court from  
cardiac arrest, his Miami Redhawks are in the NCAA tournament's 
round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles is smiling a lot as the Redhawks prepare to play defending  
champion Kentucky on Friday. It's not just because his team has 
done something that no other Miami team could -- win two NCAA 
tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	There's more to it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel blessed,'' Coles said. ``But you know, I would  
have felt blessed regardless because I get a chance to spend time 
with kids I truly love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bond between coach and players deepened last year, when  
Coles collapsed during the first half of a Mid-American Conference 
tournament quarterfinal on Feb. 28. Doctors worked on him for 20 
minutes on court before he was taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors determined there was no lasting damage to his heart and  
he would be able to coach again. Coles, 57, never hesitated to go 
back to doing what he loves and working with a senior-laden team 
that he had nurtured to the verge of national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really builds around the seniors and senior pride and  
leadership,'' Wally Szczerbiak said. ``He was really looking 
forward to the senior class coming in this year and us going out 
with a bang like we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After beating Washington in the first round -- Szczerbiak scored  
43 of Miami's 59 points -- the 10th-seeded RedHawks upset Utah to 
reach the round of 16 and set their southwest Ohio campus buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has tried to be calmer at courtside this season, a  
resolution he admits he cannot always keep. But there's been no 
change in the way he coaches -- and his players are thankful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie is a perfectionist,'' Szczerbiak said. ``That's how he  
lives. That's how he is. He never takes anything for granted and he 
always works really hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think that's the main reason we've come so far, with  
him driving us to be the best we could possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His coaching in the tournament has been impressive. He gave his  
struggling team some time off after it lost in this year's MAC 
tournament, and that helped put players in the right frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach gave us two days off to totally get away from basketball  
and take our minds off the game. That really helped everyone,'' 
Szczerbiak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game plans for the NCAA tournament have worked. The idea  
against Washington's man-to-man defense was to get Szczerbiak the 
ball and set screens to give him some room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't mind when Wally scores a lot of points,'' Coles said.  
``The screens we set were the best I've ever been associated with 
as a coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak scored 24 against Utah and often drew a crowd,  
leaving others open to score. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as important, the RedHawks didn't crumble when times got  
tough. That's at least partly a tribute to Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we've handled it pretty well,'' Szczerbiak said.  
``After the first game, we got better and played better in the next 
game. That's a tribute to guys not letting the attention affect 
them.''

<HEADLINE> L. Taylor's Ex-Partner Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- The onetime business partner and lawyer for  
retired All-Pro linebacker Lawrence Taylor was convicted by a 
federal jury Thursday of embezzlement, money laundering, bank fraud 
and tax evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict against Alfred Porro Jr. came after three days of  
deliberations. It followed nine weeks of testimony, highlighted by 
Taylor's appearance on the witness stand last month just three days 
after being he was elected to the pro football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea bargain that he hopes will help him avoid  
prison, Taylor, 39, testified for the prosecution. Taylor had 
pleaded guilty in June 1997 to tax charges that surfaced during the 
investigation of Porro, 64, and his wife, Joan, 51, who was also 
convicted Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was not charged with the couple, who are both lawyers  
from Lyndhurst in Bergen County. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trial presented proofs of a seamless web of fraud,'' said  
U.S. Attorney Faith S. Hochberg, whose office prosecuted the case. 
``When the frauds were finally catching up with Al and Joan Porro, 
the evidence proved that they tried to pervert justice by 
submitting phony and backdated documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Porros represented themselves and were convicted on all  
charges, 17 against him and eight against her. Among the charges: 
stealing $276,000 in client trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of that money was used to salvage their failing businesses,  
including the Lawrence Taylor Golf Center in East Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor and Porro were partners in a company that built the  
driving range, but Taylor said he was not involved in the 
construction or financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor told jurors that his signature was falsified on a bogus  
financial guarantee that Porro submitted to a bank that lent Porro 
$850,000 to develop a Meadowlands tract. Under cross-examination by 
Porro, Taylor said he did not know who forged his name and that it 
did not appear to be Porro's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Porros had been municipal attorneys for two Bergen County  
towns, Carlstadt and East Rutherford. They could be disbarred 
because of the felony convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Each also faces dozens of years in prison and millions of  
dollars in fines when sentenced Aug. 13 by U.S. District Judge 
Joseph H. Rodriguez, although the actual penalties would be far 
lower under federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors asked that the Porros be held without bail, but  
Rodriguez decided on house arrest with electronic monitoring 
pending a bail hearing on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor will probably be sentenced after the Porros.  
</P>
<P>
	Considered the dominant defensive player of his time, Taylor  
played 13 seasons at linebacker with the Giants, leading the team 
to two Super Bowl titles. He is also known for trouble off the 
field, including two drug arrests.

<HEADLINE>  Lewis: I'm Victim of Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lennox Lewis returned home today endorsing the  
investigations into his disputed draw with Evander Holyfield in 
their heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after touching down at London's Heathrow Airport, Lewis  
maintained was the victim of a ``conspiracy'' and that the judges 
had been ``incompetent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everything should be looked into,'' he said. ``There  
was definitely something going on, some kind of conspiracy we don't 
know about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Holyfield-Lewis showdown at Madison Square Garden in  
New York created an outcry when it was called a draw. Most in the 
sellout crowd felt Lewis had won comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Arthur Mercante Jr. agreed, as did most boxing writers  
who covered the 12-rounder 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three judges saw the outcome differently. South  
African Stan Christodoulou scored it 116-113 for Lewis, Eugenia 
Williams of Atlantic City, N.J., voted 115-113 for Holyfield and 
Britain's Larry O'Connell scored it 115-115. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' manager, Frank Maloney, said he didn't believe bribes had  
been paid, but he questioned Williams' competence as a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe there was any illegal payment, they wouldn't  
have been that stupid,'' Maloney said. ``They may not find money in 
her bank account, but there was definitely something wrong with her 
judging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigations by state authorities are being held in New York,  
and the Manhattan district attorney is looking into possible 
criminal activity regarding the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be  
identified, said: ``We could be looking at tampering or illegal 
payments. Then again, maybe we're looking at lousy judging, which 
is not a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said Holyfield should hand over the WBA and IBF titles,  
although the British fighter doesn't expect that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Evander's a man, he should admit that he got beat and give  
me my belts,'' said Lewis, who is the WBC champion. ``But he's not 
that kind of character. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say that Evander Holyfield is holding my belts right  
now for me. They're actually my belts but he's holding them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to a possible rematch, Lewis' promoter, Panos  
Eliades, said he was looking at ways of removing Don King as a 
promoter of the fight, although he conceded it would be very 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney said he would prefer the rematch to be in the United  
States or Britain while Eliades said he had been contacted by 
President Nelson Mandela who wanted the fight in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis took consolation from one thing. He believes he won over  
Americans who had been skeptical about his ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``People stopped me in the streets and said 'you got robbed'.  
It's weird getting so many people coming up to me and saying 
that,'' Lewis said. ``When I go out on the streets a lot of people 
know me.''

<HEADLINE> Southwest Airlines Spurs Fare Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Consumers may get a break on travel through early  
August even though leisure fares have increased by as much as 7 
percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Major airlines quickly lowered fares on competing routes  
Thursday to match a sale announced in the morning by Southwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be one of the last few great fare sales that we will  
see for the spring and summer travel seasons,'' said Tom Parsons, 
editor of Bestfares.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples of prices for seven-day advance roundtrip fares  
included $99 between Baltimore and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and $198 
for flights between Los Angeles and Nashville, Tenn. or Austin, 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous best fare at American Airlines on the Austin-Los  
Angeles flight was $290, according to spokesman Tim Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The special fares are available for purchase through April 27  
for flights until Aug. 4. Tickets are nonrefundable, must be 
purchased at least seven days in advance, and require a roundtrip 
purchase and an overnight stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with all the requirements, the fares are worth it, said  
Parsons, who tracks ticket prices for his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's good about this fare sale is Southwest is giving us  
almost a whole month to get our act together. This will be a great 
week to sit down and review your vacation time and talk to human 
resources about getting some time off,'' Parson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-based Southwest has offered similar sales a few times  
each year in the past. Still, this one is unlikely to fill all of 
the seats that are expected to go empty because of overcapacity at 
several major airlines this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly helps but its not enough to offset it,'' said  
Susan Donofrio, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown.

<HEADLINE>  Blue Jays Fire Johnson As Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Tim Johnson's lies about his Marine service  
in Vietnam did too much damage to save his job with the Toronto 
Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare spring training move, the Blue Jays fired Johnson as  
manager Wednesday and replaced him with Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unsettledness and the distractions had become the issue,''  
general manager Gord Ash said. ``It had become apparent it wasn't 
going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson never saw combat, but supposedly made up stories --  
including a tale about shooting a young girl -- to motivate the 
team. Instead, it cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson taught mortar training to recruits going to Vietnam, yet  
never served there. The truth was revealed last year, causing 
conflicts with several players and pitching coach Mel Queen, and 
even an apology to the club this spring could not quell the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was always a distraction, we can't lie about that,'' first  
baseman Carlos Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was fired at 1 a.m. after a 2-1 loss to the New York  
Yankees left the Blue Jays at 3-12 in exhibitions. The move came a 
few days after former Toronto third baseman Ed Sprague called 
Johnson a ``liar'' and a ``back stabber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't going to fade into the background as quickly as I  
hoped,'' Ash said. ``It had become a preoccupation and was making 
it hard to focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't any one thing, just an accumulation of things,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing a manager in spring training is not unprecedented.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Padres fired Alvin Dark and hired Roger Craig on  
March 21, 1978. Dark had managed the Padres for the final 114 games 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Cavaretta was fired by the Chicago Cubs on March 29, 1954.  
He was let go when, with a 5-15 record, he told owner P.K. Wrigley 
he thought the Cubs were doomed to a bad season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were looking for leadership,'' Fregosi said. ``We've got  
18 games. We'll be ready by opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 49, was offered a job as a scout, and it was not known  
whether he would take it. He was driving to visit family in Kansas 
and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays went 88-74 and finished third in the AL East in  
Johnson's only season as a major league manager. Fregosi also 
interviewed for the spot before Ash picked Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, 56, managed the Philadelphia Phillies when they lost  
the 1993 World Series to Toronto. Fired after the 1996 season, he 
was with the San Francisco Giants as a special assistant to the 
general manager when Ash sought permission Friday to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached agreement Sunday and Fregosi signed a two-year  
deal. He had an 861-937 record while managing Philadelphia, the 
Chicago White Sox and California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to manage,'' Fregosi said. ``I missed the  
action, I missed the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first exhibition game for Toronto on Wednesday, he faced  
the Phillies and shook hands with manager Terry Francona, who 
replaced Fregosi in 1996. The Blue Jays stole a run with a double 
steal in the first inning, then Fregosi came on the field to argue 
a ground-rule double call in the fifth of a 10-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting,'' Fregosi said. ``It was fun to be back a  
part of the action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson almost didn't make it to spring training.  
</P>
<P>
	Last November, he was given the choice of being dismissed,  
resigning to become a coach or apologizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson made a public apology, then came to camp and apologized  
to his players. He also cleared up another lie -- his official Blue 
Jays bio said he was a high school All-American basketball player 
who turned down a chance to play for UCLA, but none of it was true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe people deserve second chances, and I think Tim  
deserved that,'' Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash said the move to change managers began last week when he met  
with the Toronto's owners and ``expressed some concern about our 
ability to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays stumbled at the start of last year before  
finishing strong. Still, Johnson's lies about his service in the 
U.S. Marines became the story of their season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that had something to do with it,'' infielder Tony  
Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a key series last season at Boston, Johnson said he  
planned to pitch Roger Clemens instead of Pat Hentgen in the final 
game. When Hentgen complained, Johnson sharply told the pitcher he 
didn't know anything about tough spots, adding ``pressure is 
Vietnam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hentgen, one of Johnson's critics, had little to say after the  
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a front-office decision and Gord Ash made it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> China Criticizes US for Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China today criticized a U.S. missile-defense  
bill that was passed with overwhelming support by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said the missile defense  
programs the United States is considering are counterproductive for 
arms control and disarmament and will ``have an impact on global 
strategic balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``China expresses its grave concern,'' Sun said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed by the Senate 97-3 on Wednesday, would commit  
the United States to building a national defense against limited 
ballistic missile attack ``as soon as technologically possible.'' A 
version of the bill was scheduled to be taken up today by the House 
of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The national missile defense program supported by the Senate  
would use similar technology to a theater missile defense system 
that the United States and Japan are studying for East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	China fears the system could spark a costly arms race, would  
strengthen U.S. military alliances with Japan and South Korea and 
may be used to protect Taiwan, thereby obstructing reunification. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past month, senior Chinese leaders have spoken out  
against the proposed regional anti-missile system. On Monday, 
Premier Zhu Rongji said China was firmly opposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
	China views the island of Taiwan as part of its territory and  
considers reunification a strategic goal. Taiwan and the mainland 
have been ruled separately since the end of the Chinese civil war 
in 1949.

	Court Clears Way for Probe for Starr  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court cleared the way today  
for the Justice Department to investigate the official conduct of 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The special court that names 
independent counsels dismissed a challenge by Landmark Legal 
Foundation, a conservative group that sought an order to block the 
Justice Department investigation. The court said it had limited

Ethics In Government Act.

	House Considers Own Pay Raise

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top House leaders are weighing a plan to give  
legislators a cost of living increase, an increase that could add 
about $5,000 to an annual salary of $136,673. Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., raised the issue at a meeting earlier this year 
with Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, according to aides to the 
two men. Under a 1989 law, lawmakers are entitled to a cost of 
living increase that is pegged to the pay raise the president 
proposes each year for federal workers. Members of Congress last 
got an increase two years ago.

	Whitewater Defense Gets Order

<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled today that  
lawyers for Susan McDougal must first specify what questions they 
want to ask of Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr's top deputy 
before he takes the witness stand. Acting on a request from Starr's 
office, U.S. District Judge George Howard ordered Mrs. McDougal's 
lawyers to provide a better summary of their questions for Deputy 
Independent Counsel Hickman Ewing and told the two sides to try to 
reach an agreement on Ewing's testimony. Court papers filed earlier 
by Starr's office suggested the defense lawyers' summary might be 
used to fight an appearance by Ewing or to try to block some 
questions.

	Trade Deficit Surges to Record High

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit soared to an all-time  
high of $17 billion in January as global financial troubles pushed 
U.S. exports down further while imports of autos, consumer goods 
and food were climbing to record highs. The Commerce Department 
reported that the trade deficit shot up 21 percent from December's 
$14.1 billion level and surpassed the old monthly record of $16.7 
billion set last August. In other reports, the government announced 
that new claims for unemployment insurance were up 6,000 to 298,000 
last week, and that consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent in 
February.

<HEADLINE>  Blue Jays Fire Johnson As Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Tim Johnson's lies about his Marine service  
in Vietnam did too much damage to save his job with the Toronto 
Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare spring training move, the Blue Jays fired Johnson as  
manager Wednesday and replaced him with Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unsettledness and the distractions had become the issue,''  
general manager Gord Ash said. ``It had become apparent it wasn't 
going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson never saw combat, but supposedly made up stories --  
including a tale about shooting a young girl -- to motivate the 
team. Instead, it cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson taught mortar training to recruits going to Vietnam, yet  
never served there. The truth was revealed last year, causing 
conflicts with several players and pitching coach Mel Queen, and 
even an apology to the club this spring could not quell the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was always a distraction, we can't lie about that,'' first  
baseman Carlos Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was fired at 1 a.m. after a 2-1 loss to the New York  
Yankees left the Blue Jays at 3-12 in exhibitions. The move came a 
few days after former Toronto third baseman Ed Sprague called 
Johnson a ``liar'' and a ``back stabber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't going to fade into the background as quickly as I  
hoped,'' Ash said. ``It had become a preoccupation and was making 
it hard to focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't any one thing, just an accumulation of things,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firing a manager in spring training is not unprecedented.  
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Padres fired Alvin Dark and hired Roger Craig on  
March 21, 1978. Dark had managed the Padres for the final 114 games 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Cavaretta was fired by the Chicago Cubs on March 29, 1954.  
He was let go when, with a 5-15 record, he told owner P.K. Wrigley 
he thought the Cubs were doomed to a bad season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were looking for leadership,'' Fregosi said. ``We've got  
18 games. We'll be ready by opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 49, was offered a job as a scout, and it was not known  
whether he would take it. He was driving to visit family in Kansas 
and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays went 88-74 and finished third in the AL East in  
Johnson's only season as a major league manager. Fregosi also 
interviewed for the spot before Ash picked Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, 56, managed the Philadelphia Phillies when they lost  
the 1993 World Series to Toronto. Fired after the 1996 season, he 
was with the San Francisco Giants as a special assistant to the 
general manager when Ash sought permission Friday to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached agreement Sunday and Fregosi signed a two-year  
deal. He had an 861-937 record while managing Philadelphia, the 
Chicago White Sox and California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted to manage,'' Fregosi said. ``I missed the  
action, I missed the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first exhibition game for Toronto on Wednesday, he faced  
the Phillies and shook hands with manager Terry Francona, who 
replaced Fregosi in 1996. The Blue Jays stole a run with a double 
steal in the first inning, then Fregosi came on the field to argue 
a ground-rule double call in the fifth of a 10-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting,'' Fregosi said. ``It was fun to be back a  
part of the action.'' 
</P>

resigning to become a coach or apologizing.

who turned down a chance to play for UCLA, but none of it was true.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Angers Stottlemyre With Bows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa's new home run bow has Todd  
Stottlemyre bent out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to be embarrassed,'' Stottlemyre said after Sosa  
hit two homers off him Wednesday in the Chicago Cubs' 8-5, 
10-inning loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure don't remember Mickey Mantle bowing after home runs,''  
Stottlemyre said. ``I guarantee Joe DiMaggio didn't bow. I bet 
everything I got Lou Gehrig didn't, Jackie Robinson, Roberto 
Clemente. Those are great players. Those are guys who paved the way 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa raised his home run total to seven, the most in spring  
training and two more than his 1999 spring total. He picked up the 
habit of bowing to fans during the All-Star tour of Japan last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have a lot of opportunities to see me showing  
the bows, showing respect for fans,'' said Sosa, who has hit the 
home runs in just 22 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, 3-for-17 (.167) against Stottlemyre during the regular  
season with no homers and eight strikeouts. hit a two-run homer to 
right-center in the first and a solo shot to left-center in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time he crossed the plate, he stopped after a few steps for  
a crisp bow to the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the way he and Mark McGwire put baseball back on the  
map last year,'' Stottlemyre said. ``It's a huge credit to him 
personally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bows, however, crossed Stottlemyre's line.  
</P>
<P>
	``I took it as offensive,'' he said. ``I don't bow after a  
strikeout or a win. Just play the game, be professional and move 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was, well, unbowed.  
</P>
<P>
	``No comment,'' he said when informed of Stottlemyre's remarks.  
The bows, he said, are ``showing respect for all the fans who come 
out here seeing the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting 66 homers last year, four short of the record set  
by Mark McGwire, Sosa bulked up during the offseason. He is two 
ahead of McGwire in the meaningless spring training race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a gym in my house. I was working out two times a day,''  
Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he exercise during his numerous travels, too?  
</P>
<P>
	``I was working out on the plane,'' he joked.  
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre, making his fourth spring start, allowed three runs  
and five hits in 2 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs starter Kevin Tapani gave up five runs -- four earned -- and  
six hits in 2 1-3 innings. He has an 8.59 ERA in three spring 
starts, allowing seven earned runs in 7 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Williams drove in three runs for the Diamondbacks with a  
two-run double in the first and a solo homer in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Rodriguez hit his fourth homer of the spring, a two-run  
shot in the fifth off Vladimir Nunez.

<HEADLINE> Terrapins, Red Storm Go High-Octane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Coach Mike Jarvis wants the St. John's  
Red Storm to enjoy what he calls a fantastic voyage. For Maryland, 
taking in the sights just won't do anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins are in the round of 16 for the fourth time in six  
years. Getting this far is no longer a thrill for a program that 
hasn't been to a regional championship game since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the focus is reaching the first Final Four in Maryland's  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maryland definitely is on the cusp of greatness this year,''  
senior Laron Profit said. ``We feel this is our opportunity. There 
is a sense of urgency, not only for Maryland basketball, but we're 
being selfish. This is our last time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this is our opportunity to go out and do well and win  
and be remembered in Maryland as the team that got us there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second-seeded Terrapins (28-5), who already have the most  
wins in school history, must get past third-seeded St. John's 
(27-8) tonight in the first South Regional semifinal at 
Thompson-Boling Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Auburn plays No. 4 Ohio State in the second game.  
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis is trying to pass along some of the excitement of playing  
in the semifinals in his first year coaching the Red Storm. He 
knows how fleeting success can be since he took George Washington 
to a regional semifinal in 1993, only to fall short three other 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I asked them to do ... is no matter how much they  
want to win a game and no matter how far they want to go, to enjoy 
the experience and have some fun because these things don't happen 
very often for many people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans could have the most fun from a semifinal that features two  
teams that love to push the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm can nearly match Maryland, the nation's  
fifth-highest scoring team this season with an 85.6 average, 
point-for-point on offense. Jarvis has five starters scoring in 
double figures, with the Red Storm averaging 79.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Williams, one victory short of 400 for his career, said he  
hopes both teams play at the level that got them to the round of 
16. But he won't be picky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take an ugly game ... if we win,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Terrapins are used to being quicker than most opponents, an  
advantage they won't have against St. John's. Williams said 
preparation will be the key, but that doesn't mean major changes 
for Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out and play Maryland basketball,'' Maryland  
guard Terrell Stokes said. ``That's what got us 28 wins, so I don't 
think we should change anything at this point of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland basketball this season has meant defense as much as  
balanced offense. The Terrapins already have a school-record 423 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm has shown some versatility in the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	St. John's, making its first appearance in the round of 16 since  
1991, switched from its preferred man-to-man defense to a zone 
against Indiana, despite the players' reservations. The result was 
an 86-61 victory, the worst tournament loss in Indiana's history. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his Red Storm will need to play with the same kind of  
discipline to keep up with Maryland and contain Steve Francis (17.2 
points). That doesn't mean playing tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage of the game, unless you're Duke, you better play  
attack and you better play disciplined; otherwise, you're going 
home,'' Jarvis said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Mrs. Clinton Ahead in NY Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton would defeat New York  
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a hypothetical U.S. Senate election, 
according to a New York Times/CBS News poll published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found that 48 percent of voters favor the Democratic

percent of those polled.

would probably be more effective than Giuliani. However, four in 10 
voters asked said they felt the first lady would not be an 
effective state representative in the Senate because she has never 
lived in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 8-14 telephone poll of 1,270 New Yorkers who said they  
voted in 1998 or 1996 has a margin of error of 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Three earlier polls this year have also given Mrs. Clinton the  
edge of Giuliani. A Zogby International New York poll released 
Monday gave Giuliani the edge with 48 percent of likely voters 
compared with Mrs. Clinton's 37 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Defends Business Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Development Program responded  
Thursday to criticism of a new economic partnership with 
corporations, saying any joint program will meet U.N. standards on 
labor, human rights and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	UNDP chief James Gustav Speth also accused a human rights  
organization, Transnational Resource and Action Center, of having 
misled the media by suggesting the new program was being kept 
secret because some of the corporations had been accused of human 
rights or environmental abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has been very open about the plans for the  
partnership, even holding a workshop on it in South Africa, but 
hasn't widely publicized it because the initiative was still in the 
works, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is indeed much information that you do not have, and it  
would have been far preferable to do us the courtesy of seeking out 
accurate information, and all of it, and engaging in a dialogue 
with us on your concerns,'' Speth wrote the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal U.N. document leaked by TRAC to the media last week  
detailed a new Third World economic development effort in which 
multinational companies contribute $50,000 for new U.N. development 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the United Nations is considering creating a logo  
incorporating its name that corporate sponsors could use. TRAC 
claims the partnership, and the logo, will allow companies an easy 
opportunity to use the highly valuable U.N. name to help build new 
businesses and improve their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
	Speth acknowledged that some of the corporations involved had  
been accused of rights abuses, but said the United Nations wasn't 
in a position to certify the companies' compliance with 
international rights standards. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed, however, that any cooperation between corporations  
and the United Nations ``will have to meet United Nations standards 
in human rights, environmental sustainability and labor rights.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Warns About Unsafe Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Water is becoming the ``climate change''  
issue of the next quarter century, when the number of people 
without access to clean, safe water is expected to jump by about a 
billion people, a top U.N. official says. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of ``water wars'' between countries vying for  
dwindling water supplies will only increase as the world's 
population grows and governments squander opportunities to manage 
the finite amount of freshwater that exists, Klaus Topfer, the head 
of the U.N. Environment Program, said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 47 percent of the world's land area, excluding  
Antarctica, falls within international water basins shared by two 
or more countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations is trying to drive home the threat of future  
conflicts over water -- and the humanitarian consequences of unsafe 
water -- ahead of the World Day for Water, which will be marked 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's focus is to draw attention to the impact of the  
world's water shortage on regions where the water supply is 
adequate, primarily the developed world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people are convinced water is a regional topic,'' Topfer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. analysis, sponsored by Topfer's agency and the U.N.  
University, found that clean, safe water can be brought to the 1.4 
billion people around the world without it for as little as $50 per 
person in rural areas and $105 per person in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	That can prevent many of the 3 billion cases of illness and 5  
million deaths caused each year by unsafe water, U.N. experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, a child dies every eight seconds from a water-related  
disease and 20 percent of freshwater fish species are near 
extinction because of contaminated water, U.N. figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	The study warned that the number of people without access to  
safe water would jump from 1.4 billion today to 2.3 billion by 
2025, with the number of those who die from contaminated water 
expected to jump sharply as well.

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Doctor Likes Center Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eriq La Salle has taken center stage on  
``ER'' and in a new television movie, ``Mind Prey.'' And he wants 
to stay there. 
</P>
<P>
	He recently carried an ``ER'' episode that took La Salle's Dr.  
Peter Benton and the NBC medical drama away from their Chicago home 
base and down to a small, Southern town that doesn't have a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Now La Salle is starring as a maverick police officer tracking a  
killer in ``Mind Prey,'' based on the John Sandford novel. Titus 
Welliver and Sheila Kelley co-star in the film (9 p.m. Monday on 
ABC), which La Salle co-produced. 
</P>
<P>
	Such opportunities don't simply rain down. As the actor tells  
it, his voice soft but intense, it takes careful attention to get 
exactly what he wants -- and, on occasion, hard bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mind Prey,'' for example, wouldn't have caught his eye if it  
were just another forgettable made-for-TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a vow I wouldn't do a movie of the week. I felt with  
'ER' we were doing some of the best television there was to do,'' 
he said. ``When I read this script, I felt it was something I could 
do different. It was edgy, it was very mature. Very challenging and 
intriguing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The character of deputy police chief Lucas Davenport, featured  
in a series of Sandford mysteries, is written as white. For the 
black actor, that created added appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more about the character, it's not about his race.  
There's never any reference to his race (in the film),'' La Salle 
said. ``It's very similar to what we've been able to accomplish 
with the Benton character. He's a talented surgeon who happens to 
be black. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is a rogue cop who does things his way. He's a great  
cop, and he happens to be black. ... I'm not interested in doing 
segregated filmmaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Salle also welcomed the chance to extend colorblind casting  
to other ``Mind Prey'' roles. The part of a surgeon and love 
interest went to Nicole Parker, who is black; the part of an old 
flame is played by Judy Reyes, who is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes told him she almost skipped the audition. ``I thought they  
were going through the motions. I never thought they would actually 
cast a Latina, because they never do,'' she said to La Salle. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the kind of hope you want to give to artists,'' he  
said. ``I totally know what it's like to go into an audition and to 
be quote-unquote token actor, African-American actor, because they 
just want to see a couple of blacks. But if it's a really good 
role, it goes to the white males.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing the playing field is the challenge before producers  
and directors -- roles which La Salle has successfully cultivated as 
he branches out from acting. 
</P>
<P>
	He directed the HBO film ``Rebound,'' about fallen basketball  
great Earl Manigault, and created two award-winning short films. 
Plans are in place for La Salle to direct a film about former Black 
Panther Geronimo Pratt, produced by Marlon Brando and Sean Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	La Salle, a Hartford, Conn., native with a New York University  
degree in theater arts, has his own production company, Humble 
Journey Films. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say that he is neglecting ``ER.'' La Salle  
fought for what he considered the overdue showcase episode in which 
Benton plays a rural sawbones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it took five years for Dr. Benton to get what  
every other original principal character has had not once, but 
multiple times on the show,'' said La Salle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we wrong in asking for what our colleagues are getting in  
abundance? It's sad that it literally took me ... saying, 'I want 
to be released from the show.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Warner Bros. stepped in and said, 'Let's fix this. We want you  
to honor your contract,' '' La Salle said. ``It was only after the 
studio stepped in that this episode came about. I think that's a 
really sad comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to say if he believed race was the reason; the facts  
speak for themselves, La Salle said. He also declined to say if he 
intended to remain with the series after next season, when his 
contract ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure last month of George Clooney, who played series  
heartthrob Dr. Doug Ross, inspired tabloid reports of La Salle 
issuing demands for more prominence in the series. La Salle 
dismisses such stories as ``loopy.'' But does he think the cast 
shift will affect his role? 
</P>
<P>
	``With George having left, my desire and the goals I have for  
the character don't change. I still have a lot of respect for this 
job and for the character and the work. So the desire and goal is 
the same -- to have Dr. Benton presented in as multidimensional a 
light as you see with the other characters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's room for improvement.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Treasure Hunters Win Fortune </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A band of treasure hunters who found the  
wreck of the ill-fated Brother Jonathan -- California's deadliest 
shipwreck -- have come out the big winners in a fight over a fortune 
in lost gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Sea Research Inc. of El Cajon will get to keep more than  
1,000 coins it recovered from the sunken hulk. The ship went down 
in 1865, taking scores of sailors, miners, prostitutes and 
politicians to the bottom about four miles off Crescent City. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's settlement in U.S. District Court in San Francisco  
upheld an agreement between DSR and the state which will allow the 
company to continue retrieving objects and keep 80 percent of what 
it finds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The settlement brought to a close 5 1/2 years in court,'' said  
David Flohr, one of DSR's founders. ``We're very pleased and 
gratified, after this long and very expensive struggle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DSR expects to make $5 million to $10 million when the coins --  
$5, $10 and $20 gold pieces -- are auctioned in Los Angeles May 
29-31. Part of the payoff will go to about 100 small investors who 
bankrolled the project. 
</P>
<P>
	DSR divers will be back on the wreck later this year and again  
next summer. Among the items they will be seeking are a safe which 
may contain $200,000 in greenbacks from an army payroll, a circus 
payroll and more gold in coins and bullion. 
</P>
<P>
	It sounds like a lot of money, but the hunt for the Brother  
Jonathan and the salvage operation is a complex and costly project. 
More than $1 million was spent finding and retrieving the booty. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey Harrington, DSR's vice president and director of offshore  
operations, visited the wreck in a small submarine. The picture he 
recalls is far from glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no panoramic view,'' he said. ``In most cases, ships like  
this have deteriorated to the waterline or are covered over. It's 
murky and muddy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's still quite a sight.''  
</P>
<P>
	In July 1865, the Brother Jonathan, a three-masted, side-wheel  
steamer was heading north along the California coast when it 
encountered stormy weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushed out of control, it slammed into a hidden rock, now called  
Jonathan Rock. The rock ripped a gaping hole in the hull, and 
terrified passengers had just 45 minutes to save themselves before 
the ship vanished in 250 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
	One lifeboat, with 21 people aboard, made it to shore.  
Researchers think some 200 others perished. Among the victims was 
James Nesbit, editor of the San Francisco Bulletin, whose hastily 
scribbled will and notes to loved ones washed ashore wrapped in 
oilskin. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Lands Commission gets 20 percent of whatever DSR finds  
and will have an expert on board the salvage ship to supervise the 
recovery of historic items. The 200 coins already due to the state, 
worth $1 million, will be distributed to museums in Crescent City 
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	DSR has already bought title to the ship and its contents from  
insurance companies that paid claims. Descendants of the wreck's 
victims who can prove a relationship to an item will be able to 
keep it, minus recovery costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement brings to an end more than a quarter century of  
research and legal squabbling. The case went to the Supreme Court, 
where a year ago the state, with 17 states supporting it, argued -- 
unsuccessfully -- that they should control whatever came off the 
ship. The court ruled that salvage cases must be considered on a 
case-by-case basis in lower courts.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Remain in Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Joe Gibbs can concentrate solely on NASCAR  
for another couple of weeks. Vinny Cerrato has to keep cooling his 
heels in his hotel room a few miles from Redskin Park, where 
current management won't let him have an office. 
</P>
<P>
	With the sale of the Washington Redskins postponed again, the  
people who plan to be a part of the new regime remain in limbo -- as 
do the people who still run the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of us thought it would get voted upon this week,''  
general manager Charley Casserly said Thursday. ``It didn't, so we 
just keep going. That's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly represented the Redskins at the NFL meetings in  
Phoenix, where the team's prospective new owners, Howard and Edward 
Milstein and Dan Snyder, had to ask for a postponement on a vote to 
approve their $800 bid because they realized it wouldn't pass. The 
NFL said Thursday the owners will reconvene and vote on the matter 
at a special meeting April 7 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Howard Milstein will travel around the country  
for some one-on-one lobbying to get the four or five votes it's 
believed he needs to reach the necessary three-fourths majority of 
24. It's thought that a hard-core group of four owners -- Denver's 
Pat Bowlen, New Orleans' Tom Benson, Pittsburgh's Dan Rooney and 
Cleveland's Al Lerner -- are firmly opposed and cannot be won over, 
while others are more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons for opposition to the Milstein-Snyder bid vary, but  
they all concern the Milstein part of the bid, which was originally 
to be financed with an unsecured loan. The Milsteins have adjusted 
their financing several times over the past few weeks, and they 
will use the extra time to put together a proposal that satisfies 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some owners, wary of Howard Milstein's contentious  
reign as part-owner of the New York Islanders, worry that he may 
become an Al Davis-like maverick owner in the NFL. Several owners 
even suggested Wednesday that Snyder should be the majority owner 
of the Redskins' group because he has the ready cash in the bank, a 
proposal Milstein isn't ready to consider. 
</P>
<P>
	But where does this leave the team? Free agents have been  
skittish about signing with the Redskins because of the 
uncertainty. Casserly and coach Norv Turner are preparing for the 
April 17-18 draft, even though there's no guarantee they'll still 
have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's killing us,'' guard Tre Johnson told The Washington Post  
even as the owners were meeting. ``This is my sixth year (with the 
Redskins) and it looks like it's going to be the worst one. ... A 
lot of guys have to be skeptical -- like free agents. They've got be 
wary of coming here. They don't know who they're going to play 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Milsteins and Snyder have been preparing for the changeover  
as best they can. Cerrato, the former director of player personnel 
with the San Francisco 49ers, has been hired as a consultant. The 
Redskins said there wasn't room for him to have office space at 
Redskin Park, so he's working out of a hotel, keeping tabs on 
players throughout the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs, who coached the Redskins to three Super Bowl titles  
before resigning after the 1992 season, would serve as an adviser 
to the new owners while continuing to run his NASCAR team in 
Charlotte, N.C. Milstein and Snyder plan to have their first 
face-to-face meetings with Turner and Casserly -- if the sale is 
approved -- before any decision is announced concerning the coach or 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the repeated delays were starting to wear on him,  
Casserly said: ``It's like a football game. You lose yardage on 
first down, you still got to play second down. We'll keep doing 
what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Redskins signed two players Thursday. Unrestricted free  
agent tackle Jamie Brown, who has played for Denver and San 
Francisco over four NFL seasons, signed a one-year, $500,000 
contract. Exclusive rights free agent guard Lamont Burns, a late 
addition last season, signed for one year at $325,000.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Invests $1.4B in Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp.'s $1.4  
billion Spaceway satellite system, scheduled to debut in 2002, will 
give consumers access to inexpensive, high-speed computer links, 
including Internet and video conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will be able to transmit and receive data, voice,  
video, audio and multimedia via a pair of satellites orbiting Earth 
but only pay for the amount of bandwidth needed to communicate with 
high-speed corporate networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be as easy as picking up your telephone today,''  
Hughes chairman Michael T. Smith said Wednesday during a telephone 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will no longer have to go through a retransmission  
service or hub but will be able to communicate directly via 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Spaceway ``the most advanced satellite platform in the  
world,'' Smith said users will see a 20 percent to 30 percent cost 
reduction over current land-based systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Spaceway will provide access for everyone from large businesses  
to home office users to two-way, high speed applications including 
desktop video conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large businesses, telecommuters, small office, home office or  
solo users and consumers will have easy access to two-way, 
broadband multimedia applications such as desktop 
videoconferencing, interactive distance learning, commuter 
networking and many other intra- and internet services,'' said 
Pradman P. Kaul, chief operating officer of Hughes Network Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, through its Hughes Network Systems unit, will develop  
terminals and ground infrastructure. Another subsidiary, PanAmSat, 
will operate the telemetry and Hughes-owned DirecTV will market 
several data services to subscribers. DirecTV has about 4.5 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two operational Spaceway satellites and one spare, built by  
Hughes in El Segundo, will be placed in geosynchronous orbit in 
late 2001, Kaul said. The launch site has yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The first system is expected to begin in North America in 2002  
and eventually be marketed in regions worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producers Seek Federal Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 100 independent oil and natural gas  
producers have fanned out across Washington this week, clamoring 
for federal help for an industry battered by low crude oil prices 
stemming from a worldwide glut. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond seeking tax relief and other legislative help, the  
marginal producers and their allies on Capitol Hill are calling on 
the Clinton administration to change its policies toward Iraq. 
Under a U.N. policy supported by the United States, Iraq is allowed 
to sell up to $10.4 billion of oil a year in order to purchase food 
and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is assembling a task force, to be headed by  
presidential economic adviser Gene Sperling, to examine the state 
of the oil industry and possible relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers have seen their industry shrink by 50,000  
jobs in the last year and seen more than 136,000 oil wells shut 
down since November 1997. They contend the oil-for-food program is 
serving mainly to aid Saddam Hussein while harming U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our rights are being violated by politicians taking care of  
the Middle East,'' complained Ruben Ramirez, a 34-year oil industry 
veteran from Kermit, Texas, who has been laid off amid the 
industry's current woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq can use $600 million a year  
to rebuild its oil infrastructure and drill new wells, adding to 
the current oversupply and potentially handing Iraq a tool to 
destabilize oil markets, producers said at a Capitol news 
conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to argue against ... some kind of relief for  
the Iraqi people,'' said New Mexico producer George Yates, chairman 
of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. ``But what 
we're saying is that the oil-for-food program is skewed. It is 
government at work, it is not the market at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing before Senate committees Wednesday, Energy Secretary  
Bill Richardson said Iraq's 2.5 million barrel-a-day production has 
a negligible impact on U.S. oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But that view was dismissed by the chairman of the Senate Energy  
and Natural Resources Committee, Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska, 
who noted oil prices rose sharply when OPEC last week proposed 
production cuts of 2 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to recognize that old reality that charity begins at  
home,'' Murkowski said at Thursday's news conference, organized by 
IPAA. ``We've got to support our domestic petroleum industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IPAA, which represents thousands of marginal producers, is  
backing legislation that would provide tax credits and return 
inactive wells to production. IPAA members met Tuesday at the White 
House with Vice President Al Gore, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, 
Richardson and other top administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Marginal producers account for 20 percent of domestic production  
-- a large share for a nation that depends on foreign oil for more 
than half of its energy needs, the independents note. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message has to be that the administration will not let  
this industry collapse,'' Yates said.

	Eliot Spitzer said he was reacting to complaints from several  
people, especially minorities, who say they have little confidence 
in the police because of the way they've been treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the pre-eminent civil rights issue facing New York  
City right now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Rep Jose E. Serrano also said Thursday that the U.S.  
Justice Department has agreed to his request for a federal 
investigation into the NYPD's patterns, practices and apparent 
``lack of sensitivity to the diverse cultures, languages and needs 
of the city's immigrant groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he welcomed the state investigation.  
The police department pledged to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm young, I'm black, and I was stopped in the middle of the  
night,'' said Jackson Winters, a 22-year-old Harlem resident who 
attended a protest Thursday outside police headquarters decrying 
the police shooting of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I asked why I was being stopped and frisked, I was told I  
resembled a police sketch,'' Winters said. ``But I wasn't told 
anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights  
Coalition, said city officials have cause to worry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're really fearing this investigation because the  
attorney general has the staff and consulted with people in the 
civil rights community and police community who know where the 
bodies are buried and where the data is,'' Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer's office will ask the police department for data from  
the last five years relating to ``stop and frisks,'' interview 
officials and people who claim they were unreasonably stopped. 
Spitzer said he has a full range of remedies to choose from, 
including issuing recommendations for changes in the department and 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Improper searches are a common complaint made to the Civilian  
Complaint Review Board, which investigates alleged police 
misconduct. Last year, there were 565 such complaints, a 6 percent 
increase over 1997, when there were 531 complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the president of the NAACP, Kweisi Mfume, and several  
dozen demonstrators were arrested Thursday at the protest over the 
death of Diallo, who was hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired by four 
officers just steps away outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of sign-waving protesters outside police headquarters  
shouted ``Arrest the killer cops'' and ``No justice, no peace'' as 
two smaller groups, including Mfume, splintered off, marched 
shoulder-to-shoulder to the entrance and sat down. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said 59 people were charged with disorderly conduct.

<HEADLINE> Tandy Settles Hearing Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Radio Shack's parent company has settled a  
lawsuit brought by a hearing-impaired man who was assaulted by a 
store clerk because he couldn't understand what the clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tandy Corp. said Wednesday it also has agreed to launch a  
nationwide program to teach its employees how to better serve the 
needs of hearing-impaired customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gannon, 39, said he was attacked at a Radio Shack in  
suburban Virginia in August 1995 during a misunderstanding 
aggravated by his lack of hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon said the clerk ringing up the sale questioned his  
signature on his credit card receipt, but Gannon couldn't read the 
clerk's lips because the clerk wasn't facing him. 
</P>
<P>
	After Gannon impatiently snatched his receipt back, the clerk  
came around the counter, punched Gannon in the face and tackled him 
onto a glass display case. Gannon was cut and bruised. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio Shack fired the clerk, Donald M. Boseman, who was later  
convicted of assault, sentenced to 10 days in jail and fined 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon said he went to court after Tandy refused to apologize or  
help with his $10,000 medical bills. He also launched a picketing 
campaign outside area Radio Shack stores urging customers to 
boycott the electronics chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side would disclose the amount of the settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	Tandy officials said the Fort Worth, Texas-based company  
``regrets the experience of Mr. Gannon.''

<HEADLINE>  Huskies Resist Common Perception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Only Iowa -- and either Florida or Gonzaga -- stand  
in the way of Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun and his 
much-anticipated first trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun's Huskies are heavily favored to beat Iowa, and would be  
expected to beat the other two as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he and his players are assuming nothing, a wise decision  
considering the upsets in this year's NCAA tournament, and the fact 
that Calhoun has taken his team to the regional semifinals six 
other times in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I can taste it, though, per se,'' Calhoun said.  
``I'm just worried about Iowa. Hopefully our kids are going to be 
in the same frame of mind. If we can treat it like that, we're 
going to be a lot better off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, after blowout victories in the first two rounds,  
play the Hawkeyes in tonight's second game at America West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The closer he gets to the Final Four, the more Calhoun is  
reminded that he has never taken a team there. It's obviously an 
irritating subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've coached over 800-something games in college basketball,''  
he said, ``and I'm asked about four or five games. How fair is it? 
I didn't make the rules. We've won three or four Big East 
championship games against John Thompson, Jim Boeheim -- in Madison 
Square Garden on a Saturday night against St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those, I thought at the time, were big games. But I've been  
told since that there are bigger ones coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa has fed off the emotion surrounding the departure of coach  
Tom Davis, who is leaving -- not by his choice -- at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pour so much of your energy into practice and your  
workouts and trying to improve yourself because he gave you a shot 
to play big-time basketball,'' Iowa's Kent McCausland said. ``You 
know he's just a great guy and he puts everything into trying to 
make you a better player. For him to put that energy into you, you 
just want to give it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emotion propelled the Hawkeyes to an upset victory over  
Arkansas in the second round. But the players weren't exactly 
brimming with confidence about their chances against the deep, 
talented Huskies, who have lost just twice in 32 games and romped 
to two victories last week in Denver.. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing so well right now,'' McCausland said.  
``They're like a well-oiled machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he'd do the hokey-pokey if Iowa wins, the Hawkeyes'  
Jess Settles said, ``You'll see more than that. They're so good, I 
can't even imagine that happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa was able to use Davis' trademark pressing defense against  
Arkansas, despite the Razorbacks' quickness. But doing it against 
Connecticut is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that's our strength,'' El-Amin said. ``We like to play  
the up-tempo game, and we love for a team to press us. We think we 
can do a very good job against anybody's press because we have very 
good ball handlers out there at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody has dared press the Huskies much this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing. We've played 34 games and I don't think  
anybody's pressed us more than 10 possessions,'' Calhoun said. 
``New Mexico the other night threw on a press for about six 
possessions. We scored four out of six and the other times we got a 
good shot off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get pressed. But assuming Tom plays the way he always  
plays, which I think he will, we'll probably get pressed for 40 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kahlid El-Amin pulled hamstrings in practice two days ago, but  
should be at about 90 percent efficiency, Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Iowa, Connecticut All-American forward Richard  
Hamilton is at full strength. Hamilton has scored 49 points in the 
Huskies' NCAA victories over Texas-San Antonio (by 25) and New 
Mexico (by 22). 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, who has known Davis since the Iowa coach was at Boston  
College from 1977 to 1982, expects some sort of special defense 
geared to stopping Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``They try to take the star player out of the game,'' Calhoun  
said Wednesday. ``We feel we have enough complementary players to 
offset that. But that is something we will have to prove 
tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Inflation All but Disappears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inflation all but disappeared -- again -- in  
February, allowing increased wages to flow directly into more 
purchasing power for American workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Price Index edged 0.1 percent higher last month,  
for the third consecutive month, despite a few scattered trouble 
spots such as meat, oranges, school books and airline fares, the 
Labor Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	World economic weakness continued to deliver dividends to U.S.  
buyers, with prices falling for clothing, cars and computers, 
reflecting the influence of imports manufactured in countries with 
devalued currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the department said average weekly earnings for  
American workers, adjusted for inflation, jumped 0.7 percent in 
February, the biggest increase in 18 months. During the past year, 
they have risen 3.6 percent to $452.49, before inflation, and 1.9 
percent after inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increased imports have had a positive effect on the economy by  
keeping prices down, and real consumer purchasing power up,'' said 
economist Dave Huether of the National Association of 
Manufacturers. ``There is no inflation-creep in sight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted inflation rate for the first two months  
of the year was just 1.1 percent, compared with a 12-year low of 
1.6 percent for all of 1998. That means Federal Reserve 
policy-makers meeting March 30 probably will feel comfortable 
leaving short-term interest rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Low inflation will keep the Fed on hold throughout 1999,''  
said economist Stan Shipley of Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy costs were unchanged last month, with declines for fuel  
oil and gasoline offsetting increases for electricity and natural 
gas. Energy is down 5.7 percent from a year ago, but analysts 
warned recent big increases for crude oil mean prices at the pump 
will head higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll probably see a 3 percent to 4 percent increase in  
gasoline prices. ... It will be noticed but it won't be huge,'' 
said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, rose only 0.1 percent after a  
substantial 0.5 percent increase in January. Fruit costs went up, 
pushed by a 5.3 percent increase for oranges on top of a 24.1 
percent gain the previous month, reflecting a December freeze in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef rose 1.3 percent, the most in six years, and pork, 1.4  
percent. Still, pork remained 5.3 percent cheaper than a year ago 
and vegetable costs fell 3.4 percent, pulled down by a 20 percent 
drop for tomatoes, the most in almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components edged  
up 0.1 percent in February. Airline fares jumped 2.4 percent. 
Hospital services and textbooks rose, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Further airfare increases probably will appear in the March  
price index, due out next month. Over the weekend, the airline 
industry raised business fares about 1 percent and leisure fares by 
about 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, clothing costs fell 0.2 percent in February, and new  
cars and trucks, 0.3 percent. Computer prices declined 2.8 percent 
and were 34.6 percent lower than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, tobacco costs declined 1.4 percent but were still 33.5  
percent higher than a year earlier, reflecting tobacco companies' 
efforts to recoup the cost of multimillion-dollar liability 
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Says China Is World Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, making his  
first major foreign policy speech as a potential presidential 
candidate in 2000, suggested the Bush administration may have been 
too easy on China. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying it was time to ``speak some truths,'' Quayle said former  
President Bush and he believed encouraging trade ``with a minimum 
of sanctions and sanctimony'' would move China toward allowing more 
freedoms for its people while improving U.S.-China ties. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strategy didn't work and things have worsened under an  
even friendlier Clinton administration, Quayle said, according to a 
draft copy of a speech he was delivering today in Los Angeles to 
the World Affairs Council. The Associated Press obtained an advance 
copy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a worthy objective, but upon reflection it is  
clear to me that the Chinese took advantage of that opportunity,'' 
Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said the Bush administration was ``firm when we had to  
be,'' however, imposing stiff economic sanctions against China 
after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy 
demonstrators by Chinese military troops. Some sanctions remain in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush administration also used an annual international human  
rights convention in Geneva to condemn China -- something President 
Clinton refused to do last year for the first time since Tiananmen, 
Quayle said in a broad attack of the administration's China policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle criticized Clinton for removing the link between human  
rights and U.S. trade policy in 1994, saying the administration 
went further than Bush in promoting trade. Still, Bush granted 
China most-favored nation status to China every year, as has 
Clinton, allowing normal trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton has consistently supported granting China  
most-favored nation status, no matter how egregious the human 
rights abuses documented by his own State Department,'' Quayle 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle also slammed Vice President Al Gore, the likely 2000  
Democratic candidate, for blaming past Republican administrations 
for lax security at federal weapons labs that may have allowed 
China to steal nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``How dare Al Gore blame Presidents Reagan and Bush for  
negligence that clearly happened on his and President Clinton's 
watch,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and CIA since 1995 have been investigating possible  
espionage at the Los Alamos National Laboratories in the 1980s that 
may have helped modernize Chinese nuclear warheads. The Clinton 
administration has been accused of dragging its feet in responding 
to the allegations as U.S. officials just this week announced 
tighter lab security. Clinton on Thursday ordered an analysis of 
the security threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, who has visited China three times since leaving office  
and has met Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu 
Rongji, said he doesn't perceive China as a U.S. enemy and he 
believes that working with Beijing will promote development of a 
``free and prosperous China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the fall of the Soviet Union and the growing U.S.  
military technological advantage over other countries, among other 
events, have caused China to see the United States as a potential 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to recognize the emergence of a new China,'' Quayle  
said. ``China is much different than it was 10 or even five years 
ago. The new China is increasingly assertive and aggressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said the Clinton administration should move cautiously on  
making a deal with China to join the World Trade Organization, 
which would require Beijing to lower more tariffs on goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he said Taiwan, which China considers a renegade  
province, is ready to join the WTO now, although the Clinton 
administration doesn't want to anger by Beijing by making a deal 
with Taipei first.

<HEADLINE> 'Via Dolorosa' Is Masterful Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most playwrights reveal themselves through their  
work. David Hare is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	But the British writer, author of ``Plenty,'' ``Racing Demon,''  
``Skylight'' and other works, has done one better. He has put 
himself on stage in ``Via Dolorosa,'' a masterful meditative 
monologue on his 1997 visit to Israel and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a fascinating journey, not only for what it reveals about  
Hare, but for what it says about a situation that has defied 
solutions for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
	At Broadway's Booth Theater, Hare paints his picture from scores  
of interviews with Jews and Palestinians alike. It is a fragmented, 
often surreal portrait, made up of contradicting ideas hurled at 
him with a ferocity that could make one despair for any resolution 
of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Hare, a gangly gentleman casually dressed in a  
white shirt and charcoal gray slacks, is no actor. ``I've always 
tried to get Judi Dench to do this sort of thing,'' he says of the 
profession he abandoned at age 15 after a school production of ``A 
Man for All Seasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet his slow, almost stiff delivery contributes to the  
effectiveness of the evening. His speech is deliberate, carefully 
measured as he moves across the nearly barren stage of the Booth, 
which is filled only with a wooden playing area, two desks and two 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The author reveals that he finally has discovered the subject of  
his many plays (there are more than a score). Faith, the need for 
belief, dominates most of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israel is, first and foremost, a cause ... the cause being a  
patch of land ... lying like a small brown anchovy set down on a 
school atlas,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause has created intractable conflict, battles that are  
championed by an astonishing parade of characters in ``Via 
Dolorosa.'' The author re-creates some vivid interviews in his 
90-minute lecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Hare starts in Israel, visiting settlers in Hebron, a Jewish  
settlement surrounded by Arabs. He stays with Danny and Sarah 
Weiss, American Jews who came to Israel to reconnect with their 
spiritual values. As for their living on disputed land, Danny 
contends Israel must have roots. ``It has to be the place where 
life goes right down deep into the soil,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	That soil is claimed just as defiantly by the Palestinians,  
although there are as many shades of opinion among the Arabs as 
there are in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	Haider Abdel Shafi, the most popular politician in Gaza,  
declares, ``Our most urgent task is to reform ourselves.'' Shafi 
laments the lack of principles in his society and criticizes Yasser 
Arafat for being ``a man who buys peoples' allegiance,'' creating a 
corrupt society. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone has an opinion, including Hare who celebrates the  
argumentative environments in which he finds himself. He discovers 
joy in the fact that people stand for something, unlike folks in 
his own country. 
</P>
<P>
	Hare chides British Prime Minister Tony Blair for being ``all  
things to all men'' and thus not letting people know what he really 
stands for. 
</P>
<P>
	The title of the evening comes from Hare's need to walk the Via  
Dolorosa in Jerusalem, ``to follow the Stations of the Cross, which 
represent the steps on Christ's journey to his death.'' The 
playwright is bewildered by the narrow unimpressive walkway, its

shell suits and baseball caps.''

	He wants more, but gradually realizes it is not the stones that  
are important but the ideas they represent that matter, ideas that 
have led to the life-and-death struggle in the Middle East.

	Hare has become something of a growth industry on Broadway. Last  
year, New York saw ``The Judas Kiss,'' the author's drama about 
Oscar Wilde starring Liam Neeson. Earlier this season, Nicole 
Kidman, riding waves of publicity, sold out in ``The Blue Room.'' 
Next month could be the best of all, Dench, returning to Broadway 
after more than 30 years, in ``Amy's View.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, we have the playwright in the flesh, courtesy of  
Lincoln Center Theater. ``Via Dolorosa'' makes a plea for 
understanding or, at the least, attempting to understand. It is a 
lively, literate evening that like the rest of Hare's plays, 
celebrates belief, even if no agreement is in sight on what belief 
is the one true faith.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Need Hasek for Playoff Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres avoided losing much  
ground without Dominik Hasek. Now they're looking forward to going 
places with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is close to returning from a strained groin that has  
sidelined him since Feb. 17. The goalie has resumed practicing with 
the team and might play Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a good practice,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said  
Wednesday. ``He went a little bit longer today, a few more shots. I 
thought at times he was still a little tentative, but he got 
through it OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said Hasek might start against the New York Rangers on the  
first stop of the team's four-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today I could go even harder from post to post, more splits,''  
Hasek said. ``I hope it feels the same tomorrow. I'll have one more 
practice and I hope I'll play in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres did their part to get Hasek in shape when Curtis  
Brown took a blistering slap shot that dented the goalie's face 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are loose after wins over Boston and the New York  
Islanders. They are seventh in the Eastern Conference playoff race, 
within two points of sixth-place Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a logjam in the middle of our conference,'' Sabres  
captain Michael Peca said. ``You put some wins together and you're 
going to put yourself in a better position in the playoffs and 
possibly get home-ice advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are in the thick of the playoff race despite their  
recent struggles. They tumbled from the top of the conference after 
a strong start and looked at last Thursday's loss to Tampa Bay as 
their season low. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe for awhile there we weren't doing the small things, and  
sometimes it's tough to even notice what those are,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as teams make a playoff push, Tuesday's trade deadline has  
players around the league a little edgy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a nervous time,'' Ruff said. ``Any time there's a  
possibility that players might get moved, there's some anxiety 
around the team. There's nothing you can do about it. You worry 
about how you play and your effort on the ice, and that's all you 
can control really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of Stu Barnes, sent from Pittsburgh in a recent  
trade for Matthew Barnaby, has provided a lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a lot of chances and he creates a lot of chances for  
guys around him, so he's a welcome addition to this team,'' said 
Barnes' linemate Geoff Sanderson, who is trying to break out of a 
scoring slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting the chance play a lot, which is something that I  
wasn't getting in Pittsburgh this year,'' Barnes said. ``I'm 
playing center now, which is a little bit different, too, because 
I'm handling the puck a little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The return of Hasek would be another boost, even though Dwayne  
Roloson and rookie Martin Biron have played well. ``No disrespect 
to Dwayne or Marty, but when you're adding the best goaltender that 
possibly ever played the game, you've got to feel better about your 
chances,'' Peca said.

<HEADLINE> House Seeks To Restructure FCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long-distance companies would have to post  
information about current rates on the Internet under a plan 
federal regulators are considering. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint say they already voluntarily  
provide information about rates on their corporate Web sites. But 
the FCC plan, expected to be adopted today, would force the 
companies to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would have to provide information on domestic  
rates -- including the terms and conditions of service -- in a 
``timely manner and updated regularly,'' said FCC officials, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	If rates or services are changed, that would have to be posted,  
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the FCC would not specify when information must be  
posted, how often it must be updated or where it would appear on 
the companies' corporate Web sites, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's requirement would cover a wide range of services, from  
domestic long-distance calls to calling card calls to directory 
assistance. It would not include information on international 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's expected requirement goes hand-in-hand with a 1996  
order, which never took effect, intended to free long-distance 
companies from having to file federal tariffs outlining their rates 
or service changes to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, long-distance companies continue to file that  
information to the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's expected action today would not affect that 1996  
order, which is being challenged by MCI WorldCom and others at a 
federal court here. But the public disclosure requirement would not 
take effect until the court resolves the larger matter involving 
federal tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's Washington  
office, said the public disclosure requirement would help make 
consumers more aware of rate changes. But he noted it would not 
help those who do not own computers. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the FCC also was expected to require long-distance  
companies to post current rate information in some of their 
offices, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T said they are not opposed to the public  
disclosure, but repeated their opposition to getting rid of federal 
tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the century-old doctrine, long-distance companies may  
charge only the rates for services they have filed with the FCC. 
The tariff trumps all other agreements with customers, verbal or 
otherwise. Some critics contend the arrangement lets companies slip 
rate changes by customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T contend that in the absence of  
tariffs, companies would have to enter into some other contract 
with customers each time rates or service were changed. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make it harder for them to offer new discount plans  
or promotions featuring free or cheap calls, they note. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kimmelman and other critics said that consumers would be  
better served by posting rate information online than by putting it 
in tariffs, which the average long-distance customer does not see. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming the court upholds the FCC on its decision to eliminate  
tariffs, officials contemplate that long-distance companies 
voluntarily would move toward a more ``contractual relationship'' 
with customers -- along the lines of credit card companies who 
provide notice in the mail when terms change. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the FCC was expected:  
</P>
<P>
	-- To tighten rules making it easier for companies to install  
equipment at major local phone companies' central offices to 
provide high-speed Internet and data services. The ruling would 
help companies including Covad Communications and NorthPoint 
Communications, which provide connections letting businesses access 
information from computers at speeds considerably faster than 
regular phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Earmark a portion of the airwaves for satellite delivery of  
telephone and data services. Nine companies, including Iridium, 
Globalstar and Boeing are interested.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Team Eyes Starr Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Attempting to put Kenneth Starr's  
tactics on trial, lawyers for Susan McDougal plan to call the 
Whitewater prosecutor's top deputy to the witness stand. Starr's 
office demanded today that the defense first spell out in detail 
what questions will be asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office made the demand in a letter after Starr deputy  
Hickman Ewing was subpoenaed in the courtroom where Mrs. McDougal 
is on try for criminal contempt and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter to Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said federal  
regulations require that when a U.S. attorney is called to testify, 
the defense must disclose ahead of time what information is being 
sought. Geragos showed the letter to reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already told them what we wanted to talk to Ewing about,''  
Geragos said. ``Now they want more detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard will have to decide what level  
of specificity Geragos must provide to the court before 
questioning. The judge could decide not to allow some questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony from defense witnesses was expected to start today,  
beginning with Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing watched from the rear of the courtroom Wednesday as the  
prosecution closed its case by summoning three former members of 
the Whitewater grand jury before whom Mrs. McDougal had refused to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the day, Bill Henley, Mrs. McDougal's brother,  
reached through a crowd of reporters and handed Ewing a subpoena, 
saying, ``Hick, I've got something for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt really good,'' Bill Henley said a few moments later.  
``It's about time we got to ask them a few questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said later he didn't think prosecutors would try to block  
his appearance at the behest of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to hide,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he hinted at a possible legal dispute ahead over how far  
afield Mrs. McDougal's lawyers should be allowed to range in 
questioning the Whitewater prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos would not rule out summoning Starr as well. ``First let  
me deal with Hick Ewing,'' he said. ``One at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making a prosecutor a defense witness was the second unusual  
turn of the day. The first was putting on the witness stand three 
members of the grand jury that indicted Mrs. McDougal after she 
refused to answer their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said that in 25 years as a federal prosecutor he had never  
seen grand jurors testify at a criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jury foreman John Washam testified that the death of Mrs.  
McDougal's former husband, James McDougal, in 1998 made her 
testimony even more crucial than it had been before. 
</P>
<P>
	With James McDougal's death, ``one link of the chain was gone''  
of people who knew what went on in Whitewater, said Washam. 
McDougal had been Starr's chief cooperating witness in his 
investigation of the Whitewater land deal in which the Clintons and 
McDougals were partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos focused on the fact that Starr's office didn't tell  
grand jurors James McDougal had changed his story a number of 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't you have wanted to hear that?'' Geragos asked grand  
juror Marsha High. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' she responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Geragos argues that his client didn't want to answer questions  
because overzealous prosecutors were trying to force her to give 
false testimony against the president and first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand juror Jennifer Castleberry said she believed prosecutors  
were simply trying to gather the facts, not go after the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say they wanted to ask Mrs. McDougal about her  
Whitewater business partnership with the Clintons, including a 
$27,600 loan for the land development taken out in Bill Clinton's 
name from the savings and loan owned at the time by the McDougals. 
The president has testified he never borrowed money from the S&AMP;L.

<HEADLINE> Joe Torre Undergoes Prostate Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre is  
recovering from what doctors call a successful removal of his 
cancerous prostate gland earlier today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 1-2-hour operation was performed at Barnes-Jewish hospital  
by Dr. William Catalona. Catalona is internationally known for his 
ability to remove prostate glands without seriously damaging nerves 
around the gland. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say the 58-year-old Torre is expected to be hospitalized  
for three or four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona said he removed the prostate gland and lymph nodes from  
Torre and that the operation went well, with minimal apparent 
damage to surrounding nerves or tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre disclosed the illness last week and has taken leave from  
the team for the surgery and an undisclosed period of recovery.

<HEADLINE> Senate Saves Ind. Counsel Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Thursday killed a Democratic  
effort to cut off funding for most independent counsels by year's 
end, sparing Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the amendment, which lost on a voice vote, made  
their aims clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a mistake to let the Starr investigation continue  
indefinitely, without any ending date,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa. ``Mr. Starr has had long enough to investigate Whitewater 
and Monica Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Watergate-inspired independent counsel law is set to expire  
June 30 unless Congress renews it. But with three months left and 
no consensus for how to fix the law, there is little sentiment for 
saving it, especially after investigations of Republican and 
Democratic presidents have irritated lawmakers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic proposal, which supporters tried to add to a  
spending bill, would have cut off federal money for Starr's 
investigation of Clinton and for four other independent counsels on 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The matters under investigation would have reverted to the  
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Letting the law lapse would allow the ongoing investigations to  
continue to their conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	With no Republican co-sponsors, the measure had little chance of  
passing. Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Fred Thompson, 
R-Tenn., called the amendment ``a very very bad idea,'' and pointed 
out that even Attorney General Janet Reno opposed the Democratic 
proposal a day earlier. The attorney general, he said, can 
terminate investigations without direction from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should not be interjecting itself to terminate  
investigations in midstream when there is already a mechanism,'' to 
do that if warranted, Thompson told the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the amendment crossed party lines. Sen. Joe  
Lieberman, the ranking Democrat on Thompson's committee, said the 
measure would set a bad precedent for congressional interference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This amendment is not just a preemptive attack on the  
statute...it's what might be called a personal attack on the most 
controversial independent counsels,'' said Lieberman, D-Conn.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Seizes Lung Transplant Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLY HILL, Fla. (AP) -- A 4-year-old girl who went home from the  
hospital last week after undergoing a double lung transplant has 
been taken by child-welfare agents who say her guardians were 
neglecting her medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Department of Children and Families refused  
Thursday to discuss specifics of Megan Jones' case, citing state 
confidentially laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Both guardians are 65 years old. One of them, Carole LaBarr,  
blasted the agency's actions. ``They came in here like the 
Gestapo,'' she said. ``It is a case of the system run amok.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Megan was taken from the LaBarr home near Daytona Beach late  
Wednesday, just a week after returning home from the Dec. 26 
double-lung transplant operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The state maintains that Mrs. LaBarr failed to follow a complex  
list of steps outlined in Megan's medication plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. LaBarr and her husband, Jim, had taken care of the girl, a  
distant relative, since July 1996 when the diaper-clad 2-year-old 
weighing just 18 pounds was brought to them by the birth mother. 
They helped care for Megan at the hospital during her 10-week 
recovery after the transplant surgery.

<HEADLINE> Train Crash a Nightmare for Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Sheena Dowe was an ambitious young  
college student and single mother, visiting family in Chicago 
during spring break. 
</P>
<P>
	June Bonnin was happily married and running a charming country  
inn in the South when she brought her daughter, granddaughter and 
friends to Chicago on a shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowe, 22, and Bonnin, 46, lived totally different lives, but  
both were on Amtrak's City of New Orleans when it slammed into a 
semitrailer loaded with steel rods at a railroad crossing. Both 
were killed, along with nine others. 
</P>
<P>
	Their acts of courage, even as their own lives were being cut  
short, emerged Thursday, three days after the collision. 
</P>
<P>
	All the fatalities occurred in the sleeper car. Dowe had taken a  
friend's son to the bathroom in the car when she felt the jolt of 
the train slamming into the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	She yelled at the boy to go to his mother, relatives said. Her  
friend, the boy and Dowe's own 1 1/2-year-old son survived, but Dowe 
never made it out of the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowe was scheduled to graduate from Tougaloo College in  
Mississippi in December and wanted to become a brain surgeon ``to 
try to help people,'' recalled her grandmother, Bessie Mae Dowe. 
</P>
<P>
	She came to the crash site 50 miles south of Chicago, but left  
with little solace. ``There's nothing I can say or I can do to 
bring her back,'' Ms. Dowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bonnin was supervising a slumber party for the young girls  
in the sleeping car. She saved her daughter by passing her through 
a window to a cook from the dining car, according to her husband, 
Max. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Bonnin, who is from Nesbit, Miss., near Memphis, said he is  
relying on his religious beliefs to comfort him after his wife's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bonnin's 11-year-old granddaughter also died in the crash,  
as did a pair of sisters, 10 and 8 years old, who were family 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bonnins' 8-year-old daughter Ashley survived, however, and  
is still hospitalized after having her leg amputated below the 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real example of what faith can do,'' Bonnin said.  
``I'm surprised at the sense of peace we all have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley has become a symbol of survival. Toys, dolls and balloons  
and visitors have poured into the hospital where she is staying. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a little girl to experience that type of love, I think, is  
in her mind reconfirming what her mom was always telling her about 
what human kindness is all about,'' Bonnin said. ``Now she's seeing 
a perfect example of it.''

<HEADLINE> Debate Opens Over HMO Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Differences over how far Congress should go to  
protect patient rights are on full display as debate begins in 
earnest over regulating HMOs and other managed health care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Outnumbered Democrats are sure to lose on every major point as  
legislation works its way through the Senate Health, Education, 
Labor and Pension Committee, which began debate Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the GOP bill, expected to win early  
committee approval, ``falls far short'' of what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today represents the first test of whether this new Congress  
is serious about providing Americans with a strong enforceable 
patients' bill of rights to assure quality health care,'' Clinton 
said in a statement. ``I urge the committee to do everything it can 
to pass this test and give Americans the health care protections 
they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was already looking past the  
committee vote, promising reporters: ``We'll win on the floor of 
the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill would offer a mix of popular protections, including  
the right to reasonable emergency room payments, direct access to 
gynecologists for women and prohibition of much-maligned, but 
virtually nonexistent ``gag rules'' that prevent doctors from 
discussing all options with their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	But those protections would be given only to 48 million  
Americans covered by federally regulated health insurance plans. 
Republicans noted that other patients are covered by state 
regulations, and numerous states have adopted many of the same 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the GOP bill would cover all Americans in  
employer-sponsored health plans -- about 75 million -- with a key 
provision that would give patients the right to take disputes over 
payments to an independent group of experts outside the health 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say all Americans should be covered by all of the  
bill's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats also want to give people new rights to sue their  
health plans over bad decisions and to require plans to pay for 
what doctors determine to be ``medically necessary'' care. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., argued that more  
lawsuits are not needed and emphasized that the GOP bill would add 
hardly anything to health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal,'' Jeffords said, ``is to give Americans the  
protections they want and need in a package they can afford and 
that we can enact.''

<HEADLINE> Judge: Pay Cuba Shootdown Victims </HEADLINE>

	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge Thursday ordered that more than  
$6.2 million owed to Cuba by U.S. telephone companies be paid 
instead to the families of three Cuban-Americans killed when their 
small planes were shot down by Cuban jets in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Judge James Lawrence King means direct phone  
service between the United States and Cuba through several U.S. 
carriers will remain severed for now, though some calls were making 
it through. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department wouldn't comment on the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	The families won a $187 million judgment against Cuba and the  
Cuban Air Force in 1997 but were unable to collect because 
President Clinton waived a new anti-terrorism law that would have 
allowed them to receive the blocked assets. The State Department 
also objected. 
</P>
<P>
	King ruled that Clinton didn't have the authority to waive the  
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice has been served,'' said Mario de la Pena, the father  
of one of the killed pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very glad that we can make (Cuban President Fidel)  
Castro pay for his crime, although this is not the final result of 
seeking true justice -- which is putting him and a bunch of henchmen 
he has behind bars,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's telephone company, Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba  
S.A., stopped most direct service to the United States on Feb. 25 
because U.S. phone companies have withheld payments since Dec. 29, 
pending King's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. carriers rerouted calls to the island, apparently through  
third countries or onto Sprint telephone lines, which were not 
affected. AT&AMP;T said it will continue the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The families received $300,000 each in November 1996 that the  
U.S. government plucked from frozen Cuban accounts. The government 
called it a humanitarian gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest payment of the new judgment -- $4.1 million -- must  
come from AT&AMP;T, King said. MCI International Inc. owes about $1 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for both companies refused comment on the order.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are reviewing the court's opinion and are considering our  
options to appeal this ruling,'' AT&AMP;T said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members of the Miami-based group Brothers to the Rescue  
were searching for Cuban refugees on rafts when Cuban MiGs shot 
down two private planes in the Florida Straits on Feb. 24, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men were U.S. citizens, making their families eligible to  
sue under U.S. law. The fourth man killed wasn't a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
	King called the shootdown ``a murderous act of terrorism by Cuba  
against United States citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba said the two planes were over Cuban waters when they were  
shot down. A U.S. Customs report released shortly after the 
shooting said the lead Cessna had flown three nautical miles into 
Cuban airspace, but that it and the other plane were shot down over 
international waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Basulto, co-founder of Brothers to the Rescue, said the  
Clinton administration knew of a potential shootdown beforehand so 
has been reluctant to back the families or seek an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They allowed it to happen. Castro had a green light for the  
shootdown of our airplanes,'' Basulto said. ``Thereby, Clinton's 
administration is not going to pursue this any further.''

<HEADLINE> Superhacker Signs Plea Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Mitnick, a computer vandal whose  
exploits made him the FBI's most wanted hacker until he was 
arrested four years ago, has signed a plea agreement reportedly 
calling for one more year behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Randolph, Mitnick's court-appointed attorney, confirmed  
Thursday a deal had been struck this week. He would not discuss 
details of the agreement, which has been filed under seal for 
review by U.S. District Judge Marianna Pfaelzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to say anything that would influence the court's  
decision,'' he said. ``We are cautiously optimistic that the court 
will accept the agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office,  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea deal was reported earlier in Thursday's Los Angeles  
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick, 35, had been scheduled to go on trial April 20 on  
charges of computer and wire fraud. However, the judge could set a 
hearing for another date in order to accept the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would require Mitnick to remain behind bars for  
another year and stay away from computers for at least three years 
after his release, according to a source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick's formal sentence would be about five years  
imprisonment, but he would be credited with time served. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been accused of damaging computers, stealing millions of  
dollars in software from high-tech companies and using stolen 
computer passwords. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his arrest in 1995 in North Carolina, Mitnick was  
identified by the FBI as the agency's most wanted hacker and as a 
``computer terrorist'' by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick's exploits made him a legend among many other hackers. A  
Web site dedicated to freeing Mitnick counts -- to the second -- the 
time he has spent in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mitnick supporters hacked into a New York Times Web  
page to post pro-Mitnick statements and criticize Times reporter 
John Markoff, who chronicled Mitnick's arrest in the book 
``TakeDown.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings, Moon Might Reunite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Warren Moon, once the starting  
quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings, could come back to the club 
as the backup to Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings haven't really started their search for a  
replacement for Brad Johnson, who was traded to the Washington 
Redskins at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But offensive coordinator Ray Sherman and head coach Dennis  
Green both include Moon in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to consider him,'' Sherman said. ``He knows our  
system, and he's been here. That's something we'll look into it. 
I'd be interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Warren and I talk from time to time, and I think he'd be  
interested as well. We're not going to close any doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moon is a friend of Vikings owner Red McCombs, dating from his  
playing days in Houston. Moon spent 1994-96 with the Vikings. He 
played the past two seasons with Seattle but was released last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon still wants to compete for a starting job somewhere, but  
his opportunities appear to be dwindling.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Hill Is Comfortable Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- There's nothing like zipping a few fastballs  
past batters to convince a long-ailing pitcher that he's back in 
form. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anaheim Angels' Ken Hill, who struggled through elbow and  
shoulder problems the last two years, looked like the Ken Hill of 
old as he struck out five and allowed one run on four hits in four 
innings against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt comfortable, and I haven't felt comfortable the last  
couple of years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill pitched in pain early last season, had surgery to remove  
bone chips and spurs from his right elbow in June and didn't return 
to the Angels until Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hurt in April of last year and I still pitched,'' Hill  
recalled. ``I can take so much pain, but it was unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who was 16-10 with a 3.63 ERA with Texas in 1996, was  
acquired by the Angels in a 1997 trade that sent catcher Jim 
Leyritz and infielder Robert Sasser to the Rangers in late July. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who strained his right shoulder in May of that year and  
seemed to be bothered by it later, was 4-4 with Anaheim that 
season, and 9-6 in 19 appearances last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, he feels healthy again and believes he is throwing  
as well as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``My splitter got to moving like it used to. Location is still  
the big thing. I've got to be more aggressive, establish my 
fastball in and out,'' he said after the Angels' 13-7 victory over 
the Rockies on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly but surely, he's regaining the confidence to challenge  
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good to throw the fastball 90-92 mph, the splitter,  
the slider,'' said Hill, 33. ``When you're not able to throw 
inside, the hitters are all over the plate and can reach anything 
you throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, being so hurt, when I needed to go inside, I  
couldn't. It's a good feeling, knowing I can reach out and get it 
over there (inside). It lets hitters know that when I'm on the 
mound, I'm coming after them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hill begins to feel comfortable, so does Anaheim manager  
Terry Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw the ball very well,'' Collins said after Hill's  
performance against the Rockies. ``He's getting the ball in and 
out. It's been a really positive spring training for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to stop worrying about his health. He's healthy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hill is eager to begin the regular season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I could go 7-8 innings now, and I think I'll be able  
to throw 100 pitches out of camp,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Smog May Damage Kids' Lungs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Children who grow up breathing dirty air may  
suffer lung damage into adulthood, according to early results of a 
long-term study of the effects of Southern California smog. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Southern California also found  
that girls may be at a higher risk than boys of suffering the ill 
effects from air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary results of the 10-year study were published  
today in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists monitored the air in 12 California communities for  
ozone, nitrogen dioxide, microscopic airborne particles and acid 
vapor. Researchers also monitored the breathing capacity of about 
5,000 children from grades four to 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The children filled out questionnaires about their daily  
activities and surroundings. They also were asked to blow into a 
machine that measured their lung capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Boys showed a lower breathing capacity if they lived in  
communities with high ozone levels and spent a lot of time 
outdoors, said research leader John Peters, professor of preventive 
medicine at the USC School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls who spent more time outdoors showed an even higher  
percentage of diminished breathing capacity, the study found. 
Nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter appeared to have the most 
effect on girls. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists aren't sure why girls are more at risk, Peters  
said, especially since most indicated they spent less time outdoors 
than boys, and thus presumably had less exposure to smog. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were taken from the first year of the $15 million  
study, 1993-94. Researchers will continue tracking the children 
through high school, and more comprehensive results were expected 
in 2003, Peters said.

<HEADLINE> Stem Cell Research Supported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seventy-three prominent scientists, including  
67 Nobel prize winners, signed a letter supporting plans by the 
National Institutes of Health to consider financing research with 
stem cells that originated from human embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, to be published Friday in the journal Science, said  
that despite the opposition of more than 70 members of Congress, 
the NIH position on human stem cell research ``is both laudable and 
forward-thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cell research, the scientists said, could be used to treat  
heart disease and brain disorders and could ``perhaps even cure'' 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter is the latest volley across a growing chasm of  
disagreement separating medical researchers who say stem cell 
research offers great promise from members of Congress who believe 
the research is immoral because it starts with aborted human 
embryos. The lawmakers support a ban on federal funding of human 
embryo research and say that ban includes stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Pluripotent stem cells are the master cells from which all body  
tissue develops. During gestation, the cells change into the 210 
types of cells that make up the human body. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately funded researchers recently took cells from aborted or  
unused embryos no longer needed for invitro fertilization and they 
grew colonies of pluripotent stem cells. In some experiments, the 
cells differentiated into other types of cells, supporting the 
theory that heart, brain and other tissue could be grown from such 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the promise of stem cell research, Dr. Harold Varmus,  
director of the National Institutes of Health, proposed in January 
that the agency consider funding such studies. He said the research 
may not violate the federal ban because it would use existing stem 
cell colonies and not involve working directly with embryos. An NIH 
committee is being selected to evaluate the ethical concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In their letter in Science, the 73 scientists said Varmus' plan  
``succeeds in protecting the sanctity of human life without 
impeding biomedical research that could be profoundly important to 
the understanding and treatment of human disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells, the letter said, could be used to make ``a long list  
of cells and tissues that could be used for transplantation.'' New 
cells could be injected to restore ailing hearts, or to correct 
damage by Parkinson's disease, or to replace failed 
insulin-producing cells, and, thus, cure diabetes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Congress blocks this research, the letter said, ``these  
tremendous scientific and medical benefits may never become 
available to the patients who so desperately need them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In reply, the leader of an antiabortion group in Congress, Rep.  
Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., said: ``Some scientists resent any 
moral limits on their use of taxpayer funds for harmful 
experiments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I reject the claim that a degree in science -- even a Nobel  
Prize in science -- makes scientists our supreme arbiters of 
morality and human dignity,'' said Smith, who leads a group of 70 
Congress members who have written two letters opposing Varmus' 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressman said medical experimenters have committed  
``horrific abuses'' in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the scientists, Smith said: ``Americans will not  
endorse lethal experiments on infants just because you claim it 
would be useful. We should not start down that road now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who signed the scientists' letter were Nobel  
laureates Dr. Robert F. Furchgott of State University of New York, 
1998 winner for discovery the action of nitric oxide in the body; 
Eric F. Wieschaus of Princeton, 1995 winner for studies of genes in 
developing fetuses; Joseph E. Murray of Harvard, 1991 winner for 
studies on cell and organ transplantation, and James D. Watson of 
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, co-discoverer in 1953 of the DNA 
molecule.

<HEADLINE> Cities Celebrate St. Patrick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Led by actress Maureen O'Hara, the 238th annual  
St. Patrick's Day Parade filled Fifth Avenue with some 200,000 
marchers Wednesday as people here and across the country saluted 
Irish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish-born Ms. O'Hara, the parade's grand marshal and star  
of such movies as ``The Quiet Man,'' celebrated the Irish 
connection ``that I feel so strongly in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irish-accented Boston held its St. Patrick's Day Parade on  
Sunday, but Wednesday was another opportunity for celebration as 
government workers got the day off for Evacuation Day, the 
anniversary of the day when the British left Boston Harbor in 1775 
and Loyalists fled the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people filled downtown Kansas City, Mo., for a  
parade that included an Elvis impersonator in a green 
rhinestone-studded suit, a Dixieland Jazz band and an Old West 
stagecoach. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, celebrated a  
noon Mass in honor of St. Patrick, and Guinness flowed freely in 
crowded bars with names like Dooley's Tavern, The Purple Shamrock 
and Tiernan's. 
</P>
<P>
	In Savannah, Ga., a beautiful spring day led to a  
higher-than-average attendance for the city's 175th St. Patrick's 
Day parade that wound for nearly four hours through the city's 
famed squares. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York crowds also enjoyed high temperatures, nearing 60  
degrees at one point, after a chilly weekend filled with rain and 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's too many firemen here. If you had a fire, there  
wouldn't be anyone to put it out,'' said Tom Walsh, 31, visiting 
along with fellow London bus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw lots of people with green hair,'' said Susan Kelly, 53,  
of Alexandria, Va., who wore a shamrock scarf, ``and people wearing 
`Kiss me, I'm Irish' shirts who didn't look Irish at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was mostly peaceful, although police made three  
arrests for unruly behavior. A 20-year-old man was arrested after a 
fight in Central Park in which another man was stabbed in the 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade also was marked by the annual protest by the Irish  
Lesbian &AMP; Gay Organization, which has repeatedly been barred from 
marching under its own banner by the parade sponsor, the Ancient 
Order of Hibernians. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen members of the gay group were arrested for disorderly  
conduct during a pre-parade demonstration on 42nd Street.

<HEADLINE> Gore Rips GOP Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today ripped a $1.74  
trillion budget plan offered by Republicans, calling it a rehash of 
bad economic policies that pushed the country into recession a 
decade ago. ``We don't need more Republican retronomics,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the White House to a group of black newspaper  
publishers, Gore said he was disappointed that the House Budget 
Committee approved a plan which he said ``puts risky tax schemes 
first'' ahead of Social Security overhauls. He said that is a 
budgetary tactic straight out of the 1980s -- one blamed in part for 
a recession that did not turn around until Clinton's first budget 
was approved in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried this kind of budget before, and it nearly wrecked  
the United States. It drove our economy into the ditch,'' Gore 
said. ``I appeal to the Republican leadership to drop this 
nostalgia for the recessions of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House panel's 22-18 vote along party lines Wednesday night  
capped a day of political maneuvering on both sides of the Capitol 
as Democrats unsuccessfully sought to put off tax cuts until both 
Social Security and Medicare are overhauled. Republicans argued 
that projected budget surpluses will make it possible to accomplish 
many things. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think what we're going to do is take away from the tax  
cut -- we're not going to support that,'' said Rep. John Kasich, 
R-Ohio, chairman of the House committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate budgets envision unspecified tax cuts of  
$15 billion next year and $778 billion over the next decade. Other 
rejected proposals would have shifted some of that money into 
spending programs Democrats favor, such as Head Start or hiring 
more teachers to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the tax cuts, the plans crafted by Kasich and Senate  
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., would set aside 
$1.8 trillion in projected surpluses over the next decade to ensure 
Social Security's solvency when the huge baby boom generation 
begins retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares to $1.3 trillion over 10 years for Social Security  
in President Clinton's proposed budget, but Clinton's plan also 
would lock up part of the remaining surplus to keep Medicare 
afloat. The popular health program for senior citizens faces a 
financial crunch beginning in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican budgets, which set overall tax and spending  
limits that are filled in by later congressional action, also would 
boost defense spending to $289 billion for fiscal 2000, $9 billion 
more than this year and $8 billion more than Clinton proposed. They 
would also increase spending for primary and secondary schools by 
more than $2 billion next year, and provide more for some 
agriculture and veterans' programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they could afford those increases while  
honoring a tight spending limit for next year set by the 1997 
budget-balancing pact. Neither committee provided much detail about 
which programs they would cut to heed that spending ceiling, but 
both chairmen said they could do it. 
</P>
<P>
	But that also imposes some limits on spending priorities.  
Kasich, for example, agreed with the thrust of a Democratic 
amendment to boost spending for research at the National Institutes 
of Health but said the proposal cost too much.

	``We can't be all things to all people,'' Kasich said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Democrats said that to afford the GOP's proposed  
increases, the remaining programs affected by the spending limits 
would face 12 percent reductions. That could mean cuts in popular 
programs such as Head Start, food inspections and the FBI, they 
said. 
</P>

	``If it were an over-the-counter drug, it would have to say,  
'Warning: Could be harmful to elderly, children and working 
families,''' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said of 
the GOP plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Clinton administration threatened to veto a  
GOP proposal to set aside Social Security's vast surpluses over the 
next decade -- before baby boomers start retiring -- for debt 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	That proposal, which will move separately from the budget  
resolution, would require that Social Security surpluses be used to 
buy down the debt. Doing otherwise would require votes of 60 of the 
100 senators, a tough hurdle to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Democratic leaders, Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin said the plan could hinder the government from issuing new 
debt if it needed to, threatening its credit rating and perhaps 
requiring it to stop paying Social Security benefits.

<HEADLINE> Senior PGA Return to Roots  </HEADLINE>

	ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) -- Had there been no money, no  
television cameras, no legacy on the line, the four men involved 
still would have remembered it as a wonderful afternoon -- and 
evening -- of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, the amazing show put on by Tommy Bolt, Roberto  
De Vicenzo, Art Wall and the late Julius Boros 20 years ago in the 
Legends of Golf tournament was not only exciting, it was important. 
</P>
<P>
	Their six-hole playoff, one seen by a good-sized TV audience for  
a few, magical hours on a Sunday evening, stands as the critical 
moment in the formation of the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had everything to do with the tour starting, in my  
estimation,'' Bolt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour, now with 42 tournaments and more than $51 million  
annually in prize money, returns to its roots Friday, with the 
first round in the two-man, best-ball format at the World Golf 
Village Slammer and Squire Course. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champions are Charles Coody and Dale Douglass, who  
needed a two-hole playoff last year to become rare 60-something 
winners on this increasingly competitive, 50-and-over tour. 
</P>
<P>
	That playoff brought back faint memories of 1979 at Onion Creek  
Country Club, when Bolt, De Vicenzo, Wall and Boros combined for 11 
birdies -- five from De Vicenzo himself -- over a six-hole playoff 
that lasted well into the twilight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were making birdies,'' Bolt said. ``I holed one, then I'd  
point my finger at Roberto and say, `Top that one.' He'd hole his 
putt on top of it and point his finger back at me. We had a lot of 
fun playing that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boros and De Vicenzo eventually split the $70,000 first prize,  
but the real reward was the attention the entire foursome drew to 
seniors golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Their playoff ran so long, it preempted the nightly news and the  
beginning of prime time through most markets in the East, something 
rarely heard of even these days for a golf tournament. It drew 
nearly double the TV audience of a normal PGA event and sent the 
message that, yes, these old guys could still put on quite a show. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Raphael, the creator of the Legends of Golf, said he was  
overwhelmed by the reaction when he walked into one of his favorite 
New York restaurants the next afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all people were talking about,'' he said. ``They were  
saying, `Did you see that finish? Did you see them putting and 
playing?' I thought it was going to be the greatest thing to happen 
to these senior players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The timing was perfect. A year later, Arnold Palmer turned 50,  
and the Senior Tour was up and running with two events and a total 
of $250,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its best-ball format and the fact that it's an  
unofficial event, the Legends has drifted back somewhat in 
prominence on the increasingly crowded schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's a nice break from the grind, and an opportunity to  
see some players that longtime golf fans may not have seen in 
action in a while. Players like Bob Goalby and Sam Snead will 
compete in the over-70 Demaret Division, a 36-hole competition 
played over the first two days. 
</P>
<P>
	De Vicenzo, Wall and Bolt will all be back to play and celebrate  
the 20th anniversary of the tournament that started it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the tour started, I thought maybe they would have 12 to  
15 tournaments at the very most,'' Wall said. ``I had no idea it 
could grow into this. It totally boggles my mind.''
