<HEADLINE> Turkey to Import Russian Oil, Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has decided to import
Russian oil and natural gas, local newspaper Daily News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following a meeting of energy officials
from the two countries in Ankara early this week. The two sides
agreed in principle to sign a series of contracts for the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement in principle, Turkey is expected to buy
about 10 billion cubic meters of Russian gas.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish-Russian deal is attacked by some Turkish
lobbyists, who are allegedly backed by companies of the United
States involved in oil exploitation in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Russian gas is 70 percent more expensive than that provided by
U.S. firms, the lobbyists said, adding that the deal will make
Turkey dependent on Russian energy.
</P>
<P>
But Turkish energy policy-makers said that cooperation with
Russia in this field is favorable to Turkey, describing the
criticism as "baseless."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Air Force
commander-in-chief Pyotr Deinekin on Friday ordered Air Force
flights to suspend for a week, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Deinekin was quoted as saying that his decision is connected
with "serious air crashes" in December.
</P>
<P>
An air crash happened at the Naryan-Mar airport on December 11
when a military transport plane An-12 rammed a sanitary helicopter
Mi-8, killing eight people with three seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Not before less than a week on December 6, another air disaster
of a plane An-124 Ruslan occurred in the eastern city of Irkutsk,
which crashed into a block of flats, killing 68 people.
</P>
<P>
Deinekin noted that it is necessary to examine the situation,
carry out studies to inspect planes and then to move further.
</P>
<P>
He said the order is applicable only to flights of the Air
Force and does not cover air defense aviation and marine aviation,
which are necessary for national security and also within the
system of the Russian Defense Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France Disagree Over EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A dispute between Britain
and France over the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is dragging
on the feet of other major issues European Union (EU) leaders are
expected to discuss at the two-day summit beginning here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders were set to make a deal over the issue before
they could move on to talk about other issues.
</P>
<P>
France has been leading a drive in setting up a Euro council
which will group exclusively EU member countries that are likely
to launch the EMU in January 1999. The council is supposed to
oversee the EU's future economic and monetary policy under a
single currency.
</P>
<P>
It maintains that the council will play a key role in deepening
political ties between EMU members before the EU admits new
members from central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain hates to be ignored in the EU's discussion of
future monetary and economic policy.
</P>
<P>
"There can't be small clubs that try and take over the running
of the European Union," British Prime Minister Tony Blair was
quoted by media reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
After assuring it will not join the EMU before 2002, Britain is
being backed up on the issue by Sweden, Denmark and Greece, the
three other EU members which expect to stay out of the EMU in
1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Prime Minister Robert
Kocharyan ended his six-day visit here on Friday after talking
with French President Jacques Chirac about the dispute over
High-Karabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Chirac appealed for Kocharyan to accept the proposal by the
Minsk Group, a group of mediators chaired by the United States,
Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
The group proposes a withdrawal of Armenian troops from the
one-fifth of the Azerbaijani territory they occupy, the return of
Azerbaijani refugees, and the lifting of blockade by Azerbaijan
upon Armenia and Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
Armenia and Azerbaijan are involved in a protracted conflict
over Karabakh, an Armenia-populated enclave which broke away from
Azerbaijan in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The mainly Moslem Azeris have been at odds with the Christian
Armenians for centuries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Continue to Decrease in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. producer prices
decreased for the eighth time this year as computers, gasoline and
coffee became cheaper in November, the labor Department reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
Prices paid by wholesalers and others for finished goods fell a
seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent, following three monthly increases
in the Producer Price Index. The index dropped for consecutive
seven months from January through July, which constitutes a
post-World War II record.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of the year, prices have fallen at
an annual rate of 1.2 percent, compared with a 2.8 percent
increase for all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
November's producer price decline was attributed mainly to a
3.1 percent drop in gasoline and broad-based decreases.
</P>
<P>
Food prices inched 0.1 percent lower, helped by drops of 11
percent for vegetables, 8.6 percent for fresh fruit and 5.1
percent for coffee, the biggest decline in more than six years.
</P>
<P>
Cauliflower fell 70 percent; broccoli, 55.1 percent; lettuce,
46 percent; citrus fruit, 29.2 percent, and cantaloupes, 23.2
percent. The cost of beef, poultry and fish also declined, but the
price of fresh eggs shot up 30.6 percent, the highest rate for one
month.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices fell 0.8 percent. A 5.4 percent increase in
heating oil, the most in 19 months, and a 3.8 percent rise in
natural gas partly offset declines for gasoline and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sector, prices sank by
0.1 percent. For the first 11 months of the year, these so-called
core prices, which are considered a better gauge of underlying
goods inflation,_ have risen at an annual rate of just 0.2
percent, down from 0.6 percent for all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In November, auto prices declined 0.6 percent; light trucks,
0.8 percent, and computers, 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cost of intermediate goods rose 0.2 percent but crude goods
shot up 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, intermediate level prices still were 0.1 percent lower
than a year earlier and crude was off 0.9 percent. Examples of the
three processing stages are bread and clothing for finished, flour
and cloth for intermediate and wheat and cotton for crude.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said
business inventories rose 0.4 percent in October while sales edged
0.1 percent lower. If continued, that trend could mean a
production slowdown. The report includes retailers, wholesalers
and manufacturers.

<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- London Heathrow's Terminal One
partially reopened this afternoon for flights after a major fire
broke out early in the morning in a burger bar.
</P>
<P>
The terminal, which mainly handles domestic flights, is now
open for all flights after departures began at 3 pm this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But airport officials said passengers using the airport can
still expect severe delays.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out around 4:40 am, swept through the
main terminal, causing extensive damage and bringing chaos to the
world's busiest international airport.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Heathrow airport, Mark Phillips, said later
this morning the fire had been extinguished but travel chaos
lasted for hours longer.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of injuries, but officials said damage
appeared to be considerable.
</P>
<P>
British Airways Plc cancelled 100 outgoing flights and 120
incoming. Three inbound flights were diverted to Stansted
northeast of London and to Southampton in southern England.
</P>
<P>
Heathrow's other three terminals remained open but flights were
subject to delays and an estimated 30,000 people had seen their
flights disrupted by mid-morning.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Stockmarket on Downward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- As a cloud of uncertainty
continues to hang over Zimbabwe's economy, the stockmarket, the
second largest one in Africa, ended the week on a downward trend
when the industrial index shed 173 points to close at 7456 today.
</P>
<P>
Even President Robert Mugabe's assurance in
which he said the current slump in the economy was "a temporary
setback", failed to restore investor confidence. This has been
the negative outlook on the market during the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's state of the nation address on Tuesday contended that
the problems bedevilling the economy were temporary and would
soon subside.
</P>
<P>
The scrapping of tax increases by the government this week,
following outright rejection by workers, members of parliament
and those of the ruling ZANU (PF) also did nothing to arrest the
slide.
</P>
<P>
There has been more selling than buying in the market against
a backdrop of falling share prices since November 14 when the
Zimbabwe Dollar dropped sharply against major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the Zimbabwe Dollar has prompted investors
to shift from the stock exchange to money markets which offer
high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mining index also dropped on Friday losing 22
points to close at 424.

MOGADISHU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 26 people were
today confirmed dead in the heavy fighting between rival
militiamen within the supporters of Somali faction leader Ali
Mahdi Mohamed in North Mogadishu on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Situation in North Mogadishu remains tense despite the
relative calmness on Thursday night and today after the heavy
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed militiamen on technical vehicles were seen
consolidating their defensive posotions in the hostile Manobolyo
and Sana junctions where new checkpoints were erected despite
efforts by clan elders, politicians and businessmen to contain
and prevent further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The rival militiamen were watching indifferently a peace march
carried out by hundreds of people mainly women, children and the
elderly today.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were shouting anti-fighting
words and carried placards read "No More Fighting, No More
Bloodshed, No More Civil Strife" and etc.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, sporadic gunfire could be heard in several
parts in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
South Mogadishu's politicians, Muslim scholars and the other
factions have made appeals of ceasefire and called on the North
Mogadishu militia commanders to contain the hostility.
</P>
<P>
This new round of hostility is taking place at a time when all
Somali faction leaders are meeting in Egypt to finalize the
seven-year long civil war and the political deadlock in their
country.

JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of Israeli soldiers
were detained today by Palestinian security forces in southern
Gaza Strip, Israeli state television reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldiers were detained because of a mistaken

report.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli armed patrol in a military jeep took a wrong turn at
the Deir el-Balah junction in southern Gaza Strip, and entered the
Palestinian-controlled region.
</P>
<P>
They were stopped and detained for interrogation by Palestinian
security forces. Senior officers of both sides held hour-long
negotiations to secure the release of the Israeli soldiers.
</P>

The incident is believed to be the first since the Palestinians
began to exercise autonomy in Gaza Strip and some areas in the

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Confirms Coming Poll Is His Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, 74 and in power since 1978, confirmed in public
today that his running for another five-year term in the December
29 poll will be his last.
</P>
<P>
"This is my last term," Moi told thousands of people crowded
in Nairobi's Nyayo Stadium celebrating Kenya's 34th anniversary
of independence, 17 days before the second multi-party general
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Thus cleared any suspicions clouding Kenyans' mind that Moi,
if he is re-elected as widely expected, might intend to seek the
top place again in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moi called on all political parties to "carry out
their campaigns in a responsible and mature manner" so that
peaceful, free and fair elections can be ensured.
</P>
<P>
"The coming elections will be a test of our maturity and
integrity as a nation" and "crucial to the stability of our
nation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on everyone seeking an elective position in the
forthcoming general elections to "accept the people's verdict
with dignity and in the spirit of unity and patriotism".
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 candidates now are busy campaigning for the
presidency, the most crowded presidential race since Kenya
declared independence in early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Moi is the sole candidate of the ruling Kenya African National
Union (KANU) party and is effectively taking advantages of the
division of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
His powerful rivals include Mwai Kibaki of Democratic Party of
Kenya, Wamalwa Kijana of FORD-Kenya, Raila Odinga of National
Development Pary of Kenya, Charity Ngilu of Social Democratic
Party and Martin Shikuku of FORD-Asili.
</P>
<P>
A presidential aspirant can be qualified as he (she) gets the
mandatory 1,000 signatures of supporters but to be a legal Kenyan
president needs no less than 25 percent votes in five out of the
country's eight provinces under Kenya's current constitution.

MAPUTO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Swazi government has
denied that it has tried to annex the southern part of Mozambique
into its territory, Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi
said today.
</P>
<P>
According to Mocumbi, the denial was made by the Swazi Foreign
Minister in a document presented to the Mozambican authorities.

The document said that "as fraternal and friendly neighbors,
Swaziland and Mozambique have been maintaining good cooperation
relations and their border line will remain unchanged."

About two weeks ago, there were reports in two Swazi
newspapers that Swazi Prince Khuzulwandle, Chairman of the Swazi

Mozambique, including Maputo, into its territory.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican prime minister noted that the claims by the
Swazi parliament members are not helpful for promoting bilateral
relations. He said the Swazi government keeps a distance from
these members of parliament.

<HEADLINE> EU Likely to Announce ECB Chief Next March: Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
likely to announce its nomination of the head of the new European
Central Bank (ECB) in late March of 1998 before it decides on
which countries to join the planned economic and monetary union
(EMU), it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Many observers to the ongoing EU summit in Luxembourg made the
forecast after a row over the issue simmered at the start of the
two-day summit on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The issue of nomination was expected to be raised in the
margins of the meeting. Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said late on
Thursday that he planned to raise the issue with other EU leaders
attending the summit.
</P>
<P>
But he later told reporters that there would be "no formal
solution" since the issue was not on the agenda, adding that he
did not want the issue to overshadow the EU's talks on
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
France and the Netherlands have been at odds with each other
over the issue since both countries have put forward high-profile
central bankers for the post.
</P>
<P>
Wim Duisenberg, former Dutch central bank chief and current
president of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), has been
widely regarded as the most likely candidate to win the post.
</P>
<P>
In November, France recommended its own candidate for the key
post of EU institutions, its own central bank chief Jean-Claude
Trichet, who said Thursday that it was up to EU leaders to decide
on who should get the job.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Finnish central bank chief Sirkka
Hamalainen was chosen as a compromise choice for the post.

LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Royal Mail plans to
issue a set of stamps commemorating Princess Diana, a Royal mail
spokesman said today.
</P>

"We have every intention of issuing the stamps, but no date has

</P>
<P>
Princess Diana died in a car incident with her boyfriend on

<P>
The mail planned to issue the stamps in September but was put

ATHENS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Bulgarian Vice
President Todorov Kavaldjiev today met with Greek Parliament
President Apostolos Kaklamanis to discuss ways of expanding
cooperation between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Kavaldjiev, who is in Athens to attend a

<HEADLINE> Canada's Natives Win on Land Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's native people have a
constitutional right to own their lands and to use them as they
wish, the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled.
</P>
<P>
The decision applies to natives who have not signed away their
lands in treaties and its impacts will be felt in parts of
Atlantic Canada and most of British Columbia province, reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous decision released on Thursday, the Supreme Court
overturned a ruling of B.C. court that dismissed native claims to
ownership of a 58,000-square-kilometres swatch of land in
northwest B.C..
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court concluded that a new trial is necessary and
that the judge should take into account oral histories of the
natives in the new trial.
</P>
<P>
Both the federal and provincial governments have expressed a
willingness to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
"It's a complete victory for us," said the lawyer representing
the B.C natives in their land-claim fight.
</P>
<P>
"The decision restores a measure of faith in the rule of law,"
said Chief Joe Mathias, a native spokesman in the province.
</P>
<P>
The ruling has increased the power of the natives in
land-claims negotiations, and has direct implications for Canada's
native lands not governed by a treaty, the reports noted.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Party Threatens to Return Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Party of Nigeria
(DPN) has threatened to return its registration certificate to
the government in a protest over alleged manipulation of the
state legislative election last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prince Pat Abii, the party's national publicity official was
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying in Abuja today
that the party is now under pressure from its state chairmen to
boycott the rest of the transition program.
</P>
<P>
The state chairmen were in Abuja to attend an emergency
National Executive Council meeting started on Wednesday to
discuss the party's performance during the election.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the chairmen have even threatened to quit the party
if their demands are not met by the National Executive Council,"
said Pat Abii.
</P>
<P>
The DPN emerged as the second largest party during last
Saturday's election, securing about 151 out of a total of 989
state legislative seats, according to incomplete results
announced by the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The party was complaining of manipulation of the election in
favor of the United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP), according to
the report. The UNCP was leading all the other four parties with
about 500 seats.

<HEADLINE> UK Publishes Late Payment of Commercial Debts Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) - The British government has
published a Bill to introduce a statutory right for businesses to
claim interest on the late payment of commercial debts.
</P>
<P>
The Bill is a key element in its comprehensive package of
measures developed in partnership with businesses, their
representative organizations and the public sector to improve
Britain's payment problem.
</P>
<P>
Announcing publication of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts
(Interest) Bill, Small Firms Minister Barbara Roche said on
Thursday that the purpose of the Bill is to help businesses tackle
the problem of late payment.
</P>
<P>
"Late payment hits small firms hardest; it stifles growth,
disrupts cash-flow and ultimately hits profits," Roche added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister, to give specific help to small
firms, the right to claim interest will be phased in three stages:
</P>
<P>
- The first stage brings the right to small businesses to use
against all large enterprises, including public sector
organizations.
</P>
<P>
- The right will then be extended, after a period, probably two
years, for use by small businesses against all enterprises and the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
- Finally, the right will be extended, again after a probable
period of two years, to cover all enterprises and the public
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Government wants to encourage businesses to agree their own
contractual terms giving a right to interest if bills are paid
late.
</P>
<P>
However, provisions are included in the Bill to prevent
"contracting out" of the legislation by dominant customers setting
excessively low rates of interest or long payment times in their
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Promote Trade Ties with Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish Minister
of State Mehmet Batalli said today the Turkish government has a
keen interest in enhancing bilateral relations with Ethiopia,
particularly in areas of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Batalli made the
remarks during talks here with an Ethiopian delegation led by
Kassahun Ayele, minister of trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
Turkish exports to Ethiopia do not reflect the real potential
of the Turkish economy in terms of both diversity and value,
Batalli said, adding Turkish imports from Ethiopia are also
limited to raw materials.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two sides to strive to expand their volume of
trade, variety of trade items and joint investments.
</P>
<P>
Kassahun on his part said that Ethiopia and Turkey enjoy long
standing historical and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
"These ties have been further strengthened when the two sides
signed in 1993 an agreement on trade, economic and technical
cooperation in Turkey," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian minister added that measures have also been
taken in various areas of the economy with a view to empowering
and encouraging the private sector and attracting foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member Turkish delegation led by Batalli arrived here
early today for a seven-day visit in Ethiopia. The Turkish guests
will hold talks with pertinent offices during their stay in the
east African country.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNMIBH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) for a further
period of 12 months.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said progress had
been made in implementing the General Framework Agreement, much
of it in areas of immediate concern of the UNMIBH operation: the
inauguration of joint Bosnia - Croat police forces in the two
mixed cantons of the Federal; the initiation of a comprehensive
police restructuring program in the Republika Srpska; and the
appointment of a multi-ethnic police leadership in the contested
city of Brcko.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said police restructuring had to be
accompanied by reform of the judicial system in general. It was
clear that reforming the police, the judicial system and the
prisons must be addressed in an integrated way in order to create
a law and order environment that was fair and non-discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said another area that deserved increased
attention was the loss of revenue to the state through economic
crimes. UNMIBH was ready to begin training entity police forces
in the detection of financial crime, smuggling and corruption,
and to assist in setting up special anti-corruption units.
</P>
<P>
Annan said much had been achieved, but much also remained
to be done. The United Nations was ready to continue to play its
part. In order to carry out the tasks suggested above, he
recommended to extend the mandate of UNMIBH for a further 12 months.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament to Probe Neo-Nazi Trend in Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's parliament today
decided to launch a special probe into a series of neo-Nazi
scandals that have seriously damaged the image of the German armed
forces, the Bundeswehr.
</P>
<P>
The probe, insisted by the German opposition parties, the
Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, will start next
January with the establishment of a parliamentary investigation
committee.
</P>
<P>
The move was prompted mainly by a major scandal a week ago
after a convicted neo-Nazi, Manfred Roeder, was found to have been
invited to deliver a speech in 1995 to a German military academy
training top officers.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, a number of video tapes have also been made
public over past few months depicting neo-Nazi behavior of German
soldiers ranging from giving the Nazi salute to staging mock
executions and rapes.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, whose resignation was
demanded by the SPD last week, has insisted that these cases were
isolated incidents and did not prove that rightist extremism was
rampant within the army.
</P>
<P>
He also accused some leftwing German media today of working
together with Roeder in a deliberate campaign against the army.
</P>
<P>
German opposition parties today stressed that the parliamentary
investigation was meant to ensure the exclusion of neo-Nazis from
the army and would help restore its image.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Ease Tanzania's Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) has started an emergency operation to deliver relief food
to over 1.4 million people facing food shortage in Tanzania,
after poor performance of both short and long rains last season.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued today by WFP country director
Irene Lacy, the relief food worth 20.7 billion Shillings (about
33 million U.S. Dollars) will be distributed to 48 worst affected
districts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 69,000 tons of maize and 7,000 tons of pulses are
expected to be distributed under a nine-month operation. The
first batch of 300 tons of maize which arrived at the end of last
month in Dodoma is expected to benefit 212,000 people there.
</P>
<P>
The move, according to Lacy, is in response to Tanzanian
President B. Mkapa's latest appeal to the international community
to assist in the procurement of relief food. The president has
declared a state of food emergency in the 1997/98 season.
</P>
<P>
The program, which involves 11 non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), UNICEF and local communities, will give priority to the
most needy, and the rest accordingly, Lacy added.
</P>
<P>
Food distribution will first start in the regions of Dodoma,
Singida, Shinyanga, Mara, Tabora and Arusha, which are in
critical situation. The most seriously affected villages will be
reached this month, said Lacy.
</P>
<P>
However, the WFP country director expressed fears that the
current rains which have cut off a number of villages from major
roads will make their food relief a tough job. But she said all
efforts will be made to ensure the program goes on as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
She pledged that WFP will try to meet members of the United
Nations, NGOs and donor community over the coming weeks to help
the starved.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Peace Process Remains Stranded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The peace process in Sierra
Leone has become shaky as fresh fightings broke out between the
military junta and traditional Kamajors hunter militias who are
loyal to President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah ousted in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued today, the Kamajors said it had to
launch a fresh round of attack against the junta since the
military had failed to implement the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Anyone working in the interest of the junta will be considered
as target, the British Broadcasting Corporation quoted the
release as saying.
</P>
<P>
A Kamajor field commander reportedly accused the junta of
killing a number of people in a town in southeast Sierra Leone in
its attack earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The entire town was burnt down before the junta forces were
repelled. The junta forces also attacked a town at the border
with Liberia on Thursday, killing 15 people, including women and
children.
</P>
<P>
But in Freetown, junta spokesman Aliu Kamara said today it was
the Kamajors who were attacking and killing people as well as
damaging properties in the southeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the Nigerian troops in the west African peace
keeping force (ECOMOG) for the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The junta has been opposed to the dominance of Nigerians in
ECOMOG and the disarmament of the national army since the signing
of a peace accord in Conakry, Guinea last October.
</P>
<P>
A number of talks have since failed to work out modalities to
implement the peace plan, under which the junta agrees to step
down in April next year.
</P>
<P>
While Kamara said the military would assist the disarmament of
other combatants in the country rather than its troops, he
insisted that Nigeria should not be part of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament, originally slated for the period between
December 1 and 31 this year, would begin when Nigerian stands
neutral in the peace process, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll not disarm on schedule if Nigeria keeps bombarding our
innocent civilians and keeps harassing our people with their
jets," Kamara noted.

29 to expel U.S. weapons inspectors in the UNSCOM, has been eased
after Russia's mediation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq agreed on November 21 to allow U.N. weapon inspectors to
return to Baghdad to resume their work, but has been refusing to
grant access to weapon inspectors to presidential palaces on the
ground that it would infringe Iraq's national security,
sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
Bulter said he would hold technical talks with the Iraqi side
Sunday, in hopes that the two sides could agree on a further
"special, intensified" program of work in some key weapon areas.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the issue of access will top his agenda in
discussions with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz Monday,
stressing that "we should be able to go anywhere, anytime."
</P>
<P>
Butler said that he would see if they could find a way to
inspect sensitive sites without infringing Iraq's "legitimate
concerns for national security, sovereignty and dignity."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait will be lifted only after the UNSCOM submits to the
Security Council a bill of health certifying that Iraq has
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he would leave Baghdad Tuesday and report to the
Security council the results of his talks with Iraqi government
officials.

<HEADLINE> US Working on Big Aid Package to Congo (K): </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said in Kinshasa today the U.S. is working on
a U.S. $35-40 million aid package for Democratic Congo, a report
from the Congolese capital said.
</P>
<P>
The money would come on top of a U.S. $10 million contribution
Albright announced Tuesday that Washington would grant the former
Zaire through a World Bank trust fund, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Albright, speaking after talks with Congolese President
Laurent Kabila, said the U.S. government would prepare the
package jointly with Congress, which has demanded assurances that
Kabila is respecting democracy and human rights before sending
aid.
</P>
<P>
She said the money would be used for infrastructure, health
care, water projects and rebuilding a bridge destroyed by the
forces of ousted President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. top diplomat, on a seven-nation African tour, arrived
in Kinshasa from Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
While in Kigali Thursday, she pledged U.S. support to Rwanda,
saying the country's future was critical to the region.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, Albright Slammed hardline Hutu rebels for failing to
choose peace and national unity.
</P>
<P>
However, she stressed the need for justice in Rwanda and "the
importance of providing security without harm to non-combatants"
-- referring to civilians killed in the army's counter-insurgency
operations.
</P>
<P>
Albright noted that Washington plans to release US $3.9
million in aid for army demobilization, the education of
repatriated refugees and the promotion of democracy and
reconciliation in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official will leave Kinshasa for Luanda of Angola
later today.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OIC Leaders Agree to Disagree at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Islamic leaders found that
the approach of "agree to disagree" can best serve their
objectives of closing ranks and enhancing solidarity among
themselves at the just-concluded eighth summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Almost without difficulty, the leaders adopted reams of
resolutions on a variety of political, economic and cultural
issues facing the Islamic nations, and a "Tehran Declaration"
pledging promotion of Islamic unity, condemning Israel's
occupation of Palestinian and Arab lands, and hoping for the
formation of an Islamic common market.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the approach worked and resulted in
reconciliation which enabled the smooth proceeding of the
three-day summit that, among other things, brought together
Iran, a die-hard against the Middle East peace process, and some
U.S. allies, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by delegates from 54 OIC members,
including more than 30 heads of state, vice presidents, crown
princes and prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
It exhibited solidarity by denouncing Israel's continued
occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories including
Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan Heights and South Lebanon, and
calling for the liberation of all occupied lands and restoration
of Palestinian rights to self-determination and to an
independent and sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Divisions still exist. Iran, for example, stuck fast to its
opposition to dealing with Israel, which it called
"untrustworthy," and further cited the current deadlock on the
peace process as a proof of the correctness of its stance. Many
Arab countries, on the other hand, pinned their hopes of a
lasting and complete peace on, and committed themselves to, the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
They did agree to disagree. The declaration went through
without even mentioning the peace process. Nor did it urge OIC
members to reconsider, or simply stop dealing with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On other issues, the leaders fully supported a peaceful
solution to the Afghan conflict, and expressed solidarity with
Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and called for rejection
of the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
They called for safeguarding the Islamic values and principles,
the revival of Islamic civilization, and its peaceful
coexistence with other civilizations.
</P>
<P>
The leaders emphasized that the goal of establishment of an
Islamic common market constitutes a significant step toward
strengthening Islamic solidarity and enhancing the share of
Islamic world in global trade. However, the embryonic ambitious
and trans-regional project lacks step-by-step planning and will
take a long time to realize.
</P>
<P>
The leaders voiced indignation over the U.S. D'Amato Law,
which aimed to tighten screws of sanctions against Iran and
Libya, and termed it an imposition of U.S. domestic law over
international laws.
</P>
<P>
Their differences over who should host the next summit in
2000 prolonged the concluding session for about five hours. But
they finally decided to award it to Qatar, which alienated
itself from a majority of Arab countries by its insistence in
holding the U.S.-brokered Arab-Israeli economic conference last
month despite strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
Iran emerged victoriously in hosting the December 9-11
summit. The massive turnout in Tehran, in contrast to the scarce
attendance in Doha last month, prompted Iranian leadership to
claim that the country has broken the U.S.-imposed isolation since
its 1979 victory of Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
More striking is the fact that Iran used this opportunity to
improve ties with estranged Arab neighbors and even long-time
foes. It agreed with Iraq on resolving bilateral problems,
consented with Turkey to return their recalled ambassadors to
each other's capitals and undertook with Egypt and Saudi Arabia
to better relations.
</P>
<P>
All these conform to the philosophy of "agree to disagree"
as said by Iran's President Mohammad Khatami. Having achieved
this consensus, what awaits ahead for the OIC is how to
translate their objectives contained in the declaration and
resolutions into well-oriented actions. This time, it is not
without difficulty.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Changes Central Bank Law in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's parliament today
approved changes in the country's central bank law in preparation
for the 1999 launch of the single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the powerful German central bank, the
Bundesbank, will no longer run a special German national monetary
policy up from July 1998 when the European central bank is due to
be founded to run a common monetary policy for the whole Euro
area.
</P>
<P>
Traditional bank business conducted by the Bundesbank will also
be subject to common guidelines and regulations of the European
central bank.
</P>
<P>
However, during the transition period until 2002, when the Euro
bank notes and coins are due to actually enter into circulation,
the Bundesbank will still retain the right to issue the German
mark bank notes.
</P>
<P>
The Euro is due to be launched in January 1, 1999. Countries to
join the single currency club will be selected in May next year
based on their 1997 economic data, including budget deficit and
overall national debt.
</P>
<P>
The legal amendment made by the German parliament today is
necessary to incorporate the country's national central bank into
the Euro central bank system.

<HEADLINE> 14 Arrested for Sectarian Clashes in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian police have arrest 14
people since a sectarian clash began in the northwestern town of
Wa three days ago, a police source said today.
</P>
<P>
Late on Wednesday in Wa, 500 km northwest of the capital
Accra, members of the Tijaniya Moslem sect attacked the property
of the Al-Sunni sect after provoking preachings by the latter
group, the source said.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday morning, seven houses, a Mosque, a junior
secondary school, an Arabic school, kiosks and stores belonging
to the Al-Sunni were completely burnt down and their contents
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The car of the regional minister and a police jeep were also
damaged, the source said, quoted by a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place despite warning shot by the police while
troops of the army's airborne force have been deployed in the
town, where they have restored order, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The regional security was due to meet today to discuss the
growing religious intolerance in the area.
</P>
<P>
The clash in Wa follows the killing in Tamale, 220 km southeast of
Wa, of an Al-Sunni sect member as he attempted to cut the electricity
of a Tijaniya ceremony, where married women were belly-dancing, an
activity the Al-Sunni frown upon, it said.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Former Warlord Accepts New Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Alhaji Kromah, one of the
former key warlords in the Liberian civil war, said today he has
accepted the offer by President Charles Taylor to lead the newly
constituted National Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
Kromah, an arch rival of Taylor's in the war and currently in
the Guinean capital of Conakry, said he had a telephone talk with
the president on the peace process in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
As citizens in the country are committed to voluntary programs
during the peace process, he has to accept the offer, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to Monrovia some time from now to begin to work
out the modalities" for the new job, Kromah said, adding that his
earliest schedule is before Christmas or early January next year.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's government is now upset by last week's murder of an
opposition member of parliament and three members of his family.
</P>
<P>
Four men, including Taylor's aide-de-camp, have been arrested
in connection with the killing of Samuel Dokie.
</P>
<P>
But the murder case seems to have destroyed the confidence of
some Liberians in the country's democratic process.
</P>
<P>
It is yet to be seen what will be brought about when Kromah is
back in Monrovia to chair the new commission.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Hints at Changes for Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan today hinted that the United Nations might make some
changes for the oil-for-food deal it signed with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We are reviewing the scheme and we are going to make it more
effective and efficient," said Annan while addressing officials of
the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) at its
headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he will submit a report to the U.N. Security
Council in January, which he said will review all aspects of the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
He will propose to allow Iraq to sell more oil, so that it can
buy more food and medicine to ease the hardship of its people
who are under U.N.-imposed sanctions since 1990 following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, which was carried out in December 1996,
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six
months.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here today from Iranian capital Tehran, where he
attended the eighth summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conference. Upon arrival, he flew by helicopter to UNIKOM
headquarters near the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he refuted Arab countries' criticism that "the
U.N. is starving" the Iraqis, which he said he has heard during
the Islamic summit.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world "must understand the (U.N. Security) Council has
never intended to punish the Iraqi population. ... If the U.N.
wants to punish the Iraqi population, we would not have even
introduced the oil-for-food scheme."
</P>
<P>
On the mission of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in Iraq,
Annan demanded Iraq cooperate with the chief inspector, Richard
Butler, to allow the arms inspectors to search "wherever they have
reasons to believe the materials are being hidden."
</P>
<P>
Iraq, citing national security and sovereignty, bans the
inspectors from entering the presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they will cooperate with the inspectors so they will
see the light at the end of the Tunnel," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. will not lift the sanctions on Iraq until the UNSCOM
has verified that Iraq has complied with the orders issued by the
U.N. in 1991 after the Gulf War to eliminate its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Funeral Held for Jordanian Executed in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A funeral was held today in the
Irbid Governorate for one of the four Jordanians who were
executed Monday by Iraqi authority on charge of smuggling car
spare parts, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of King Hussein, local officials attended the
funeral of Walid Mohammed Enseirat in his hometown, some 70
kilometers north of Amman, and conveyed the king's condolences to
Enseirat's family members.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein today condemned the execution of the four
Jordanians by Iraq for the first time since Monday, saying that
the "blood of the Jordanians had never been cheap."
</P>
<P>
Jordan expelled seven Iraqi diplomats Wednesday in retaliation
for the execution and recalled its Charge D'Affaires in Baghdad
Adel Sweidan back home for consultation. It warned that more
actions will be taken.
</P>
<P>
The four Jordanians were seized in January 1996 on charge of
smuggling car spare parts worth 620 Jordanian dinars (about 878
U.S. dollars). They were released on bail in March this year,
then called back for trial in April and sentenced to death in
September.
</P>
<P>
Car parts and many other goods are in short supply in Iraq,
which has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iraq will execute a fifth Jordanian named
Ammar Ghaleb Shehabeddine soon. There are now over 100
Jordanian prisoners serving their sentences in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq used to be firm allies before and during the
Gulf crisis. But after that, the bilateral ties suffered a
setback as Jordan was eager to distance itself away from Iraq to
end international alienation.
</P>
<P>
However, the ties have been picking up in recent years as Iraq
began to provide the kingdom with more oil at discount prices and
kept increasing the volume of imports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a main supplier of humanitarian goods such as food
and medicine for Baghdad under the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food
deal.

<HEADLINE> Self-Confidence Important: Indonesian Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite the importance of
external support, self-confidence of Southeast Asian countries was
crucial to solving their recent financial problems, Indonesian
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence building becomes the core of the issue, and this is
not merely an economic issue," he said in his keynote address to
the Conference on Tigers in Transition, dealing with the financial
situation mainly in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"To restore confidence, we should begin at home, although the
support from international communities is highly important," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Clean your desk and put your house in order, otherwise the
guest won't come in," he added.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the lessons drawn from the recent financial crisis
in Southeast Asia, the minister said he thought the crisis was
triggered and worsened by fragility in the financial sector and
heavy foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Short-term borrowing by this region and South Korea was
estimated at 200 billion U.S. dollars and it was unknown how much
more was needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another lesson, he said, was that the fundamental microeconomy
at the corporate level became more important as the private sector
was the true market player.
</P>
<P>
He thought the role of the market forces was more dominant
though the role of the government was important.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater transparency of the financial system and
continued comprehensive economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the external factor, the minister said the global
money market should have a global safety net to minimize the
destabilizing factors which might emerge from huge transactions.
</P>
<P>
The daily volume of global monetary transaction has reached as
high as 2 trillion dollars whose holders and players are pension
funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and commercial banks,
among others.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects Criticism by OIC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has reservations on
two resolutions passed at the eighth summit of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference (OIC), a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Ahat Andican, who just returned from
Tehran following the OIC summit, said that Turkey can not accept
the two resolutions because they failed to reflect the truth,
according to Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which concluded Thursday, adopted the two
resolutions which criticized Turkey's cross-border incursion in
northern Iraq and its military cooperation with Israel without
giving specific names.
</P>
<P>
Andican stated that Turkey's military operation in northern
Iraq is aimed at wiping out camps of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), which has been fighting Ankara for a
Kurdish state since 1984.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our operations there so long as the PKK
uses the authority vaccum in the region to threaten Turkey's
border security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders have repeatedly announced that Turkey fully
respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq within
the framework of international law.
</P>
<P>
On the quickly growing Turco-Israeli military ties, Andican
said that the military cooperation between the two countries is an
issue of bilateral nature.
</P>
<P>
"As we said many times earlier, the Turkish-Israeli
cooperation is by no means directed at a third country," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish-Israeli cooperation in military and defense industry
fields has witnessed a quick expansion, provoking harsh criticism
from Muslim countries, especially Arab nations, in the region.
</P>
<P>
Andican also denied press reports that Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel left the summit one day earlier due to his
dissatisfaction with accusations from some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The president returned to Ankara ahead of schedule as he has
other matters to deal with, he said, describing these press
reports as "groundless."

<HEADLINE> New Drug Approved for Kidney Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, December 12 (Xinhua) --Zenapax, genetically
engineered new drug for kidney transplant patients, was approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drug could help prevent the rejection of the
transplanted organ without the side effects of the commonly used
immune system suppressing agents, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
It was developed by Protein Design Labs Inc., a biotechnology
company in Mountain View, Calif., and will be marketed worldwide
by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc..
</P>
<P>
Although designed for kidney transplants, it has been said
to be used with other organs as well, including heart, liver
and lung.
</P>
<P>
Zenapax is one of biotechnology drugs called monoclonal
antibodies which can be extremely selective, binding only with
specific targets while not affecting healthy cells. With it's amino
acid structure being more than 90 percent "humanized", Zenapax
could avoid the allergic response,and human body can accept it as
human proteins. It can stay in the system a very long time, so
it can be more effective.

WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Fund and Russia agreed on a plan
for a quick infusion of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars from the fund and
World Bank. The accord, which would allow for the payment of back
wages and relieve pressure on the ruble, entails a new round of
budget cuts that may be hard to get through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
-- The Internal Revenue Service, quoting from its own internal
audit conducted this fall, admitted that tax-payer rights are
abused by a systemwide "climate" of high pressure that encourages
auditors to go to improper lengths to meet statistical benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States on Friday banned imports of all cattle and
sheep from Europe until the risk of spreading mad cow disease in
the country is fully examined.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and about 70 other nations reached
agreement Friday night on a pact to liberalize world markets for
financial services. The accord will open the banking, insurance
and securities markets of a number of fast-growing developing
countries to U.S. firms that have been clamoring for entry.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Friday
called for an end to the ban on political activity in Congo and
said the United States would give aid for the country's
reconstruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) --Field workers of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) were praised today for their hard work
and contributions to the country by Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also member of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee Politburo, told a group of scientists at CAS's second
conference on field work that they should make an effort to
inherit the tradition of seeking truth from facts and be
creative and devoted to make further progress in the utilization
of resources, environmental protection and agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
Participants heard reports from the field by scientists about
developments in gold ore prospecting, grain output assessing,
restoration of the eco-system, and control of diseases on cotton
plants.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that over 10,000 field-workers from 50 CAS
institutes have made many discoveries in their research, and the
natural resources situation is now clearer, thanks to their
efforts, which have provided a large amount of data for
governmental decisions on industrial layout.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Cracking Down More On Major Corruption Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will focus its
efforts in anti-corruption work on municipal party and
government departments and law enforcement and the judiciary, Jia
Qinglin, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party
Committee, said today.
</P>
<P>
Jia made the announcement at the Eighth Beijing Municipal
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which opened
here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts will be made to uncover corruption cases
in economic administration offices and of officials above the
bureau chief level, with greater focus on the finance, real
estate, land lease, and security market sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing discipline inspection and supervision
departments, the city in the past five years has made
investigations into nearly 6,000 cases of violations of Party
disciplines and laws.
</P>
<P>
By October, 5,000 cases were settled and 15 million yuan (1.8
million US) worth of potential economic loss halted.
</P>
<P>
Jia called for Party officials in the city to discipline
themselves and to be honest in performing their duties, adding
they should learn a lesson from Chen Xitong and Wang Baosen and be
on guard against any corrupt acts.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xitong was relieved of his position of secretary of the
Beijing Municipal Party Committee when he was discovered to have
been involved in criminal activities in 1995. Wang Baosen, who was
vice-mayor, was also found to have been involved in criminal
activities.

<HEADLINE> World Records Fall at World Weightlifting Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, December 13 (Xinhua) -- World records
fell at the hands of Chinese and Turkish strongwomen at the World
Weighlifting Championships here on Saturday.
</P>

two gold medals.

FUZHOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The city of Quanzhou in east
China's Fujian Province has added 101,000 mobile phone customers
this year, bringing the total number to 202,000.

when it had only three base stations. The city had about 360
mobile phone customers a year later.
</P>
<P>
By June of this year, the handling capacity of the local mobile
telecommunications network, including digital and analog, had bee
at least 250,000 lines.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Govt, Opposition on Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government
appears to be on a collision course with the opposition over the
recently signed Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both are busy preparing political offensives against each other
centering on the peace treaty signed between the government and
the CHT Tribal Organization on December 2.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami (People's) League (AL) has decided to call a
parliamentary session to discuss the agreement, while the
opposition parties with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) as
the leader have chosen not to go for any kind of legal battle over
the agreement, but rather to face the situation politically.
</P>
<P>
The AL is also planning to hold a series of meetings to garner
the public's support for the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The BNP-led seven opposition political parties Friday began to
seek opinions from different professional groups in connection
with their campaign against the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Begum Khaleda Zia, BNP Chairperson and leader of the opposition
in parliament, said Friday that the opposition "would wage a
movement to unseat the government if it did not rescind the
agreement" on the CHT issue.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister, also said that her
party would intensify its campaign against the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The BNP and its supporters have staged hartals almost every
day, particularly in the CHT, since the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
BNP Legal experts said the agreement had not yet come into
force as relevant laws required for its implementation were not
yet enacted.
</P>
<P>
The AL, at its working committee meeting on Thursday, decided
to launch an all-out campaign to win support for the accord.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some political parties have urged the
government to take appropriate steps to establish a national
consensus over the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Crisis will come and crisis will go," Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, who is AL chairperson, said Friday. "When we are in
politics and in power, we will have to solve the crisis and we
will do it."
</P>
<P>
"Necessary steps to solve the crisis will be taken," she added.

HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A black and white portrait
of Confucius on the wall, a big kite featuring owl -- the Western
symbol of wisdom -- beside the computer, and on top of the shelves
 the British Union Jack and Hong Kong's bauhinia flag.
</P>
<P>
That is the very first glimpse of Dr. Michael DeGolyer's small
and compact office in the new campus of Hong Kong Baptist
University.
</P>
<P>
The office is somewhat an epitome of Hong Kong, where East
meets West in a free and frequent way, the associate professor of
government and international studies joked.
</P>
<P>
He came to Hong Kong in mid-1988 with his wife and son, and
first taught at the History Department. There was not a Government
 and International Studies Department at the then much smaller
Baptist College.
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to study overseas, live overseas and work
overseas for a while, because I study history, political economy
and comparative economy," DeGolyer recalled why he had quit his
teaching job at an American university and settled in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
His keen academic interest in Hong Kong led to years' devotion
to a research project on the handover, involving social scientists
 at various local universities as well as overseas.
</P>
<P>
Since February 1989, DeGolyer has been on the Hong Kong
Transition Project, which aims to study the transition of Hong
Kong from British colonial rule back to China, and its
far-reaching impact on Hong Kong, China and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to the handover, we did 18 telephone surveys, about
twice a year, interviewing 600 to 1,200 residents each time," said
 DeGolyer, director of the project. Following each survey was
heavy workload of analyzing and writing.
</P>
<P>
The last survey report before July 1 showed that there remained
 a fairly high degree of optimism among Hong Kong people, with
about 60 percent of the respondents said they were "very
optimistic" or "optimistic".
</P>
<P>
Concerning the expectations in the next decade from now, 44
percent expected Hong Kong to be "better" and 11 percent "about
the same".
</P>
<P>
Now with Hong Kong being a Special Administrative Region (SAR)
of China, the project is starting a new series of surveys which
will go forward to the year 2007, the tenth anniversary of the
handover.
</P>
<P>
"We are revising some of the questions," Dr. DeGolyer. For
example, Hong Kong's integration with the inland areas of China is
 more closely watched. The first post-handover survey report is
due to release next January.
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is to understand this process better
as you know 'one country, two systems' is a kind of new concept, "
 he explained. "The group is a multi-disciplinary one, looking at
various aspects of Hong Kong's development."
</P>
<P>
The research work made DeGolyer a target of the media -- he has
 an average of five interviews and briefings every week.
</P>
<P>
He gets up between four and five in the morning to study until
seven, then listens to radio, watches TV news and, reads papers
and magazines if there isn't an early class.
</P>
<P>
"So I can keep up with what's going on in Hong Kong and Asia,"
DeGolyer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the recent regional financial turmoil, Hong Kong has done
much better than other Asian economies, DeGolyer said.
</P>
<P>
"There are some areas we need to look at, for example, our
distorted property market, but on the other side if you look at
competitiveness, Hong Kong came out second or third on most of the
 lists," he added.
</P>
<P>
He was excited about the prospects of Hong Kong: "China is set
to grow and Hong Kong has a position of growth leadership in
China's economic development."
</P>
<P>
But, speaking of the education field, the scholar turned
critical.
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S. people graduate from high school and go on to
university study. In Hong Kong, it's only 18 percent, which means
we are only educating less than one person out of five."
</P>
<P>
Even worse, "in a wealthy society like Hong Kong, 40 or 50
percent of our primary students go to school only half-day (for
lack of school buildings)."
</P>
<P>
It is something Hong Kong really needs to improve, DeGolyer
said.
</P>
<P>
His family has fostered a deep feeling toward the city. "We
prefer to live in Hong Kong than anywhere else. We like Hong Kong
very much."

<HEADLINE> EU Demands Efforts by Turkey to Gain Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
said Saturday Turkey was eligible for EU membership but had to
meet certain criteria before being allowed into formal entry talks.
</P>
<P>
It was politically difficult, they agreed at a summit beginning
Friday, to exclude Turkey from a "European family" though the
country had "serious problems" for joining the enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with the regional bloc's reluctance to consider
giving it a seat around the table for entry talks, Ankara snubbed
an invitation to dine with EU leaders on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insists the EU make clear that it has candidate status.
</P>
<P>
The EU has demanded Ankara to live up to Europe's democratic
values, improve human rights record and relations with neighboring
Greece, and allow EU entry talks with Cyprus to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Here at two-day summit, EU leaders decided to launch a European
Conference to bring EU members and EU applicant countries together.
</P>
<P>
They decided to invite the 10 central and eastern European
candidates, Cyprus and Turkey first to attend the conference,
which will take place annually for discussions on the enlargement.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek said Friday the conference
would lack substance if Turkey was not attending.
</P>
<P>
But the leaders also maintained that the invitees must meet
criteria laid out by the EU in the first place, such as respect of
international law and commitment to peace and dispute settlement
by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the entry talks would start early next year
with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Slovenia and
Cyprus, applicants the EU considers to be advanced in their
required economic and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
The other five candidates, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania,
Bulgaria and Latvia, will move towards EU membership on a slower
track, with the promise of a place in the world's biggest single
market once they have met its criteria.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese fishermen recently
discovered an unexploded aerial bomb in the water off Lianyungang
in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese military experts say the bomb was probably dropped by a
Japanese bomber during the Anti-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gongping, one of the fishermen, discovered the bomb on
November 21 along with fellow fishermen in the sea two miles off
Lianyungang's Kaishan Island.
</P>
<P>
Local military experts say the 400-kilogram bomb is 1.23
meters long with a diameter of 0.38 meters. It is too rusty to
read any identifying marks, they say, but guess from its shape
that it might have come from a Japanese bomber during the
bombardment of the city in 1938.

<HEADLINE> Australian Republicans Continue Strong Showing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian republican
candidates for next year's constitutional convention are
continuing to outpoll rival monarchists in at least four states in
a ballot with just over 50 percent of the votes counted
nationally.
</P>
<P>
However, the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy (ACM)
party is outperforming the Australian Republican Movement (ARM) in
Queensland.
</P>
<P>
The vote is too close to call in Tasmania, the Northern
Territory and South Australia.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary poll is to decide the 76 delegates who will join
76 appointed delegates at the February constitutional conference
to discuss whether Australia should be a republic or a
constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) figures showed that the
ARM is outpolling its rivals by two to one in the most populous
state of New South Wales with about 50 percent of the vote
counted.
</P>
<P>
The republicans are also storming past the monarchists in
Victoria with about 38 percent of the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
Results from the other two states, Western Australia and the
Australian Capital Territory, also put the republican delegates in
a winning position with most of the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
But AEC electoral officer Brien (Brien) Hallet has called for
caution in reading the results, saying the vote was too early to
call and difficult to read.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Slashes High Houses Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba slashed prices of council houses when he discovered
irregularities by the Lusaka City Council Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who is on a surprise tour of Chunga compound, ordered
the council to review the prices of houses in the area and told
resident who have paid more than 400,000 Kawacha (about 300 U.S.
dollars) for a one bed-roomed house not to make any more payment
because that figure is beyond what he thought was reasonable,
reported the Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
He described the high prices of houses as not only
exploitative but an affront to government policy of citizens'
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
He wondered how the council valued the houses and said he
could even have given them for free if he had known earlier.
</P>
<P>
"This is theft, you cannot sell these houses, one bed-roomed
structures which are falling off at 1.6 million kwacha (about
1,200 dollars). These people will have to do renovations when
they buy these things. So how much do you want them to pay? You
must be serious," the president told a official from Chunga
office.
</P>
<P>
He said the government policy of house ownership is not meant
to raise revenue for councils but to give people a chance to own
their houses.
</P>
<P>
Zambia started to sell government and council houses to their
sitting tenants last year as a new housing policy to back house
ownership.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Urged to Increase Regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today proposed that ASEAN countries should
increase trade among them to help cushion the effects of the
currency devaluation and shorten the region's economic recovery
period.
</P>
<P>
"I feel quite sure that the devaluation of our currencies can
facilitate trade between us," he told the opening of a four-day
"Private Sector Salute to ASEAN" meeting which is to mark the 30th
anniversary of ASEAN and in conjunction with the second ASEAN
Informal Summit in Kuala Lumpur on December 14-16.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said there were many things which ASEAN countries
could not buy from each other before and which should be
competitive now "if we keep our new exchange rate and the price of
goods according to the domestic market."
</P>
<P>
By taking advantage of the simultaneous devaluation of the
region's currencies, he said, members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) could actually increase their
trade with each other without keeping out other countries.
</P>
<P>
"That way we will help each other's economy to recover and
hopefully to grow," he said. "When we are rich again and able to
afford the imported goods and luxuries from outside ASEAN, we
should do so. Indeed, we will be helping to restore world trade by
working hard to recover quickly."
</P>
<P>
As all the ASEAN currencies had been devalued to almost the
same extent, the exchange rates between them had not changed much,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can therefore continue our trade with each other almost as
we did before. Indeed we can extend our trade greatly if our
regional sources retain this competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in this regard, the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
could be re-examined to expedite and expand it.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to make AFTA worthwhile, we have to guard against
the inflationary effect of devaluation. It is not impossible to do
this. It requires a great deal of discipline among our people,"
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he was not advocating ASEAN economic
regionalism, saying the fact was that "We have less money now and
we should buy from the cheapest source."
</P>
<P>
He said there should be no restriction on others entering the
ASEAN markets with their products. "But if their prices are higher
we should not buy from them."
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, ASEAN countries could barter to increase
their trade "since we don't know when the pressure on our
currencies will be lifted," Mahathir said.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Marks Massacre Anniversary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Exactly Sixty years ago, five
months after Japan launched a full invasion, the eastern Chinese
city of Nanjing, then the capital of China, was captured by the
Japanese intruding troops.
</P>
<P>
The following six weeks and more became a bloody nightmare for
the over 500,000 peaceful residents and nearly 100,000 disarmed
Chinese soldiers in Nanjing, as the Japanese occupants indulged
themselves in an orgy of slaughter, arson, rape and loot.
</P>
<P>
Various records, including those made by the Japanese, showed
that at least 300,000 Chinese were butchered and more than 20,000
women raped. One third of the city's streets and buildings were
burnt to the ground, causing a property loss of 230 billion yuan
(about 28.75 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Also known as "the Rape of Nanking", the Nanjing Massacre was
later described as "a dark page in modern human civilization" by
historians worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Though a long time has passed and Nanjing is now a beautiful
and vibrant provincial capital with a population of over five
million, what happened here six decades ago has become a perpetual
wound to the city and its people that aches most this very day.
</P>
<P>
At ten o'clock this morning, all sirens in Nanjing sounded a
three-minute alarm. The city government designed this ritual last
year for mourning the massacre victims and reminding the local
residents of the past tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 3,000 people gathered in a large square outside
the suburban Jiangdongmen Museum, built for the memory of the
massacre victims, for a special memorial service.
</P>
<P>
By the side of a large wreath, which is made of fresh flowers
and two meters in diameter, Sun Han, chairman of the Jiangsu
Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, blasted a few Japanese right wingers and
their political representatives for repeatedly trying to deny the
existence of Nanjing Massacre.

<P>
Starting November 24, the Nanjing City Notary Association began
to certify material evidence and testimony provided by these old
people. Li Xiuying was among the first group of 150 survivors to
testify in front of a video camera.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing-based publishing houses also published a series of
books cataloguing Japanese atrocities, which include an
eight-volume diary of German businessman John Rabe, who helped
protect some 250,000 Chinese refugees during the massacre, and a
picture album that collects 800 pictures about the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The curator Zhu said that this year his museum organized a
touring exhibition on the Nanjing Massacre in the country's seven
major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan. The exhibition
received a total of one million visitors.
</P>
<P>
"In Hefei alone, 250,000 people came to the exhibition. That's
one third of the city's population," he said. Hefei is the capital
city of east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, memorial services for the victims of Nanjing
Massacre were held today not only in Nanjing and China, but also
in many other parts of the world, such as the United States,
Japan, Canada, Australia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, he said, memorial concerts were held simultaneously
in Tokyo and Osaka this afternoon, and 11 massacre survivors and
historians from Nanjing were invited.
</P>
<P>
"From this we can see that the world has not forgot this
tragical episode of human history, and that peace and development
have become the common theme for the mankind," he said. "We shall
draw lesson from history and work together for the eternal peace
of the world."

"The reason we're holding this service here today is to teach
our people, especially our younger generation, that they shall
never forget history and the national shame if they want to
prevent such kinds of historical tragedy from happening again," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiuying, one of the survivors of Nanjing Massacre, lit a
"lamp of eternal brightness", traditional tribute to the dead in
China.
</P>
<P>
Li, 78, was stabbed 37 times by Japanese soldiers on December
19, 1937 when she resisted their rape attempts.
</P>
<P>
"I and the scars on my body are the living evidence of the
Nanjing Massacre," said the old lady emotionally.
</P>
<P>
The people released 3,000 pigeons at the end of the service to
express their resentment against war and wishes for world peace.
</P>
<P>
Similar services were held in other 13 places across the city,
all major sites of slaughter 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Chengshan, curator of the Jiangdongmen Museum, noted that
it is not on December 13 only that the people in Nanjing and other
parts of the country remember the massacre and its victims.
</P>
<P>
From early July to late September this year, he said, over
11,800 students from 121 universities and middle schools in
Nanjing searched almost every corner of the city for any living
victims, survivors and witnesses of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts were joined by a group of Japanese students from
14 schools in Osaka, Tokyo and other cities in mid August.
</P>
<P>
After visiting nearly 30,000 households, the Chinese and
Japanese youngsters found a total of 2,630 old people who were in
Nanjing in that horrible winter of 1937-38.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Peter Velappan, General
Secretary of Asian Football Confederation (AFC), rated Iran as the
best outfit among the four Asian teams which qualified for the
World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
At an AFC news conference here today, the general secretary
said Iran, who had taken the rockiest path to qualify, are the
most possible Asian team to make the second round next year in
France.
</P>
<P>
The Arab squad, staging an astonishing comeback to edge out
Australia on away-goal rule in the Asia-Oceania play-off and grab
the last ticket for France, had a wealth of talented players.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian team have six players who are exceptionally
gifted," Velappan said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's playmaker Karim Bagheri, striker Khodadad Azizi and Ali
Daei, all of whom play professional football in the Bundesliga,
were playing a huge part in Iran's World Cup campaign, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian, saying 1997 was a good year for Asian football
since four teams have qualified for the World Cup finals, reveal
he was particularly glad about the Iranian victory.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian win is psychologically very important for Asian
football, and I will have a strong case presented to FIFA to ask
for six Asian seats in the 2002 World Cup since Japan and South
Korea are automatically qualified."
</P>
<P>
And the other Asian team Velappan would bet on at next year's
World Cup is South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"I have pleasant feelings about all our four teams next year in
France," he said, "Iran and South Korea are most favoured to
qualify for the next round and surprises may come from Japan and
Saudi Arabia."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- India's tea exports would
touch the target of 180 million kg this year, Tea Board Chairman
S.S. Ahuja said today.
</P>
<P>
India's tea exports, which stood at 154 million kg last year,
are all set to increase with Indian tea making fresh inroads into
traditional markets such as Russia, the United Kingdom, Iran,
Canada, Japan and the United States, he said in his address to the
15th annual general meeting of Indian Tea Association in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan market would act as a spring board to gain access
to other central Asian countries. Pakistan itself had placed
import orders of 2.5 million kg tea during the current year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the tea industry in the country to move towards
product diversification and develop more sophisticated packaging
infrastructure to compete in new markets.

<HEADLINE> Missing Myanmar Fishermen Reach Indian Shores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen Myanmar fishermen,
who reportedly went missing after being caught in a recent
cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal, safely reached India's
southern shores on the Kerala Coast Friday evening, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen, who set sail on a motorized boat near Yangon,
Myanmar 45 days ago, lost their way in the severe cyclonic storm.
</P>
<P>
After running out of their food stocks, the fishermen had lost
all hopes of survival before they saw the faint glimmer of a
lighthouse at the Mamallapuram of India, which guided them ashore,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
All the fishermen were healthy but appeared exhausted, police
said.
</P>
<P>
As none of them possessed any passports or valid documents, a
case had been registered under the Foreigners Act. India's
Immigration Department and the Myanmar Embassy in New Delhi had
also been informed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar's Entry Into ASEAN Opens New Chapter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's entry into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a major event
for the country in the outgoing year of 1997 and has opened a new
chapter in its foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, withstanding pressure from certain Western countries,
made its decision to admit Myanmar into the fold of the grouping
in July, showing its independence and maturity in dealing with
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's entry into the grouping, from a long-term point of
view, is not only conducive to the development of the country, but
also to peace, stability and development in the region as a whole,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Since its integration into ASEAN, Myanmar has been making
efforts to work closely with other ASEAN members to share the
responsibility of the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Myanmar formed a leading committee on ASEAN
affairs in June and then set up respective committees and groups
in all sectors to take an active part in meetings and activities
of the grouping.
</P>
<P>
The series of ASEAN meetings Myanmar has attended showed the
country's positive response to the cooperation among ASEAN member
nations.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) Council and
ASEAN economic ministers' meeting in Kuala Lumpur in October,
Myanmar presented its commodities list compiled for tariff
reduction for the establishment of AFTA which is to bring tariffs
down to zero to 5 percent within 10 years after joining AFTA.
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar's final Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT)
packages, there are 2,355 tariff lines (43 percent of its total)
in the inclusion list of products and 2,987 tariff lines (54.6
percent of its total) in the temporary exclusion list.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the Council meeting that ASEAN will provide
technical assistance to Myanmar as well as Laos, its two new
members, to help them fulfill their obligations for AFTA.
</P>
<P>
At an ASEAN agriculture and forestry ministers' meeting in
Bangkok in September, Myanmar stressed cooperation among ASEAN
member nations in food, agriculture and forestry sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at an ASEAN transport ministers' meeting in the
Philippines' Cebu in September, Myanmar pledged to cooperate with
other members in carrying out projects and activities under the
integrated implementation program for the ASEAN plan of action in
transport and communications sectors.
</P>
<P>
In drugs control, Myanmar is also making preparations to act as
a host in implementing individually and collectively ASEAN
members' three-year narcotic drugs control project which was
worked out at the 18th meeting of ASEAN Senior officials on Drug
Matters (ASOD) in Bangkok in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Brunei in August, Myanmar attended the 20th meeting on ASOD
which discussed the latest development of each country's anti-drug
program and cooperation among ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
In the education sector, Myanmar is planning to revise its
education curriculum to conform to the education standards in
ASEAN member states, aiming to turn out skilled workers and
technicians in the process of human resources development.
</P>
<P>
With regard to parliamentary affairs, Myanmar promised to
cooperate with other member nations in achieving economic
well-being of the Southeast Asia region when Chairman of the
Myanmar National Convention Convening Work Committee U Aung Toe
attended as observer the 18th Working Committee and General
Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization (AIPO) in
Bali, Indonesia, in September.
</P>
<P>
In financial affairs, Myanmar, together with Laos, signed the
memorandum of understanding on multilateral cooperation in ASEAN's
financial sector at a special meeting of ASEAN Finance Ministers
held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, early this month.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's integration into the regional grouping, which now
embraces nine members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos, is
seen as not only an opportunity for the country in the development
of its economy and trade and attraction of foreign investment, but
also a challenge to it in commodity production and market
competition.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar was admitted into ASEAN, the Association's
Secretary-General Ajit Singh has visited Myanmar twice, the last
trip being in November when he led an ASEAN business forum
delegation, exploring business cooperation with Myanmar
counterparts, especially the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, at the end of September,
investment from other ASEAN countries added up to over 3 billion
U.S. dollars, accounting for about 45 percent of the total 6.44
billion dollars of foreign investment in Myanmar. This has helped
the country obtain much-needed foreign exchange and promote job
creation and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that with the technical assistance and
support from other member nations, Myanmar's economy would develop
at a relatively quicker pace which would in turn promote the
region's economic, social and cultural development.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Initial Pact on Prevention of Naval Incidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Senior U.S. and Chinese
defense officials Friday initialed an agreement designed to
prevent naval accidents at sea as they ended the first-ever formal
defense consultations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Military Consultative Agreement was worked out
during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington in
October.
</P>
<P>
The two-day defense talks also yielded an agreement on
exchanging information on their military's role in humanitarian
relief missions.
</P>
<P>
The talks at the Pentagon were led by Walter Slocombe, U.S.
Under-Secretary of Defense and visiting Chinese Lt. General Xiong

Liberation Army. The two sides exchanged views on a wide range of
issues, including international and regional security, and
discussed exchange programs between the two armed forces.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Implement Bailout Agreement with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's senior political
leaders made a joint statement Saturday, promising to implement a
bailout agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund on
December 3 to regain international confidence in the nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after a 70-minute meeting at
Chongwadae by President Kim Young-sam, Lee Hoi-chang, the
presidential candidate of the Grand National Party, Kim Dae-jung,
presidential runner of the National Congress for New Politics, and
Rhee In-je, presidential candidate of the New Party by the People.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders discussed at the meeting how to restore
international confidence in South Korea's economy in a hope of
finding a quicker resolution to the financial panic gripping the
country since November.
</P>
<P>
"We will exert utmost efforts to regain international
confidence and expeditiously stabilize the nation's financial
market by implementing the agreement singed between the government
and the IMF," they said.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the public to share the burden of dealing with
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to the entire people to be united as one and make
even more strenuous efforts to overcome the economic crisis by
enduring all the pains," the four political leaders said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial crisis has been deepening as businesses
grasping for funds are becoming increasingly restless over the
skyrocketing value of the U.S. dollar against the nation's won.
</P>
<P>
The rapid depreciation of the won has sent exports and imports
into near paralysis while some industrial sectors are cutting
production under snowballing exchange losses.
</P>
<P>
The won's depreciation is also afflicting huge exchange losses
on the airline, oil refinery and shipping sectors, which heavily
depend on oil imports.
</P>
<P>
The financially-troubled country, which has ordered 14 merchant
banks' suspension of business operation this month, is estimated
to need about 20 billion U.S. dollars to boost foreign currency
flows.
</P>
<P>
The nation's financial crisis was caused by failures of some
corporates and bad loans of financial institutions, estimated at
more than 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With a debt of 110 billion U.S. dollars, South Korea, which is
the world's 11th largest economy, accepted the 57-billion-dollar
IMF loans with strict conditions on December 3 after hard
negotiations with the monetary organization.
</P>
<P>
Those conditions include budget cuts, higher interest rare,
bigger taxes, and a wide opening of its financial market.

<HEADLINE> Ankara Denounces EU Presidency's Remarks Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman has said that the remarks of the European Union (EU)
Presidency describing Turkey as a country practicing torture are
"unacceptable, baseless, humiliating and regretful."
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted Spokesman Necati Utkan
as saying that "Turkey had listened to righteous criticisms over
its human rights conditions, took them into consideration and
displayed serious and good-willed efforts to overcome these
deficiencies," which have also been explained to the parties
concerned in the EU.
</P>
<P>
He also said "Turkey is also a country proud of the fact that
it has steered clear of xenophobia and intolerance."
</P>
<P>
In his interview with the "Luxemburger Wort" newspaper
Thursday in advance of a two-day summit of EU leaders in
Luxembourg, Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said "I do not
believe the human rights problems can be solved in three to five
years (in Turkey)."
</P>
<P>
Juncker is now holding the EU's rotating presidency and is
hosting the Luxembourg EU Summit.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "it can not be that the representatives of a
country in which torture is still going on can sit at the table
of the European Union."
</P>
<P>
Juncker said that Turkey can begin talks with the EU now but
the talks will never conclude until Turkey's human rights
problem is fully resolved, adding that "in my opinion Turkey
really has a place in the EU but this process will take decades."
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an associate EU member since 1963, was excluded Friday
from the EU enlargement process although it submitted its
application for EU membership a decade ago. Turkey is accused of
failing to satisfy the EU's political criteria, such as improved
human rights record and respect of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders complain they are thus treated as a
third-ranked nation by the EU. Turkey has turned down the
invitation for the Turkish prime minister to dine with the EU
leaders Saturday after the summit's conclusion.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Warns S. Leone Junta on Attacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
(ECOMOG) Friday warned the illegal regime in Sierra Leone to stop
its attacks on civilians, or face consequences of its
actions.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG statement accused the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
and its allies of intensifying their raids since December 9 and 10 on
the eastern and southern parts of the country, the Daily Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by Major S.O. Adewusi on behalf of ECOMOG
force Commander Major-General Victor Malu, named Joru and Gorahun in
the east and Sonoshun, Fairo and Dia in the south as areas mostly
affected.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel group RUF has allied to the national army since
the May 25 this year coup overthrew the legitimate government of
President Ahemd Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
"These attacks were backed by helicopter gunship, artillery, mortar
rocket propeller grenade and other small arms. These attacks afforded
the rebel troops the opportunity to loot, rape and traumatize innocent
citizens," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Those mostly affected were children, women and the old, some
of whom managed to escape and are being treated by ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Also affected in the unprovoked attack were the civil defense corps
known as Kamajors, a group of traditional hunters loyal to President
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged the military junta to intend to push the
Kamajors back and enter the ECOMOG location to create avenue for
more damages on the civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors and the junta forces have reportedly been in tense
fighting the southeastern Sierra Leone since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Considering these attacks as a serious violation of the Conakry
peace accord on Sierra Leone, ECOMOG high command reminded the junta
of the grave consequences of its actions.
</P>
<P>
"This high command is therefore constrained to reiterate its
preparedness and commitment to enforce the ceasefire. The junta is
therefore warned that any further violation will inevitably draw
appropriate action from the ecomog high command," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Condemns Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
not allow people to use demonstrations as instruments for
robbery, thieving or as spring-boards for acts of disorder and
general rampaging, said Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing officers from the presidential office and cabinet
members Friday, President Robert Mugabe said that the predictable
linkage between demonstrations and violence should be prevented
from going on.
</P>
<P>
"If people have a grievance and they want to express it
through a demonstration, why should they be stopped if they do so
in an orderly way? To me that's perfectly in order." he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting publicly for the first time since Tuesday's
nationwide mass protest against levies, Mugabe said the problem
arose when demonstrations were used to commit acts of crime.
</P>
<P>
He said the government condemned violence in all its forms and
it should be avoided by all means.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also condemned the assault on Secretary-General of the
Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Morgan Tsvangirai, who
was attacked by unknown assailants in his office Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
But he said trade unions should learn the discipline of
self-control and break the now assumed linkage between violence
and demonstrations, especially in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He said if the union was being used by white farmers to fight
the policy of giving land to the people the government will
regard them as enemies.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Meet Egyptian FM on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will have brief talks with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa Tuesday on the crumbling Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will take place when Albright, finishing her
African tour, makes a stopover at Cairo Airport on way to Europe
for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit on December
16-17.
</P>
<P>
The Albright-Moussa talks will focus on the Israeli Likud
government's much-delayed second-phase troop redeployment in the
West Bank, the Middle East News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
She has held two rounds of separate talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat within a month and plans a third round
next week, with Netanyahu in Paris and with Arafat in London.
</P>
<P>
Albright said earlier that she expects Netanyahu and Arafat to
"make firm decisions" before their meetings again, meaning that
Israel must make a concrete decision on the second pullback while
the PNA has to make a harsher crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Washington is growing impatient with Israel's handling of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, especially the delays in the
second redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda to Attend Inter-Party Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda will attend the inter-party talks scheduled for
next month if the government guarantees his safe return from a
protracted overseas trip, said the United National Independence
Party (UNIP) led by Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted UNIP Secretary of Information and
Publicity Bweendo Mulengela as saying there is no doubt that
Kaunda, who went abroad on the eve of the October 28 coup
attempt, will attend the crucial talks, "but the ball is in the
government's court. They should guarantee that he returns home
safely".
</P>
<P>
Mulengela, who attended the preliminary meeting held earlier
this week to map out an agenda for the inter-party dialogue, said
the concern of most opposition parties is that the preliminary
talks might have been done as a display for other influences and
warned that the talks will fail if they are not genuine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) has said that
it will go ahead with the inter-party talks whether its president
Dean Mung'omba currently in detention for his alleged involvement
in the foiled coup is released or not.
</P>
<P>
ZDC Vice-President Wynter Kabimba said: "We are still a party
even with detention of our president. We want him out of there
but ZDC will still attend the talks if things go beyond our
control to have him around."
</P>
<P>
The preliminary meeting has been hailed as successful by
opposition parties and non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
National Party Secretary Standwell Mapala said that he hoped
that the same spirit that prevailed during the preliminary
meeting would also prevail when the inter-party dialog to be
attended by party presidents is held.

<HEADLINE> Floods Ravaging Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Floods caused by
continuing heavy rains in different parts of Tanzania have made
hundreds of people homeless and created transport problems,
especially along the central railway line.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also caused a reduced supply of cattle from
upcountry to Dar es Salaam, raising prices of meat.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of supply was caused by the poor state of roads
and the central railway line caused by continuous rains which
have been pounding for the last two weeks, The Guardian reported
today.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 out of 8,000 passengers who were travelling by
rail to the northwest region of Mwanza have been forced to return
to Dar es Salaam after the portion between Ipala and Bukene in
the neighboring region Tabora was washed away by floods.
</P>
<P>
The passengers had been stranded for 48 hours at Tabora
Station and Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) officials said
here Friday that it would take engineers seven days to to repair
the damaged portion of the railway.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that so many passengers were stranded at
the station, TRC officials said.
</P>
<P>
In Igunga and Nzega districts, heavy rains destroyed some 150
houses leaving hundreds of people homeless, the Nzega District
Commissioner, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Road services between Tabora and Mbeya regions have been
suspended after the Ipole bridge was washed away by floods, the
Sikonge District Commissioner, Ms Beatrice Mkina said.
</P>
<P>
In Kilosa District, Morogoro Region, floods damaged more than
200 houses leaving over 1,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The Kilosa District Commissioner, Ms Eddy Tumbo, said that
floods seriously affected Mtendeni and Magomeni areas in Kilosa
town and Madizini village.
</P>
<P>
A district task force has been formed to evaluate the loss
incurred and to look for ways to prevent further floods.
</P>
<P>
She said people whose houses have been damaged by the floods
have taken refuge in primary schools. Others are living in with
their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Musoma said Friday more than 20 families were
vacating their houses which are about to be engulfed by floods,
and 10 houses have been damaged by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Asian-European Soccer Bridge Set from 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Asian football's European
connections will be strengthened up as a between-continental
contest involving top Asian teams and European powerhouses such as
Germany and Italy will be carried out annually from 1999 after
next year's World Cup
</P>
<P>
Asia will send six teams to play against as many European
counterparts on a home-and-away basis every year since 1999, Dato'
Peter Velappan, General Secretary of Asian Football Confederation
(AFC) declared at a news conference here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
AFC are currently discussing with the football associations
from England, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy and Spain to
make possible Asian soccer can regularly get in touch with world's
best soccer to boost its own levels.
</P>
<P>
Five of the six Asian participants have been settled down and
they are four next year World Cup finalists, namely South Korea,
Iran, Japan and Saudi Arabia, plus China, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
The last team to grab the appealing opportunity to play up with
European big names will come from West Asian Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Yogoslavia or Croatia would be other European possibilities, Dr.
Velappan said.
</P>
<P>
Reactions from the European side were "very receptive", and they
have recognized the growing-up of Asian football and would help to
internationize the growth and the development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good year for Asian football in 1997, " the general
secretary said, "Four of our teams have qualified for World Cup
next year in France and they have been grouped in company of
European giants.
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen of the thirty-two qualified teams come from Europe and
that's why I'm always suggesting we should play more games with
the Europeans."
</P>
<P>
AFC has its next project to develop Asian football in
cooperation with Africa, Dr. Velappan said.
</P>
<P>
Also from 1999, top two Asian under-20 youth teams will play
against their African counterparts on an annual basis, and similar
arrangements with the European youth teams will be set out from
the year of 2000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Massacre Documentary Film Discovered in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A documentary film on Nanjing
Massacre that had never been released, was discovered in the
United States, said Tze-ping Shao, first head of a U.S.-based
association in commemoration of Nanjing Massacre victims.
</P>
<P>
The six-week long Nanjing Massacre started 60 years ago today
during which some 300,000 civilians and disarmed Chinese soldiers
were killed by the intruding Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
Shao, a Chinese-American, said here Friday in an interview with
Xinhua that the 37-minute soundless black-white documentary film
was shot by John Gillespie Magee, a US missionary in China from
1912 to 1940 who died in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Magee, who had been chairman of the Nanjing International Red
Cross Society, used a 16-mm. camera to take scenes of Japanese
soldiers killing, raping or robbing Nanjing civilians in Ginling
University Hospital and other places in the city during late 1937
and 1938, Shao noted.
</P>
<P>
In late 1938, Shao added, Magee's colleague named George
A. Fitch, brought the first part of the documentary to Shanghai at
the risk of his life and made four copies after editing and
entitling the film.
</P>
<P>
Then, Fitch and Magee kept two copies each.
</P>
<P>
The documentary film was mentioned in Bates Documents, left by
Miner Bates, who was in Nanjing for the 30 years preceding 1950.
</P>
<P>
A German diplomat also mentioned the documentary film in his
report submitted to the German Foreign Ministry on February 10,
1938, saying that "the narration of the scenes and the film itself
is a very stunning document."
</P>
<P>
The documentary film had not been discovered till 1990.
</P>
<P>
After an announcement for collecting Nanjing Massacre related
materials made by Shao in New York Times in 1990 publicized,
Fitch's daughter Edith offered her father's film copy and
recollections, and David, Magee's son, found his father's positive
at the basement of his house.
</P>
<P>
David recalled that he had first seen the film in 1938 when he
accompanied his father to London and the documentary film was kept
at his home afterwards.

<HEADLINE> 12 COMESA Members Under Sanctions for Failure to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Twelve out of 20 members of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) are
under sanctions for failure to contribute to the budget for two
or more years, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report from the Lusaka-based organization
as saying that the unprecedented move against the defaulting members
including Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Malawi,
Mozambique and Tanzania, is in accordance with the COMESA Treaty
signed in 1994 which calls for sanctions against members that
fail to meet their obligations to the regional body.
</P>
<P>
Twelve are affected by the decision to have all benefits and
operations suspended in those countries and to lose rights and
privileges, including addressing policy organs' meetings.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of operations are to cover all new
extra-budgetary resources' projects, except those currently being
implemented, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The second part of the sancitons states that all the arrears
as at the end of 1997 will accrue one percent interest which will
be reflected in the assessment for the 1998 financial year.
</P>
<P>
Nationals of the affected countries will cease to be eligible
for new recruitment to COMESA staff, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the sanctions imposed on the 12 members can only
be lifted only after the apropriate payments are made.
</P>
<P>
Up to November 21, the COMESA secretariat has received 3.49
million dollars representing 76 percent of the 1997 budget
of 4.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the same date, arrears in contributions by member states
stood at about 8.52 million dollars or about two financial years'
COMESA budgets, said the report, adding that to date only three
members are fully paid up.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Senior U.S. and Chinese
defense officials Saturday initialed an agreement designed to
prevent naval accidents at sea as they ended the first-ever formal
defense consultations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Maritime Military Consultative Agreement was worked out
during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington in
October.
</P>
<P>
The two-day defense talks also yielded an agreement on

</P>
<P>
The talks at the Pentagon were led by Walter Slocombe, U.S.
Under-Secretary of Defense and visiting Chinese Lt. General Xiong

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Massacre Documentary Film Discovered in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A documentary film on Nanjing
Massacre that had never been released, was discovered in the
United States, said Tze-ping Shao, first head of a U.S.-based
association in commemoration of Nanjing Massacre victims and the
man who is now keeping the film.
</P>
<P>
The six-week long Nanjing Massacre started 60 years ago today
during which some 300,000 civilians and disarmed Chinese soldiers
were killed by the intruding Japanese troops.
</P>
<P>
Shao, a Chinese-American, said here Friday in an interview with
Xinhua that the 37-minute soundless black-white documentary film
was shot by John Gillespie Magee, a US missionary in China from
1912 to 1940 who died in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Magee, who had been chairman of the Nanjing International Red
Cross Society, used a 16-mm. camera to take scenes of Japanese
soldiers killing, raping or robbing Nanjing civilians in Ginling
University Hospital and other places in the city during late 1937
and 1938, Shao noted.
</P>
<P>
In late 1938, Shao added, Magee's colleague named George
A. Fitch, brought the first part of the documentary to Shanghai at
the risk of his life and made four copies after editing and
entitling the film.
</P>
<P>
Then, Fitch and Magee kept two copies each.
</P>
<P>
The documentary film was mentioned in Bates Documents, left by
Miner Bates, who was in Nanjing for the 30 years preceding 1950.
</P>
<P>
A German diplomat also mentioned the documentary film in his
report submitted to the German Foreign Ministry on February 10,
1938, saying that "the narration of the scenes and the film itself
is a very stunning document."
</P>
<P>
The documentary film had not been discovered till 1990.
</P>
<P>
After an announcement for collecting Nanjing Massacre related
materials made by Shao in New York Times in 1990 publicized,
Fitch's daughter Edith offered her father's film copy and
recollections, and David, Magee's son, found his father's positive
at the basement of his house.
</P>
<P>
David recalled that he had first seen the film in 1938 when he
accompanied his father to London and the documentary film was kept
at his home afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Syria Calls for Better Arab-Iranian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
Al Shara has hailed the Islamic Summit hosted by Tehran as an
opportunity to put Arab-Iranian ties back on track and remove
misunderstandings between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian TV program Beit Al Arab Friday
night, Shara said that the three-day summit, which wound up
Thursday, underscored the importance for Arab countries and Iran
to be in one camp against threats against security and
stability of the region
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the importance of Iran's geographic site for
Arab national security.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister pointed out that Iran has lately taken
"important steps" confirming its desire to end its disputes with
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Iranian condemnation of the terrorist
attack in Luxor, southern Egypt last month indicates the new
Iranian leadership's desire for closer relations with Arab
countries including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Despite Iran's opposition to Middle East peace process, Shara
noted, Tehran demands the implementation of U.N. resolutions
regarding the Middle East and calls for defence of Jerusalem as a
holy city for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is not against peace but against subjection to Israeli
dictates," said Al Shara.

<HEADLINE> New Oil Field Found in Angola Seas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A French company has found an
oil field in Angola with deposits exceeding 100 million tons in
the deep sea near Luanda.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique jointly issued by French Elf
Aquitaine Petroleum Company and Angola's State Petroleum Company,
the oil field, located at a 1250-meter deep sea bed area, 200 km
northeastern of Luanda, has great commercial potential.
</P>
<P>
The French company has 35 percent of the share for the
newly-found oil field. Some other foreign companies, mostly from
Europe, are also involved in tapping the oil field.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that it has been the third oil field Elf
Aquitaine has found in Angola. It has found a oil field with a
reserve of 660 million barrels in May 1996 and another with a
reserve of 700 barrels in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new founding is likely to increase the oil reserve Elf
Aquitaine explores by 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> WTO, EU Leaders Hope for China's Early Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and the European Union (EU) voiced their hope
Sunday that China will join the WTO as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the reaching of the Agreement
on Financial Services, WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero said
he shares the wish that China will be, in the next two years, a
member of the WTO and it "will participate in the negotiation or
the process of the liberalization by making a good offer."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this will be very much in the interest of
China because China will enjoy also, through the participation of
foreign banks and foreign insurance companies, the benefits in its
process of the strengthening of the financial institutions,"
Ruggiero said.
</P>
<P>
China has now had no say in the negotiations to liberalize
trade in financial services as it is not a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
At the 6th session of the Working Party on China's Accession to
the WTO, China's vice foreign trade minister Long Yongtu expressed
China's hope to participate, as a full member of the WTO, in the
next round of negotiations on trade in services which begin on
January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We also share the hope that China will at the earlier possible
date become a member of the WTO," said European Commission Vice
President Sir Leon Brittan.
</P>
<P>
"I was in China a couple of months ago, and had very good talks
with Chinese leaders," he recalled. "We've reached agreement on a
set of principles which, I think, will narrow the area of the
negotiation on China's membership of the WTO."
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can build on that by dealing with some of the other
areas such as services, and in this way make progress toward the
final agreement," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The successful conclusion of
negotiations on financial services today has made 1997 a golden
year of the international trading system, said Renato Ruggiero,
Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"This landmark agreement comes at a critical time," Ruggiero
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"With so much of the world facing economic turbulence,
negotiators from all our members have shown once again the courage
and commitment to pursue the policies of liberalization which are
essential to economic stability, growth and development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
With the Agreement on Financial Services, the WTO has reached
three agreements of historic importance in a year. It reached the
Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Services on February 15 and
the Information Technology Agreement on March 26.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey
Lang, U.S. President Bill Clinton said, "Today's agreement by 70
countries (and regions) to liberalize trade in financial services
will ensure market access in sectors where we lead the
world: banking, securities, and insurance."
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of recent financial instability, it is
particularly encouraging that so many countries have chosen to
move forward rather than backward," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, European Commission Vice President Sir
Leon Brittan said that the agreement would provide opportunities
for providers of financial services all over the world to increase
their activities.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to reach this agreement at the moment because
it will be a sign of the capacity of the world to reach the
agreement with the participation of the countries in Asia,"
Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that it will provide a source of confidence in that
part of the world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Political Parties Turn Cautious on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 13 (Xinhua)-- The mood among political
parties has been one of caution towards economic reforms, local
newspaper Business Standard said here today.
</P>
<P>
While they acknowledged the importance and necessity of
economic reforms, they were clear it would not be at the cost of
the industry.
All political parties agreed there was no need for further
reduction in the tax rates.
</P>
<P>
Jay Dubashi, part of the think-tank of the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP), the biggest opposition party in the country, on
economic issues, said, "I don't see any more scope for reduction
of tax as ours is comparable with rates in other Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
Congress Working Committee member Pranab Mukherjee and
politburo member of the Communist Party of India Prakash Karat
said that they wanted the existing tax base to be widened.
</P>
<P>
On the much-talked about insurance sector reforms, the BJP and
the Congress gave almost similar views -- they welcomed Indian
private sector participation but would not accept foreign
investors in the area. The Left completely opposed privatization
of the sector.
</P>
<P>
On capital account convertibility, Congress leader Pranab
Mukherjee said, "We should move cautiously in this area. We should
not take any hasty decision." The BJP is also for a cautious
approach towards capital account convertibility. Dubashi said that
if there was any hasty decision on the issue the country would
face the same fate as other South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In their recent summit, the World Economic Forum and the
Confederation of Indian Industry have put up some recommendations
which included reduction in tax rates, opening up of the insurance
sector to foreign investors, and full capital account
convertibility.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- 70 participants reached an
agreement on financial services here early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made over four hours behind the original
deadline of 23:00 GMT on December 12.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations were part of the unfinished business of the
Uruguay Round (1986-1993) of multilateral trade negotiations
concluded in 1993.
</P>
<P>
First offers to liberalize trade in financial services made
during the Uruguay Round were improved in 1995 in an interim
agreement which entered into force on September 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
70 members (counting the European Communities as 15) of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) have taken part in the financial
services negotiations which began in April, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The total number of governments which have made commitments in
financial services under the General Agreement of Trade in
Services (GATS) is 102.
</P>
<P>
The results of the negotiation concluded today will be part of
a protocol which will be open for governments to accept until
January 29, 1999. The agreement will enter into force on March 1,
1999 at the latest.

<HEADLINE> Indian Banks to Change Tack on Gold Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 13 (Xinhua)-- India's commercial banks
licensed to import gold are planning to source the yellow metal on
a consignment basis, wherein no purchase price is truck up front,
to hedge against future volatility in domestic prices, bank
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Though they did not burn their fingers in bullion operations
during the past month which was characterized by a steady fall in
prices, the move is to ensure complete insulation from price
fluctuations, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The slide in domestic gold prices has been triggered by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decision in October this year to free
gold import restrictions in the country.
</P>
<P>
With gold import being freed, domestic gold prices are
vulnerable. Banks are moving towards sourcing gold in consignments
and preparing the ground for it.
</P>
<P>
"In such a transaction, the foreign supplier entrusts the gold
with us, and the price is fixed when the buyer comes in," the same
sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has signed an
agreement with the International Program for the Elimination of
Child Labor (IPEC), under which Thailand will get 86,000 U.S.
dollars in grant for teachers training.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to train 164 primary school teachers in
82 rural schools in the prevention and resolution of child labor
abuse.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that teachers play a vital role in spotting,
dissuading and solving the problem of younger teenagers entering
the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The aim of IPEC is to end child labor and abuse by attacking
the root causes -- poverty, and lack of education opportunities
and reliable information on employment.
</P>
<P>
According to an IPEC study, 60 percent of the estimated 250
million under-aged workers worldwide are in Asia. In Thailand, 70
percent of child labor is employed in agriculture, and the
remainder in the industry and service sectors.

<HEADLINE> China to Examine and Register Environmental Auditors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China has formally launched
the examination and registration of the auditors on ISO-14000, a
set of international standards for environmental management, said
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A national registration committee for auditors of the
environmental management system, which has been set up under the
National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa), is in charge of
the work, the English newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The country's environmental protection management auditing is
to be unified under one set of standards, one system and one
certificate to better protect the environment, Zhang Xiaodan, an
official with the registration committee, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that about 55 enterprises across the country
have volunteered to carry out experimentation on the certification
and auditing of ISO-14000 since July 1996.
</P>
<P>
Zhang went on to say that the adoption of ISO-14000 benefits
not only the well-coordinated development of economy and
environment, but also helps to strengthen the government's
supervision on the enterprises' environmental management.
</P>
<P>
"It is also conducive to enhancing the enterprises'
competitiveness in the world trade market, improve their images
and increase their economic and environmental benefits," he added.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 120 countries have adopted and implemented the
ISO-14000.

<HEADLINE> Thai Planning Board Sees Economic Recovery in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's overall economy
will recover in 1999, according to a senior official of the
National Economic and Social Development Board.
</P>
<P>
Wirat Wattanasiritham, secretary general of the country's
national planning board, predicted Friday that Thailand would
achieve economic growth and an inflation rate of 4 percent in
1999-2001.
</P>
<P>
He based his forecast on an exchange rate of between 35 to 36
baht to the U.S. dollar, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
However, the forecast might not be viable as the baht already
crashed past the 45 barrier to close at 45.65 to the dollar
Friday, losing about 77 percent of its value to the dollar since
the baht was floated five months ago at 25.79.
</P>
<P>
Wirat said despite the economic problems, the country could
compete internationally in agriculture, canned food and service
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government should not make more cuts in
the national budget as it will hamper the national economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
He advised instead that the government improve tax collection.
</P>
<P>
In its latest review of the economic growth, released Friday,
the board predicted that the growth rate for the current fiscal
year (October 1, 1997 to September 30, 1998) would be zero.

<HEADLINE> China-Made Electrical Appliances to Dominate Domestic Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese electrical appliances
will not only dominate the domestic market, but also will compete
on the international market by the year 2000, according to
economic predictions.
</P>
<P>
Experts and representatives from the 12 most popular electrical
producers attended a seminar here on development strategy oriented
to the new century.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that the sales ratio of domestic to imported
electrical products now is 8-2, exactly the opposite of a decade
ago. Domestic consumers now favor Chinese name brands.
</P>
<P>
The present achievement was attributed to massive reforms
carried out by large state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Hi-Sense Group of Qingdao, specializing in computers, has
expanded its registered capital from 300 million yuan (37.5
million U.S. dollars) to 3 billion yuan (361 million US dollars)
with 24 subsidiaries set up in China and abroad. This year's sales
will top 5 billion yuan (602 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
One-third of the Haier Group's production and sales are outside
China.
</P>
<P>
Producers were told at the meeting that the central government
will continue its preferential policies. The Bank of China
recently granted an unprecedented bank loan of 3.8 billion yuan
(457 million U.S. dollars) to a state-owned Konca Color TV Group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts warned these promising enterprises of the
need to upgrade the quality of their products.
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat (Uygur), vice-chairman of the Standing Committee
of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), and Wu Changyuan,
vice-governor of Hainan Province, attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parliament Approves 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian National Assembly
(parliament) passed the "financial constitution" for next year, or
the 1998 national budget on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Bulgaria has approved a budget
before the end of the calendar year.
</P>
<P>
The budget revenue is estimated at 3.56 trillion leva (about
2.22 billion U.S. dollars), while proceeds from the sale of
intangible assets and concessions are projected at 20.2 billion
leva (about 12.8 million dollars), according to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The budget expenditures are set at 4.17 trillion leva (about
2.61 billion dollars) of which 1 trillion leva (about 625.8
million dollars) are internal and external debt payments.
</P>
<P>
The defense and security budget is 25.6 billion leva (about
15.9 million dollars) that will be spent in compliance with the
schedule for restructuring the Bulgarian Army.
</P>
<P>
A total of 299 billion leva (about 16 million dollars) will be
spent for wages in the state-financed sectors. The subsidy for the
judiciary is 40.5 billion leva (about 25.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is restricted within 610.8 trillion leva
(about 382.2 million dollars). It will be financed by external
and internal loans, transactions in government securities and
privatization proceeds, expected to be about 540 trillion leva
(about 337.9 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government may issue bonds for external capital markets in
the amount of 200 million dollars and use the proceeds for
restructuring the national debt to facilitate its servicing
without increasing it.
</P>
<P>
A special provision in the law authorizes the government to
negotiate and sign agreements with the G-24 countries for loans in
the amount of 50 million dollars, or their equivalent in another
currency, in a balance of payments support.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mouravei Radev hopes the budget will not be
updated. He said over 50 proposals by MPs have been taken into
consideration in drafting the budget.
</P>
<P>
Economist Stefan Stoilov, a member of parliament, said the
budget spells freezing real-term incomes. Finance Ministry
calculations showed there is an increase of 0.5 to 0.75 percent of
real-term incomes and a 1.3 decrease of real-term pensions next
year.

<TEXT>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Scores Record Cotton Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China's state purchase of
cotton harvested this year has reached a record height of 2.67
billion kilograms, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By December 5, cotton purchased from the country's major cotton
planting areas has exceeded the total amount bought by the state
last year by 680 million kilograms, the paper quoted sources with
the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives,
which is in charge of all state cotton purchases.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dafeng in east China's Jiangsu Province has set a
national record by selling over 50 million kilograms of cotton to
the state this year.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the
country's top cotton producer, is expected to harvest a total of
1.15 billion kilograms of cotton this year, and all the harvest
will be bought by the state.
</P>
<P>
It attributed this year's good cotton harvest to the
introduction of more advanced technology in cotton planting.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government has taken a series of measures during
the purchasing to ensure the target of state cotton purchase is
met.
</P>
<P>
These measures include abolishing purchasing limits, increasing
purchasing standards, ensuring purchasing funds and monopolizing
the purchasing market and offering still better services.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Plunges to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah plunged
to a historic low of 5,400 against the U.S. dollar Friday,
following what many analysts attributed to the announcement that
President Soeharto has called off his plan to attend an informal
ASEAN summit to be held early next week in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was quoted at 5,400 against the dollar at 6:30 p.m.
before it recovered to 5,150/5,250 at 9:15 last night, dealers
said today.
</P>
<P>
The local currency has devalued by more than 100 percent since
the government floated the rupiah on August 14.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono announced here Friday that
the president's team of doctors advised him not to attend the
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit scheduled
for December 15-16.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono, however, reiterated that the president was in good
condition and that his health has restored, but doctors advised
him against traveling.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers also attributed the drop of the rupiah to
regional weaknesses which were driven by the falling South Korean
won.
</P>
<P>
The panic in the currency market spread to the Jakarta Stock
Exchange, which saw its composite index tumble 30.26 points to a
four-year low of 365.85.
</P>
<P>
All foreign investors dumped their local stocks when the rupiah
sank to another new low after the announcement that President
Soeharto would cancel his trip to Malaysia, brokers said today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan governing
Colorado Party presidential candidate Lino Oviedo surrendered to a
military unit in response to the arrest order issued by the
Paraguayan president.
</P>
<P>
Retired General Oviedo, who had eluded capture for the past 44
days, surrendered Friday to the First Infantry Division. He was
accompanied by his platform mate Raul Cubas, his defense counsel
and sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo had been accused of aggravating President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy. Wasmosy forced Oviedo to retire by accusing him of
attempting a coup last April.
</P>
<P>
The former commander of the army and his followers consider
the arrest order part of a persecution campaign unleashed by
President Wasmosy, who is also a member of the Colorado Party.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo was nominated presidential candidate for next year's
general elections during the Colorado Party's primary held last
September.

LUXEMBOURG -- European Union (EU) leaders Friday decided to
establish a euro council in order to manage the planned single
currency and to expand eastward to include the 10 eastern European
candidates and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of 15 EU member countries
Friday made the decision after marathon talks on the first day of
the two-day EU summit held in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The euro council is expected to be an informal and
non-decision-making organization which will be responsible for
coordinating the economic and budgetary policies of euro countries
after the planned economic and monetary union (EMU) is launched in
January 1999. (EU Summit in Luxembourg)

BONN -- Germany's economy would continue its current upswing
and would expect a 2.6-percent growth in 1998, the Ifo economic
research institute predicted Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Munich-based institute, the increase in GDP
next year would be driven by a continued export boom as well as a
modest recovery in the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
However, it also warned that the country's economy still lacks
a solid footing and is likely to be negatively affected by the
recent financial crisis in Asia. (German Economy up 2.6 Percent)

LAGOS -- Ghanaian police have arrested 14 people since a
sectarian clash began in the northwestern town of Wa three days
ago, a police source said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Late on Wednesday in Wa, 500 km northwest of the capital Accra,
members of the Tijaniya Moslem sect attacked the property of the
Al-Sunni sect after provoking preachings by the latter group, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday morning, seven houses, a Mosque, a junior secondary
school, an Arabic school, kiosks and stores belonging to the
Al-Sunni were completely burnt down and their contents destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The car of the regional minister and a police jeep were also
damaged, the source said, quoted by a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place despite warning shot by the police while
troops of the army's airborne force have been deployed in the
town, where they have restored order, the report said. (Armed

BONN -- Germany's parliament Friday decided to launch a special
probe into a series of neo-Nazi scandals that have seriously
damaged the image of the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr.
</P>
<P>
The probe, insisted by the German opposition parties, the
Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, will start next
January with the establishment of a parliamentary investigation
committee.
</P>
<P>
The move was prompted mainly by a major scandal a week ago
after a convicted neo-Nazi, Manfred Roeder, was found to have been
invited to deliver a speech in 1995 to a German military academy
training top officers. (Germany Probes Neo-Nazi)

<HEADLINE> Asian Currency Crisis of Little Concern to Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The high quality of Italian
produced goods means that Mediterranean country has no reason to
fear the ongoing financial crisis in southeast Asia, Italian
Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The characteristics of Italian foreign trade allow us not to
be too concerned about the crisis," Fantozzi said a day after
fragile Asian stock markets plummeted again, raising new fears of
a slump in the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
Falling demand in Southeast Asia affects Italy less than other
countries, the minister said, because Italy's exports are
primarily of quality goods whose appeal usually holds up in times
of crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said quality would also be a key factor when regional
consumers came to choose between Italian goods and local
equivalents made cheaper by currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
On Italian imports from Southeast Asia, the severe devaluation
of the Korean won could make Korea's car industry more
competitive here, Fantozzi said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Italy was also shielded from the crisis in
Southeast Asia because only 6 percent of its goods were exported
to those Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reportedly Nearing Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is said to be nearing a decision to appoint Bill Lann Lee the
government's chief civil rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
White House aides reportedly said they had discussed the option
of Clinton's simply naming Lee to the job at the opening of his
scheduled news conference on Monday. The so-called recess
appointment would mean Lee could serve until the end of the next
session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Mike McCurry said, "The president
hasn't made any final decision on that because the president would
prefer to see him confirmed."
</P>
<P>
Word circulated on Capitol Hill that Clinton would indeed make
the appointment on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 48, has made clear that he will accept if Clinton decides
to appoint him to head the Justice Department's civil rights
division. He told an interviewer he would do so out of concern
that the nation's civil rights laws be enforced.
</P>
<P>
"So if the president asked me to take that job and make sure
that the law enforcement job gets done,... I would really look
forward to doing what I could," Lee said on NBC's "Today" program.
</P>
<P>
Critics say Lee's support of affirmative action makes him unfit
for the job.
</P>
<P>
If appointed or confirmed, Lee would become the first
Asian-American to hold the civil rights post in its 40-year
history.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that Clinton won't decide on a recess appointment
"until he is absolutely certain" there is no other way to put Lee
in the job."

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Decide on Euro Council, Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders
today decided to establish a euro council in order to manage the
planned single currency and to expand eastward to include the 10
eastern European candidates and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of 15 EU member countries
Friday made the decision after marathon talks on the first day of
the two-day EU summit held in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The euro council is expected to be an informal and
non-decision-making organization which will be responsible for
coordinating the economic and budgetary policies of euro countries
after the planned economic and monetary union (EMU) is launched in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that euro countries would be entitled to get
together to discuss problems concerning themselves and that it
might be possible to invite the non-euro countries to attend if
there were issues of common interest to be raised.
</P>
<P>
Britain has announced that it will not join EMU before 2002.
Sweden, Denmark and Greece have also decided to stay out at the
time when EMU will be formally launched.
</P>
<P>
However, all the decisions will only be taken at meetings of
finance ministers from the 15 EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is a little bit unexpected," said French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn after the agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France had a fierce row over a French proposal to
create a special council for the inner circle of countries
planning to be in the first wave of EU member countries joining
EMU at its launch.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac told Britain's Tony Blair
during talks Friday that he must compromise if he wanted an
agreement. "He asked for an effort from Britain if it wanted a
deal," Chirac's spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders also agreed Friday to launch its enlargement
process with the 10 eastern European countries and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the entry talks would be started first with
five-plus-one configuration recommended in July by the European
Commission, the EU's executive body, early next year.
</P>
<P>
The configuration is composed by Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus, six countries the EU
considers to be advanced in both political and economic terms.
</P>
<P>
The other five applicants, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia
and Slovakia, will also begin early next year to participate in
the enlargement process but have to be patient before they can
have truly entry talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The five candidates, which will take part in the "entry
partnerships" like the others, will be assessed on the basis of
their progress to see if they are qualified to join the entry
talks.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed that annual meetings between leaders of these
countries and the EU would take place to evaluate their progress.
The EU noted that the entry negotiations could last some ten years
for certain candidates.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, was excluded from the enlargement process
though it was the first candidate which has been applying for EU
membership since 1963. Turkey was accused of failing to satisfy
the EU's political criteria, such as improved human rights record
and respect of democracy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the EU also accused Ankara of lack of efforts to
improve its relations with neighboring country Greece, which has
long been firmly opposed to Turkey becoming an EU member.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with the exclusion, Turkey Friday turned down an EU
invitation to dine with its leaders on Saturday after the summit
is closed.
</P>
<P>
In spite of Turkey's rejection, the EU leaders still agreed
that it was politically difficult to exclude Turkey from the
"European family."
</P>
<P>
France, backed up by Germany, has proposed a European
conference which will group all the eleven EU candidate and Turkey
in order to discuss issues of common interest as a configuration
of 15 plus 12.
</P>
<P>
A European conference lacks substance if Turkey is not
attending, according to EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek.

<HEADLINE> German Economy to See 2.6 Percent Growth in 1998: Ifo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy would continue
its current upswing and would expect a 2.6-percent growth in 1998,
the Ifo economic research institute predicted today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Munich-based institute, the increase in GDP
next year would be driven by a continued export boom as well as a
modest recovery in the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
However, it also warned that the country's economy still lacks
a solid footing and is likely to be negatively affected by the
recent financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Germany's unemployment could rise further to 4.45
million in 1998 compared with 4.39 million this year, the Ifo
said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Emergency Post-Conflict Aid to Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a credit for Rwanda equivalent to some 8
million U.S. dollars, under the IMF's policy of emergency
post-conflict assistance.
</P>
<P>
The previous credit under the same policy of about 12 million
dollars equivalent was approved by the institution on April 22
this year to support the government's economic program for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The major objectives of the program were to attain a real GDP
growth rate of 12.7 percent, an inflation rate of 7 percent, and a
level of gross official international reserves equivalent to 4.4
months of imports.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda joined the IMF in September 1963. Its quota is about 80
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
totals about 34 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Help Southeast Asian Countries Weather Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Robert D. Hormats today called on the U.S.
government to rethink about the impact of Southeast Asian
financial turmoil and give bail-out support to the region.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal at an Asia Society-sponsored conference on
"Tigers" in Transition to analyze the financial difficulties in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad's
keynote address to the conference, Hormats said the Administration
needs "to do a lot of selling" to Congress and the American public
to underscore the needs of U.S. support to the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the signal that the United States has so far given to
the region is that "there is no American money", and that the U.S.
"is really pulling back from responsibilities" in the notion that
each region should take care of its own financial problems.
</P>
<P>
He said there seems much "inward-looking view" among some
members of the Congress that the financial problems in Southeast
Asia do not affect much on them or that the money should be spent
at home.
</P>
<P>
Actually the wave "has begun to wash out on our own shores", he
said, referring to recent New York Stock Exchange's downturn
partly due to the psychological impact stemmed from the weakening
performance of some U.S. firms in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the region is not wholly regional and there is no
substitute to the approach of the U.S. except encouraging the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to lend more support or taking
its own initiative in this direction, Hormats said.

<HEADLINE> Business Costs in Western Countries Higher than in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries have lower
business operating costs than western countries for international
investment, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a survey of costs in 27 countries by the Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU), the newspaper said that business in
industrialized nations incur far higher wage and infrastructure
costs than in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in general, nations in southeast Asia are
between 10 and 60 times cheaper for business than western
countries.
</P>
<P>
The countries surveyed include those which had attracted
significant inward investments and others with the potential to
woo foreign companies in the future.
</P>
<P>
The study, which is based on wages and employers' costs, office
and industrial rents, telecommunications, corporate taxes,
expatriate costs, business travel and corruption, found that
Germany is the most expensive of the countries surveyed, with a
relative score of 100.
</P>
<P>
Then come the US, with 91.8 and Belgium with 89.4.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all score less than
six, and South Africa has the lowest score of only one.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State Visits Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said here today that the Angolan Peace
Process is now approaching an end, but certain tasks stipulated
in the peace agreement are still unaccomplished.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the statement during her brief visit here in
Angola after her visit in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
She expressed regret that Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
failed to come to Luanda for the meeting and appealed to the
former rebel movement to shift its headquarters to Luanda, or
risk the danger of being excluded from political life.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state started her visit in Angola at
noon. Before she reached Luanda, Albright had visited Cabinda,
an oil-producing area in northern Angola where she met with the
country's Minister of Petroleum Albina Assis.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered in Cabinda, she said the United States
enjoys good cooperation with Angola in the field of petroleum.
U.S. oil import from Angola had accounted for seven percent of
its total import, almost four times its import volume from
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will further its economic cooperation with Angola,
she said, adding the U.S. Import and Export Bank will invest 90
million Dollars in oil tapping in Cabinda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she added, the bank is undertaking negotiations
with Angola National Petroleum Corporation and Chevron Oil
Company in the United States on the provision of 350 million
Dollars to purchase petro equipment from the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to her, revenues from petroleum is of vital
importance to Angola's rehabilitation, the disbanding of
remaining militiamen and the consolidation of national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the fifth leg of Albright's African tour. During her
short stay in Angola, she also met with Angolan President Eduardo
dos Santos on peace process in the country and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state also held talks with Blondin Beye,
U.N. representative in Angola and UNITA leaders in Luanda on
issues concerning the peace process.
</P>
<P>
This is Albright's first visit to Angola in here present
capacity. Her next stop is South Africa.

<HEADLINE> US Cautiously Welcomes Some OIC Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
gave a cautious welcome to resolutions approved by the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) summit in Teheran with
respect to dialogue and anti-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We give a cautious welcome to a moderate tone that seems to
have been struck in some... of the resolutions. We welcome, for
instance, the call for cooperation, dialogue and positive
understanding among cultures and religions, and the rejection of
the ideology of confrontation," State Department spokesman James
Foley told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Foley also said the United States "supports the OIC's
condemnation of terrorism in all forms and methods and the
statement that the killing of innocent people is forbidden in
Islam."
</P>
<P>
"We support the OIC's call that the campaign against
international terrorism should continue and that the granting of
asylum to terrorists should be stopped," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the United States rejected the OIC's call for the lifting
of sanctions against Libya, Foley said. He also expressed
disappointment that the summit did not offer open support for the
Middle East peace process, as previous summits have done.
