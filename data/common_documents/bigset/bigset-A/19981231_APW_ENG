	   BOISE, Idaho (AP) _ John Welsh threw for four touchdowns and
Idaho forced six turnovers in beating Southern Mississippi 42-35 in
the Humanitarian Bowl on Wednesday.
	   The Vandals (9-3) capped only their third Division I-A season by
surprising a team that was favored by 16 1/2 points. Welsh was
24-of-41 for 291 yards, but the outcome wasn't secure until Derrick
Nix lost Southern Mississippi's sixth fumble of the game at
midfield with 2:30 to play. Nix rushed for 126 yards and three
touchdowns, but also fumbled twice in critical situations.
	   After Southern Miss (7-5) rallied from a 14-point deficit to tie
it 35-35, Welsh drove Idaho 65 yards for the winning touchdown. His
21-yard scramble helped set up his 28-yard pass to Ryan
Prestimonico with 4:36 left.
	   ``These guys were rated 112th in the nation about 90 days ago,
but it's not where you start, it's where you finish,'' Idaho coach
Chris Tormey said.
	   Idaho's inventive offense bothered the Golden Eagles all day,
using no-huddle schemes and five wideouts in short-yardage
situations.
	   Idaho led 35-21 with 10 minutes to play, but Lee Roberts, who
threw for 342 yards, combined for the second time on a scoring pass
with Sherrod Gideon to cut the deficit to seven points.
	   Idaho punter Mike O'Neal shanked a kick and the Golden Eagles
drove 45 yards for the tying touchdown, which came on a 15-yard run
by Nix with 6:37 left.
	   Southern Miss led 21-7 after Nix's second touchdown run of the
game early in the second quarter, but Welsh threw three TD passes
in the final 5 1/2 minutes of the half as Idaho went ahead. Welsh's
2-yarder to Michael Moody made it 28-21 as time expired.
	   The second edition of the Humanitarian Bowl attracted 19,664,
over 3,500 more than attended last year's inaugural game.
Organizers were worried a storm would hit Boise on game day, but
for the second year, the nation's coldest bowl was played in crisp
temperatures under mostly sunny skies.

	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ Engineers made final adjustments
Thursday to a football stadium-sized balloon designed to carry
three men to record heights and hopefully nonstop around the world.
	   Specialists were preparing to attach the giant, fragile balloon
to the capsule that will carry the three around the earth at
altitudes near the edge of space.
	   But the final countdown for the mission has not yet started and
may again be delayed by dangerously strong winds blowing over the
launch zone in the Australian Outback.
	   Denver real estate magnate Dave Liniger, Albuquerque, New
Mexico, journalist Bob Martin and Australian balloonist John
Wallington will decide after a weather briefing later Thursday
whether to start the countdown clock or hold off for another 24
hours.
	   ``We're just tying up loose ends, the pilots are making some
last-minute adjustments'' said Dan Pedersen, the former U.S. Navy
captain and test fighter pilot who is the team's mission control
director.
	   ``But you can't control the wind.''
	   Engineers and scientists worked late into Wednesday night after
a weight distribution problem was found in the six steel cables
that will connect the fragile balloon with the spaceship-like
capsule upon which the pilots' lives will depend.
	   Temperatures soared to almost 100 F (38 Celsius) at the
Australian Balloon Launch Center Wednesday as more than 60 people
continued final preparations for the Team Re/Max International bid.
	   But winds strong enough to make a launch too dangerous continued
to buffet the desert launch zone near Alice Springs, in central
Australia.
	   The team's own forecasters say weather conditions are looking
good for a dawn takeoff on New Year's Day local time (1930 GMT Dec.
31). The next weather forecast was due at 3 p.m. Thursday local
time (0530 GMT).
	   Until launch, the team were ``checking and rechecking every
circuit, every life support component,'' of the capsule, the
balloon and the radio guidance systems on the ground, Liniger said.
	   The 7-ft. by 8-ft. (2.1-meter by 2.4-meter) capsule will hang
below a balloon made of lunch wrap-thin polyethylene plastic that
when fully inflated is 460 feet (138 meters) in diameter and 700
feet (210 meters) high _ large enough to envelope the Houston
Astrodome or two 747 jet liners nose-to-nose.
	   More than a dozen previous attempts to circle the planet
non-stop by balloon have failed, often when the balloon was forced
down by bad weather.
	   The team hopes to avoid adverse weather by flying in the
stratosphere about 25 miles (40 kilometers) above the earth.
	   That's higher than any previous manned balloon flight.
	   ``There's no question that it's more dangerous than the other
missions,'' which flew at altitudes no greater than 40,000 feet
(12,000 meters), Liniger said.
	   ``The other people, if they get in trouble they can slowly go
down and sit down in the ocean. If we get into trouble, we're 25
miles up.''

North Korean defects to South

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A North Korean man arrived in Seoul
Thursday and sought asylum after fleeing his hunger-stricken
homeland, intelligence officials said.
	   Park Yong Soo, 33, had been living in hiding in a ``third
country'' since leaving North Korea in August 1996, officials at
the Agency for National Security Planning said.
	   The government generally uses the term ``third country'' to
avoid naming China, which is required by treaty with North Korea to
return defectors to their homeland.
	   The agency said Park had worked at a fur plant near Pyongyang
before leaving the North but declined to reveal further details.
	   About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past
three years. All complained about severe food and fuel shortages in
their country.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They fought the Korean War in 1950-53 and
never signed a formal peace treaty.

Five years into NAFTA, the strong survive

	   McALLEN, Texas (AP) _ For Victor Jaramillo and his family, NAFTA
has been a gateway to the American dream. For Teodoro Guido, it's
become a Mexican nightmare.
	   The North American Free Trade Agreement helped Jaramillo start
his own U.S.-based business, Red and Hot Produce, to import and
distribute dry hot pepper and other crops grown in his home state
of Zacatecas in central Mexico.
	   ``The mentality is different here, because only good merchandise
sells,'' he said. ``In Mexico, you can sell whether your product is
good or bad.''
	   Guido, a pork farmer from Guanajuato, another central Mexican
state, has struggled to compete with cheaper U.S. imports. He
blames the free trade accord for driving many of the farmers in his
hometown of Iramuco out of business in recent years.
	   Five years after it started tearing down trade barriers between
the United States, Canada and Mexico, NAFTA has become a
survival-of-the-fittest test for businesses and farmers.
	   Big, innovative producers that have adapted to changing market
conditions have prospered. Smaller producers sticking to old
methods have sometimes been trampled over.
	   For labor, it's been more of a tossup. New jobs have been
created; old jobs have been lost.
	   Those who had opposed NAFTA and warned, like Ross Perot, of a
``giant sucking sound'' of U.S. jobs moving to Mexico say time has
proven them right. Advocates say the benefits have outweighed the
drawbacks.
	   Both sides use statistics to support their case. The AFL-CIO
estimates between 300,000 and 400,000 American jobs have gone to
Mexico since 1994.
	   The U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce maintains that 1.7 million
export-related jobs have been created in the United States since
1993 largely because of NAFTA. The U.S. government says trade
between Mexico and the United States has soared, rising from dlrs
80 billion before NAFTA to about dlrs 200 billion now.
	   ``The balance has been favorable for both countries,'' U.S.
ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow said, noting that Mexico is
now the United States' second-largest trading partner after Canada.
	   ``Mexico's trade with the United States has been a primary
factor in its continuing recuperation from the peso crisis,'' he
said, referring to the economic meltdown of 1995. ``And U.S. trade
with Mexico has been a bright spot, especially during the last
year, at a time when our trade with much of the rest of the world
has declined or stayed flat.''
	   NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, linking more than 360 million
consumers in a dlrs 6 trillion market. Over 15 years, it will
gradually eliminate all trade barriers between the three nations.
	   NAFTA included side agreements intended to protect the
environment and labor rights. It also gave Mexicans new
opportunities to work in the United States,
	   Jaramillo, the hot pepper importer, became eligible under NAFTA
for a U.S. trader/investor visa to open his own business two years
ago in the border city of McAllen, Texas.
	   For years he had made little money trying to sell his peppers in
Mexico City. Then he found out about the McAllen Produce Terminal
Market, a project just 3.5 miles (5 kilometers) north of the border
designed to help Mexican farmers become their own U.S.
distributors.
	   Now he's enjoying a middle-class life in the United States and
the chance to give his two children a better future.
	   ``They will have more opportunities for all kinds of things;
it's going to be a great advantage for them,'' he said. ``Education
is better here, and they will not have to worry about economic
turmoil in Mexico.''
	   In Iramuco, Guido's home town, residents are also heading north
of the border _ but under different circumstances.
	   ``People are desperate because now there's no way to make a
living,'' he said.
	   Small farmers say they have a tough time competing against U.S.
farm imports because American producers tend to be much larger and
more efficient, helping keep prices lower. Mexican farmers also
have a hard time getting loans, now carrying high interest rates.
	   While Guido has chosen to stay in Iramuco, he estimates that
about a third of the 15,000 residents have opted to cross the
border as undocumented aliens.
	   As a result, a bus from the tiny town makes daily, 16-hour trips
directly to the border town of Nuevo Laredo, across from Laredo,
Texas.
	   But on the U.S. side of the border, unions say jobs have been
heading south. Companies that have moved operations to Mexico since
NAFTA include Zenith Electronics Corp., Nintendo of America,
Mattel, Sara Lee Knit Products, Vanity Fair Mills and Pendleton
Woolen Mills.
	   General Motors and other companies, which had operations in
Mexico before 1994, have gradually moved more of their production
to Mexican plants. They insist the moves were made independently of
NAFTA.
	   Luring business to Mexico is the lower cost of labor. While the
wages for production workers in the United States have grown
steadily, those of Mexican workers have fallen, after adjustment
for inflation, since the 1995 economic crisis. Mexico's minimum
wage is only dlrs 3.40 a day. The minimum wage in the United States
is, in comparison, dlrs 5.15 an hour.
	   NAFTA advocates say the treaty didn't cause the jobs to leave
the country. They say companies looking for lower wages can just as
easily take their plants to such other low-wage countries as China,
India or the Dominican Republic.
	   ``What is affecting American workers is the process of
globalization,'' Davidow, the U.S. ambassador, said.
	   Unions reject that argument. ``There is no way to know where
companies would have gone in the absence of NAFTA,'' Thea Lee,
spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO in Washington, said in a telephone
interview.
	   Unions also claim that the agreement has failed to protect
worker safety and guarantee the rights of Mexican workers to
organize unions. Eight of the nine complaints filed against Mexican
employers under NAFTA have alleged violations of the right to
organize unions.
	   While these and other issues remain, Davidow said NAFTA includes
means for helping resolve trade woes and noted that agreements have
been reached in several disputes, such as those involving Mexican
imports of avocados, tomatoes and tuna.
	   Still unresolved is an argument over Mexican trucking. In 1995,
citing safety concerns, the Clinton administration blocked
implementation of a NAFTA provision that would allow Mexican
haulers to carry goods into California, Arizona, New Mexico and
Texas.
	   As NAFTA enters its sixth year and trade barriers continue
dropping or disappearing, changes are expected to take place at an
even faster rate.
	   ``Change has not been as drastic as it could become in the next
five years,'' said Jaive Torres, head of the foreign trade
department at the Commerce Secretariat in the northern Mexican city
of Monterrey, about 150 miles (241 kilometers) south of the border.
	   A joint survey by Bank of Montreal, Harris Bank of Chicago and
Mexico's Grupo Financiero Bancomer concluded that the three
economies will become more tightly linked as businesses expand
further.
	   As a result, ``a larger, 'borderless' North American economy
will emerge,'' predicted Jeff Chisholm, vice chairman of Bank of
Montreal.

After months of deadlock, Mexican Congress agrees on 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lower house passing tax part of bill. &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With only hours to spare, the Congress
finally began approving the 1999 budget narrowly saving Mexico from
a constitutional crisis.
	   The months-old deadlock between the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party and four opposition groups was broken late
Wednesday when the House of Deputies approved the package's tax
bill by a 349-131 vote.
	   Still being debated overnight were the package's expenditure and
other bills, but congressmen said an overall compromise was reached
earlier between the ruling party, known as the PRI, and the
conservative National Action Party.
	   The leftist Democratic Revolution Party, the second largest bloc
in the House of Deputies, voted against the tax bill along with the
tiny Labor and Green parties. Some of the legislation now becomes
law, but other items in the package must still be approved by the
Senate, where the PRI still holds a majority.
	   After 69 years, the PRI lost its House majority in mid-term
elections last year. The deadline for approving the budget was Dec.
31, but the constitution does not specify what will happen if it is
not approved.
	   At the root of the dispute was a pressing need to finance a dlrs
2.86 billion shortfall, due mostly to low world prices for crude
oil of which Mexico is a major exporter. Up until last year, export
revenues by the state petroleum monopoly had financed two-thirds of
the budget.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo had proposed a series of tax
increases, including a 15 percent telephone surcharge on top of the
current 15 percent sales tax. Opposition parties, who now have the
majority in the lower house, opposed the plan, as did business and
civic groups.
	   Zedillo had warned that a budget deficit bigger than 1.25
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) would unleash major
inflation, shoot up interest rates, reduce jobs and disrupt markets
and the economy.
	   The compromise worked out Wednesday made up for the shortfall by
including at least dlrs 1.4 billion in spending cuts, a higher
corporate income tax rate than Zedillo had proposed, and higher
diesel fuel prices charged by the state-owned oil monopoly.
	   The revised dlrs 103 billion budget also calls for higher
tariffs on goods from countries with which Mexico doesn't have free
trade agreements. Those tariffs will not affect major trading
partners such as the United States, Canada or much of Latin
America.

Future of Tokyo neighborhoods may be up on a rooftop
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Tomihisa neighborhood suffers from many of the
same problems afflicting inner city areas all over the world.
	   Graffiti and trash clutter abandoned buildings. Homeless sleep
in shelters fashioned from cardboard boxes. High school kids huddle
in a vacant lot while one keeps watch on the street.
	   But Yoshiko Masuda has a plan to save Tomihisa.
	   The Tokyo architect wants to tear the neighborhood down and
rebuild it, narrow back alleys, tree-studded parks, shrine and all
_ on top of a new seven-story building.
	   As outlandish as her idea might sound, city planners see
Masuda's project as a possible blueprint for the future.
	   ``This could serve as a precedent,'' says Seigo Maruta, an
official at the Housing and Urban Development Corp.
	   The neighborhood is a microcosm of the problems that have
befallen urban Japan since the land development craze that swept
over much of the country during the booming 1980s.
	   A quiet neighborhood of two-story wooden houses clustered in an
area the size of a New York City block, Tomihisa became the site of
particularly frenzied buying because of its proximity to a major
entertainment and office area.
	   At the boom's peak in 1992, developers with briefcases full of
cash knocked on doors offering to buy houses on the spot. Residents
sold out as lots that cost the equivalent of dlrs 375 in the 1950s
were snapped up for dlrs 5.6 million, says Hiroichi Shoji, head of
the Tomihisa neighborhood association.
	   When the bust came, development plans evaporated and Tomihisa
was left with weed-filled lots, vacant buildings and a growing
crime rate. Almost half the neighborhood sits unused six years
later.
	   ``Our town became a slum,'' says Shoji, who's lived in Tomihisa
for 50 years.
	   Masuda wants to lift Tomihisa above all that.
	   Moving residents into new houses built on a rooftop 92 feet (28
meters) above the street will make security easier to manage: The
only entry will be elevators and stairwells fitted with locks.
	   The architect's design also aims to stem the flight of residents
to the suburbs by adding new amenities, including a community
center complete with day care, a nursing home and a gym.
	   Masuda says the project makes economic sense, too.
	   Renting out space in the building beneath as offices and regular
apartments is expected to cover the dlrs 60 million to dlrs 70
million construction cost and provide extra income for Tomihisa
residents as they retire.
	   ``I was looking for a way to make the community last,'' she
says.
	   While penthouse dwellings on rooftops have a long history in
urban architecture, no one's ever attempted to build _ much less
transplant _ a neighborhood to the top of a building.
	   Experts caution that similar, more modest projects in the past,
such as putting parks atop urban buildings, have generally not been
well received by the public.
	   ``Given the choice, people prefer to go about their private
lives on the ground and ascend buildings only to work,'' says
Terunobu Fujimori, a professor of architecture at the University of
Tokyo.
	   But architects agree Masuda's design could be different.
	   At 2.5 acres (1.01 hectares), the roof would large enough for
life in Tomihisa to feel like it did on the ground. There would be
plenty of room to toss a ball, take a stroll down a shaded lane,
even enjoy a picnic.
	   Residents have given the neighborhood association near unanimous
support to pursue the project, but some admit to unease.
	   ``I've never wanted to live in a building with an elevator,''
says one middle-aged woman, who asks to remain anonymous to avoid
angering neighbors.
	   The most formidable hurdle has proved to be buying up the vacant
lots and abandoned buildings.
	   The banks that took over the properties from defunct developers
refused to sell to avoid recording the loss. Then there was the
hefty price tag: dlrs 25 million even at today's vastly deflated
prices.
	   Japan's recession has actually provided a breakthrough, however.
	   Since June, the government has been pumping billions of dollars
into urban renewal projects in an effort to boost its stagnant
economy. Some of that may flow to Tomihisa.
	   Persistent lobbying has put the neighborhood near the top of the
government's list of projects to finance, and money could be
available in 1999, says Maruta at the Housing and Urban Development
Corp.
	   Once construction starts, Masuda says she can get the project
done in about two years.
	   ``Tomihisa will just be the first,'' she says.

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Just when Nebraska and Arizona were settling
into a defensive struggle, the Holiday Bowl reverted to its wild
past.
	   Keith Smith, half of Arizona's two-quarterback system, threw for
one fourth-quarter touchdown and his scrambling set up the
game-winning, 1-yard plunge by Kelvin Eafon with 6 minutes, 8
seconds to go as the No. 5 Arizona Wildcats beat the No. 14
Nebraska Cornhuskers 23-20 Wednesday night.
	   Arizona added to its school-record victory total by finishing
12-1. The Wildcats were knocked out of a Rose Bowl berth when UCLA
was upset by Miami on Dec. 5, but Arizona made the most of its
first Holiday Bowl visit by winning for the 16th time in 17 games.
	   The bowl-record crowd of 65,354 saw a rarity _ Nebraska's
first-four loss season in 30 years. The Cornhuskers finished 9-4
under first-year coach Frank Solich, who replaced Hall of Famer Tom
Osborne.
	   Chris McAlister, Arizona's All-America cornerback, capped a big
game with a leaping interception of Eric Crouch's pass with 3:03
left. McAlister jumped in front of Shevin Wiggins at about the
8-yard line and returned it 22 yards.
	   Nebraska had one final desperation shot, but McAlister deflected
Crouch's pass as time expired.
	   After a scoreless third quarter, there were three lead changes
in the fourth.
	   Arizona went ahead 16-13 on Smith's 15-yard pass to Brad
Brennan, who made a fingertip catch before tumbling into the end
zone on the first play of the fourth quarter. The Wildcats
converted one fourth down and one third down on the 66-yard drive.
	   McAlister had a chance to really swing the momentum when he
intercepted Crouch's pass deep in Nebraska territory, but split end
Kenny Cheatham forced and recovered a fumble.
	   Nebraska went on to complete the eight-play, 88-yard drive
thanks to two big catches by tight end Tracey Wistrom, including a
4-yard TD pass from Crouch with 10:55 left for a 20-16 lead.
	   Smith then led the Wildcats 68 yards to the winning score. He
had scrambles of 20 yards, 8 yards on a third-and-6 and then 7
yards to the Cornhuskers 1 to set up Eafon's TD.
	   The Cornhuskers' option game continued to struggle, and their 87
rushing yards was their second-lowest total of the season.
	   The Cornhuskers did get hot right before halftime, scoring 13
points in the final 4:58 of the second quarter to take a 13-9 lead.
	   The defense was already well on the way to holding Arizona to
just nine yards in the second quarter when Chad Kelsay forced
Ortege Jenkins to fumble, which Loran Kaiser recovered at the
Arizona 34. That set up Kris Brown's 25-yard field goal.
	   Crouch threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Shevin Wiggins for a
10-9 lead. Nebraska got the ball right back when Billy Legate hit
kick returner Dennis Northcutt head-on, forcing a fumble and
recovering it at the Arizona 9. Brown kicked a 23-yard field goal
as time expired.
	   Wiggins atoned for fumbling a punt in the game's opening
minutes, which McAlister recovered to set up the first of Mark
McDonald's three field goals.
	   Arizona's Trung Canidate gained 101 yards on 22 carries.

South Korea to sell Korea First Bank to U.S. financial firms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea agreed Thursday to sell
heavily indebted Korea First Bank to an American financial
consortium in a bid to boost foreign investors' confidence in its
crisis-hit economy.
	   The Newbridge Capital-GE Capital Services consortium outbid HSBC
Holdings PLC of Britain to take over 51 percent of Korea First
Bank, which is currently owned by the government, said bank
officials.
	   They refused to divulge further details until the government's
Financial Supervisory Commission makes a formal announcement later
Thursday.
	   But the national Yonhap News Agency, quoting commission
officials, reported that Newbridge and GE Capital will raise its
stake to 75.5 percent next year.
	   Thursday's sale is part of a promise by South Korea to
restructure its financial sector and open it to foreign investment
in return for a record dlrs 58 billion economic bailout package
announced by the International Monetary Fund a year ago.
	   When the economy slowed down and companies began collapsing last
year, Korea First and other banks were left with mountains of bad
loans, triggering a sudden loss of international confidence that
led to the country's financial crisis.
	   So far, the government has poured 3.6 trillion won (dlrs 3
billion) into Korea First Bank to write off half of its bad loans.
It also bought 94 percent of the bank's shares.
	   The bank has shed 2,900 workers, or 38 percent of its total work
force, and closed down 74 of its 413 retail branches across the
country in a restructuring program aimed at wooing foreign
investors.
	   President Kim Dae-jung has considered bank reform crucial to
restoring investors's confidence in the country.
	   South Korea so far has shut down 16 merchant banks and four
insurance companies and forced five small commercial banks to be
merged with bigger banks.
	   Major commercial banks are discussing more mergers as the
government is offering tax benefits and debt write-offs as
incentives.
	   Foreign banks are allowed to open retail branches, but the cost
of matching the vast number of branches owned by existing South
Korean banks would be prohibitive. That makes the takeover of an
existing bank especially attractive, experts say.
	   GE Capital is a unit of General Electric Of the United States.
Newbridge Capital Ltd. is a Texas-based investment fund.

Sweden advances to semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) _ Henrik Sedin scored three goals to
help Sweden clinch first place in the B Pool at the world junior
hockey championship with a 5-4 victory Wednesday over Belarus.
	   In other games, Slovakia defeated the United States 3-2,
Kazakstan shut out Switzerland 3-0, and Canada topped the Czech
Republic 2-0.
	   The victory gave the Swedes a 3-0-0 record, with one game left
against Kazakstan (1-1-1) in the round-robin portion of the
competition. Russia, second in the five-team pool with a 2-1-0
record, plays Switzerland (1-2-0) Thursday night.
	   The top three teams from each of the two pools advance to the
medal round, with the first-place squad getting a bye to the
semifinals. The second-place team in one pool plays the third-place
team from the other pool in quarterfinal action Saturday.
	   Slovakia remained atop the A Pool, finishing with a 3-0-1
record. Canada (2-0-1) takes on the United States (0-3-0) Thursday
night, while Finland (1-2-0) goes against the Czechs (1-2-0) in a
battle for third place in the pool. A win by the Canadians would
give them first place in their pool.
	   The Swedes almost wasted a 5-1 lead against Belarus.
	   Sedin, who has been tabbed as a potential top-five NHL draft
pick along with his brother, Daniel, scored twice in the first
period.
	   Christian Berglund and Marcus Kristoffersson made it 4-0 by 7:04
of the second period before Kanstantsin Kaltsou broke the shutout.
	   Sedin made it 5-1 at 3:58 of the third, but Pavel Bely scored
for Belarus at 5:06, Kaltsou scored again just eight seconds later
and Aliaksei Andreyeu made it a one-goal game at 6:28.
	   The Swedes were forced to kill back-to-back minor penalties in
the final minutes of the game to survive with the win.
	   Berglund also had three assists and Daniel Sedin two assists.
	   Kaltsou took over the lead among tournament scorers with four
goals and two assists.
	   Nikolay Antropov had one goal and an assist for Kazakstan in the
victory over Switzerland. Rostam Yessirkenov and Nikolay
Zarzhytskiy, shorthanded, also scored for Kazakstan.
	   The Slovaks _ the big surprise of the tournament _ did all they
could to put themselves in position for a bye to the semifinals.
	   Michal Hudec scored with 24 seconds left in the third period to
give the Slovaks the victory over the United States in a
penalty-filled contest. More than a dozen minors were called.
	   Miroslav Zalesak and Brian Gionta exchanged goals in the second
period.
	   Douglas Janik gave the Americans a 2-1 lead 3:24 into the second
period, but Roman Macoszek tied the game at 7:24.
	   Brian Campbell and Daniel Tkaczuk scored for Canada in the
victory over the Czech Republic. Goaltender Roberto Luongo made 29
saves for his second shutout of the tournament. Canada has allowed
just four goals in three games, matched only by Russia.

Dackell's overtime goal gives Senators victory over Sabres
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Andreas Dackell scored 2:24 into
overtime to give the Ottawa Senators a 3-2 victory over Dominik
Hasek and the Buffalo Sabres on Wednesday night.
	   Dackell, who added two assists, snuck the puck past Hasek for
his seventh goal of the season.
	   Shawn McEachern scored two goals for Ottawa, including the tying
goal in the third period.
	   Hasek made 41 saves for the Sabres, who lost their second
straight home game. The Sabres' last two-game losing streak at home
was in 1997.
	   Damian Rhodes, making his fourth start of December and first in
six games after battling the flu, stopped 21 shots for Ottawa, who
snapped their three-game road losing streak.
 &UR; Devils 3, Capitals 2
	   In Washington, Bobby Holik scored with 12:46 remaining to extend
New Jersey's unbeaten road streak to seven (6-0-1).
	   Washington, the defending Eastern Conference champions but mired
with the second-worst record in the conference this season, was
trying to win back-to-back games for only the second time this
season.
	   Vadim Sharifijanov and Brian Rolston also scored for the Devils.
	   Michael Pivonka, who missed the first 29 games recovering from
shoulder surgery, scored his first of the year for the Capitals.
 &UR; Penguins 7, Panthers 4
	   In Pittsburgh, Kip Miller scored two goals for the first time in
eight years to lead Pittsburgh to an easy victory.
	   Robert Lang and Martin Straka also scored twice as the Penguins
won despite allowing a pair of shorthanded goals.
	   Radek Dvorak scored two goals for Florida, including the team's
first shorthanded tally. Viktor Kozlov also scored shorthanded.
 &UR; Maple Leafs 4, Mighty Ducks 1
	   In Toronto, defenseman Jason Smith had a goal and an assist and
Tannick Tremblay scored his first of the season in Toronto's win.
	   Tie Domi and Fredrik Modin also scored for Toronto, which took
39 shots on Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert.
	   The Leafs ended a seven-game homestand with a 4-3 record. The
loss ended Anaheim's three-game road unbeaten string.
	   Anaheim's Paul Kariya, who entered the game second in the NHL in
goals, had an assist but went his sixth consecutive game without a
goal. He has just one goal in his last 13 contests.
	   Teemu Selanne spoiled Curtis Joseph's shutout bid at 6:50 of the
third period.
 &UR; Bruins 5, Predators 2
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Sergei Samsonov's goal helped Boston
snap a season-high, three-game losing streak.
	   It was the Predators' first home loss since Dec. 5. The win gave
the Bruins a record of 14-1-3 against 1990s expansion teams in
their first seasons of play. Boston is 10-5-2 in its last 17 games.
	   Anson Carter, Peter Ferraro and Steve Heinze added goals for the
Bruins.
	   Sebastien Bordeleau spoiled Boston goaltender Rob Tallas'
shutout bid midway through the final period, tipping Patrick Cote's
pass from the left corner past him.
 &UR; Coyotes 3, Rangers 1
	   In Phoenix, Rick Tocchet's goal at 18:16 of the second period
helped Phoenix win despite the absence of Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy
Roenick.
	   Nikolai Khabibulin turned back 28 shots for the Coyotes.
	   Daniel Briere and Bob Corkum also scored for Phoenix, whose top
two players were out with injuries. The Coyotes also were minus
Dallas Drake, serving a suspension.
	   Niklas Sundstrom scored the lone goal for the Rangers, who have
lost six of their last eight games.
 &UR; Hurricanes 4, Lightning 3
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Kevin Dineen, Gary Roberts and
Ron Francis each scored third-period goals to rally Carolina.
	   Dineen and Roberts scored 53 seconds apart early in the third
period while Francis beat Bill Ranford with 1:07 left.
	   Wendel Clark scored three goals for the Lightning.
	   Paul Coffey, acquired Tuesday night from Chicago, didn't score
in his Carolina debut.
	   The loss by Tampa Bay denied Jacques Demers his 400th NHL
coaching victory.

 &UR; Singapore officially in recession, 4th quarter negative

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore fell into recession as 1998 ended,
according to negative growth figures for the fourth quarter
revealed in Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's New Year's speech
Thursday.
	   The city-state's growth for the last three months of the year
was a negative 1.5 percent, Goh said in his speech.
	   That follows negative growth in the third quarter, and means
Singapore is in recession, according to the International Monetary
Fund's definition of two consecutive quarters of reverse growth.

Pakistan hangs first person sentenced to death by military court in
</HEADLINE>
Karachi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Authorities on Thursday executed the
first person sentenced to death by a special anti-terrorism
military court in the southern port city of Karachi.
	   Ashraf Irani, in his early 30's, who was convicted in the second
week of December of killing a policeman, was hanged at the Karachi
Central Prison early Thursday, prison officials said. President
Rafiq Tarar rejected his mercy appeal on Wednesday night.
	   Three other people convicted in the same case received prison
sentences ranging from 10 to 14 years.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has recommended that the president
not issue any pardons to people sentenced by the military courts,
the English-language daily, The News, reported Thursday.
	   The government set up military courts last month to try persons
responsible for ''violence and terrorism'' in Karachi, where more
than 1,000 people have been killed in political and religious
violence in 1998.
	   In October, the government imposed direct federal rule in Sindh
province of which Karachi is the capital. The government suspended
civil rights in Sindh and ordered the army to help curb the
violence in Karachi.
	   Opposition parties and human rights groups have bitterly
criticized the government's moves. They have accused it of
violating the constitution and undermining the judiciary by setting
up the military courts.
	   But Sharif says these steps are needed to restore order in
Karachi _ the main commercial hub and the only port city of
Pakistan.

India makes three changes for limited-overs series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ India made three changes Thursday
to its squad for the limited-overs section of its cricket tour of
New Zealand.
	   Veteran opener Navjot Sidhu, teenage offspinner Harbhajan Singh
and medium fast bowler Robin Singh Jr., will return home after the
third test which starts in Hamilton on Saturday.
	   They will be replaced by offspinners Hrishikesh Kanitkar and
Nikhil Chopra and allrounder Robin Singh Sr.
	   Kanitkar has been recalled to the Indian team after three years
away. Chopra played in Sharjah in September and is also a useful
batsman and Singh Sr., is a one-day specialist. (djp)

Hunter: Players to make their ``final'' offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with league disputing Bryant's statement &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. National Basketball Association players
plan to make their own ``final'' offer, hoping to end a 6-month
labor dispute that threatens to scuttle the entire season of play.
	   ``I have called David Stern and requested an opportunity to
present it to the owners' labor committee as soon as they're
available, and certainly before the Jan. 7 date that Stern has set
as the owners' deadline,'' union director Billy Hunter said on
Wednesday, refering to the league commissioner.
	   Union president Patrick Ewing said the new proposal should be
ready before Friday.
	   Stern said Monday that if the players brought him something new,
he'd present it to his negotiating committee. The lockout is
essentially a strike by the owners, who are angered over the high
cost of players' salaries.
	   In Houston, a federal court judge rejected an injunction sought
by Nick Van Exel, Marcus Camby and Reggie Slater for unconditional
letters of clearance from the NBA and USA Basketball. The three
want to play the rest of the season in Europe _ even if the lockout
ends.
	   U.S. District Judge Sim Lake told the plaintiffs they could
submit their dispute to an arbitrator, and agent James Bryant said
he would do so.
	   The union then tried to contact John Feerick, dean of Fordham
University law school, to set up an expedited hearing Thursday or
Friday.
	   ``In open court, the NBA's attorney stipulated that Dean Feerick
can decide the case within 24 hours,'' Bryant said.
	   Jeffrey Mishkin, chief legal officer for the NBA, said Bryant's
statement was completely untrue.
	   Mishkin also was unaware that the union was trying to contact
Feerick.
	   Ewing, meanwhile, said the owners' ``final'' offer _ which the
commissioner presented earlier this week _ would not be put to a
vote of the general membership unless a majority asked for it.
	   So far, only a handful of players, including Jayson Williams and
Kevin Willis, has openly called for a chance to vote.
	   ``If the majority of the players call up and say they want a
vote, then we're bound to vote,'' Ewing said. ``But yesterday we
had a conference call and we put the question to them if they want
a vote. And as of today, no one has called to demand that we put it
to a vote.''
	   Negotiating committee member Jim McIlvaine told players they
could call him at home if they wanted to express their concerns
privately and anonymously; no one did.
	   ``The committee's job is to do the will of the majority of the
players. If we get indications that they would like some proposal
voted on, we'd have to follow through on it,'' McIlvaine said.
``But reading about it in the paper or hearing it from an agent
doesn't cut it for me. I need to hear it from the players.''
	   The commissioner sent each player a copy of a letter he wrote to
Hunter asking for a vote.
	   ``While it is your prerogative to reject our proposal, the
consequences of that decision will be so catastrophic to your
members that simple fairness suggests they be given a chance to be
heard,'' Stern wrote. ``Accordingly, we request and strongly urge
that you put the NBA's final offer to a vote of the entire union
membership.''

Thailand negotiates with U.S. to upgrade fighters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICOOL BROOKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand is negotiating with the United
States to upgrade Thai air force fighter jets following the
termination of a contract to buy eight F/A-18s due to the economic
crisis, a U.S. official said.
	   The U.S. Embassy official said Wednesday that the talks were
part of an ongoing dialogue on Thailand's defense needs but were
``still in the preliminary stages.''
	   ``It would therefore be premature to identify any weapons
systems that Thailand might procure from the United States,'' the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   But a Bangkok-based U.S. arms dealer familiar with the
negotiations said on condition of anonymity that the talks may
concern the sale of used F-16 fighters and upgrades to enable the
planes to carry the advanced AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air
missiles.
	   The sophisticated missiles are currently not used by any air
force in the region, but Thailand's southern neighbor, Malaysia,
has bought Russian-built MiG-29 fighters, which carry an equivalent
missile.
	   Southeast Asia was in the midst of a mini-arms race before the
economic crisis led to recession and defense cutbacks across the
region.
	   Thai officers say an arms race is financially impossible now.
	   Lt. Gen. Somsak Salyakmtorn, director of the Thai armed forces'
civil affairs office, said that the country was not worried about
the Russian hardware going to Malaysia.
	   ``We are all working toward the same goal of developing the same
defense capability, which is to be conducted in a transparent
manner in order to maintain trust and a balance of power in the
region,'' Somsak said.
	   In an unusual move aimed at easing Thailand's burden, President
Clinton allowed Thailand to terminate a contract to buy F/A-18s and
lose only the dlrs 74.5 million down payment.
	   The contract had called for dlrs 317 million more to be paid for
delivery of the jets or a penalty of dlrs 250 million to cancel it.
	   The Bangkok Post reported Wednesday that Thailand hopes to trade
dlrs 40 million in F/A-18 spare parts already delivered to help pay
for used F-16s.
	   Thai military officers visited Washington in Decemeber to
discuss F-16 prices, reportedly about dlrs 8 million for a used
model. A follow up visit is planned in February, Thai generals say.

Gridiron bombs in the Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ As college football titles and the Super Bowl
approaches, efforts by an American promoter to establish gridiron,
or American football, in the rugby union-mad Pacific Islands
appears to have bombed badly.
	   An inaugural match due to have been played in the Fiji capital
of Suva on Tuesday between Fiji and Tonga didn't happen because the
Tongan team didn't show up.
	   Disappointed spectators seeking a refund for their 5 Fijian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.50) ticket were told by Fiji Gridiron
Association manager Aisake Seru that there had been difficulties
getting the Tongan team flown to Fiji since the airline had wanted
ticket money up front.
	   He promised games would be played on the weekend or next
Tuesday.
	   A local travel company which organizers said had arranged travel
for the Tongans denied having done so when contacted by The
Associated Press.
	   In the Cook Islands, games scheduled to begin 10 days ago were
also delayed.
	   Local organizer John Teao said the delay was cause by ``backing
American companies being tied up in hotel deals in Tonga.''
	   Local newspaper The Cook Island News reported that no airline
bookings had been made for a 40-player gridiron squad asked to go
to New Zealand.
	   American promoter Isiah Cater, describing himself as ``Director
of Football for the U.S. National Professional Minor League
Football Conference,'' said the organization was ready to invest
money in establishing gridiron in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Papua New
Guinea, Vanuatu, the Cook Islands Australia, New Zealand and
perhaps Nauru.
	   He claimed that a Pacific championship between 14 teams would be
played during June to August 1999.
	   Cater said about 144,000 Fijian dollars (U.S. dlrs 72,000) had
been spent teaching Fijian ruby union players to play gridiron.
	   After's Tuesday's flop, Cater told a Fiji radio station he
``might have to pack up and leave if things don't fall into
place.''
	   ``We'll treat it like a business and take it as a loss,'' he
said.
	   Alice Tabete, chief executive of the Fiji Sports Council, said
ground maintenance staff had been called back from Christmas
vacation to prepare the national stadium in Suva, which had been
closed for repairs.
	   Fiji's Sports Minister Jonetani Kaukimoce directed that the
stadium be prepared for gridiron.
	   Tabete said the association wanted a 5,000 Fijian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 2,500) deposit from the gridiron promoters before considering
another date for the Tonga-Fiji match. (rkr-rs/djp)

	   Goh said that 1999 ``will be another difficult year,'' and cast
doubt on predictions by the government's own Ministry of Trade and
Industry that the economy would grow slightly or decline by only 1
percent.
	   ``MTI has forecast that the Singapore economy should grow by
between minus 1 percent and plus 1 percent in 1999,'' Goh said.
``But the prospects are very uncertain.''
	   After escaping the immediate effects of the Southeast Asian
economic crisis when it hit in 1997, they caught up with Singapore
in 1998.
	   More than 30,000 people have been laid off, bankruptcies are up
and for the first time the government has gotten involved in
limited welfare programs.
	   Despite wage freezes, tax and fee reductions and other measures
aimed at keeping Singapore competitive and encouraging
international businesses to stay, more layoffs next year will be
unavoidable, Goh said.
	   ``Our economy is driven primarily by external demand,'' Goh
said. ``The environment has changed swiftly. Contagion has spread
from country to country.''
	   ``While we have not been spared,'' he said, ``our economy has
been much less affected than others.''

	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Four weary yacht crews faced seeing in
the New Year at sea overnight Thursday night as they limped toward
the finish after surviving mountainous seas and gale-force winds in
the Sydney-to-Hobart race.
	   Four sailors were killed in the race and two others are missing
and presumed drowned.
	   Of the original 115 yachts which set out Dec. 26 on Sydney
Harbor, race officials expected a further 13 to get into Hobart on
Thursday, bringing to 42 the number of finishers in the
tragedy-marred race after the majority withdrew.
	   Liquid Asset, Allusive, Ocean Road and Misty are the four yachts
that will not finish until Friday. (djp)

Pitch could favor returning Warne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Shane Warne can expect a receptive
pitch for his test comeback with the Sydney Cricket Ground wicket
expected to aid spinners in the latter stages of the fifth test
against England beginning Saturday.
	   However, Sydney Cricket and Sportsground Trust chief executive
Noel Neate on Thursday predicted the test strip would also offer
early assistance for pacemen.
	   Warne, hoping to play his first test in eight months following
shoulder surgery, collected two expensive wickets for Victoria in
his last Sheffield Shield outing against New South Wales earlier
this month.
	   ``The pitch looks to be good, obviously we would expect it to
turn in the latter part of the game, but there should be a bit in
it for the quicks in the early part,'' Neate said.
	   ``The ground has come up superbly, it's as we expected and if
the players can pull a good one out of the bag, I don't think the
ground will have a bearing on the game.''
	   Warne was included as one of three spinners in the Australian 12
along with fellow legspinner Stuart MacGill and Colin Miller, with
some reports suggesting Warne was third in line to start.
	   However, Warne's likely return, along with England's fourth-test
victory in Melbourne, has sparked an upsurge in ticket sales with a
bumper crowd expected for the opening day on Saturday.
	   ``Obviously the result in Melbourne has rekindled a bit of
interest,'' Neate said. ``I think we're looking for the best first
day of a test match that we've had for quite some time, I wouldn't
be at all surprised to see it nudge up towards the 40,000 mark.''

Singapore officially in recession, 4th quarter negative
</HEADLINE>

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore fell into recession as 1998 ended,
according to figures in the prime minister's New Year's message
Thursday that revealed the economy shrank by 1.5 percent during the
last quarter of the year.
	   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong avoided the word recession and put
a positive spin on the news by saying the city-state's growth for
the entire year was 1.3 percent and described it as ``not a bad
performance, considering the unfavorable climate.''
	   But this would be the second straight quarter that the economy
here has shrunk. The International Monetary Fund defines recession
as two consecutive quarters of contraction, putting Singapore in
the same recession boat as other Asian countries such as Thailand,
Malaysia and Japan.
	   Singapore's economy shrank by 0.7 percent in the third quarter,
which was the first time since the recession year of 1986 that it
has recorded a year-on-year contraction.
	   Although the government had hinted at the possibility that
recession might come in 1999, leaders were hoping that the first
two quarters of positive growth _ 6.1 percent and 1.6 percent _
would buoy up the economy through the end of the year.
	   ``However, for 1998 as a whole, the economy grew by 1.3
percent,'' Goh said in a statement distributed to news media.
	   Goh said that 1999 ``will be another difficult year,'' and cast
doubt on predictions by the government's own Ministry of Trade and
Industry that the economy would grow slightly or decline by only 1
percent.
	   ``But the prospects are very uncertain,'' he said.
	   The immediate effects of the Southeast Asian economic crisis
missed Singapore in 1997 but caught up with the resource-scarce
republic of 3.1 million people in 1998.
	   More than 30,000 people have been laid off, bankruptcies are up
and for the first time the government has gotten involved in
limited welfare programs.
	   Despite wage freezes, tax and fee reductions and other measures
aimed at keeping Singapore competitive and encouraging
international businesses to stay, more layoffs next year will be
unavoidable, Goh said.
	   ``Our economy is driven primarily by external demand,'' Goh
said. ``The environment has changed swiftly. Contagion has spread
from country to country.''
	   ``While we have not been spared,'' he said, ``our economy has
been much less affected than others.''

South Korea to sell Korea First Bank to U.S. financial firms

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea agreed Thursday to sell
heavily indebted Korea First Bank to an American financial
consortium in a bid to boost foreign confidence in its crisis-hit
economy.
	   The consortium, led by Texas-based investment fund Newbridge
Capital Ltd., outbid HSBC Holdings PLC of Britain to take over 51
percent of Korea First Bank, which is currently owned by the
government.
	   The deal marked the first takeover of a major Korean commercial
bank by foreign investors. Members of the Newbridge consortium
include GE Capital Services, a unit of General Electric of the
United States, and several other investors.
	   ``It will help boost the country's credibility abroad,'' said
Chun Joo-sung, an economist at Seoul's Ewha Woman's University.
``The deal is significant in that it could trigger an influx of
foreign investment in the domestic bank industry.''
	   President Kim Dae-jung's government has insisted on selling
Korea First Bank to foreigners to demonstrate its willingness to
restructure and open its cloistered domestic financial sector to
foreign investors.
	   The government first bought a 94 percent stake in the bank by
investing 1.5 trillion won (dlrs 1.2 billion). It then poured 3.6
trillion won (dlrs 3 billion) to write off half of the bank's bad
loans.
	   The bank also was forced to shed 2,900 workers, or 38 percent of
its total work force, and closed down 74 of its 413 retail branches
across the country this year in a restructuring program aimed at
wooing foreign investors.
	   Lee Hun-jai, head of the Financial Supervisory Commission, said
in a news conference that to help the deal go through, the
government also promised Newbridge that it would take over all
loans that go bad over the next year.
	   Newbridge will complete the purchase of its stake in Korea First
Bank by May, Lee said. Other details will be worked out later, he
added.
	   When the economy slowed down and companies began collapsing last
year, Korea First and other banks were left with mountains of bad
loans, triggering a sudden loss of international confidence that
led to the country's financial crisis.
	   Bank reform was a key condition of the record dlrs 58 billion
economic bailout package announced by the International Monetary
Fund a year ago.
	   Lee said South Korea will sell another ailing bank owned by the
government, Seoulbank, to foreigners in January.
	   South Korea so far has shut down 16 merchant banks and four
insurance companies and forced five small commercial banks to be
merged with bigger banks. Major commercial banks are discussing
more mergers.
	   Foreign banks are allowed to open retail branches, but the cost
of matching the vast number of branches owned by existing South
Korean banks would be prohibitive. That, say analysts, makes the
takeover of an existing bank especially attractive for overseas
banks.
	   Newbridge is affiliated with Texas Pacific Group, a closely held
U.S. investment firm based in Fort Worth, Texas.

	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Khmer Rouge leaders under
controversial government protection checked into a secluded
Cambodian beach hotel for a holiday Thursday as U.N. officials
pondered dwindling options for bringing them to justice for
genocide.
	   After basking in red-carpet treatment in Phnom Penh for two
days, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea began a tour of the country they
helped turn into a bloody slave-labor camp when the leftist Khmer
Rouge movement held power from 1975 to 1979.
	   Escorted by military police providing tight security, the two
drove with their families in luxury vehicles to the seaside town of
Sihanoukville, the first leg of a tour that will take them to the
ancient Angkor temple complex and their home provinces.
	   Along the roads, they will pass memorials stacked with the bones
and skulls of thousands of their victims, irrigation ditches dug by
hand under the murderous eye of Khmer Rouge overseers and fields
strewn with mines from years of civil war.
	   The two guerrilla chiefs, who share blame for the deaths of up
to 2 million Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge, emerged from years
in the jungles last week and sealed a defection deal with Prime
Minister Hun Sen that included assurances they would not face
trial.
	   They told a news conference Tuesday that they were ``very
sorry'' for the reign of terror but refused to accept personal
responsibility, inviting survivors to ``let bygones be bygones.''
	   They did not speak to reporters Thursday on arriving at the best
hotel in Sihanoukville, where they had rooms with a view of the
Gulf of Thailand 50 meters (yards) away across sparkling sands.
	   The de facto pardon they are receiving from Hun Sen, which
contradicted earlier pronouncements by him that remaining Khmer
Rouge leaders would stand trial if captured, has shaken hopes that
the architects of their murderous rule will ever face justice.
	   At the request of Cambodia's leaders, the United Nations sent
legal experts to Cambodia last month to assess evidence against
senior Khmer Rouge members and offer recommendations for a
tribunal, either overseas or in Cambodia.
	   ``The defection of Noun Chea and Khieu Samphan does not change
the plans,'' said Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N.'s top human rights
officer for Cambodia, from his home in Sweden.
	   ``We intend to present their recommendations as soon as possible
to the government and hope for a constructive discussion,''
Hammarberg said.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, who initially voiced support for Hun
Sen's defection deal, said Wednesday he would in fact not provide
amnesties for Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea because of ``undeniable
discontent'' among a majority of Cambodians in seeing them go free.
	   Hun Sen has since been silent, but as Cambodia's most powerful
man he can easily pressure the pliant courts to ensure there is no
trial.
	   Hopes for prosecution now seem to rest with the United Nations,
which can pass resolutions to try Khmer Rouge leaders overseas
through an as yet non-existent international tribunal.
	   Sihanouk voiced his support for that option when he said the
international community had ``the perfect right to take up the case
of genocide in Cambodia'' because it was a crime against humanity.
	   However, Hun Sen's cooperation would be needed to arrest them.
	   Several possibilities are being considered by the U.N. team,
according to Hammarberg, who said it was necessary to send a
message to future generations in Cambodia that atrocities must be
punished.
	   ``Considering the scale and the brutality of the Khmer Rouge
crimes, genuine healing in Cambodia will be extremely difficult
without a justice process,'' Hammarberg said.
	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and forced the
population to toil in Maoist-inspired agricultural collectives. One
Cambodian in five died of overwork, starvation, disease and
systematic executions.
	   The revolutionaries were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese
invasion, but fought a guerrilla war from the jungles.
	   In 1996, Sihanouk granted amnesty to one leader, Ieng Sary, who
led thousands of fighters to peace. The Khmer Rouge has since
dwindled to near-extinction and poses no threat to the central
government.
	   Many in Cambodia dispute Hun Sen's assertion that amnesty is
needed for Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to prevent renewed war.
Pressure is growing for someone to be held accountable for Khmer
Rouge crimes.

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Sixteen inmates
escaped in three separate prison breaks in southeastern Chiapas
state, a top official said. Five of them were recaptured, including
four who were wounded by gunfire.
	   State attorney general Eduardo Montoya Lievano said the escapes
Wednesday in the towns of Simojovel, Playas de Catazaja and
Ocosingo _ which included a prison disturbance _ were unrelated.
	   In a telephone interview, Montoya blamed negligence or possible
complicity by guards in the three prisons. He said a number of
guards were detained for questioning, but refused to give details.
	   All the fleeing inmates were serving time for homicide and other
major felonies. Prisons in the state are generally overcrowded.
	   The first break occurred early Wednesday when two inmates
serving time for murder fled the jail in Simojovel, in the northern
part of the state.
	   Montoya said the guards there initially told investigators 10
armed men wearing ski masks, like those used by Zapatista National
Liberation Army rebels, freed the two prisoners. But he added that
account proved untrue later, but gave no further details.
	   ``There is no indication they were involved, it appears there
was negligence by the guards,'' he said.
	   Friday marks the fifth anniversary of a brief uprising by the
Zapatistas, who took up arms Jan. 1, 1994, and fought the army for
12 days until a ceasefire was called. About 145 people were killed
in the fighting then.
	   Later in the day, nine convicts serving time for homicide
escaped during a prison mutiny in Playas de Catazaja. The prisoners
rioted to protest the lack of drinking water.
	   Montoya said the guards opened fire, wounding four inmates. The
four and another inmate were later recaptured. He said the
disturbance was quelled, but several guards are being questioned.
	   At about the same time, five inmates walked out of the prison in
Ososingo, a town in the jungle in the southern part of the state,
without anyone doing anything to stop them, Montoya said.

Police in Singapore charge politician for public speech

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Police in Singapore charged an opposition party
leader Thursday for allegedly giving a political speech without a
permit earlier this week, and served him a court summons at his
home.
	   Chee Soon Juan, secretary-general of the 200-member Singapore
Democratic Party, was ordered to appear in Subordinate Court on
Monday. If convicted, he faces a fine of 5,000 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 3,030).
	   Chee, 36, had addressed a crowd of more than 250 people during
the lunch hour Tuesday on a lawn at Raffles Place in Singapore's
business district. He criticized the government's economic, human
rights and foreign affairs policies.
	   In a statement faxed to the news media Thursday, Chee said the
charge against him ``for speaking in public is another attempt by
the government to silence me and stifle the growing voice of
democracy in Singapore.
	   ``This is a clear violation of my fundamental rights to freedoms
of speech, assembly, and association guaranteed in the constitution
of Singapore,'' he said. ``I will attend court and face my accusers
with a conscience and conviction to continue to speak up for my
rights, and in so doing, the rights of my fellow citizens.''
	   The Singapore Police Force had earlier issued a press statement
saying the summons had been served on Chee at his home Wednesday
night. ``The investigation revealed that Dr. Chee has committed an
offense of giving a talk in public place without a license under
Section 18 (1) (a) of the Public Entertainment Act,'' said the
police statement.
	   Chee had ignored three warnings from uniformed police who told
him not to speak. He announced to the crowd that if he could, he
would appear again at the same time and place on Jan. 5.
	   The unusual public speech was his only way of disseminating
information, Chee said, because the government had banned his
party's political video, blocked information from being posted on
the Internet about candidates during the last election, refused or
delayed until the last minute issuing permits for public lectures,
and fined him for trying to sell his book on Asian human rights
violations.
	   The People's Action Party has ruled Singapore for 38 years, and
holds 81 of the 84 elected seats in Parliament.

World Cup champions prepare for defense of title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Defending World Cup-champion Sri Lanka
will look to this month's triangular limited-overs series with
Australia and England to overcome poor form in advance of the 1999
championships.
	   With their aging team in a form slump and on a five-match losing
streak in limited-overs cricket, the tour gives the Sri Lankans a
welcome chance to sharpen up their one-day skills and bring in some
new faces.
	   They lost all four games at their most recent tournament in
Sharjah, including twin losses to Zimbabwe.
	   In the 1998 calendar year, they won 11 and lost 12 of 23 one-day
games to rank fifth in the world.
	   The previous year, they won 19 and lost only seven of 28
matches.
	   Team manager Ranjith Fernando admitted Thursday his side was
struggling for form, but said their focus was now on the 1999 World
Cup, to be held in England.
	   ``We are the World Cup champions and that carries a heavy
burden,'' he said. ``There is a lot of pressure and the
expectations are high, but it is not always possible to maintain
winning momentum in the one-day game.
	   ``Australia is going to be a hard tour, but we've always come
through when the going is tough and we're very confident of
ourselves.''
	   Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga echoed Fernando's thoughts
and said the triangular series would help identify the best talent
for the World Cup.
	   ``We have been looking at some of the younger players and we are
building a side now,'' Rantunga said.
	   ``There are a couple of young players on this tour and we have
to get the best possible combination for the World Cup.''
	   Sri Lanka plays Australia A in a day-night match on Sunday in
Perth, and the same teams meet again in Adelaide on Tuesday.
	   The limited-overs tournament begins on Jan. 10 when England
plays Australia in a day-nighter at Brisbane's Gabba, followed by
England against Sri Lanka at the same venue the next night. (djp)

Indonesian military searches for three kidnapped soldiers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Attacks on the Indonesian military
have escalated in a northern province where hundreds of troops
searched Thursday for three kidnapped soldiers.
	   Suspected rebels abducted the soldiers Wednesday in Aceh
province, one day after a mob of villagers armed with machetes
pulled soldiers off a bus and killed seven of them.
	   The armed forces recently ended a decade-long campaign against
separatist guerrillas in Aceh, but many residents remain bitter
about atrocities committed by the military.
	   Violence this week jeopardized Jakarta's efforts to ease
tensions in the Sumatra island province by withdrawing troops and
handing over security affairs to community leaders. The more
conciliatory approach followed the ouster of former authoritarian
President Suharto in May.
	   Several hundred troops have returned to Aceh, at least
temporarily, and military chief Gen. Wiranto warned he will not
tolerate attacks on his forces.
	   Two marines and an army sergeant were being held by an
unidentified group in the village of Blang Panjang, the military
said.
	   The daily Kompas newspaper reported that assailants had seized a
soldier and offered to turn him over to the military. When four
officers arrived, the kidnappers abducted them also but two later
escaped, Kompas said.
	   Blang Panjang lies on the outskirts of the coastal city of
Lhokseumawe, where a mob on Wednesday attacked a police station and
burned two police cars.
	   Some 25 people have been arrested in the killings of seven
off-duty soldiers in the Aceh village of Lhok Nibung. Another 10
soldiers who were forced off the bus managed to escape.
	   Fearing more violence, residents stayed off the streets of
Lhokseumawe on Thursday. A day earlier, mobs stopped vehicles and
asked for identification along a main highway leading out of the
city.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a staunchly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting for
an Islamic state for decades.
	   The military says 760 people died in fighting since the late
1980s, but human rights groups put the death toll higher. Mass
graves have been uncovered and some women allege they were raped by
soldiers.

Cowboys hoping Deion's big toe will heal by Saturday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNE H. FREEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) _ The painful big left toe of Deion Sanders
remains the Dallas Cowboys' biggest playoff mystery.
	   It's apparent the team plays better with him. They are 2-4
without him in the lineup doing his thing on punt returns,
occasional big plays on offense and tenacious coverage on pass
defense.
	   ``It's a timing thing, and we don't have much time,'' said
Sanders, who is listed as ``doubtful'' for Saturday's NFC playoff
game against the Arizona Cardinals.
	   Doctors say the toe is sprained and there's really nothing
modern medicine can do to get it well. Sanders worked alone at
practice on Wednesday, but didn't participate in drills with the
team.
	   ``It's in the hands of the Lord,'' Sanders said.
	   Dallas lost its last four games last season after Sanders
sustained a rib injury. He has missed games in the past because of
baseball, but his absence has never hurt the Cowboys like it has
this season.
	   The Dallas players have almost given up thinking Sanders will be
able to give them any help in the playoffs.
	   ``We've had to play without him in the lineup, and we just might
have to face up to the fact that's the way it's going to be in the
playoffs,'' Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston said. ``Hopefully he'll
be out there Saturday moving around, but it will be a big bonus if
he's able to play.''
	   ``There's nothing that can be done to alleviate the pain,''
Johnston said. ``You hear about it and think it's just a minor
injury. But it's not. And you can't take a shot where the sprain
is.''
	   Running back Emmitt Smith said Sanders' injury is much worse
than a turf toe.
	   ``A toe is a very important part of the body,'' Smith said.
``I've never had anything like Deion has. I've had turf toes but
this is much worse. It's not even close to a turf toe.''
	   Smith said Sanders wants to play.
	   ``It's frustrating to him and frustrating to us,'' Smith said.
``We know we're a better team with him in the lineup. But we've won
two games without him now. We just have to mentally prepare without
him.''
	   Trainer Jim Maurer said Sanders was ``still feeling pain but not
as much. The MRI he had shows the area is healing but there's still
swelling in the joint of his toe.''
	   Quarterback Troy Aikman said it would be a big morale boost for
the Cowboys if Sanders could play on Saturday.
	   ``We miss Deion,'' Aikman said. ``Hopefully, we'll get him back.
Our fingers are crossed. If not, we'll just have to play without
him.''

Police accused of harassing prominent Chinese dissident's wife
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The wife of a prominent dissident in China said
Thursday that police have been making harassing phone calls to her
home and have refused to allow visits with her jailed husband.
	   The humiliating treatment given democracy campaigner Xu Wenli
and his wife underscores the uncompromising mood of the ruling
Communist Party in pressing its widest crackdown on dissent in at
least three years.
	   He Xintong said she went to Beijing's Half-step Bridge detention
center Wednesday, but police refused to let her see Xu or leave a
change of clean winter clothes, his first since being arrested Nov.
30.
	   She has met with Xu only once in the past month, immediately
after a Beijing court convicted and sentenced him to 13 years in
prison for subversion on Dec. 21.
	   Xu passed a note to her Monday via his lawyer. In it, he
defiantly labeled his conviction ``political persecution'' and said
he would not appeal.
	   At the meeting with the lawyer, Xu was in handcuffs, a treatment
He said was normally given to convicted murderers. She said other
dissidents held in the detention center have described it as
overcrowded, with inmates being made to sleep on the floor, even in
the harsh cold of winter.
	   Despite Xu's jailing, police have kept He under surveillance,
with officers posted outside her home, she said. She has been
receiving frequent nuisance calls, up to 20 an hour. When she picks
up the receiver no one answers.
	   ``Yesterday I disconnected the phone. As soon as I plugged it
back in the phone calls immediately started again,'' He said.
``This is really senseless.''
	   Xu's 13-year sentence was the longest given a dissident in three
years, a backhanded testament to his reputation as a potent
organizer in the dissident community. He was put on trial for his
leading role in trying to organize an opposition political party.
	   Two other influential figures in the China Democracy Party, Qin
Yongmin and Wang Youcai, were also sentenced at separate trials to
12 and 11 years in prison. All three were charged with the same
crime, inciting the subversion of state power.
	   Two other dissidents active in the party, Shi Wanbao and Liu
Xianbin, have been placed under house arrest in two cities in
southwestern Sichuan province, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported
Thursday.
	   One other dissident was convicted of subversion in November:
writer Ma Zhe got 7 years in southern Guizhou province, apparently
for trying to publish an independent literary journal, the
Information Center said.
	   The Communist Party crackdown has prompted dissidents in China
and in exile to protest and demand the release of the democracy
campaigners.
	   One prominent exile, Wang Xizhe, is now in the fourth day of a
hunger strike outside the United Nations in New York. He was
drinking only water, and his supporters said his health, already
bad from years of imprisonment in China was weakening.
	   Twenty-three writers, actors and other artists and intellectuals
planned to stage a symbolic 24-hour hunger strike on New Year's Day
to press for the release of Xu, Qin, Wang, writer Ma and others.

It's official: Zolak to face Jaguars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD ULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ His fractured finger has been
X-rayed repeatedly, encased in a bandage and held together by a pin
that sticks out the top. For at least one more game, though, it
won't be guiding any passes to receivers.
	   The expected became official Wednesday when Drew Bledsoe was
declared out of the New England Patriots' playoff game Sunday at
the Jacksonville Jaguars.
	   ``It is extremely disappointing,'' he said after coach Pete
Carroll announced he wouldn't play. ``You go through a year's worth
of hard work and games with the goal of getting a shot in the
playoffs. When you are not on the field, it's tough to deal with.''
	   For the third straight game, Scott Zolak will be on the field in
his place, hoping to improve on a poor performance in last Sunday's
31-10 loss to the New York Jets that ended the regular season.
	   ``As the weeks progress, I feel more and more comfortable,'' he
said. ``I'm excited about playing in the playoff. Let's get this
thing going.''
	   Zolak, an eight-year veteran, will make his first playoff
appearance. A little more than two weeks ago, he made his first
start in three years in a 24-21 upset win over San Francisco that
clinched a playoff berth.
	   He played well then and welcomes the chance to bounce back from
the Jets' game in which he completed 14-of-31 passes for 127 yards.
	   ``I don't wish that he (Bledsoe) was hurt,'' Zolak said. ``On
the other hand, you don't want to go out on a note like last week.
You want another chance to redeem yourself and prove some people
wrong.''
	   If the Patriots win, they'll play in Denver the following Sunday
and Bledsoe, a three-time Pro Bowl player, could return if his
right index finger has healed sufficiently.
	   ``It'll be something we'll evaluate next week,'' he said.
	   Bledsoe fractured his finger Nov. 23 against Miami when his hand
hit defensive lineman Shane Burton on a follow-through late in the
fourth quarter. But he led the Patriots to last-minute wins in that
game and the following week against Buffalo and directed a 23-9
victory over Pittsburgh.
	   But the following week, two pins put in the finger for
protection shifted and were replaced during the game by a single
pin intended to promote healing. He was ineffective and the
Patriots lost to St. Louis 32-18.
	   Now, nearly three weeks later, that pin is part of the reason he
can't play.
	   If it stays in, it could break if he plays, doing further damage
to the finger that might require major surgery to remove the
pieces, he said. If it comes out so he could play, the healing
process would be set back.
	   Meanwhile, he feels he can help Zolak in practice this week and
in the game Sunday.
	   ``I know Scott real well and I know what he likes to throw and
doesn't like to throw,'' Bledsoe said. ``I also have taken a more
active role with our receiving corps during practice, pointing out
little things that I can see.''
	   On Sunday, it will be up to Zolak to get the ball to those
receivers.

Hostages rest, receive luggage, as bodies of dead examined
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Survivors of a bloody rescue operation that
killed four Western kidnap victims tried to get back to normal life
Thursday, collecting luggage scattered in their abduction and
resting at an Aden hotel.
	   But their two day ordeal at the hands of militant Islamic
captors still haunts them.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' a tearful Laurence Whitehouse, a
54-year-old schoolteacher from Hampshire, England, said in the
hotel's elevator Thursday as a porter carried his and his slain
wife's luggage to his room.
	   Margaret Whitehouse, 52, was among the hostages killed.
	   Tension was visible on another freed hostage, Briton David
Holmes.
	   ``No passports, no cameras, no money, nothing,'' he said in the
hotel lobby, complaining that the luggage retrieved from the battle
scene had some items stolen by the kidnappers before their retreat
under army fire.
	   In the nearby Al-Jamhuriya Hospital, the bodies of four slain
hostages _ three Britons and an Australian _ were examined by an
American Embassy doctor Wednesday night. They were being prepared
to be transported out of the country.
	   Yemeni security officers arrived at the hotel Thursday to
interview the former hostages before the Westerners leave this
southern port for the capital of San`a in the northern mountains
later in the day. The hostages were expected to fly home on Friday.
	   Some hostages have disputed the Yemeni government's claim that
security forces opened fire ``after the kidnappers had already
started killing the hostages.'' The soldiers were only trying to
``prevent further killings,'' a government statement said.
	   Two wounded hostages remain in the Aden hospital. Hospital
officials and British diplomats said the victims did not wish to be
interviewed.
	   British diplomat David Pearce said Wednesday one of them, Claire
Marston who was shot in the shoulder, is ``in a very bad way.'' She
was told that her husband, Peter Rowe, was among the dead.
	   The British Foreign Office has confirmed three Britons were
slain _ Ruth Williamson, 34, Mrs. Whitehouse, and Rowe, a
60-year-old math lecturer from Durham University. The fourth person
killed was an Australian, Andrew Colin Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   In an account Wednesday, Eric Firkins, 55, of Croydon, England,
said the abductors armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers
were leading the hostages into the mountains to a hideout. ``Then
we heard the gunfire,'' he said.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said another hostage, Brian
Smith, a 52-year-old postal worker from Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   The former hostages said they were forced to stand with their
hands in the air to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered
back, two of them were shot dead by their captors as revenge, they
said.
	   Smith and Firkins were interviewed at their hotel in Aden, about
a three-hour drive from the town of Mawdiyah where the hostages
were held captive after being seized Monday. Mawdiyah is 175 miles
(286 kilometers) south of the capital, San`a.
	   Firkins, a chemistry professor, said the kidnappers had divided
the hostages _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians _ into
two groups of 11 and five. He and Smith were in the larger group
and didn't how the others came under attack.
	   Holmes, among the group of five hostages, also said the hostages
were used as human shields by the kidnappers.
	   ``We were standing in front of the army during the battle,'' he
said Thursday.
	   He also said that kidnappers retreating under army fire tried to
execute hostages but ``we tackled them.''
	   He could not tell how the two hostages in his group were killed.
	   ``How can a gun differentiate,'' he said.
	   Whitehouse said his wife tried to help the wounded Australian
hostage who later died.
	   ``A kidnapper wanted Margaret to protect him, but she kept
trying to help Andrew. She was kneeling beside him, talking to him
and he was hit again,'' Whitehouse added.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg ... I tried to move her,
but another kidnapper clung on to me and kept the machine gun dug
into my neck. Then I saw a bullet hit Margaret in the head. She was
dead the instant it hit her. She never stood a chance.
	   ``They wouldn't let me go to her and she just lay there,
bleeding in the dirt,'' Whitehouse told Britain's Press
Association.
	   This was the first time Islamic extremists had abducted
foreigners.
	   In the past, tribesmen have kidnapped scores of foreigners to
win economic concessions from the government but have usually freed
the hostages safely. On Wednesday, four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni
tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set free unharmed.
	   The Yemeni government statement this time the kidnappers had
``purely political motives. ... The kidnappers were terrorists.''
	   Yemeni officials said its forces killed three of the kidnappers
and captured three others. They said the kidnappers belonged to
Islamic Jihad, a group of about 200 in south Yemen.
	   They had seized the hostages to demand the release of two of
their leaders and to protest the recent U.S. and British airstrikes
against Iraq, officials said. The leaders had been seized in a
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   The group has loose ties to radical Muslim groups elsewhere in
the Arab world. The common aim of these groups is to set up
theocratic rule in their countries, and many of their leaders had
fought against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.
	   Brig. Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, the chief of security in Aden
province, said Wednesday that Yemen's resolve in dealing with the
hostage-taking should serve as a warning to other kidnap groups.
	   ``Don't they dare repeat it,'' he said.

South Korea to sell Korea First Bank to U.S. financial firms

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea agreed Thursday to sell
heavily indebted Korea First Bank to an American financial
consortium in a bid to boost foreign confidence in its crisis-hit
economy.
	   The consortium, led by Texas-based investment fund Newbridge
Capital Ltd., outbid HSBC Holdings PLC of Britain to take over 51
percent of Korea First Bank, which is currently owned by the
government.
	   The deal marked the first takeover of a major Korean commercial
bank by foreign investors. Members of the Newbridge consortium
include GE Capital Services, a unit of General Electric of the
United States, and several other investors.
	   ``It will help boost the country's credibility abroad,'' said
Chun Joo-sung, an economist at Seoul's Ewha Woman's University.
``The deal is significant in that it could trigger an influx of
foreign investment in the domestic bank industry.''
	   President Kim Dae-jung's government has insisted on selling
Korea First Bank to foreigners to demonstrate its willingness to
restructure and open the cloistered domestic financial sector to
foreign investors.
	   The government first bought a 94 percent stake in the bank by
investing 1.5 trillion won (dlrs 1.2 billion). It then poured 3.6
trillion won (dlrs 3 billion) to write off half of the bank's bad
loans.
	   The bank also was forced to shed 2,900 workers, or 38 percent of
its total work force, and closed down 74 of its 413 retail branches
across the country this year in a restructuring program aimed at
wooing foreign investors.
	   Lee Hun-jai, head of the Financial Supervisory Commission, said
in a news conference that to help the deal go through, the
government also promised Newbridge that it would take over all
existing non-performing loans and any loans that go bad over the
next year.
	   The government hopes to recoup some of its money at some point
in the future by selling off part of its minority stake when the
bank's rock-bottom share price rebounds.
	   Newbridge will complete the purchase of its stake in Korea First
Bank by May, Lee said. Other details will be worked out later, he
added.
	   When the economy slowed down and companies began collapsing last
year, Korea First and other banks were left with mountains of bad
loans, triggering a sudden loss of international confidence that
led to the country's financial crisis.
	   Bank reform was a key condition of the record dlrs 58 billion
economic bailout package announced by the International Monetary
Fund a year ago.
	   Lee said South Korea will sell another ailing bank owned by the
government, Seoulbank, to foreigners in January.
	   South Korea so far has shut down 16 merchant banks and four
insurance companies and forced five small commercial banks to be
merged with bigger banks. Major commercial banks are discussing
more mergers.
	   Foreign banks are allowed to open retail branches, but the cost
of matching the vast number of branches owned by existing South
Korean banks would be prohibitive. That, say analysts, makes the
takeover of an existing bank especially attractive for overseas
banks.
	   Newbridge is affiliated with Texas Pacific Group, a closely held
U.S. investment firm based in Fort Worth, Texas.

Russia's inflation hits 84 percent for 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian inflation, which appeared under control
until a financial crisis hit last summer, reached 84 percent for
all of 1998, the government said Thursday.
	   With Russia still mired in crisis, many private economists
expect the rate for 1999 to be as high, if not higher.
	   In preparing the 1999 federal budget, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's government has forecast inflation at 30 percent, but
many analysts regard this as overly optimistic.
	   Russia suffered from hyperinflation after it moved to a market
economy in 1992, but the government seemed to be taming inflation
in recent years.
	   The rate was 11 percent in 1997 and the government was expecting
single-digit inflation for 1998 until the financial crisis struck
in August.
	   Since then, the Russian currency has lost much of its value, the
government has effectively defaulted on some of its debts and the
economy has been in a nose dive.
	   The economy contracted about 5 percent in 1998 and Russia
remained trapped in one of the worst depressions ever experienced
by an industrial nation.

Russia launches three global navigation satellites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Defense Ministry successfully launched
three global positioning satellites from a space center in the
Central Asian nation of Kazakstan, a news report said Thursday.
	   The three GLONASS satellites blasted off from the Baikonur
cosmodrome atop a Proton booster rocket at 9:36 p.m. Moscow time on
Wednesday night, the Interfax news agency said.
	   GLONASS, short for Global Navigation Satellite System, was
developed by the Russian military to enable ships, planes and
ground troops to pinpoint their position anywhere on earth to
within 15 meters (50 feet).
	   Like the United States' satellite network, called the Global
Positioning System (GPS), the Russian network can be used by
civilians who have the proper equipment. The location devices are
not yet widely available in Russia.
	   GLONASS will eventually consist of 24 satellites, like the US
version. Twenty-one were in orbit following Wednesday's launch.

Hostages rest, receive luggage, as bodies of dead examined
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Survivors of a bloody rescue operation that
killed four Western kidnap victims tried to cope with their tragedy
Thursday, collecting luggage scattered in their abduction and
recovering at an Aden hotel.
	   Their two-day ordeal at the hands of militant Islamic captors
still haunts them.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' a tearful Laurence Whitehouse, a
54-year-old schoolteacher from Hampshire, England, said in the
hotel's elevator Thursday as a porter carried his and his slain
wife's luggage to his room.
	   Margaret Whitehouse, 52, was among the hostages killed.
	   Whitehouse said his wife tried to help a wounded Australian
hostage, Andrew Colin Thirsk, who later died.
	   ``A kidnapper wanted Margaret to protect him, but she kept
trying to help Andrew. She was kneeling beside him, talking to him
and he was hit again,'' Whitehouse added.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg ... I tried to move her,
but another kidnapper clung on to me and kept the machine gun dug
into my neck. Then I saw a bullet hit Margaret in the head. She was
dead the instant it hit her. She never stood a chance.
	   ``They wouldn't let me go to her and she just lay there,
bleeding in the dirt,'' Whitehouse told Britain's Press
Association.
	   Tension was visible on another freed hostage, Briton David
Holmes.
	   ``No passports, no cameras, no money, nothing,'' he said in the
hotel lobby, complaining that the luggage retrieved from the battle
scene was missing some items stolen by the kidnappers before their
retreat under army fire.
	   In the nearby Al-Jamhuriya Hospital, the bodies of the four
slain hostages _ three Britons and an Australian _ were examined by
an American Embassy doctor Wednesday night. They were being
prepared to be transported out of the country.
	   Yemeni security officers arrived at the hotel Thursday to
interview the former hostages before the Westerners leave this
southern port for the capital of San`a in the northern mountains
later in the day. The former hostages were expected to fly home on
Friday.
	   Some hostages have disputed the Yemeni government's claim that
security forces opened fire ``after the kidnappers had already
started killing the hostages.'' The soldiers were only trying to
``prevent further killings,'' a government statement said.
	   Yemeni officials said its forces killed three of the kidnappers
and captured three others. They said the kidnappers belonged to
Islamic Jihad, a group of about 200 in south Yemen.
	   They had seized the hostages to demand the release of two of
their leaders and to protest the recent U.S. and British airstrikes
against Iraq, officials said. The leaders had been seized in a
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   Two wounded hostages _ an American woman, who was not
identified, with a wound to the pelvis, and a British woman who was
shot in the shoulder _ remain in the Aden hospital. Hospital
officials and British diplomats said the victims did not wish to be
interviewed.
	   British diplomat David Pearce said Wednesday that the wounded
Briton, Claire Marston, is ``in a very bad way.'' She was told that
her husband, Peter Rowe, was among the dead.
	   The British Foreign Office has confirmed three Britons were
slain _ Ruth Williamson, 34, Mrs. Whitehouse, and Rowe, a
60-year-old math lecturer from Durham University. The fourth person
killed was Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   In an account Wednesday, Eric Firkins, 55, of Croydon, England,
said the abductors armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers
were leading the hostages into the mountains to a hideout. ``Then
we heard the gunfire,'' he said.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said another hostage, Brian
Smith, a 52-year-old postal worker from Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   The former hostages said they were forced to stand with their
hands in the air to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered
back, two of them were shot dead by their captors as revenge, they
said.
	   Smith and Firkins were interviewed at their hotel in Aden, about
a three-hour drive from the town of Mawdiyah where the hostages
were held captive after being seized Monday. Mawdiyah is 175 miles
(280 kilometers) south of San`a.
	   Firkins, a chemistry professor, said the kidnappers had divided
the hostages _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians _ into
two groups of 11 and five. He and Smith were in the larger group
and didn't know how the others came under attack.
	   Holmes, among the group of five hostages, also said the hostages
were used as human shields by the kidnappers.
	   ``We were standing in front of the army during the battle,'' he
said Thursday.
	   He also said that kidnappers retreating under army fire tried to
execute hostages but ``we tackled them.''
	   He could not tell how the two hostages in his group were killed.
	   ``How can a gun differentiate,'' he said.
	   This was the first time Islamic extremists had abducted
foreigners.
	   In the past, tribesmen have kidnapped scores of foreigners to
win economic concessions from the government but have usually freed
the hostages safely. On Wednesday, four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni
tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set free unharmed.
	   The Yemeni government statement said this time the kidnappers
had ``purely political motives. ... The kidnappers were
terrorists.''
	   The Yemeni Islamic Jihad group has loose ties to radical Muslim
groups elsewhere in the Arab world. The common aim of these groups
is to set up theocratic rule in their countries, and many of their
leaders fought against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan in the
1980s.
	   Brig. Mohammad Saleh al-Turaiq, the chief of security in Aden
province, said Wednesday that Yemen's resolve in dealing with the
hostage-taking should serve as a warning to other kidnap groups.
	   ``Don't they dare repeat it,'' he said.

Singapore officially enters recession with 4th quarter contraction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 5th graf to state final growth figures for first two
quarters; ADDS 1997 growth figure in 10th graf and average growth
figure since independence in final graf.
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore fell into recession as 1998 ended,
according to figures in the prime minister's New Year's message
Thursday that revealed a 1.5 percentage contraction of the economy
during the last quarter of the year.
	   But Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong never used the word recession
in his speech. Instead, he put a positive spin on the news, saying
the city-state's growth for the entire year was 1.3 percent and
describing it as ``not a bad performance, considering the
unfavorable climate.''
	   The International Monetary Fund defines recession as two
consecutive quarters of contraction, putting Singapore in the same
recessionary boat as other Asian countries such as Japan, Malaysia
and Thailand.
	   Singapore's economy shrank by 0.7 percent in the third quarter,
which was the first time since 1986 the Southeast Asian economic
hub recorded a year-on-year contraction.
	   Although Goh had said recession might come in 1999, government
leaders had hoped the first two quarters of positive growth _ 6.2
percent and 1.8 percent _ would buoy the economy through the end of
the year.
	   After noting in the fifth paragraph of his statement that the
economy contracted from the previous year, Goh said that it had
shrunk 1.9 percent from the previous quarter.
	   ``However, for 1998 as a whole, the economy grew by 1.3
percent,'' he said.
	   Goh also said 1999 ``will be another difficult year,'' and cast
doubt on predictions by the government's own Ministry of Trade and
Industry that the economy would grow slightly or decline by only 1
percent.
	   ``MTI has forecast that the Singapore economy should grow by
between minus 1 percent and plus 1 percent in 1999,'' Goh said.
``But the prospects are very uncertain.''
	   Singapore escaped immediate damage from a regionwide crisis
which broke out in 1997, a year when the country enjoyed economic
growth of 7.8 percent.
	   But the regional malaise caught up with the resource-scarce
republic of 3.1 million people in 1998. More than 30,000 people
have been laid off, bankruptcies are up, and for the first time the
government has gotten involved in limited welfare programs.
	   Despite wage freezes, tax and fee reductions and other measures
aimed at keeping Singapore competitive and encouraging
international businesses to stay, more layoffs next year will be
unavoidable, Goh said.
	   ``Our economy is driven primarily by external demand,'' Goh
said. ``The environment has changed swiftly. Contagion has spread
from country to country.''
	   ``While we have not been spared,'' he said, ``our economy has
been much less affected than others.''
	   Singapore has enjoyed average annual growth of 8.9 percent since
independence in 1965.

Taiwan moves to revive sagging property market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Hoping to prevent the slump in Taiwan's
property market from triggering financial turmoil and further
slowing the economy, the Cabinet announced a stimulus package
Thursday to encourage more people to buy homes.
	   Mortgages totaling up to 150 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
4.6 billion) will be provided at a government-subsidized rate of
5.95 percent, compared to the current commercial rate of between 7
percent and 8 percent.
	   The preferential 20-year loans will be available for one year
beginning Friday, while new public housing projects will be
suspended for two years to reduce an oversupply of houses and
apartments, according to a government statement.
	   Critics say the stimulus plan will enable property companies to
prop up prices _ at taxpayer expense _ in a market that became
glutted when developers greedily overbuilt. Without the government
plan, the developers would have to cut housing prices further.
	   An economic slowdown fueled by Asia's financial crisis has
weakened Taiwan's property market, which now has 600,000 to 800,000
empty housing units scattered across the island.
	   The government bailout was launched after several construction
companies came to the brink of bankruptcy, prompting banks to
tighten credit as investors dumped construction shares.
	   In announcing the recovery plan, Premier Vincent Siew tried to
appease critics of the proposal.
	   ``We take these measures not to help the real estate developers
but to keep our economic and financial stability,'' Siew said,
noting the empty housing units have idled assets that cost some 1.5
trillion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 46 billion.)
	   ``These are measures we must take whether you like it or not,''
he said.
	   Finance Minister Paul Chiu said the housing loan subsidies would
cost the government an estimated 1.2 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S.
dlrs 37 million) a year, but will be recovered through increased
tax revenues brought in by a hoped for recovery in the property
market.
	   Despite a 7-year slump, industry sources say housing prices have
only dropped by an average of 20 percent since the boom in the late
1980s.
	   While prices have largely remained out of reach of many
potential home buyers, others complain that many large-scale
housing projects were ill-devised or built in remote areas.
	   Some economists said the government measures could help prevent
a possible collapse of property prices, which could cause a
financial crisis because about 40 percent of bank loans are
collateralized with real estate.
	   But others remain skeptical about the government scheme.
	   ``The measures will mitigate the problems, but not solve them,''
said Kuo Wen-jeng, an economist at the Chunghua Institute of
Economic Research, a private think tank.
	   ``The real estate market still needs some structural
adjustments,'' he said. ``Over the long term you need more
reasonable prices. The houses are still overpriced, and most people
with an average salary still won't buy.''

Unheralded spinner could be in England side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ England has summoned unheralded leftarm
spinner Ashley Giles and could name him to play in Saturday's fifth
Ashes test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
	   Giles, who has bowled spin for only five years, flew into
Australia two days ago with England's limited-overs contingent but
England selectors believe his variation in spinning the ball away
from Australia's righthanders will be crucial on a turning pitch.
	   The visitors' two other slow-bowling options, Peter Such and
Robert Croft, are offspinners.
	   Giles bowled nine overs, taking 1-29, in England's one-day
victory against a Queensland country side in Brisbane on Wednesday.
	   That was his first outing since September, when he played his
last four-day game.
	   The leftarmer's main claim to fame is taking the sole wicket by
an England spinner in the five-match South African series this year
_ in his one and only test so far.
	   Giles started his first-class career with Surrey as a seamer
before taking up spin when crossing to Warwickshire four seasons
ago.
	   He said he would not be daunted by the occasion if selected for
the showdown to decide the Ashes series.
	   Australia leads 2-1 entering the final test.
	   ``Everyone will be nervous, it's a big test for England,'' Giles
said Thursday. ``Everyone is going to have a few butterflies but
you have got to try and control that and get on with the job.''
	   England captain Alec Stewart said Giles faced a difficult task
if selected.
	   ``If he does play, it will be asking a lot,'' Stewart said.
``But we feel this fellow is up to it.'' (djp)

Thursday, collecting luggage scattered in their abduction and
recovering at an Aden hotel.
	   Their two-day ordeal at the hands of militant Islamic captors
still haunts them.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' a tearful Laurence Whitehouse, a
54-year-old schoolteacher from Hampshire, England, said in the
hotel's elevator Thursday as a porter carried his and his slain
wife's luggage to his room.
	   Margaret Whitehouse, 52, was among the hostages killed.
	   Whitehouse said his wife tried to help a wounded Australian
hostage, Andrew Colin Thirsk, who later died.
	   ``A kidnapper wanted Margaret to protect him, but she kept
trying to help Andrew. She was kneeling beside him, talking to him
and he was hit again,'' Whitehouse added.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg ... I tried to move her,
but another kidnapper clung on to me and kept the machine gun dug
into my neck. Then I saw a bullet hit Margaret in the head. She was
dead the instant it hit her. She never stood a chance.
	   ``They wouldn't let me go to her and she just lay there,
bleeding in the dirt,'' Whitehouse told Britain's Press
Association.
	   Tension was visible on another freed hostage, Briton David
Holmes.
	   ``No passports, no cameras, no money, nothing,'' he said in the
hotel lobby, complaining that the luggage retrieved from the battle
scene was missing some items stolen by the kidnappers before their
retreat under army fire.
	   In the nearby Al-Jamhuriya Hospital, the bodies of the four
slain hostages _ three Britons and an Australian _ were examined by
an American Embassy doctor Wednesday night. They were being
prepared to be transported out of the country.
	   Yemeni security officers arrived at the hotel Thursday to
interview the former hostages before the Westerners leave this
southern port for the capital of San`a in the northern mountains
later in the day. The former hostages were expected to fly home on
Friday.
	   Some hostages have disputed the Yemeni government's claim that
security forces opened fire ``after the kidnappers had already
started killing the hostages.'' The soldiers were only trying to
``prevent further killings,'' a government statement said.
	   Yemeni officials said its forces killed three of the kidnappers
and captured three others. They said the kidnappers belonged to
Islamic Jihad, a group of about 200 in south Yemen.
	   They had seized the hostages to demand the release of two of
their leaders and to protest the recent U.S. and British airstrikes
against Iraq, officials said. The leaders had been seized in a
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   Two wounded hostages _ an American woman, who was not
identified, with a wound to the pelvis, and a British woman who was
shot in the shoulder _ remain in the Aden hospital. Hospital
officials and British diplomats said the victims did not wish to be
interviewed.
	   British diplomat David Pearce said Wednesday that the wounded
Briton, Claire Marston, is ``in a very bad way.'' She was told that
her husband, Peter Rowe, was among the dead.
	   The British Foreign Office has confirmed three Britons were
slain _ Ruth Williamson, 34, Mrs. Whitehouse, and Rowe, a
60-year-old math lecturer from Durham University. The fourth person
killed was Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   In an account Wednesday, Eric Firkins, 55, of Croydon, England,
said the abductors armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers
were leading the hostages into the mountains to a hideout. ``Then
we heard the gunfire,'' he said.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said another hostage, Brian
Smith, a 52-year-old postal worker from Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   The former hostages said they were forced to stand with their
hands in the air to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered
back, two of them were shot dead by their captors as revenge, they
said.
	   Smith and Firkins were interviewed at their hotel in Aden, about
a three-hour drive from the town of Mawdiyah where the hostages
were held captive after being seized Monday. Mawdiyah is 175 miles
(280 kilometers) south of San`a.
	   Firkins, a chemistry professor, said the kidnappers had divided
the hostages _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians _ into
two groups of 11 and five. He and Smith were in the larger group
and didn't know how the others came under attack.
	   Holmes, among the group of five hostages, also said the hostages
were used as human shields by the kidnappers.
	   ``We were standing in front of the army during the battle,'' he
said Thursday.
	   He also said that kidnappers retreating under army fire tried to
execute hostages but ``we tackled them.''
	   He could not tell how the two hostages in his group were killed.
	   ``How can a gun differentiate,'' he said.
	   This was the first time Islamic extremists had abducted
foreigners.
	   In the past, tribesmen have kidnapped scores of foreigners to
win economic concessions from the government but have usually freed
the hostages safely. On Wednesday, four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni
tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set free unharmed.
	   Germany Embassy officials said Thursday that the freed Germans
arrived in San`a early in the morning and were sleeping at the
embassy. They were scheduled to depart for Germany on Friday, said
the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The Yemeni government statement said this time the kidnappers
had ``purely political motives. ... The kidnappers were
terrorists.''
	   The Yemeni Islamic Jihad group has loose ties to radical Muslim
groups elsewhere in the Arab world. The common aim of these groups
is to set up theocratic rule in their countries, and many of their
leaders fought against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan in the
1980s.

China angry about U.S. Congress allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Thursday called a United States Congress
report that found Beijing acquired American military technology
which harmed U.S. national security ``groundless and
irresponsible.''
	   A House of Representatives committee unanimously approved a
report Wednesday that concluded Beijing aggressively sought U.S.
technology, including sensitive military secrets, and bought or
stole items that hurt national security.
	   ``The allegation is groundless and irresponsible and we express
our strong resentment over this,'' Zhu Bangzao, a spokesman for
China's Foreign Ministry, said in response to the report's claims.
	   Normal trade and technology exchanges are ``in the interest of
both sides,'' he said.
	   Beijing has long pushed Washington to lift a ban on sales of
high technology, saying high-tech exports could help redress a
trade imbalance, estimated at dlrs 60 billion in China's favor in
1998.
	   China hopes ``the U.S. can proceed from the overall development
of bilateral relations and take actual deeds to remove obstacles to
the normal development of economic and trade relations between the
two countries and not to the contrary,'' Zhu said.
	   Despite China's pique over the House report, Zhu said U.S. and
Chinese officials would meet next month in Washington to discuss
human rights, an issue that has long been an irritant in China-U.S.
ties.
	   The meeting comes in the midst of the ruling Communist Party's
widest crackdown on dissent in at least three years. In the past
two weeks, four dissidents accused of endangering state security
have been given lengthy jail terms; another three, including two
U.S.-based activists, have been sent to labor camps.
	   Zhu indicated, however, that China was in no mood to suffer
criticism of its crackdown at the upcoming meeting.
	   He said the sentenced dissidents were guilty of ``subversive
activities'' and that China hoped its view that countries should
not interfere in each others affairs would be respected.
	   ``We have all along stood for dialogue and cooperation and
opposed confrontation'' over human rights, he said. ``To revert to
the road of confrontation is against the trend of history.''
	   Three dissidents, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, were
sentenced to 13, 12 and 11 years respectively for trying to set up
an opposition party to challenge Communist Party rule.
	   A labor activist, Zhang Shanguang, also was sentenced to 10
years imprisonment for telling U.S. government-funded Radio Free
Asia about farmers' protests.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing has expressed deep disappointment
over what it said were ``extremely harsh sentences.''

Aziz: Resistance to operations in `no-fly' zones continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ There will be no letup in Baghdad's
defiance of Western-patrolled ``no-fly'' zones in northern and
southern Iraq, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in remarks
published Thursday.
	   ``The battle against the aggression and aggressors has not
stopped. It will continue,'' Aziz said in a front-page commentary
in Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath Party.
	   Aziz also criticized the decision by the Arab League to put off
a meeting of foreign ministers.
	   They had been scheduled to meet this week on the mid-December
airstrikes by the United States and Britain against Iraq. But the
session was put off until Jan. 24, after the Muslim fasting month
of Ramadan, at the request of Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia.
	   Aziz accused Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid of
yielding to pressure from Saudi Arabia, terming it ``outrageous.''
	   ``The decision of the secretary-general lacks legitimacy ... it
also lacks fairness,'' Aziz added.
	   Aziz's comments came a day after the latest incident, which
occurred in the no-fly zone in southern Iraq. The United States and
its allies set up the zone in 1992 to protect Shiite Muslims after
a failed uprising against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   The Pentagon said that American jets launched missiles at an
Iraqi anti-aircraft battery after it fired on British patrol
planes.
	   Iraq said one farmer was killed and two other civilians were
wounded. It made no mention of military casualties.
	   Two days earlier, U.S. jets fired on an Iraqi post in the
northern no-fly zone, set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds from
Saddam's forces. Iraq said that four soldiers were killed and seven
wounded.
	   Aziz also accused Abdel-Meguid of acting against the wishes of
the Arabs, who he said resented their leaders' muted reaction to
the bombing of Iraq. It was a reference to anti-American
demonstrations around the Arab world during the airstrikes.
	   He said Iraq's resistance to the United States and Britain would
trigger ``further interest and wrath from the Arab masses'' and
garner support for Iraq's campaign to get punishing U.N. trade
sanctions removed.
	   The newspapers also published more defiant remarks by Gen. Ali
Hassan al-Majid, commander of the southern region.
	   ``We shall continue (efforts) to liberate the skies of Iraq from
devils like (U.S. President) Clinton ... who is aided by some evil
Arabs, among them the rulers of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,'' the
official Al-Iraq newspaper quoted al-Majid as saying in telegram to
Saddam.

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Khmer Rouge leaders under
controversial government protection checked into a secluded
Cambodian beach hotel for a New Year's break Thursday as U.N.
officials pondered dwindling options of bringing them to justice
for genocide.
	   After basking in VIP treatment in Phnom Penh for two days, Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea began a tour of the country they helped turn
into a bloody slave-labor camp when the Khmer Rouge held power from
1975 to 1979.
	   Escorted by military police providing tight security, the two
drove with their families in luxury vehicles to the seaside town of
Sihanoukville, the first leg of a tour that will take them to the
ancient Angkor temple complex and their home provinces.
	   Along the roads, they will pass memorials stacked with the bones
and skulls of thousands of their victims, irrigation ditches dug by
hand under the murderous eye of Khmer Rouge overseers and fields
strewn with mines from years of civil war.
	   The two guerrilla chiefs, who share blame for the deaths of up
to 2 million Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge, emerged from years
in the jungles last week and sealed a defection deal with Prime
Minister Hun Sen that included assurances they would not face
trial.
	   They told a news conference Tuesday that they were ``very
sorry'' for the reign of terror but refused to accept personal
responsibility, inviting survivors to ``let bygones be bygones.''
	   They did not speak to reporters Thursday on arriving at the best
hotel in Sihanoukville, where they had rooms with a view of the
Gulf of Thailand 50 meters (yards) away across sparkling sands.
	   The pair did not emerge from their rooms for hours and Long
Norin, a spokesman, said Khieu Samphan, 67, was exhausted.
	   ``He is sleeping right now,'' Long Norin said.
	   The treatment they are receiving from Hun Sen, which contradicts
his earlier pronouncements that remaining Khmer Rouge leaders would
stand trial if captured, has shaken hopes that the architects of
their murderous rule will ever face justice.
	   At the request of Cambodia's leaders, the United Nations sent
legal experts to Cambodia last month to assess evidence against
senior Khmer Rouge members and offer recommendations for a
tribunal, either overseas or in Cambodia.
	   ``The defection of Noun Chea and Khieu Samphan does not change
the plans,'' said Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N.'s top human rights
officer for Cambodia. ``We intend to present their recommendations
as soon as possible to the government and hope for a constructive
discussion.''
	   King Norodom Sihanouk, who initially voiced support for Hun
Sen's defection deal, said Wednesday he would in fact not provide
amnesties for Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea because of ``undeniable
discontent'' among a majority of Cambodians in seeing them go free.
	   Hun Sen has since been silent, but as Cambodia's most powerful
man he can easily pressure the pliant courts to ensure there is no
trial.
	   Hopes for prosecution now seem to rest with the United Nations,
which can pass resolutions to try Khmer Rouge leaders overseas
through an as yet non-existent international tribunal.
	   Sihanouk voiced his support for that option when he said the
international community had ``the perfect right to take up the case
of genocide in Cambodia'' because it was a crime against humanity.
	   However, Hun Sen's cooperation would be needed to arrest them.
	   Several possibilities are being considered by the U.N. team,
according to Hammarberg.
	   ``Considering the scale and the brutality of the Khmer Rouge
crimes, genuine healing in Cambodia will be extremely difficult
without a justice process,'' Hammarberg said.
	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and forced the
population to toil in Maoist-inspired agricultural collectives. One
Cambodian in five died of overwork, starvation, disease and
systematic executions.
	   They were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion, but
fought a guerrilla war from the jungles.
	   In 1996, Sihanouk granted amnesty to one leader, Ieng Sary, who
led thousands of fighters to peace. The Khmer Rouge has since
dwindled to near-extinction and pose no threat.
	   Many dispute Hun Sen's assertion that amnesty is needed for
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea to prevent renewed war.

Chinese dissident meets Taiwanese opposition leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Exiled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng on
Thursday praised former Taiwanese dissidents for launching a
zealous campaign that helped transform the island into a democracy.
	   At a meeting with Lin Yih-hsiung, leader of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, Wei said China's dissidents ``are
still treading on a tough road'' after two decades of championing
democracy.
	   ``Maybe it is because China is a big country,'' Wei said. ``It
is hard to push an elephant.''
	   Like mainland China, Taiwan saw the emergence of a dissident
movement two decades ago, but Taiwan has now become a full-blown
democracy, Wei said.
	   Lin agreed to keep supporting exiled Chinese dissidents.
	   ``After all, we are after the same goals,'' Lin said.
	   Wei was released last year from a Chinese prison where he spent
much of the last 18 years after his arrest for leading the
Democracy Wall movement, in which activists put up posters calling
for democracy.
	   Arriving in Taiwan last week for his first-ever visit, he has
met with President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Vincent Siew. He also
took time out to visit a former jail for political prisoners on
Green Island.
	   Wei was released earlier Thursday from a hospital where he had
stayed for two days for complications from a cold. Doctors urged
Wei, a chain smoker, to cut back on cigarettes.

 &UR; BARBADOS: Embassy suspects Americans were beaten while in police
custody &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Two Americans hospitalized with
serious injuries appear to have suffered them while in police
custody, the U.S. Embassy in Barbados says.
	   The men, both of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, claim Barbadian police
beat them with pipes and sticks.
	   The United States has filed an official protest with the
island's government, embassy spokeswoman Jennifer Clark said
Wednesday.
	   She said police never notified U.S. officials that the men,
Antonio Mendoza, 24, and Felipe Collazo Teron, 45, had been
detained. Doctors called the embassy after police brought the two
men to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in critical condition on Dec. 20.
	   ``The consular section has statements from others who say they
in were good shape when they were picked up by police,'' Clark
said.
	   Officials at the Barbadian foreign ministry received the U.S.
complaint Wednesday but had no immediate comment, ministry
spokeswoman Gayle Francis-Vaughn said.
	   Mendoza and Collazo were in Barbados to help assemble the Alana
Coney Island, a traveling carnival, when police detained them and
other carnival workers on Dec. 18 for questioning in the Dec. 11
burglary of an automatic bank machine. Thieves had bored a hole
into the money compartment through the wall of an adjoining
laundromat.
	   Police charged none of the carnival workers in the burglary,
though one man was sentenced to three months in jail for possession
of a marijuana cigarette.
 &UR; GUYANA: Government won't complain to UN about alleged jet violation
_ yet
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana says it is waiting for an
explanation from Venezuela before complaining to United Nations
supervisors about an alleged overflight by warplanes along a
disputed border.
	   The United Nations is overseeing efforts to resolve a
100-year-old border dispute in that area. Guyanese Foreign Minister
Clement Rohee said Wednesday he wants to talk to Venezuelan
officials about the alleged violation on Dec. 24 before complaining
to the international body.
	   ``We are not on a war footing and we would prefer always to work
through the diplomatic channels,'' Rohee said. ``I don't think we
need to rush to the United Nations with very limited information.''
	   The Guyanese army reported last week that two military jets flew
over northwestern Guyana without permission.
	   Venezuela has not responded to the charges. On Wednesday,
officials at the Venezuelan foreign affairs department left work
early because of the New Year's holiday and could not be reached
for comment.
	   Venezuela claims two-thirds of Guyana, a country rich in timber,
minerals, gold and oil. Guyana also has a running territorial
dispute with Suriname, its neighbor to the east.
	   Rohee said the alleged overflight ``warrants concern.''
	   ``Any incursion of one's airspace is a very serious issue both
from a foreign affairs and a national security point of view,'' he
said. ``It's not something that can be dismissed easily.''
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Fourth man arrested in alleged corruption scheme
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Prosecutors have charged a fourth
man in an alleged fraud scheme in Puerto Rico following Hurricane
Georges.
	   Federal prosecutors claim Marcos Gonzalez Reyes worked with
another contractor, Jose Orlando Figueroa, to inflate reports of
debris left by the hurricane.
	   The fraudulent reports were submitted the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in order to get more disaster funds for the city
of Toa Alta, prosecutors say. They announced the charges Wednesday.
	   They also allege he prepared blank documents and work reports
for a city worker to fill out and submit to the agency.
	   Gonzalez Reyes faces a maximum of 10 years in jail, a dlrs
250,000 fine and three years of probation on a charge of conspiring
to defraud the United States.
	   Figueroa and Toa Alta Mayor Angel Rodriguez were charged in
November with exaggerating hurricane damage and demanding dlrs 2.5
million in bribes from a Mississippi-based company, JESCO, in
exchange for a contract to collect debris.
	   Rodriguez and Figueroa have pleaded innocent to conspiracy,
extortion and bribery indictments.
	   Another contractor, Luis A. Rodriguez Sierra, was charged Dec.
15 with inflating damage estimates.
 &UR; CUBA: Government honors guerrillas who fought with Che Guevara
	   SANTA CLARA, Cuba (AP) _ The remains of 10 guerrilla fighters
who fell alongside Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara in Bolivia, including
the German woman known as Tania, have been buried with military
honors.
	   Their bodies were uncovered over the past year in Bolivia, about
three decades after they died in a failed attempt to spread an
armed Marxist revolution across the Americas _ an effort that even
Cuba today has renounced. They were interred Wednesday in central
Santa Clara.
	   But Comandante Ramiro Valdez, a former aide to Guevara, insisted
that they remained an example for those struggling against ``the
Yankee enemy'' and U.S. domination of the hemisphere.
	   ``Epochs may change. Conditions and methods also change,'' he
said, addressing the memorial service beneath a towering statue of
Guevara. ``(But) the objectives for which they battled continue to
be an objective and an aspiration for the Latin American people.''
	   ``U.S. imperialism today aspires with more force than ever,'' he
declared, saying that caused the backwardness and division of Latin
America and ensured that ``the market with its blind laws dictates
the economy and life of each country.''
	   The ceremony coincided with the 40th anniversary of Guevara's
greatest military triumph, the capture of Santa Clara, which sealed
the downfall of dictator Fulgencio Bastista and the triumph of
Fidel Castro's guerrilla forces on Jan. 1, 1959.
 &UR; GRENADA: Newspaper accuses government of corruption
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ A local newspaper is accusing
Grenada's government of corruption, saying an audit shows kickbacks
and conflicts of interest in public construction projects.
	   In this week's edition, the independent Grenada Today claims the
government gave contracts to allies of Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell and that one senator is renting a house to contractors
working on government projects at a hugely inflated price.
	   It also accuses the Carnival and Cultural Development Committee
of arranging kickbacks on contracts.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell has denied all of the accusations.
	   ``The NNP and its agents have turned out to be the most corrupt
government to hold the reigns of power in Grenada since the return
of democratic government in 1984,'' the newspaper said.
	   An audit by KPMG Peat Marwick showed overspending and violations
of public bid procedures, but did not touch upon questions of
wrongdoing.
	   Grenada Today also repeated charges that Mitchell's governing
New National Party is trying to buy votes with money and gifts as
it gears up for Jan. 18 elections prompted by the defection of two
of the party's Cabinet ministers.
	   One of the defectors, Foreign Minister Raphael Fletcher, claimed
the party was ``handing out money like confetti'' in return for
votes. He and former Health Minister Grace Duncan said they were
concerned that the audit's findings indicated corruption in the
awarding of contracts.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Hess to install emissions-cleaning equipment at
refinery
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Amerada Hess's Puerto Rican
refinery will install anti-pollution equipment as part of a deal
with federal regulators over gasoline tests, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency says.
	   The agency said the New York-based company will install cleaning
equipment over the next six months that should remove some 185 tons
of emissions annually at its Peerless Oil Corp. refinery in
southern Guayanilla.
	   In return, the company will be temporarily exempted from federal
guidelines about the cleanliness of its gasoline sold in Puerto
Rico, the agency said Wednesday.
	   The agency said it decided to allow the exemption because the
tests are based on cold wintertime conditions, when gasoline
creates more pollution as it burns.
	   ``It doesn't make sense to make Hess use a method of calculating
compliance with our regulation that is based on conditions that
never occur in Puerto Rico,'' EPA regional administrator Jeanne Fox
said in a written statement.
	   Without the pact, Hess would have had to begin refining gasoline
to the winter limits on Friday.

Aziz: Resistance to operations in `no-fly' zones continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ There will be no letup in Baghdad's
defiance of Western-patrolled ``no-fly'' zones in northern and
southern Iraq, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in remarks
published Thursday.
	   ``The battle against the aggression and aggressors has not
stopped. It will continue,'' Aziz said in a front-page commentary
in Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath Party.
	   Aziz also criticized the decision by the Arab League to put off
a meeting of foreign ministers.
	   They had been scheduled to meet this week on the mid-December
airstrikes by the United States and Britain against Iraq. But the
session was put off until Jan. 24, after the Muslim fasting month
of Ramadan, at the request of Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia.
	   Aziz accused Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid of
yielding to pressure from Saudi Arabia, terming it ``outrageous.''
	   ``The decision of the secretary-general lacks legitimacy ... it
also lacks fairness,'' Aziz added.
	   Aziz's comments came a day after the latest incident, which
occurred in the no-fly zone in southern Iraq. The United States and
its allies set up the zone in 1992 to protect Shiite Muslims after
a failed uprising against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   The Pentagon said that American jets launched missiles at an
Iraqi anti-aircraft battery after it fired on British patrol
planes.
	   Iraq said one farmer was killed and two other civilians were
wounded. It made no mention of military casualties.
	   Two days earlier, U.S. jets fired on an Iraqi air defense post
in the northern no-fly zone, set up in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds
from Saddam's forces. Iraq said that four soldiers were killed and
seven wounded.
	   Aziz also accused Abdel-Meguid of acting against the wishes of
the Arab masses, who he said resented their leaders' muted reaction
to the bombing of Iraq. It was a reference to anti-American
demonstrations around the Arab world during the airstrikes.
	   He said Iraq's resistance to the United States and Britain would
trigger ``further interest and wrath from the Arab masses'' and
garner support for Iraq's campaign to get punishing U.N. trade
sanctions removed.
	   The newspapers also published more defiant remarks by Gen. Ali
Hassan al-Majid, commander of the southern region.
	   ``We shall continue (efforts) to liberate the skies of Iraq from
devils like (U.S. President) Clinton ... who is aided by some evil
Arabs, among them the rulers of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,'' the
official Al-Iraq newspaper quoted al-Majid as saying in a telegram
to Saddam.

Mariners sign Mabry to two-year deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ The Seattle Mariners signed free agent
infielder-outfielder John Mabry to a two-year contract.
	   Mabry, 28, has spent his five-year major league career with the
St. Louis Cardinals. Last season, he played 46 games in left field,
38 at third base, 37 in right field, 16 at first base and pinch-hit
or pinch-ran in 31 games.
	   ``Mabry gives us a lot of flexibility,'' Mariners general
manager Woody Woodward said Wednesday.
	   Mabry hit .249 in 142 games with the Cardinals last season with
nine home runs and 46 RBIs. He has a .286 career average with 32
home runs and 200 RBIs in 544 games.
	   Mabry became a free agent on Dec. 21 when the Cardinals did not
offer him a 1999 contract. Mabry, who made dlrs 1.4 million last
season, would have been eligible for salary arbitration if the
Cardinals had kept him.

White South African council tries to block gift of land to blacks

	   BROEDERSTROOM, South Africa (AP) _ The ancestors of 98-year-old
Obed Moja lived in these green hills long before the white
Pretorius family arrived and made the Mojas landless sharecroppers
in the late 1800s.
	   Now a white political activist who is fasting to make his point
wants to give the land back to the Mojas and other black families.
	   But Roger Roman, 45, who bought the historic farm in 1995, is
being blocked by a nearly all-white town council with a firm
majority of former apartheid supporters.
	   The council has dredged up sanitation, zoning and building codes
to condemn dwellings that have housed black laborers for more than
100 years. Hartbeespoort district Mayor Pieter Rautenbach says he
agrees in principle with giving land to ``those poor people,'' but
that neighbors have complained Roman was not keeping up to health
standards.
	   The obstacles illustrate how far South Africa has to travel in
resolving one of the most pressing legacies of 300 years of white
oppression: 27 percent of all black families continue to live as
sharecroppers, tenants or squatters on land they neither rent nor
own, according to the 1996 census.
	   ``The apartheid system is continuing and continuing under these
guys,'' said Phillip Rafedile, 48, a high school teacher whose
forebears farmed the Pretorius land under near-feudal conditions.
	   After apartheid ended with the first democratic elections in
1994, President Nelson Mandela assured landless blacks that their
problems would be solved.
	   Nearly 40,000 individual and community land claims have been
filed with the government under a deadline that expires Thursday.
About 27 claims benefiting nearly 14,000 households have been
settled so far.
	   For the Mojas and Rafediles, who live on the 32-acre
(13-hectare) farm along with eight other families, there also are
guarantees under the 1997 Land Tenure act that forbids landowners
from evicting laborers.
	   But many rural blacks are unaware of their residency rights.
Some landowners hurried to kick blacks off their land before the
law went into effect, contributing to the creation of squatter
camps.
	   At one such camp set up by the local council, about 50 families
live in shacks next to a sewage plant where human excrement is
dried and stored for use as fertilizer.
	   Children muddy from head to toe wander among the crowded houses,
made of thin corrugated sheeting that leaks in the rain, lets cold
wind blow in winter and roasts in the summer. The floors are packed
dirt.
	   ``We aren't free at all. We can't even speak and let you use our
names,'' one resident at the camp said on condition of anonymity.
	   At Roman's farm, about six miles (10 kilometers) from the camp,
the well-built stucco homes have cement floors and graceful
courtyards adorned with yellow and blue flowers. Under old shade
trees, relatives from nearby cities visited grandmothers and aunts
on Wednesday.
	   ``I love coming home. This is where I was born,'' said
Rafedile's niece, Mary Rafedile, 33, who works in an office in a
nearby town.
	   Obed Moja retired to the farm after years of working as a
servant in Johannesburg.
	   Roman says he cannot afford to build new houses for all the
families on his land. But if each family receives title to a plot,
they can apply for government subsidies.
	   ``My plan makes sense legally, morally and financially,'' Roman
said.
	   Part of the problem is the lack of precedent in deeding land to
laborers. Several farmers have set up businesses to be run by their
laborers, but actual land transfers have been rare.
	   Nearby landowners have formed a committee to stop Roman. One,
Cor Zillee, charged Roman's plans are politically motivated to drum
up African National Congress support in the next elections. Roman
says he has no political aspirations.
	   The town council, meanwhile, claims it has the authority to
approve deed transfers and is resisting Roman's plan because of
health violations. Rautenbach, the mayor, says the levels of E.
coli in river water are unacceptably high.
	   A national land affairs official, Gigi Baldovino, said there was
no question that the national law protecting farm residents takes
precedence over the council's by-laws.
	   She said she hoped more rural land owners, who have been
targeted in slayings and robberies by landless blacks, would take
Roman's lead in cultivating reconciliation among their laborers.
	   A business consultant who has advised private industry on equal
employment and other issues, Roman has lost 35 pounds (16 kilos)
since starting to fast Nov. 25. He drinks liquids and eats some
fruits.
	   ``I will stop fasting when enough landowners start working at
this idea,'' he said. ``It's not my choice, but I'm willing to
die.''

Russia's inflation hits 84 percent for 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS 5 grafs with court declaring bank bankrupt, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian inflation, which appeared under control
until a financial crisis hit last summer, reached 84 percent for
all of 1998, the government said Thursday.
	   With Russia still mired in crisis, many private economists
expect the rate for 1999 to be as high, if not higher.
	   In preparing the 1999 federal budget, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's government has forecast inflation at 30 percent, but
many analysts regard this as overly optimistic.
	   Russia suffered from hyperinflation for several years after it
moved to a market economy in 1992, but the government seemed to be
taming inflation in recent years.
	   The rate was 11 percent in 1997 and the government was expecting
single-digit inflation for 1998 until the financial crisis struck
in August.
	   Since then, the Russian currency has lost much of its value, the
government has effectively defaulted on some of its debts and the
economy has been in a nose dive.
	   The economy contracted about 5 percent in 1998 and Russia
remained trapped in one of the worst depressions ever experienced
by an industrialized nation.
	   Meanwhile, a Russian court has declared bankrupt what was one of
the country's largest banks, clearing the way for the first
liquidation of a major bank since the August crisis.
	   The Moscow Arbitration Court ruled this week that Tokobank was
bankrupt and that its assets should be distributed among creditors,
The Moscow Times reported.
	   The bank was once among the 20 largest in Russia, but now has
debts of 7.5 billion rubles (dlrs 363 million) and assets of just
3.4 billion rubles (dlrs 165 million), the newspaper reported.
	   Russia has some 1,500 banks, but many have been hard hit by the
financial crisis and have either closed or are providing only
limited services.
	   Government officials have said that perhaps only half of the
country's banks will survive the crisis. The government's efforts
to restructure and revive the banking system have moved slowly.

Sheffield sets salary record at dlrs 14.9 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Gary Sheffield made more than the entire
Montreal Expos roster this year, and so did seven other players.
	   Sheffield set a single-season salary record at dlrs 14.9
million, heading a record group of major leaguers who made dlrs 1
million or more last season, according to a study by The Associated
Press.
	   The Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder, boosted by a dlrs 5 million
bonus he received for agreeing to a midseason trade from Florida,
smashed the previous record of dlrs 10 million, set in 1997 by
Albert Belle with the Chicago White Sox.
	   Sheffield, whose exact earnings were dlrs 14,936,667, not only
made more than the entire Expos team (dlrs 8,317,500), he also made
more than the Pittsburgh Pirates (dlrs 13,695,000) and fell just
short of the final roster of the Marlins (dlrs 15,141,000).
	   A record 36.5 percent of players reached dlrs 1 million, up from
34.5 percent last year, according to the AP study, which reviewed
the contracts of all 894 players on Aug. 31 rosters and disabled
lists.
	   At the other end, 126 players were at the minimum dlrs 170,000
(14.1 percent), nearly one of every seven players In 1997, 107
players (13.0 percent) were at the minimum, which was dlrs 150,000.
	   In 1999, the minimum jumps to dlrs 200,000, which was higher
than the average salary until 1982.
	   Following Sheffield were Belle (dlrs 10 million), Atlanta
pitcher Greg Maddux (dlrs 9.6 million), St. Louis home-run king
Mark McGwire (dlrs 8,928,354), San Francisco outfielder Barry Bonds
(dlrs 8,916,667), Toronto pitcher Roger Clemens (dlrs 8.55
million), Atlanta first baseman Andres Galarraga (dlrs 8.4
million), Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa (dlrs 8,325,000), New
York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams (dlrs 8.3 million) and
Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. (dlrs 8,203,767).
	   The median salary _ the point at which an equal number of
players were above and below _ was dlrs 418,000, down from dlrs
450,000 last season and dlrs 500,000 on opening day. Expansion and
the large number of players on the disabled list _ 144 _ were
partly responsible.
	   The average salary was dlrs 1,386,117, between the final figures
of the players' association (dlrs 1,398,831) and the commissioner's
office (dlrs 1,380,099). Slightly different methods of calculation
are used by each organization.
	   Figures were obtained by the AP from management and player
sources and include salaries, pro-rated shares of signing bonuses
and other guaranteed money not attributed to a specific year, and
all earned incentive bonuses. For some players, parts of salaries
deferred without interest are discounted to reflect current values.
	   Belle, who signed with Baltimore after the World Series, and
Williams, who re-signed with the Yankees, will receive boosts with
their new deals as will pitcher Kevin Brown, who agreed to a record
dlrs 105 million, seven-year contract with the Dodgers.
	   With the addition of Arizona and Tampa Bay as expansion teams,
the number of millionaires was easily broken. The 326 were 41 more
than the previous mark, set in 1997.
	   Just less than one in four major leaguers, 220 in all, were at
dlrs 2 million or more, an increase of 20. There were 150 at dlrs 3
million or higher, 16 more than 1997, and 98 at dlrs 4 million or
more, an increase of 15.
	   At the highest levels, the number of dlrs 8 million players
doubled from five to 11, a sign of the rise that's to come in
future years.
	   Baltimore, which had a record payroll of dlrs 75.2 million and
stumbled to a 79-83 finish, had a record 21 million-dollar players.
	   Montreal, which had a payroll one-ninth of Baltimore's, had just
one million-dollar player (Rondell White at dlrs 2 million),
Florida had just two, including Alex Fernandez, who made dlrs 7
million and spent the entire season on the disabled list following
rotator cuff surgery. Seventeen Marlins earned the minimum.

More delays for U.S.-Australian team eying around-the-world balloon

trip
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with scheduled Friday launch
canceled, new quotes from team leader and mission control director;
NOTE new tentative launch time is 5 a.m. local time on Jan. 2 (1930
GMT Jan. 1)

<TEXT>
	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ Frustrated by fierce winds in
the Australian Outback, a U.S.-Australian team trying fly nonstop
around the world was forced on Thursday to cancel their latest
scheduled launch date.
	   Mission control director Dan Pedersen said winds on New Year's
Day were forecast to be too strong at 900 ft. _ the height the
balloon will ascend to during launch _ for a safe launch.
	   ``We are going to target the morning of the 2nd (of January),''
Pedersen said.
	   Team leader and Denver real estate magnate Dave Liniger said he
and his co-pilots, Albuquerque-based journalist Bob Martin and
Australian balloonist John Wallington, were anxious to get off the
ground.
	   ``We want to go,'' Liniger said. ``It's possible that the longer
we wait, the worse the weather will get and we will end up wasting
millions of dollars and a lot of people's time.''
	   The Re/Max International team has a weather ``window'' in which
to take off lasting from late December to mid-January.
	   After that, high altitude winds that blow directly from east to
west at speeds needed to power the balloon's initial stage of
flight will shift direction.
	   The team expects to succeed where other attempts have failed by
rising to the edge of the atmosphere on a route which follows the
Tropic of Capricorn.
	   On Thursday, scientists and engineers endured another day
working on the balloon's spaceship-like capsule in searing
temperatures of around 100 F (38 C) at the garage-like workshop in
the desert of central Australia.
	   Pedersen said the team had been ready to launch from a technical
standpoint, but that he was happy the weather afforded more time to
work on the capsule and run more tests.
	   ``I'm not disappointed,'' said Pedersen, a former U.S. Navy
captain and jet fighter test pilot. ``I wanted another 16 or so
hours of tests and final crew training.
	   ``We will take advantage of every moment the wind is
unfortunately giving us.''
	   Weight distribution problems were identified Wednesday, when the
capsule was lifted by crane off the ground for the first time.
	   Electronic control boards were installed Thursday, including
switching systems which will run programs such as explosive bolts
to cut the capsule free in an emergency.
	   Final procedures including attaching the solar panels which will
power the craft were scheduled to take place on Friday.
	   The pilots will hang below a balloon made of lunchwrap-thin
polyethylene plastic in a 7-ft. by 8-ft. (2.1-meter by 2.4-meter)
capsule packed with life-support systems, scientific equipment,
food, waste disposal units and cameras and communications gear.
	   When fully inflated, the balloon is 460 feet (138 meters) in
diameter and 700 feet (210 meters) high _ large enough to envelope
the Houston Astrodome or two 747 jet liners nose-to-nose.
	   It will rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff,
expanding on the way up with 170,000 cubic ft. (5,100 cubic meters)
of helium. It will rise into the stratosphere to a cruising
altitude of 130,000 feet (39,000 meters), or about 24 miles (39
kilometers) above sea level.
	   That's higher than any previous manned balloon flight.
	   The pilots will wear Russian-made space suits during parts of
the journey where the atmosphere outside will be less than 1
percent of that at sea level.
	   After a round of meetings earlier Thursday closed to all but
core team members, Wallington said delays were adding to tension
surrounding the launch.
	   ``It's not nerve-wracking because there is so much to do, but I
am a little anxious to get going,'' Wallington said.
	   The team's bid comes just days after a failed attempt by Chicago
millionaire Steve Fossett, British millionaire Richard Branson and
Per Lindstrand of Sweden.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   ``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the
history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. ``It's the beginning of a new
era.''
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations will huddle at European Union
headquarters to agree to the rates at which German marks, Italian
lire and the rest are absorbed into euro. Strauss-Kahn said the
euro would likely be worth 6.56 to 6.57 French francs.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   ``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the
history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. ``It's the beginning of a new
era.''
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations will huddle at European Union
headquarters to agree to the rates at which German marks, Italian
lire and the rest are absorbed into euro. Strauss-Kahn said the
euro would likely be worth 6.56 to 6.57 French francs.
	   There will be solemn speeches and champagne, then schoolchildren
will release thousands of blue balloons bearing the ``e'' symbol
which may soon become as familiar as the dollar sign.
	   The euro will formally come into existence at midnight on New
Year's Eve. It will be worth about dlrs 1.17.
	   As the euro-balloons float into the skies above Brussels,
employees at banks, stock exchanges and other financial
institutions around Europe will start a race-against-time to adapt
computer systems and convert countless financial holdings _ from
Dutch government bonds, to Italian shares and Finnish bank accounts
_ into euros before markets reopen Monday after the long holiday
weekend.
	   ``It is a major logistical effort. We have catering facilities.
We have booked hundreds of hotel rooms. We have hired mini buses,''
said Vendeline Von Bredow, euro project manager at Merrill Lynch.
	   After Thursday, the old currencies will no longer be traded in
foreign exchange markets around the world. Stocks and bonds will be
quoted in euros. The euro will increasingly be used for bank
transactions, business deals and public finances.
	   The European Central Bank will set a common interest rate of 3
percent for all 11 nations. For the first time in decades the U.S.
dollar will have a rival as the world's reference currency.
	   Euro cash will only be issued to replace the old coins and
banknotes in early 2002. Until then, the euro will only be used for
non-cash transactions.
	   Consumers will see prices marked in euros making it easier to
shop across frontiers and they'll be able to buy in euros using
checks or credit cards. But they'll still have to change money for
cross-border cash purchases.
	   Citizens will start to see euro figures alongside national
currencies on pay checks, phone bills and bank statements. On
Wednesday, winners of the French and Irish national lotteries will
have their prizes announced in euros.
	   French Riviera flower sellers, Belgian supermarkets and trendy
Viennese cafes where among businesses who jumped the gun and began
posting euro prices before the official launch.
	   In the Eurotempo store selling souvenirs in the shadow of the
EU's Brussels headquarters, there was a brisk trade in pocket
calculators programed to convert to and from euros.
	   ``It's a real success, people have been buying up dozens at a
time to offer as gifts,'' said sales assistant Isabel Fernandez.
The store's shelves also contained neckties and alarm clocks
adorned with the euro symbol, and chocolate euro coins.
	   Plans to forge a common European currency date back to the
1960s, but only after then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and late
French President Francois Mitterrand threw their weight behind the
project in the late 1980s did Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU,
take flight.
	   Supporters say euro-zone's 290 million people will give European
companies a huge, secure home market like that of their American
rivals. Exchange-rate costs and currency fluctuations within the
euro zone will disappear.
	   Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg will join the
euro, hoping their combined economic weight will give Europe a
greater voice in world affairs.
	   For some, the price to pay was too great.
	   Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of the euro because of
public anxiety that dropping the national currency means giving up
too much independence. Greece failed to meet economic conditions
for joining but hopes to be in by 2001.

Parents of Australian kidnap victim say they're not bitter

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The parents of an abducted Australian
man who died in Yemen said Thursday they were not bitter about the
Yemeni government's actions, which resulted in their son's fatal
shooting.
	   Andrew Colin Thirsk, 35, died during a two-hour gunfight Tuesday
that also claimed the lives of three British hostages in the
troubled Middle Eastern country.
	   The gun battle began when more than 200 government troops and
police stormed the kidnappers' desert hideout to end the 24-hour
ordeal for 16 hostages.
	   Survivors said the Yemeni troops fired the first shots,
contradicting government claims that the Islamic Jihad kidnappers
began the fire fight.
	   Malcolm and Susan Thirsk, the parents of the dead Australian,
said they were not bitter about the bungled rescue attempt.
	   ``Personally, we're always going to wish they'd done something
different...we're not bitter, but we wish it had been another
way,'' Thirsk's father told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``Sometimes governments are going to draw the line in the sand
and one day the Australian government, I suppose, will have the
same issue to cope with,'' he said.
	   The family told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that their son
knew the dangers and risks of traveling in Yemen.
	   The partner at Pricewaterhouse Coopers wanted adventure and
thought he would be safe in a structured tour group, the elder
Thirsk told the newspaper.
	   Meanwhile, Australia's ambassador to Saudi Arabia has been
directed to visit Yemen to investigate the killing of Thirsk and
the three Britons, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said.
	   Downer said the ambassador would also ``emphasize to the Yemeni
authorities that we would like there to be a full and thorough
investigation of this incident.''

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A day after firing its naval chief, the
Indian government on Thursday installed a new chief of the air
force.
	   The retirement of the air force commander left just one of the
three service chiefs in place. The defense secretary, the senior
civil servant in the defense ministry, also was shifted from his
post in Wednesday's shakeup.
	   Air Chief Marshal Anil Yashwant Tipnis took over as the new
Chief of Air Staff from S.K. Sareen.
	   Indian newspapers, headlining the unprecedented removal of the
navy commander, Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat, said it highlighted
tensions between the 9-month-old Hindu nationalist government and
its top military officers.
	   Unlike other armies in South Asia, the Indian army is not
involved in politics, and a military coup has never been a threat.
	   ``This issue is not likely to go away,'' wrote K. Subramaniam,
the respected defense analyst of The Times of India. ``It is public
knowledge that the three service chiefs of staff had complained to
the defense minister earlier'' about the ministry's handling of
their affairs.
	   Bhagwat was fired for his refusal to accept the appointment of a
new deputy. The naval chief claimed he had the legal authority to
choose his principal officers, and he was not required to accept
the government's nominee.
	   The government judged his stand to be insubordination toward
civilian authority. A statement released Wednesday said his action
``threatened the established structure of democracy, traditional
neutrality and objectivity of the armed forces.''
	   Bhagwat was replaced by Vice-Admiral Sushil Kumar, who
previously was in charge of naval operations in south India.
	   Tipnis, a former fighter pilot and a 39-year veteran, said
Bhagwat's dismissal was ``the most unfortunate thing to happen,''
but declined further comment, United News of India reported.
	   But a retired naval chief, Admiral O.S. Dawson, was quoted by
Press Trust of India as faulting the government for ineptly
handling the conflict with Bhagwat and failing to hold a full
inquiry before firing him.
	   ``Sacking anybody without any good ground is a bad thing. If
anybody deserved to be sacked, do not do it this way,'' said
Dawson, who was naval chief in the early 1980s.

Anwar asks for delay in cross-examination of DNA expert
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 6th graf with trial judge allowing defense request for
delay and 9th-10th grafs with refusal to allow defense DNA expert
to sit in court.
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Overload
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed former No. 2 Malaysian
leader Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday pleaded with the judge in his sex
and corruption trial to give his lawyers more time to study complex
DNA evidence against him.
	   A state DNA expert on Wednesday positively identified Anwar's
DNA from semen stains on a mattress that he allegedly used for
sexual trysts with male and female partners.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove ex-deputy prime minister Anwar
had sex with the wife of his former secretary, sodomized his family
driver and abused his powers to try to cover up sexual trysts.
	   Trial Judge Augustine Paul earlier in the week rejected a
defense request to allow testimony from its own DNA experts. Anwar,
in a written statement to Paul, asked that his attorneys be given
until Jan. 7 to cross-examine state DNA expert Lim Kong Boon.
	   ``Having regard to the very political nature of this prosecution
case against me and the importance to the defense of the evidence
in question, I feel that the experts to advise the defense should
truly be independent and be known to be specialists in the field of
DNA profiling,'' Anwar said in his statement.
	   In response, Paul ruled Thursday that the cross-examination of
the state's DNA expert witness be put off until all other people on
the prosecution's list have taken the witness stand.
	   Anwar's team plan to fly in foreign DNA experts to brief them on
how to conduct their cross-examination of Lim.
	   ``I would ask that this request be considered sympathetically
and that it be granted in the interest of justice,'' Anwar said.
	   Though Paul granted the request for more time, he refused to
allow the defense's own DNA expert to sit in court and advise
Anwar's lawyers on how to grill Lim.
	   ``The matter is well within your competence,'' Paul told Anwar's
so-called dream team of nine prominent defense lawyers. ``If you
read books, they will give you the legal aspects on how you can go
about attacking a DNA expert.''
	   Earlier Thursday, Lim explained in excruciating detail how he
came to his conclusion that the stains on the mattress were those
of Anwar, Shamsidar Taharin, his secretary's wife, and those of
another unidentified woman and man.
	   The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment in a
Kuala Lumpur allegedly used by Anwar.
	   Lim, speaking in highly technical English and using diagrams
that he referred to with a laser pointer, prompted yawns from some
observers and a flurry of activity from local Chinese-language
newspaper reporters as they flipped through English-Chinese
dictionaries.
	   After an hour of explanation from Lim, the judge turned to the
defense team and quipped: ``So, it is quite easy to understand,
isn't it? You don't need an expert with you when it's made so easy
to understand.''
	   Before the proceedings began, Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail,
presented him with a large Hari Raya card from his supporters. Hari
Raya is the celebration that takes place at the end of the Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2
after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the country. He was
arrested on Sept. 20 and badly beaten while in police custody,
causing an outcry over his treatment.
	   He is on trial for abuse of power and will be tried separately
on charges of engaging in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were fabricated as part of a government conspiracy to undermine his
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Paul also rejected on Thursday a defense request to recall to
the witness stand Dr. Halim Haji Manzar. The state pathologist
wrote a medical report detailing the injuries Anwar sustained while
in police custody.
	   ``I'm afraid I'm unable to agree to the request on the simple
reason that the report is not relevant to this case,'' Paul said
before adjourning for the holiday weekend and wishing everyone a
happy New Year.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday after receiving ``credible''
threats, an embassy spokesman said.
	   The spokesman, Larry Schwartz, would not elaborate, but an
Israeli security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the threats were aimed at the embassy staff. Israel radio said the
life of U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker was threatened.
	   Schwartz said the embassy was not searched, apparently ruling
out a possible bomb threat.
	   He said the ``direct and credible'' threat was received
Wednesday evening and that Walker decided to shut down the embassy
and informed staff not to report to work Thursday.
	   Schwartz said he did not know how long the embassy would be
closed. On Friday, New Year's Day, the embassy would be closed
anyhow, followed by the weekend.
	   On Thursday, Israeli border police officers were seen talking to
U.S. security officials and taking notes. An Israeli border police
jeep was parked outside the building.
	   Tel Aviv police spokesman Nitza Friedman said ``police are doing
what they have to do.''
	   U.S. diplomatic missions have been on heightened security alert
since the twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam on Aug. 7. The attacks killed 224 people.
	   In retaliation, the United States bombed targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan that had links to Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire
and the alleged mastermind of the embassy bombings.
	   In the Middle East, there has been growing resentment against
the United States following the attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan
and the U.S. bombing of Iraq earlier this month.

Most Russians don't expect to be any better off in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seven out of ten Russian don't expect their lives
to improve in 1999, despite the government's pledge to resurrect
the economy after a devastating financial crisis, according to a
poll released Monday.
	   Eighteen percent of the 6,000 people surveyed by the Institute
of Parliamentary Sociology said they expected some improvement in
their lives, while 12 percent couldn't predict, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   But 70 percent of those polled across Russia said their living
situation wouldn't get better in the upcoming year.
	   The report gave no margin of error for the poll.
	   Respondents said the were most likely to worry about wage
arrears and low salaries in 1999. They were also afraid that health
care and other social services would fall further into neglect.
	   Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the government has had
trouble paying wages and pensions on time. The education and health
care systems have also been extremely hard hit.
	   These problems have been exacerbated by the country's latest
economic crisis, which hit in August.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets on Thursday ended the
year on a sour note, with share prices falling for a second
consecutive session in Hong Kong.
	   Bourses were closed for the New Year's holiday in Indonesia,
Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 72.86 points, or 0.73
percent, to close at 10,048.58.
	   Turnover was thin as many investors were sidelined amid
speculation that some fund managers might sell off U.S.-dollar
linked assets to put their money into the new European Union single
currency _ the euro _ which begins trading on Monday.
	   It was a dismal year for Hong Kong as the territory's blue chips
shed 6.3 percent of their value despite a controversial government
intervention that saved the market from even bigger losses.
	   The Hang Seng Index plunged from a high of 11,810.63 on March 25
to a low of 6,660.42 on Aug. 13 _ before the Hong Kong government
launched an unprecedented U.S. dlrs 15.1 billion stock-buying spree
to fend off market speculators.
	   The two-week intervention dismayed many proponents of
free-market economics.
	   New Zealand share prices closed sharply lower, with brokers
saying a hefty fall by Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. and
weakness on Wall Street overnight weighed on the market.
	   The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 40.26 points, or 1.9
percent, to 2,064.97.
	   Shares in Taiwan closed down for the sixth straight session to
another four-month low amid persistent fears about a weak economy
and deteriorating corporate profits.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 43.60
points, or 0.67 percent, to 6,418.43.
	   Singapore shares ended 1998 with a whimper, barely changed in
the last trading session of the year. The Straits Times Index
slipped 1.97 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,392.73 in a
holiday-shortened half session.
	   Malaysian share prices closed generally lower, but the key index
was propped up by local funds toward the end of trading through
aggressive buying of heavy-weight blue chips.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 11.57
points, or 2 percent, to 586.13.
	   The Australian stock market ended a shortened trading session
broadly higher.
	   The Sydney's All Ordinaries Index rose 29.2 points, or 1.1
percent, to 2,813.4. The close represents a 7.5 percent rise for
the year.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A day after firing its naval chief, the
Indian government on Thursday installed a new chief of the air
force.
	   The retirement of the air force commander left just one of the
three service chiefs in place. The defense secretary, the senior
civil servant in the defense ministry, also was shifted from his
post in Wednesday's shakeup.
	   Air Chief Marshal Anil Yashwant Tipnis took over as the new
Chief of Air Staff from S.K. Sareen, who retired on schedule after
a three- year term.

Chinese premier urges quality construction for mammoth dam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 7th-8th grafs with spokesman saying China wants to
adopt international inspection standards.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has ordered the
builders of the Three Gorges dam to ensure that the huge
hydroelectric project does not result in a disaster due to poor
engineering, state-run media reported Thursday.
	   ``The responsibility on your shoulders is heavier than a
mountain. Any carelessness or negligence will bring disaster to our
future generations and cause irretrievable losses,'' Zhu said while
recently touring the construction site along the Yangtze River, in
central China.
	   Zhu's remarks, printed by the state-run Xinhua News Agency and
major newspapers, were the first explicit official expression of
concern about the project, whose critics say it will cause massive
environmental damage while doing little to control flooding along
the volatile river.
	   When necessary, China plans to invite top international
engineering companies to inspect the dam and monitor the quality of
its construction, the reports cited Zhu as saying.
	   ``A strict engineering quality monitoring system must be
introduced into the Three Gorges Project,'' he said.
	   The dlrs 25 billion dam, east of the central city of Chongqing,
is intended to control flooding along the Yangtze and supply much
needed power for economic development. Reports by experts who have
toured the region say the endeavor has been plagued by widespread
popular resistance and corruption.
	   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, brushed off
suggestions that China's decision to have international inspection
of the dam was a vote of no confidence in its own inspectors.
	   ``There is a certain difference between Chinese and
international monitoring companies. We would like to adopt
international standards in monitoring projects,'' he said. ``I
think this is a good thing.''
	   Earlier this week, the government launched a campaign to
emphasize better quality construction and curb rampant graft that
has contributed to numerous building, road and bridge collapses.
	   The drive is intended both to boost safety and to prevent waste
and embezzlement of the billions of dollars China is devoting to
construction of such basic infrastructure to help boost the
economy.
	   Premier Zhu also said there was a need to improve management of
funds intended for the Three Gorges project and to ensure a
successful relocation of the 1.2 million people who will be
displaced by the dam.
	   ``We must establish a strict auditing system and increase
transparency in the use of funds to make sure that not a penny of
project funds is misused or diverted,'' Xinhua quoted Zhu as
saying.
	   In a separate report, Xinhua said Thursday that construction had
begun on a five-kilometer (3-mile) long bridge across the Yangtze,
downriver from the Three Gorges project near the central city of
Wuhan.
	   The 1.3 billion yuan (dlrs 157 million) bridge will be a link in
an expressway connecting Beijing in the north with Zhuhai in the
south, it said.

Hong Kong's budget deficit gets smaller
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The collection of capital gains taxes in
November lowered Hong Kong's budget deficit to 35.56 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.36 billion) for the first eight months of
the fiscal year, the government said Thursday.
	   The deficit had stood at 50.16 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 6.43 billion) at the end of October.
	   The Hong Kong government said it expects the deficit to keep
shrinking as more taxes are collected before the fiscal year ends
on March 31 _ but it was unclear whether the budget imbalance can
fall far enough to meet the government's target.
	   Officials are hoping to limit the full-year deficit to 21
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.69 billion).
	   A statement said expenditure in the first eight months of the
fiscal year came to 148.07 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
18.9 billion), while revenue totaled 112.51 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 14.42 billion).
	   Hong Kong's fiscal reserves were 430.29 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 55.17 billion), a decrease of 27.26 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 3.49 billion) since the end of March.
	   In the previous fiscal year, Hong Kong had an 80.9 billion Hong
Kong dollar (dlrs 10.37 billion) surplus. The territory is running
a deficit this year because of tax breaks and increased spending on
programs intended to lift the economy out of recession.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday after receiving ``credible''
threats, an embassy spokesman said.
	   The spokesman, Larry Schwartz, would not elaborate, but an
Israeli security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the threats were aimed at the embassy staff. Israel radio said the
life of U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker was threatened.
	   Schwartz said the embassy was not searched, apparently ruling
out a possible bomb threat.
	   He said the ``direct and credible'' threat was received
Wednesday evening and that Walker decided to shut down the embassy
and informed staff not to report to work Thursday.
	   Schwartz said he did not know how long the embassy would be
closed. On Friday, New Year's Day, the embassy would be closed for
the holiday, followed by the weekend.
	   On Thursday, Israeli border police officers were seen talking to
U.S. security officials and taking notes. An Israeli border police
jeep was parked outside the building.
	   Tel Aviv police spokesman Nitza Friedman said ``police are doing
what they have to do.''
	   U.S. diplomatic missions have been on heightened security alert
since the twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam on Aug. 7. The attacks killed 224 people.
	   In retaliation, the United States bombed targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan that had links to Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire
and the alleged mastermind of the embassy bombings.
	   In the Middle East, there has been growing resentment against
the United States following the attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan
and the U.S. bombing of Iraq earlier this month.

Palestinian minister says he hopes state will come through talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A top Palestinian official said Wednesday that
he expected a Palestinian state to be formed in 1999, but that he
hoped it would be as a result of negotiations with Israel.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has made contradictory
statements in recent months about whether he would unilaterally
declare a state on May 4, the deadline for reaching a permanent
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to walk
away from the peace talks and annex parts of the West Bank if
Arafat goes ahead with a unilaterally declaration of statehood.
	   Israeli elections are scheduled for May 17, and it is believed
that a Palestinian declaration of statehood on May 4 would give a
boost to Netanyahu over his dovish challengers.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath suggested Thursday
that the Palestinians might be willing to hold off for a while on
declaring a state.
	   ``The sovereign state of Palestine will be declared in 1999, I
have no doubt,'' Shaath told Israel army radio.
	   ``But I still say that our preference is that we will finish
together the permanent status negotiations,'' he added.
	   Shaath said he did not want the declaration of a Palestinian
state to become the source of problems between the two people.
	   The Haaretz newspaper reported Thursday that Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak asked Arafat during recent talks to delay a
declaration of a state so as not to interfere in the Israeli
elections.

Australia clinches huge race course deal in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian expertise will be used to
build a U.S. dlrs 256 million horse racing complex in China under a
deal announced Thursday.
	   The racing complex will be built in Dalian on China's northeast
coast, Independent Victoria state member of Parliament and
delegation leader Peter McLellan said.
	   ``We have a memorandum of understanding to build a race course
and we are going to provide all the expertise to do it,'' he said.
	   ``It is going to happen. It is not pie in the sky. We have a
permit from the central Chinese government to do it,'' said.
	   McLellan estimated up to dlrs 61 million would flow to Victoria
as a result of the deal.
	   Track officials, managers, veterinarians and other racing
experts from Victoria will visit China to train people.
	   About 500 horses will also be bought from around Australia and
sent to China.
	   The 6,600-foot (2,000-meter) race track will be built at the
Golden Pebble beach resort near Dalian.
	   Work on the complex, which includes breeding facilities,
training facilities and stables, is expected to start early in
1999.
	   Introduced to China by British traders in the 18th Century,
horse racing was promptly banned when the Communists seized power
almost 50 years ago.
	   But it has made a comeback.
	   Gambling is still officially prohibited, but at the Beijing and
Guangzhou jockey clubs the ban is neatly sidestepped by describing
the practice as a ``horse racing intelligence competition.''
	   At the Xiang Village racecourse in Beijing, signs exhort patrons
to observe the central government's instructions outlawing
gambling.
	   The signs are prominently displayed near the long queues of
Chinese eager to lay a bet with the on-course bookmakers before
each race.

Indonesian economy contracts 14 percent, inflation up 78 percent in
</HEADLINE>
1998
 &UR; Eds: One name only for Sugito is correct.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's economy shrank nearly 14
percent and prices rose 78 percent in 1998 during the worst
financial crisis in three decades, the government said Thursday.
	   Indonesian officials said the economic outlook for 1999 is
uncertain although the worst of the turmoil that stripped millions
of people of their jobs appears to have ended.
	   Inflation is expected to range between 15 percent and 20 percent
in 1999, said Sugito, chairman of the state Central Bureau of
Statistics.
	   He said the economy could contract by as much as 2 percent or
grow as much as 1.5 percent next year.
	   Triggered by the crash of Asian currencies in 1997, Indonesia's
economic malaise was aggravated by political unrest that led to the
ouster in May of former President Suharto.
	   Critics allege that official corruption under the authoritarian
Suharto contributed to the economic turmoil in Indonesia, which has
received billions of dollars in aid from the International Monetary
Fund and other foreign lenders.
	   Prices rose 1.42 percent in December, an increase of 0.08
percent over the rate in November, the government said. Inflation
for the year was 77.63 percent and the economy contracted 13.68
percent.
	   Sugito said most industries in the world's fourth most populous
nation contracted in 1998, except for agriculture, electricity,
gas, and potable water.
	   Predictions for the economy next year are clouded by political
uncertainty and the fear of unrest ahead of parliamentary elections
scheduled for June.
	   ``Next year is a very unpredictable year,'' Sugito said. ``We
don't know if the election will be smooth, and we don't know if the
new government will maintain current economic policies.''
	   Indonesia has closed insolvent banks and has taken other steps
to reform its economy in line with terms of the IMF-led bailout
plan.

French minister says Duisenberg should honor pledge to stand down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's finance minister said Thursday that
European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg should honor a
commitment to step down after four years to make way for the
candidate France had backed for the post.
	   Duisenberg, in an interview published Wednesday by the newspaper
Le Monde, said he will not step down after completing half his
term. France had secured a verbal agreement that he was to be
replaced by Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet.
	   Speaking at a news conference on the eve of the new euro
currency, French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said
Duisenberg's remarks were ``not in accordance with commitments'' he
made when approved for the job.
	   ``I refer you to the formal declaration made by Mr Duisenberg
last May and I have no reason to think things will be any
different,'' Strauss-Kahn said.
	   The new European Central Bank will govern the policies of the
euro, the new single currency which goes into effect Jan. 1.
	   France surprised its euro partners by proposing Trichet at the
last minute for the job Duisenberg was expected to secure easily.
	   Duisenberg agreed to step down after four years, but has since
said no such ``gentleman's agreement'' exists.
	   Trichet, in a television interview Thursday evening, said that
``a decision has been taken by the heads of state and government.''
	   President Jacques Chirac's Elysee Palace said Thursday it would
not comment on Duisenberg's remarks.
	   The newspaper Le Figaro was more forthcoming: ``New Europe
strikes its first bad note,'' said its front page headline.

Four remaining Chinese sextuplets struggle for survival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two of the four surviving infants from China's
first naturally conceived set of sextuplets have been experiencing
breathing difficulties, a hospital official said Thursday.
	   All four lost some weight after their birth on Dec. 23, but the
three boys regained all they lost. The only surviving girl remained
in the most delicate condition and occasionally had stopped
breathing, said the director of the Newborn Research Section at the
No. 2 Hospital at China Medical University, in the northeastern
city of Shenyang.
	   The babies remained in critical condition, said the official,
who gave only his surname, Xue.
	   The two smallest babies, a boy and a girl, died last weekend of
lung hemorrhages.
	   The mother, Yao Hong, hadn't used fertility drugs, making her
babies the first naturally conceived sextuplets in China. Chinese
media reports cited experts saying the likelihood of a woman giving
birth naturally to sextuplets was one in 400 billion.
	   A report Thursday in the newspaper Health Daily said that the
three largest baby boys were a set of identical triplets. The three
smaller babies _ two girls and a boy, were from separate embryos,
it said.
	   The babies were delivered by Caesarian section when Yao, then 28
weeks pregnant, experienced delivery problems. The largest weighed
2 1/2 pounds.

Palestinian minister says he hopes state will come through talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A top Palestinian official said Thursday that
he expected a Palestinian state to be formed in 1999, but that he
hoped it would be as a result of negotiations with Israel.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has made contradictory
statements in recent months about whether he would unilaterally
declare a state on May 4, the deadline for reaching a permanent
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to walk
away from the peace talks and annex parts of the West Bank if
Arafat goes ahead with a unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   Israeli elections are scheduled for May 17, and it is believed
that a Palestinian declaration of statehood on May 4 would give a
boost to Netanyahu over his dovish challengers.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath suggested Thursday
that the Palestinians might be willing to hold off for a while on
declaring a state.
	   ``The sovereign state of Palestine will be declared in 1999, I
have no doubt,'' Shaath told Israel army radio.
	   ``But I still say that our preference is that we will finish
together the permanent status negotiations,'' he added.
	   Shaath said he did not want the declaration of a Palestinian
state to become the source of problems between the two peoples.
	   The Haaretz newspaper reported Thursday that Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak asked Arafat during recent talks to delay a
declaration of a state so as not to interfere in the Israeli
elections.

U.N. begins evacuating staff from besieged Angolan city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations has started evacuating
its staff from Huambo, Angola's second largest city, after a rebel
artillery barrage that wounded at least 20 civilians, a diplomat
said Thursday.
	   The diplomat, speaking on condition he not be named, declined to
say how many U.N. staff were in the central highland city where
fighting between the army and UNITA rebels has escalated in recent
days.
	   The International Red Cross said 20 wounded civilians were
admitted to Huambo hospital after Wednesday's hour-long bombardment
by UNITA's long-range artillery.
	   A private radio station, Luanda Antena Comercial, said 12 people
died in the barrage. Another private radio, Radio Eclesia, said
eight people were killed.
	   A U.N.-chartered cargo plane crashed near Huambo on Saturday
with eight U.N. peacekeepers and six others on board. The cause of
the crash, as the plane passed over the war zone, is not yet known.
	   The United Nations Observer Mission, in Angola to oversee
implementation of the country's collapsed 1994 peace accord, still
has not received guarantees of safe passage from the warring
factions to send a rescue team to the crash site, U.N. spokesman
Hamadoun Toure said.
	   The city lies about 300 miles (480 kilometers) southeast of the
capital, Luanda.
	   IRC spokeswoman Francoise Zambelini said fighting in the
countryside around the government-held city made it impossible to
fly aid into Huambo.
	   ``The situation is still very tense in Huambo and the
surrounding area,'' Zambelini said by phone.
	   The IRC has five staff in Huambo but has no plans to evacuate
them, she said.
	   There are between 20 and 30 international aid agency staff in
Huambo, according to the United Nations.
	   With the resumption of the civil war since Dec. 4, the United
Nations is faced with the decision of whether to pull out some
1,000 troops in its observer mission when its mandate expires on
Jan. 15.
	   U.N. diplomats say Secretary-general Kofi Annan may recommend
that the Security Council withdraw the U.N. mission rather than
renew the mandate.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations. The
fighting renewed when the government tried to take the strongholds
by force and was beaten back.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

Suspect indicted in killing of Turkish journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Over five years after the killing of an
investigative journalist investigating ties between the state and
the underworld, the prosecutor's office on Thursday announced it
has indicted its first suspect in the case.
	   Abdullah Argun Cetin was indicted as an accomplice in the
killing of Ugur Mumcu.
	   Mumcu was investigating suspected links between the drug
underworld, right-wing terrorists and the government when bomb
under his car went off on Jan. 24, 1993.
	   Prosecutor Hamza Keles is asking for the death penalty.
	   The indictment says that Cetin has links to Mahmut Yildirim, who
worked for the state assassinating people seen as security threats.
It also says Cetin was trained in Azerbaijan using the explosive
C-4, which was in the bomb that killed Mumcu.
	   Police arrested Cetin last month after getting a tip that he was
planning the slayings of a new series of targets, including another
prominent journalist.
	   A car crash two years ago confirmed for the first time what many
Turks long suspected _ that state officials had close ties to
mobsters. A fugitive terrorist, a police chief and a deputy were
all riding in the same car.
	   The wreck set off a chain reaction of investigations and
allegations which led to the sacking of several policemen, the
trial of two deputies, including a former interior minister, and
the collapse of the government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz last
month.

China says missing Japanese ship found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China confirmed Thursday that a Japanese cargo
vessel that went missing in September and which was thought to have
been hijacked has been found in a Chinese port.
	   Chinese maritime authorities have impounded the 2,600-ton Tenyu
at the request of its owner, said Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
	   In announcing the ship's discovery in an east China port, Zhu
denounced piracy and robbery as ``inhuman atrocities'' and promised
China's continued cooperation in efforts to fight it.
	   ``The Chinese government has all along firmly and strongly
condemned any act of piracy and robbery,'' he said.
	   Earlier, a port official had expressed doubt that the vessel in
question was the missing Tenyu, owned by Japanese shipping company
Masumoto Kisen.
	   The Tenyu disappeared Sept. 27 after leaving an Indonesian port
with a cargo of aluminum worth about 500 million yen (dlrs 4.3
million).
	   Zhu said the ship was found in Zhangjiagang port in Jiangsu
province, near Shanghai, bearing a new name and a Honduran flag.
	   ``Concerted efforts'' by Chinese maritime officials determined
that the vessel ``is in fact the missing ship MD Tenyu,'' Zhu said.
``The case is under investigation.''
	   Zhu made no mention, however, of the ship's crew.
	   South Korean maritime police said the Tenyu had been piloted by
a South Korean skipper, Shin Young-ju, and chief engineer, Park
Ha-joon, and was manned by a crew of 12 Chinese sailors.
	   In April, Chinese authorities discovered another hijacked
vessel, the Malaysian-registered Petro Ranger, on China's Hainan
Island, and detained 12 Indonesians.
	   The circumstances of that hijacking provoked a controversy, with
Chinese authorities saying the ship actually was involved in
smuggling while the Malaysian government contended the vessel had
been hijacked by Indonesians.

At least two dead after boat carrying illegal immigrants sinks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ At least two people drowned and another
two were reportedly missing Thursday when a wooden boat carrying
illegal immigrants sank in the Aegean, rescue officials said.
	   Nearby ships and port authority vessels managed to rescue two
Greeks and 21 Pakistani, Indian and Iraqi men who had been on board
the 17-meter (56-foot), Italian-flagged Mustang, the merchant
ministry said.
	   They also recovered two bodies off the island of Nissiros, about
320 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Athens. The nationalities
of the dead were not immediately clear.
	   A helicopter and coast guard vessels searched for other
survivors or casualties. Authorities were unsure how many people
were originally on board.
	   According to media reports, at least two men _ one Greek and one
Yugoslav _ were reported missing.
	   One Iraqi survivor said he saw at least five people drown, but
his account could not be independently confirmed, the ministry
said.
	   The Mustang began to take on water and sank at around 5:30 a.m.
(0330 GMT) seven miles west of Nissiros, located near the Turkish
coast, the ministry added.
	   The 23 people rescued were to be taken to the nearby island of
Kos, the ministry said.
	   Thousands of illegal immigrants, mostly Iraqi Kurds, attempt
each year to cross from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands.
Many are arrested and deported, but others apply for asylum in
Greece and are taken to refugee camps while their applications are
processed.
	   Hundreds find work clandestinely in Greece or move on to Italy
to make their way to other European countries.

China draws blank on missing Indonesian fugitive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities said Friday they have so far
failed to locate a missing Indonesian businessman who is said to be
running a brewery in China after having escaped from jail in 1996.
	   The Indonesian government asked its embassy in Beijing to check
the validity of a report that Eddy Tansil, who was sentenced to 20
years in prison in one of Indonesia's biggest financial scandals,
was successfully operating a business in China.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Indonesia
had asked ``relevant countries and regions, including China'' for
assistance in locating Tansil.
	   ``China has attached great importance to this. However, so far,
the whereabouts of Eddy Tansil has not been found,'' Zhu said.
	   Tansil was convicted in 1994 of defrauding the government of
dlrs 430 million in a case that became a symbol of official
corruption in Indonesia. After serving two years of his sentence,
Tansil escaped from jail and eluded a nationwide manhunt.
	   An Indonesian watchdog group, Gempita, said this week that
Tansil owned a brewery in the southeastern Chinese province of
Fujian. Gempita is the acronym in the Indonesian language for
Movement of Concerned Citizens to Save State Assets.
	   Zhu said Indonesia could ask for Chinese help in investigating
any assets Tansil may have in China. ``China will give positive
consideration to the request,'' he said.

Chinese government departments and Communist Party give up

businesses

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Following moves to divest the Chinese military of
its vast corporate holdings, the ruling Communist Party and
government departments are also severing their business ties, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Departments of the central government and the Communist Party
have completed the process of divestiture ahead of a Jan. 1
deadline and will no longer run the array of businesses they once
owned and managed, Xinhua said.
	   During the transition, businesses were told to maintain normal
operations and ensure the stability of their work forces.
Profitable enterprises are to be kept open, while loss-makers will
be suspended or shut down, the report said.
	   China's central and local government still keeps tight links to
business through thousands of state-owned enterprises. But the
order pulls officials out of positions of corporate management and
eliminated direct government ownership stakes.
	   Chinese leaders have criticized officials' direct commercial
ties for fostering unfair competition and corrupt business
practices. The People's Liberation Army formally gave up its
business holdings earlier this year.
	   In the days of central planning, Chinese state enterprises not
only answered to government departments but were owned by them.
	   The government is trying to reform such companies, many of which
are unprofitable, to enable them to adjust better to market
competition.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seven out of ten Russian don't expect their lives
to improve in 1999, despite the government's pledge to resurrect
the economy after a devastating financial crisis, according to a
poll released Thursday.
	   Eighteen percent of the 6,000 people surveyed by the Institute
of Parliamentary Sociology said they expected some improvement in
their lives, while 12 percent couldn't predict, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   But 70 percent of those polled across Russia said their living
situation wouldn't get better in the upcoming year.
	   The report gave no margin of error for the poll.
	   Respondents said the were most likely to worry about wage
arrears and low salaries in 1999. They were also afraid that health
care and other social services would fall further into neglect.
	   Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the government has had
trouble paying wages and pensions on time. The education and health
care systems have also been extremely hard hit.
	   These problems have been exacerbated by the country's latest
economic crisis, which hit in August.

China lifts silk exports restrictions to U.S.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will lift restrictions on the export of
silk clothing to the United States on Friday, giving a boost to
what is already a billion dollar industry, official media said
Thursday.
	   Following a new agreement between China and the U.S., silk
garment exporters will no longer require an official export
license, the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The move will help China improve its management of silk clothing
exports to the United States, simplify export procedures, cut the
cost of operations, and ``boost the growth of bilateral trade
relations,'' Xinhua reported.
	   Textiles and apparel are China's leading export products to the
U.S., with annual exports valued at dlrs 45 billion, Xinhua said.
The export of silk garments is valued at close to dlrs 2 billion a
year, it said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's parliament and its top Islamic court
have agreed to settle a dispute that arose last week when the court
suspended the legislature and accused it of failing to adhere to
Muslim practices, a report said Thursday.
	   The head of the Islamic court Bekhan Nasukhanov and parliament
chairman Ruslan Alikhadzhiyev met Wednesday evening and agreed to
negotiate a solution, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Representatives of the clergy will work with legislators to make
sure that laws are in accordance with Shariah, or Islamic law, the
report said.
	   Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in southern Russia, has been
running its own affairs since Russian troops left at the end of a
1994-6 war.
	   Chechnya's leadership instituted Islamic courts soon after the
war ended, but Muslim clerics say that many aspects of the
political and legal system still need to be changed.
	   The Supreme Shariah Court on Dec. 24 declared that parliament's
activities should be suspended, but the legislators objected.
	   Chechnya's leaders, including President Aslan Maskhadov, have
been unable to restore law and order following the war. Hundreds of
people have been kidnapped in recent years and armed gangs roam the
country.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The judge in the sex and
corruption trial of Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader, Anwar
Ibrahim, granted a request on Thursday to give defense lawyers more
time to study complex state DNA evidence against the ex-deputy
premier.
	   A state DNA expert on Wednesday positively identified Anwar's
DNA from semen stains on a mattress that he allegedly used for
sexual trysts with male and female partners.
	   Prosecutors are trying to prove the former deputy prime minister
had sex with the wife of his former secretary, sodomized his family
driver and abused his powers to try to cover up sexual trysts.
	   Trial Judge Augustine Paul earlier in the week rejected a
defense request to allow testimony from its own DNA experts. Anwar,
in a written statement to Paul, asked that his attorneys be given
until Jan. 7 to cross-examine state DNA expert Lim Kong Boon.
	   ``Having regard to the very political nature of this prosecution
case against me and the importance to the defense of the evidence
in question, I feel that the experts to advise the defense should
truly be independent and be known to be specialists in the field of
DNA profiling,'' Anwar said in his statement.
	   In response, Paul ruled Thursday that the cross-examination of
the state's DNA expert witness be put off until all other people on
the prosecution's list have taken the witness stand.
	   Anwar's team plan to fly in foreign DNA experts to brief them on
how to conduct their cross-examination of Lim.
	   ``I would ask that this request be considered sympathetically
and that it be granted in the interest of justice,'' Anwar said.
	   Though Paul granted the request for more time, he refused to
allow the defense's own DNA expert to sit in court and advise
Anwar's lawyers on how to grill Lim.
	   ``The matter is well within your competence,'' Paul told Anwar's
so-called dream team of nine prominent defense lawyers. ``If you
read books, they will give you the legal aspects on how you can go
about attacking a DNA expert.''
	   Earlier Thursday, Lim explained in excruciating detail how he
came to his conclusion that the stains on the mattress were those
of Anwar, Shamsidar Taharin, his secretary's wife, and those of
another unidentified woman and man.
	   The mattress was seized by police in July from an apartment in a
Kuala Lumpur allegedly used by Anwar.
	   Lim, speaking in highly technical English and using diagrams
that he referred to with a laser pointer, prompted yawns from some
observers and a flurry of activity from local Chinese-language
newspaper reporters as they flipped through English-Chinese
dictionaries.
	   After an hour of explanation from Lim, the judge turned to the
defense team and quipped: ``So, it is quite easy to understand,
isn't it? You don't need an expert with you when it's made so easy
to understand.''
	   Before the proceedings began, Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail,
presented him with a large Hari Raya card from his supporters. Hari
Raya is the celebration that takes place at the end of the Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2
after Mahathir deemed him morally unfit to lead the country. He was
arrested on Sept. 20 and badly beaten while in police custody,
causing an outcry over his treatment.
	   He is on trial for abuse of power and will be tried separately
on charges of engaging in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were fabricated as part of a government conspiracy to undermine his
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Paul also rejected on Thursday a defense request to recall to
the witness stand Dr. Halim Haji Manzar. The state pathologist
wrote a medical report detailing the injuries Anwar sustained while
in police custody.
	   ``I'm afraid I'm unable to agree to the request on the simple
reason that the report is not relevant to this case,'' Paul said
before adjourning for the holiday weekend and wishing everyone a
happy New Year.

U.N. begins evacuating staff from besieged Angolan city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. evacuating staff from Huambo, more
casualties reported from bombardment. &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations has started evacuating
its staff from Huambo, Angola's second largest city, after a rebel
artillery barrage that killed at least eight people and wounded at
least 20 civilians.
	   A diplomat, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity,
declined to say how many U.N. staff were in the central highland
city where fighting between the army and UNITA rebels has escalated
in recent days.
	   The International Red Cross said 20 wounded civilians were
admitted to the Huambo hospital after Wednesday's hour-long
bombardment by UNITA's long-range artillery.
	   A private radio station, Luanda Antena Comercial, said 12 people
died in the barrage. Another private station, Radio Eclesia, said
eight people were killed.
	   A U.N.-chartered cargo plane crashed near Huambo on Saturday
with eight U.N. peacekeepers and six others on board. The cause of
the crash, as the plane passed over the war zone, is not yet known.
	   The United Nations Observer Mission, in Angola to oversee
implementation of the country's collapsed 1994 peace accord, still
has not received guarantees of safe passage from the warring
factions to send a rescue team to the crash site, U.N. spokesman
Hamadoun Toure said.
	   Huambo lies about 300 miles (480 kilometers) southeast of the
capital, Luanda.
	   Before the civil war resumed on Dec. 4, Huambo had a population
of about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees fleeing
fighting in the countryside have converged on the city in recent
weeks.
	   Francoise Zambelini, a spokeswoman for the IRC in Luanda, said
fighting in the countryside around the government-held city made it
impossible to fly aid into Huambo.
	   ``The situation is still very tense in Huambo and the
surrounding area,'' Zambelini said by telephone.
	   The IRC has five staff members in Huambo but has no plans to
evacuate them, she said.
	   There are between 20 and 30 international aid agency workers in
Huambo in addition to U.N. staff members, according to the United
Nations.
	   With the resumption of the civil war, the United Nations is
faced with the decision of whether to pull out some 1,000 troops in
its observer mission when its mandate expires on Jan. 15.
	   U.N. diplomats say Secretary-General Kofi Annan may recommend
that the Security Council withdraw the U.N. mission rather than
renew the mandate.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations. The
fighting renewed when government troops tried to take the
strongholds by force and were beaten back.
	   Earlier this week, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
ruled out talks with UNITA on ending the fighting, and said rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi was a liar for not complying with the 1994
peace pact.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

Milosevic's ally vows to defend Kosovo from NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Despite a conciliatory New Year's message
from the president of Yugoslavia, his government allies vowed
Thursday to defend Kosovo ``with all means'' and fight against NATO
if it intervenes in the troubled Serbian province.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday predicted a
political solution for the Kosovo conflict would come next year.
	   Milosevic, in a year-end message read on state television, said
he expected 1999 to lead to a ``multi-ethnic Kosovo, based on the
principles of equality for all.''
	   But his government ally, ultra-nationalist leader Vojislav
Seselj, said Serbia is taking continued NATO threats of
intervention in Kosovo very seriously, and ``we are ready to defend
it.''
	   He blasted NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who this week
said NATO won't tolerate violence in Kosovo and was ready to
intervene.
	   ``Warnings of Javier Solana remind me of one-time threats by
Adolf Hitler,'' Seselj told reporters. He said, ``NATO is an
aggressive military force threatening the whole mankind.''
	   In his year-end address, Milosevic said no ethnic group would be
favored in Kosovo. ``Not the Serbs, but not the Albanians either.''
	   But he again ruled out independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, saying any efforts
to secede would ``come up against the will of the people'' of
Yugoslavia. Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, which
also consists of Montenegro.
	   In an interview with state-run Serbian Television, Milosevic's
foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, said, ``We are obliged to use
all means to oppose the rush of terrorism and separatism'' in
Kosovo.
	   Jovanovic's and Seslelj's comments heightened concerns that the
October truce between Serbian security forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's secession _ which was mediated by
American diplomats _ could collapse altogether.
	   Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo
claimed at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
	   Serb officials accuse the guerrillas, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, of triggering the clashes by attacking police and army units.
Jovanovic on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the KLA a
terrorist organization and crack down on their support network
abroad.
	   The KLA asserts they are only responding to attacks on them.
	   A Serb crackdown against the KLA earlier this year claimed more
than 1,000 lives and left about 300,000 people homeless. Milosevic
ended the aggression after NATO threatened airstrikes.

Official: 2,000 villagers held `hostage' in rebel retreat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ The Ninja militia group
battling Republic of Congo's government has retreated into two
villages near the capital where civilians were being held hostage,
officials said Thursday.
	   About 2,000 villagers, including women and children, were being
forced to stay in their homes in Djoumouna and Linzola, between 15
and 30 kilometers (10 to 20 miles) south of the capital of
Brazzaville, a senior military officer said on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``We have the means and the equipment necessary to dislodge the
militia, but we don't want to risk the chance of a civilian
massacre,'' the official said. ``The rebels know that and they are
holding the civilians hostage.''
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the claim and Ninja
leaders were unreachable for comment.
	   There has been no fighting between the two groups since last
weekend, when the government says it drove many of the Ninjas into
hiding in mountains and jungle southwest of the capital.
	   Hostilities flared in early December between the Ninjas, linked
to ex-Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, and President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso's personal Cobra militia.
	   Human rights and aid groups say the fighting has prompted tens
of thousands of civilians to flee their homes from Brazzaville and
towns in the southwest.
	   Unarmed residents have been killed, women raped and homes
destroyed since fighting broke out.
	   The hostilities are a reversal of a civil war last year that
ravaged Brazzaville and resulted in up to 10,000 deaths when
Sassou-Nguesso captured the presidency from Pascal Lissouba, a
sometime ally of Kolelas.
	   Sassou-Nguesso, the Republic of Congo's longtime Marxist
dictator who is now advocating capitalist reform, was ousted in the
country's first multiparty elections in 1992.

10-year-old bread arrives as humanitarian aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A truck full of bread baked in
1988 arrived last week as humanitarian aid in a village destroyed
by floods last year, the CTK news agency reported Thursday.
	   The German truck, sent to the village of Troubky, 300 kilometers
(180 miles) east of Prague, was supposed to contain furniture and
old clothing. Instead, it was loaded with bread normally used by
soldiers in war conditions.
	   ``We couldn't believe our own eyes when we opened the truck,''
Troubky Deputy Mayor Radek Brazda said. ``The situation here is not
that bad, they don't have to provide us with old bread.''
	   The load was eventually used to feed poultry, Brazda said,
although some people tried it and said it ``tasted good.''
	   Troubky was hit hard by massive floods in the summer of 1997.
Nine people died and 330 houses _ or almost half of the village_
were swept away.

German finance minister raises question of rate cuts again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Returning to a pet theme, German Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine again hinted he favors further interest
rate cuts by the European Central Bank on Thursday, just hours
before the launch of the euro.
	   In an article published in Germany's business daily
Handelsblatt, Lafontaine said interest rate cuts in early December
in the 11 countries joining the euro were ``a right step.''
	   The coordinated cuts on Dec. 3 lowered the ECB's key interest
rate to 3 percent.
	   ``With a stability-oriented financial and wage policy, the ECB
has more room for a monetary policy that supports growth and
employment,'' Lafontaine wrote. ``With price stability achieved,
this room exists.''
	   Since taking office in October, Lafontaine has stirred
controversy with repeated calls for lower rates to help Europe's
governments fight chronically high unemployment and flagging
growth.
	   Lower interest rates can spur an economy by making it cheaper to
borrow money.
	   His outspoken stance has been seen as a threat to the fledgling
ECB's independence, but Lafontaine strongly endorsed the bank's
independence in the article.
	   The ECB ``is politically independent and not subject to
directives. No one in Europe will or is allowed to question this,''
he wrote.
	   Lafontaine last raised the possibility of easing monetary policy
two weeks ago, saying ``I have taken note that two German financial
institutions have said that there is further room for rate cuts by
the ECB,'' without naming the institutions. ``I will closely watch
further developments,'' he said.

Tourists return to Arc de Triomphe as five-day strike ends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Arc de Triomphe re-opened to the public on
Thursday after striking workers reached a deal with management over
wage demands and the hiring of more staff, union officials said.
	   The stone arch at the head of the Avenue des Champs-Elysees, one
of the world's most famous monuments to military glory, had been
closed since Saturday.
	   Workers said they needed better resources to handle increasingly
large crowds drawn to the Arc's splendid rooftop view: a panorama
of the Right Bank's skyline and the 12 tree-lined avenues
stretching out like spokes of a wheel.
	   Union officials said management had agreed to create five new
posts. No details were available about the salary increases.
	   Some 50 meters (about 150 feet) high and 45 meters (about 135
feet) wide, the Arc attracts about 1.4 million visitors a year.
	   Besides the rooftop view, a spacious indoor hall houses
user-friendly exhibits on French military history.
	   Recently, strikes also have hit the Orsay, Louvre and Grand
Palais museums, with employees making similar demands for more
staff. Workers also went on strike at the Eiffel Tower.

Seven candidates compete for World Cup 2006
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany, England, Brazil, South
Africa, Morocco, Egypt and Ghana are the official candidates to
host the 2006 World Cup finals.
	   The seven countries all notified FIFA in advance of the Thursday
night deadline of their intent to stage soccer's four-yearly
showcase. They now have until the end of July to submit their full
bid documents.
	   FIFA's 24-member executive committee will decide in March 2000.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter has repeatedly said the soccer
authority has a responsibility to stage the tournament in Africa,
which has never hosted the finals.
	   Despite its high crime rate, South Africa is widely considered
the front-runner. It hosted the 1995 rugby union World Cup, the
1996 African Nations Cup and the 1998 athletics World Cup.
	   Morocco lost out to France for the staging of this year's
finals.
	   The case of both Germany and England has been weakened by the
fact that they are from the same continent. The 2002 finals are
being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA insists that
co-hosting will be a one-time exception.

Milosevic ally vows to defend Kosovo from NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Despite a conciliatory New Year's message
from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, his government allies
vowed Thursday to defend Kosovo with ``all means'' and fight
against NATO if it intervenes in the troubled Serbian province.
	   Milosevic on Wednesday predicted a political solution for the
Kosovo conflict would come next year.
	   In a year-end message read on state television, Milosevic said
he expected 1999 to lead to a ``multi-ethnic Kosovo, based on the
principles of equality for all.''
	   But his government ally, Serbia's ultra-nationalist Vice Premier
Vojislav Seselj, said Serbia is taking continued NATO threats of
intervention in Kosovo very seriously, and ``we are ready to defend
it.''
	   He blasted NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who this week
said the alliance won't tolerate violence in Kosovo and was ready
to intervene.
	   ``Warnings of Javier Solana remind me of one-time threats by
Adolf Hitler,'' Seselj told reporters. He added, ``NATO is an
aggressive military force threatening the whole mankind.''
	   In his year-end address, Milosevic said no ethnic group would be
favored in Kosovo. ``Not the Serbs, but not the Albanians either.''
	   But he again ruled out independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, saying any efforts
to secede would ``come up against the will of the people'' of
Yugoslavia. Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, which
also consists of Montenegro.
	   In an interview with state-run Serbian Television, Milosevic's
foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, said, ``We are obliged to use
all means to oppose the rush of terrorism and separatism'' in
Kosovo.
	   Jovanovic's and Seslelj's comments heightened concerns that the
October truce between Serbian security forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's secession _ which was mediated by
American diplomats _ could collapse altogether.
	   Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo
claimed at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
	   Serb officials accuse the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army of
triggering the clashes by attacking police and army units.
Jovanovic on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the KLA a
terrorist organization and crack down on their support network
abroad.
	   The KLA asserts they are only responding to attacks on them.
	   A Serb crackdown against the KLA earlier this year claimed more
than 1,000 lives and left about 300,000 people homeless. Milosevic
ended the attacks after NATO threatened airstrikes.

U.S. Embassy closed unexpectedly after threat

parking lot &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday after receiving ``credible''
threats, an embassy spokesman said. Israeli police posted extra
security at the Mediterranean beachfront building.
	   The spokesman, Larry Schwartz, said the closure was in line with
``actions the U.S. government has taken in recent weeks in light of
the heightened general threats in the region.''
	   U.S. diplomatic missions around the world have been on
heightened alert since the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in which 224 people were killed.
	   In the Middle East, there has been growing resentment against
the United States following the U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan
and Afghanistan _ in retaliation for the embassy bombings _ and the
U.S. air strikes against Iraq earlier this month.
	   Schwartz said a ``direct and credible'' threat against the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv was received Wednesday evening and that in
response, U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker ordered employees not to
report to work on Thursday.
	   He would not elaborate on the nature of the threat.
	   Israel radio quoted police officials as saying that an anonymous
caller told an embassy security agent on Wednesday night that the
embassy would be blown up on Thursday.
	   However, Schwartz said the embassy was not searched, an apparent
indication that the threat was of a different nature. On Thursday,
Israeli and U.S. security officials peeked into windows of cars in
the embassy parking lot, but did not conduct thorough searches.
	   An Israeli security source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the threats were aimed at the embassy staff. Israel radio said
the life of U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker was threatened.
	   Several Israeli border policemen were posted at the entrance to
the embassy. A sign at the door informed visitors that the embassy
was closed, but did not give an explanation.
	   ``They just told me that they would be closed until after the
New Year's holiday and that the embassy would be open Monday,''
said Shahar Yaron, a 25-year-old Tel Aviv resident who was trying
to obtain a U.S. tourist visa.
	   Schwartz said he did not know how long the embassy would be
closed.
	   The U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa have been blamed on
suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire. Bin
Laden, who is based in Afghanistan, denies the charge, but says he
supported the attacks.
	   By contrast, Islamic militants in the Palestinians areas,
particularly the Hamas group, have been careful not to utter
threats against the United States. Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin
has said his struggle is against Israel, not America.

Muslim rebels warn forces not to fire weapons to celebrate New
</HEADLINE>
Year &QL; 
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim rebels in the Philippines on
Thursday joined a government effort to bring down the number of
people hurt during New Year's revelry by ordering their forces not
to fire guns to celebrate the start of 1999.
	   Ghazali Jaafar, deputy chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, said the movement's fighters have been warned they will be
punished for firing their weapons to commemorate the new year.
	   ``For every bullet fired, the penalty would be equivalent to
planting at least 20 banana plants,'' Jaafar said.
	   In the MILF's main guerrilla camp, Jaafar said warnings against
firing guns outside of combat have been posted on the walls of
houses.
	   On Monday, President Joseph Estrada urged soldiers, policemen
and civilians to refrain from firing weapons. He said soldiers and
policemen will be dismissed from the service if caught, while
civilians will face criminal charges and confiscation of their
guns.
	   Manila area police chief Reynaldo Wycoco said policemen have
been ordered to clean their weapons before the new year. The guns
will be inspected again in early 1999 to determine if they were
fired.
	   ``The president's order is clear,'' Wycoco said. ``They have
nothing to gain if they violate it, but they will lose their jobs
or even get hurt if they violate it.''
	   Perhaps no nation greets the new year with more noise than the
Philippines. The fireworks tradition comes from China, but has been
elevated to new flamboyant heights by Filipinos. Many believe
firecrackers scare away bad luck and bring good fortune.
	   Television stations have joined the move to prevent injuries by
cautioning Filipinos against firing weapons during New Year's
celebrations. They have been broadcasting footage of people maimed
by gun- and fireworks-related accidents in previous years.
	   ``So far, so good,'' said Concepcion Gahol of the Department of
Health's fireworks monitoring office. She said that from Dec. 21 to
Dec. 30, 187 people have been reported wounded by firecrackers and
10 others by stray bullets. There were no deaths reported, she
added.
	   Gahol said the figure is likely to increase beginning at
midnight Thursday when the country rings in the new year.
	   The number of victims has fallen in recent years as prevention
efforts have been stepped up. During the same period last year, one
person was reported killed and 189 others were injured by
firecrackers.
	   In 1996, at least 11 people were killed during New Year's
revelry, including six hit by stray bullets, and 700 others were
injured. In 1995, more than a dozen people were killed and about
5,000 were reported hurt.

At end of 1998, Israel's population 6.037 million

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's population at the end of 1998 numbered
6.037 million, a 2.3 percent increase from a year ago, the Central
Bureau of Statistics said Thursday.
	   Of that number, 4.783 million, or 79.2 percent, were Jews, and
1.254 million, or 20.8 percent were non-Jews, including 901,000
Muslims and 129,000 Christians, the bureau said.
	   The number of immigrants to Israel fell by 14 percent in 1998 to
56,700 from 66,000 in 1997, the bureau said. The number of
immigrants from the former Soviet Union fell to 45,400 in 1998 from
54,600 in 1997.
	   More than 769,000 people emigrated to Israel from the former
Soviet Union from 1989 through 1998, accounting for some 85 percent
of all immigration during that period, the bureau said.

Players work on ``final'' offer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with New York Post report &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The union for locked-out NBA players spent
Thursday finalizing its ``final'' offer and wondering whether
arbitrator John Feerick might hear another case.
	   With only eight days left before commissioner David Stern's
deadline for saving the season, the union was expected to make a
counteroffer to the owners either Thursday or Friday.
	   Union director Billy Hunter has asked to present the offer to
the owners' negotiating committee, but that may not be logistically
possible.
	   ``Billy will decide the best way to do this,'' said Jeffrey
Kessler, lead outside counsel for the union.
	   Kessler was on the phone Wednesday night trying to locate
Feerick in the hope that the arbitrator might convene an expedited
hearing in the case of Nick Van Exel and two other players who are
seeking to play in Europe for the rest of the season _ even if the
lockout ends.
	   A federal court judge in Houston rejected an injunction sought
by Van Exel, Marcus Camby and Reggie Slater for unconditional
letters of clearance from the NBA and USA Basketball but told the
plaintiffs they could submit their dispute to an arbitrator.
	   Agent James Bryant said he would do so.
	   The union then tried to contact Feerick, dean of Fordham
University law school, to set up an expedited hearing Thursday or
Friday.
	   ``In open court, the NBA's attorney stipulated that Dean Feerick
can decide the case within 24 hours,'' Bryant said.
	   Jeffrey Mishkin, chief legal officer for the NBA, said Bryant's
statement was completely untrue.
	   Stern said Monday that if the players brought him something new,
he'd present it to his negotiating committee. With that in mind,
the players are hoping their new offer will jump start talks.
	   ``I have called David Stern and requested an opportunity to
present it to the owners' labor committee as soon as they're
available, and certainly before the Jan. 7 date that Stern has set
as the owners' deadline,'' Hunter told the players.
	   Union president Patrick Ewing, meanwhile, said the owners'
``final'' offer _ which the commissioner presented earlier this
week _ would not be put to a vote of the general membership unless
a majority asked for it.
	   A handful of players, including Jayson Williams and Kevin
Willis, have called for a chance to vote.
	   ``If the majority of the players call up and say they want a
vote, then we're bound to vote,'' Ewing said. ``But yesterday we
had a conference call and we put the question to them if they want
a vote. And as of today, no one has called to demand that we put it
to a vote.''
	   Williams blamed both sides for the stalled negotiations Tuesday,
and also told reporters he was ``ashamed to be associated with the
NBA.''
	   ``I don't know what Jayson is talking about,'' Ewing told the
New York Post. ``If Jayson has any gripes, he should call the
office and get any gripes he has straightened away. If he wanted to
be on the committee, he should have called up and asked to be on
the committee. We're working for him along with everybody else.
	   ``If Jayson has anything he wants to say to me, come say it to
me face to face. I have no problem with that. If anybody has a
problem with me, come talk to me face to face. I'm tired of hearing
all this stuff and reading things in the paper.''
	   Williams stood by his comments Wednesday.
	   ``What I said is what a lot of players are thinking,'' Williams
told the Post. ``I didn't say Billy Hunter is doing an incompetent
job. Or David Stern is doing a lesser job. Basically, I said,
`Let's vote.' I said what was on my mind, and I stand by that. ...
Patrick Ewing, Alonzo (Mourning), nobody can tell me what to say.
	   ``We can put a 125-year-old man on the moon, and we can't get a
deal done? I don't agree with any of them. I don't agree with the
league or the union.''
	   Stern sent each player a copy of a letter he wrote to Hunter
asking for a vote.
	   ``While it is your prerogative to reject our proposal, the
consequences of that decision will be so catastrophic to your
members that simple fairness suggests they be given a chance to be
heard,'' Stern wrote. ``Accordingly, we request and strongly urge
that you put the NBA's final offer to a vote of the entire union
membership.''
	   Stern's letter, also sent to reporters, lists the additional
concessions the owners offered last Sunday at a negotiating session
in Denver.
	   Hunter's letter detailed areas where the sides remain in
disagreement, including changes to salary cap rules that the union
calls a ``List of Horribles.''
	   ``The negotiating committee and I do not believe the owners have
met us halfway yet, and we are not prepared to recommend that you
accept this proposal,'' Hunter wrote.

Dakar Rally starts with preparatory stage in southern Spanish city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRANADA, Spain (AP) _ The 21st Dakar rally famed for pushing
riders and their vehicles to the limit, roared into gear Thursday
but didn't go anywhere.
	   The 90 cars, 163 motorcycles and 51 trucks competing in the race
due to end in Dakar, Senegal, on Jan. 17, began with a preparatory
5-kilometer (3-mile) spin around a muddy army base in this southern
Spanish city.
	   The first of the grueling rally's 16 stages scheduled for Friday
covers 520 kilometers (322.4 miles) from Granada southwest to the
coastal town of Algeciras.
	   Once the participants have crossed the narrow stretch of the
Mediterranean Sea separating Spain from North Africa, they are set
to begin their odyssey through Morocco, Mauritania, Mali and
Burkino Faso, before reaching Senegal.
	   In the rally car category defending champion Jean-Pierre
Fontenay and his Mitsubishi team start off as favorites.
	   The race looks more open for the motorcycles, particularly since
Frenchman Stephane Peterhansel, who won the title a record six
times, will be driving a car this year.

Khmer Rouge leaders enjoy beach holiday; UN probes possible trial

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Khmer Rouge leaders under
controversial government protection complained Thursday that the
media were wrecking their New Year's beach holiday.
	   The United Nations meanwhile pondered dwindling options of
bringing them to justice for genocide.
	   After basking in VIP treatment in Phnom Penh for two days, Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea began touring the country they helped turn
into a bloody slave-labor camp when the Khmer Rouge held power from
1975 to 1979.
	   Escorted by military police providing tight security, the two
drove with their families in luxury vehicles to the seaside town of
Sihanoukville, first leg of a tour that will take them to the
ancient Angkor temples and their home provinces.
	   Along the roads, they will pass memorials stacked with bones and
skulls of thousands of their victims, irrigation ditches dug by
hand under the murderous eye of Khmer Rouge overseers and fields
strewn with mines from years of civil war.
	   The two guerrilla chiefs, who share blame for the deaths of up
to 2 million Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge, emerged from years
in the jungles last week and sealed a defection deal with Prime
Minister Hun Sen that included assurances they would not face
trial.
	   They told a news conference Tuesday that they were ``very
sorry'' for the reign of terror but refused to accept personal
responsibility, inviting survivors to ``let bygones be bygones.''
	   They arrived Thursday at the best hotel in Sihanoukville, where
they had rooms with a view of the Gulf of Thailand 50 meters
(yards) away across sparkling sands.
	   Reporters staked out the hotel. The pair took a room-service
lunch of crab and fish and kept their shades drawn.
	   Long Norin, a spokesman, complained that the presence of
journalists was affecting their stay and that as long as the press
remained, ``They will not leave their rooms.''
	   Khieu Samphan, 67, his hair dyed black during months on the run
in an attempt at disguise, finally appeared and was taken to meet a
local official.
	   ``Excuse me please, I would like to rest a little bit,'' Khieu
Samphan said. ``I have already said what needed to be said.''
	   A receptionist said the hotel was glad for the business, since
tourism dried up after a shipment of toxic waste was discovered in
Sihanoukville a few weeks ago.
	   ``The main thing is that they pay, so we can keep the business
running,'' the receptionist said on condition of anonymity.
	   The deal the two men are receiving from Hun Sen has shaken hopes
that the architects of their murderous rule will ever face justice.
	   The United Nations sent legal experts to Cambodia last month to
assess evidence against senior Khmer Rouge members and offer
recommendations for a tribunal, either overseas or in Cambodia.
	   ``The defection of Noun Chea and Khieu Samphan does not change
the plans,'' said Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N.'s top human rights
officer for Cambodia. ``We intend to present their recommendations
as soon as possible to the government and hope for a constructive
discussion.''
	   King Norodom Sihanouk said Wednesday he would not provide
amnesties for Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea because of ``undeniable
discontent'' among a majority of Cambodians in seeing them go free.
	   Hun Sen has since been silent, but as Cambodia's most powerful
man he can pressure the pliant courts to ensure there is no trial.
	   Hopes for prosecution now seem to rest with the United Nations,
which can pass resolutions to try Khmer Rouge leaders overseas
through an as-yet-uncreated international tribunal.
	   Sihanouk said the international community had ``the perfect
right to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia'' because it was
a crime against humanity.
	   However, Hun Sen's cooperation would be needed to arrest them.
	   ``Considering the scale and the brutality of the Khmer Rouge
crimes, genuine healing in Cambodia will be extremely difficult
without a justice process,'' Hammarberg said.
	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and forced the
population to toil in agricultural collectives. One Cambodian in
five died of overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   They were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion, but
fought a guerrilla war. In 1996, Sihanouk granted amnesty to one
leader, Ieng Sary, who led thousands of fighters to peace.
	   The Khmer Rouge has since dwindled to near-extinction. Many
dispute Hun Sen's assertion that further amnesties are needed to
prevent renewed war.

World's most prominent Nazi hunter celebrates 90th birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - Simon Wiesenthal, the world's most
prominent Nazi hunter, celebrated his 90th birthday Thursday in his
small Vienna office, surrounded by countless books, files and
testimonials of the victims of the Holocaust.
	   Born Dec. 31, 1908 in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Wiesenthal survived 12 Nazi concentration camps before American
troops freed him at the Mauthausen camp in Austria.
	   Since the war, Wiesenthal has spent the rest of his life
documenting Adolf Hitler's atrocities, hunting Nazi war criminals
and publicizing racism, often working out of his tiny Vienna office
where he spent Thursday morning at work.
	   He planned a quite celebration later in the day with his wife
Cyla, whom he married in 1936, and his daughter Pauline, who lives
in Israel.
	   Wiesenthal counts as of his most spectacular successes the 1960
capture of another Austrian, Adolf Eichmann, who was living
incognito in Argentina. Eichmann was abducted by Israeli agents and
returned to Israel, where he was tried and executed.
	   Wiesenthal was also instrumental in the 1963 arrest of Vienna
policeman Karl Silberbauer, who was responsible for the arrest in
Amsterdam of Anne Frank, the 14-year-old Jewish girl who wrote
``Anne Frank's Diary'' before her death in a German concentration
camp.

Seven candidates compete for World Cup 2006
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany, England, Brazil, South
Africa, Morocco, Egypt and Ghana are the official candidates to
host the 2006 World Cup finals.
	   The seven countries all notified FIFA in advance of the Thursday
night deadline of their interest in staging soccer's showcase
event, held every four years. They now have until the end of July
to submit their full bid documents.
	   FIFA's 24-member executive committee will decide in March 2000.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter has repeatedly said the soccer
authority has a responsibility to stage the tournament in Africa,
which has never hosted the finals.
	   Despite its high crime rate, South Africa is widely considered
the front-runner. It hosted the 1995 rugby union World Cup, the
1996 African Nations Cup and the 1998 athletics World Cup.
	   Morocco lost out to France for the staging of this year's
finals.
	   The case of both Germany and England has been weakened by the
fact that they are from the same continent. The 2002 finals are
being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA insists that
co-hosting will be a one-time exception.

China says missing Japanese ship found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs with fears for original crew

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China confirmed Thursday that a Japanese cargo
vessel that went missing in September after a suspected hijacking
has been found in a Chinese port, although there were fears that
hijackers had killed the ship's crew.
	   Chinese maritime authorities have impounded the 2,600-ton Tenyu
at the request of its owner, said Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
	   In announcing the ship's discovery in an east China port, Zhu
denounced piracy and robbery as ``inhuman atrocities'' and promised
China's continued cooperation in efforts to fight it.
	   ``The Chinese government has all along firmly and strongly
condemned any act of piracy and robbery,'' he said.
	   Earlier, a port official had expressed doubt that the vessel in
question was the missing Tenyu, owned by Japanese shipping company
Masumoto Kisen. The Tenyu disappeared Sept. 27 after leaving an
Indonesian port with a cargo of aluminum worth about 500 million
yen (dlrs 4.3 million).
	   Zhu said the ship was found in Zhangjiagang port in Jiangsu
province, near Shanghai, bearing a new name and a Honduran flag.
	   ``Concerted efforts'' by Chinese maritime officials determined
that the vessel ``is in fact the missing ship MD Tenyu,'' Zhu said.
``The case is under investigation.''
	   Zhu made no mention, however, of the ship's crew. South Korean
maritime police said the Tenyu had been piloted by a South Korean
skipper, Shin Young-ju, and chief engineer, Park Ha-joon, and was
manned by a crew of 12 Chinese sailors.
	   Lloyd's List, a daily shipping newspaper published in London,
said Wednesday that the crew's disappearance raised fears that
hijackers may have murdered them.
	   ``We cannot ignore the possibility that they may have been
killed,'' the newspaper quoted Pottengal Mukundan, director of the
London-based International Maritime Bureau, as saying. ``It is for
this reason we feel it is important that the Chinese authorities
conduct a full investigation before releasing the existing crew on
board.''
	   Chinese authorities are reported to have detained 16 Indonesians
found aboard the vessel.
	   In April, Chinese authorities discovered another hijacked
vessel, the Malaysian-registered Petro Ranger, on China's Hainan
Island, and detained 12 Indonesians.
	   The circumstances of that hijacking raised controversy, with
Chinese authorities saying the ship actually was involved in
smuggling while the Malaysian government contended the vessel had
been hijacked by Indonesians.

U.S. Embassy closed unexpectedly after threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. embassy spokesman suggesting threat came in
response to U.S. policy in the Middle East, Israel radio saying
bomb threat was received, security agents checking cars in embassy
parking lot. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday after receiving ``credible''
threats, an embassy spokesman said. Israeli police posted extra
security at the Mediterranean beachfront building.
	   The spokesman, Larry Schwartz, said the closure was in line with
``actions the U.S. government has taken in recent weeks in light of
the heightened general threats in the region.''
	   U.S. diplomatic missions around the world have been on
heightened alert since the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in which 224 people
were killed.
	   In the Middle East, there has been growing resentment against
the United States following the U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan
and Afghanistan _ in retaliation for the embassy bombings _ and the
U.S. air strikes against Iraq earlier this month.
	   Schwartz said a ``direct and credible'' threat against the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv was received Wednesday evening and that in
response, U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker ordered employees not to
report to work on Thursday.
	   He would not elaborate on the nature of the threat.
	   Israel radio quoted police officials as saying that an anonymous
caller told an embassy security agent on Wednesday night that the
embassy would be blown up on Thursday.
	   However, Schwartz said the embassy was not searched, an apparent
indication that the threat was of a different nature. On Thursday,
Israeli and U.S. security officials peeked into the windows of cars
in the embassy parking lot, but did not conduct thorough searches.
	   An Israeli security source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the threats were aimed at the embassy staff. Israel radio said
the life of U.S. Ambassador Walker was threatened.
	   Several Israeli border policemen were posted at the entrance to
the embassy. A sign at the door informed visitors that the embassy
was closed, but did not give an explanation.
	   ``They just told me that they would be closed until after the
New Year's holiday and that the embassy would be open Monday,''
said Shahar Yaron, a 25-year-old Tel Aviv resident who was trying
to obtain a U.S. tourist visa.
	   Schwartz said he did not know how long the embassy would be
closed.
	   The U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa have been blamed on
suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire. Bin
Laden, who is based in Afghanistan, denies the charge, but says he
supported the attacks.
	   By contrast, Islamic militants in the Palestinian areas,
particularly the Hamas group, have been careful not to utter
threats against the United States. Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin
has said his struggle is against Israel, not America.

German finance minister raises question of rate cuts again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with call for more transparency in monetary policy,
grafs 9-10; Tietmeyer calls euro a step to political integration in
Europe grafs 11-14; tightens &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Returning to a pet theme, German Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine again hinted he favors further interest
rate cuts by the European Central Bank on Thursday, just hours
before the launch of the euro.
	   In an article published in Germany's business daily
Handelsblatt, Lafontaine said interest rate cuts in early December
in the 11 countries joining the euro were ``a right step.''
	   The coordinated cuts on Dec. 3 lowered the ECB's key interest
rate to 3 percent.
	   ``With a stability-oriented financial and wage policy, the ECB
has more room for a monetary policy that supports growth and
employment,'' Lafontaine wrote. ``With price stability achieved,
this room exists.''
	   Since taking office in October, Lafontaine has stirred
controversy with repeated calls for lower rates to help Europe's
governments fight chronically high unemployment and flagging
growth.
	   Lower interest rates can spur an economy by making it cheaper to
borrow money.
	   His outspoken stance has been seen as a threat to the fledgling
ECB's independence, but Lafontaine strongly endorsed the bank's
independence in the article.
	   The ECB ``is politically independent and not subject to
directives. No one in Europe will or is allowed to question this,''
he wrote.
	   But Lafontaine also called for more transparency in the setting
of European monetary policy.
	   ``We must fully use the possibilities for transparency and
openness in monetary policy that are provided for in the EU
treaty,'' Lafontaine wrote.
	   Europe's new single currency must aide European political
integration, Germany's central bank president, Hans Tietmeyer,
reiterated in a separate article in Handelsblatt.
	   ``The euro must facilitate the political integration of
Europe,'' Tietmeyer said, noting that the currency union means
countries take on common risks, which binds them together
politically.
	   He noted that political coordination doesn't mean the
``centralization'' of politics, rather a ``clear definition of
responsibilities.''
	   ``There will certainly be enough room for independent national
political decisions in the future,'' Tietmeyer said.

EU announces rates for currencies entering the euro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission, the 20-member
executive body of the European Union, agreed Thursday on the
irreversible rates at which the currencies of 11 EU nations will be
locked to form a new single currency.
	   Finance ministers from the 11 nations were to given a final
stamp of approval to the rates later Thursday.
	   Under the Commission's recommendation, the new common currency
would be worth 1.95583 German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27
Italian lire, 166.386 Spanish pesetas.
	   Those rates mean the euro would start trading at about dlrs
1.1665 when markets open Monday after the long New Year's weekend.
	   Four EU members are not participating in the single currency.

Nearly 3,000 Hutus flee eastern Congo, U.N. says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Nearly 3,000 Hutus have fled to Uganda
from rebel-held eastern Congo in the past two weeks, U.N. officials
said Thursday.
	   The refugees fled Congo through the Ugandan town of Kisoro, 480
km (220 miles) west of the capital, Kampala, said Nino Timoko, a
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   The uprooted Hutus were being transported to a refugee camp in
Hoima, 140 km (53 miles) west of Kampala.
	   A rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese
soldiers and opposition politicians has taken over nearly all of
eastern Congo since launching their bid Aug. 2 to oust Congolese
President Laurent Kabila.
	   Timoko did not describe the circumstances that forced the Hutus
to flee, citing only ``general insecurity in their villages.''
	   An independent Ugandan newspaper, the Monitor, reported Thursday
that the refugees had fled the eastern towns of Rushuru and Goma,
the insurgents' headquarters.
	   It was not immediately known whether those arriving Uganda were
indigenous Congolese or remnants of the hundreds of thousands of
Rwandan Hutus who fled to the former Zaire in 1994 to escape
reprisals after extremist Hutus carried out the genocide of at
least 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the Tutsi-backed rebel
force that helped bring him to power last year have been accused of
targeting Rwandan Hutus to avenge the massacres.

Taiwan legislator vows speedy export of mercury-tainted waste
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A Taiwanese legislator promised
Thursday that 3,000 tons of mercury-laced waste from his country
that caused a deadly scandal in Cambodia would be removed as soon
as possible.
	   A team of experts sent by the plastics company that shipped the
waste arrived to verify previous tests that the material _ believed
to be compressed industrial ash _ is highly toxic.
	   The waste from Formosa Plastics Corp. was quietly shipped into
Cambodia and dumped near a small village 10 kilometers (6 miles)
away from the seaport town of Sihanoukville.
	   Discovery of the waste sparked outrage that escalated into riots
and panic when a dock worker mysteriously died after cleaning the
hold of the ship that transported the waste.
	   Four more people died in traffic accidents as residents of the
town fled in terror.
	   Allen Tseng, a Taiwanese legislator who has joined the
delegation because of his close contacts with the Cambodian
government, said at the Phnom Penh airport that Taiwan is committed
to ending the scandal.
	   ``We will work quickly to transfer all the mercury waste out of
the country,'' Tseng said.
	   Taiwan's government ordered Formosa Plastics to take back the
waste after tests by a Taiwanese environmental group showed it
contained mercury levels slightly above the country's safety
standards of 0.2 parts per million.
	   Two separate analyses of the waste have determined it could be
highly toxic.
	   An initial test commissioned by Cambodia's Environment Ministry
registered a mercury level of 675 parts per million, and five tests
conducted by Japan's Minamata Institute have showed levels ranging
from 97 to 3,984 parts per million.
	   Formosa Plastics and the Taiwanese Environmental Protection
agents will travel to the dump site Friday and take their own
samples.
	   Environment Minister Mok Mareth reiterated Thursday that the
Cambodian government would seek compensation for the deaths and
suspected environmental damage.
	   Mok Mareth added that the World health Organization and private
consultants will determine the amount of damage done.
	   Formosa Plastics representatives declined comment at the
airport, but delegation member Jacky Ko said the company has
expressed intent to pay some compensation.
	   Ko also said that Formosa Plastics has plans to send the waste
to either the United States or Europe to have it retreated.
	   Mok Mareth said efforts by Cambodian soldiers to pack the waste
into plastic-lined oil drums proceeded too slowly, so the
government brought in bulldozers this week to shovel the waste
directly into 50 shipping containers.
	   The cleanup operation is expected to be completed within a week.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   LUANDA, Angola _ The United Nations has started evacuating its
staff from Huambo, Angola's second largest city, after a rebel
artillery barrage that killed at least eight people and wounded at
least 20 civilians. A diplomat, speaking Thursday on condition of
anonymity, declined to say how many U.N. staff were in the central
highland city where fighting between the army and UNITA rebels has
escalated in recent days. The International Red Cross said 20
wounded civilians were admitted to the Huambo hospital after
Wednesday's hour-long bombardment by UNITA's long-range artillery.
A private radio station, Luanda Antena Comercial, said 12 people
died in the barrage. Another private station, Radio Eclesia, said
eight people were killed. (ANGOLA)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel _ The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S. Embassy
in Tel Aviv on Thursday after receiving ``credible'' threats, an
embassy spokesman said. The spokesman, Larry Schwartz, would not
elaborate, but an Israeli security source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the threats were aimed at the embassy staff. Israel
radio said the life of U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker was threatened.
Schwartz said the embassy was not searched, apparently ruling out a
possible bomb threat. He said the ``direct and credible'' threat
was received Wednesday evening and that Walker decided to shut down
the embassy and informed staff not to report to work Thursday.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ There will be no letup in Baghdad's defiance of
Western-patrolled ``no-fly'' zones in northern and southern Iraq,
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in remarks published
Thursday. ``The battle against the aggression and aggressors has
not stopped. It will continue,'' Aziz said in a front-page
commentary in Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath
Party. Aziz also criticized the decision by the Arab League to put
off a meeting of foreign ministers. They had been scheduled to meet
this week on the mid-December airstrikes by the United States and
Britain against Iraq. But the session was put off until Jan. 24,
after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, at the request of Gulf
states, especially Saudi Arabia. (IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON _ The USS Enterprise battle group is set to leave the
Gulf by week's end as the Pentagon reduces its military force in
the region despite skirmishes between Iraqi air defense and U.S.
and British warplanes patrolling Iraq's no-fly zones. ``The forces
left will be adequate to do what we need to do,'' Pentagon
spokesman, Lt. Col. Pat Sivigny, said Wednesday. He noted that
another carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, remains in the region, along
with more than two dozen other ships, 200 aircraft and 20,000
troops. During a four-day bombing attack on Iraq earlier this
month, the United States had both carriers in the area _ with about
40 other ships, 350 aircraft and 29,900 troops. Two failed Iraqi
missile attacks against U.S. and British warplanes in three days
this week in Iraq's no-fly zones hasn't changed plans to withdraw
some forces, Pentagon officials said. (US-IRAQ)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Despite a conciliatory New Year's message
from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, his government allies
vowed Thursday to defend Kosovo with ``all means'' and fight
against NATO if it intervenes in the troubled Serbian province.
Milosevic on Wednesday predicted a political solution for the
Kosovo conflict would come next year. In a year-end message read on
state television, Milosevic said he expected 1999 to lead to a
``multi-ethnic Kosovo, based on the principles of equality for
all.'' But his government ally, Serbia's ultra-nationalist Vice
Premier Vojislav Seselj, said Serbia is taking continued NATO
threats of intervention in Kosovo very seriously, and ``we are
ready to defend it.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

Goodbye 1998 _ Sydney rings out the old year with a big bang

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Millions of Sydney residents bid
farewell to 1998 Thursday night by partying and watching a 2
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.2 million) fireworks
extravaganza over the harbor.
	   The Sydney Opera House was bathed in pulses of green, red or
blue light as massive fireworks burst over the harbor in the first
of two bombardments, which began at 9 p.m. (1000 GMT Thursday.)
	   Another fireworks display was set for midnight to ring in the
new year.
	   More than a million people were expected to see Sydney's night
sky light up in person, and many of the city's other 2.5 million
viewed live TV coverage of the annual festival.
	   Sydney celebrates every major holiday and event with fireworks,
but New Year's Eve is a pyrotechnic orgy, and this year's barrage
was a dress rehearsal for upcoming sky shows to mark next year's
welcome for the year 2000, and the summer Olympic Games set for
September 2000.
	   Crowds cried ``Ooooh'' and ``Aaaaah!'' as combinations of
fireworks, some formations bigger than most downtown buildings, lit
the sultry southern summer night sky under low clouds.
	   The upper parts of some fireworks were cut off by low cloud
cover.
	   In addition to the usual starburst and mortar type fireworks,
the show was punctuated by blasts that fanned out in heart or ring
shapes, sometimes with another spherical firework in the middle to
create a Saturn-like effect.
	   Some of the ringed fireworks went off simultaneously, creating a
shape like a sketch of an atom.
	   A highlight of the show was the display rigged on the Sydney
Harbor Bridge, with cascading white sparks from the roadway
resembling a fiery waterfall, and red or white mortar blasts
spewing from the girders supporting its huge arch.
	   Smoke shrouded downtown after the 20-minute display, but was
clearing quickly, to give revellers a clear view for the midnight
finale.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   ``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the
history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. ``It's the beginning of a new
era.''
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations huddled at European Union
headquarters to agree to the rates at which their currencies are
absorbed into euro. They were expected to approve proposals from
the EU's executive Commission that would set the euro at 1.95583
German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386
Spanish pesetas.
	   After solemn speeches and champagne, schoolchildren will release
thousands of blue balloons bearing the ``e'' symbol which may soon
become as familiar as the dollar sign.

Portuguese Premier fears selfishness of EU member states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said in
an interview published Thursday that resurgent national egoism
among the European Union's member states could thwart efforts to
deepen European integration after the launch of the euro.
	   Guterres was quoted as saying in the daily Publico that the
15-member EU was ``currently going through a period of some
resurgence in national egoism,''
	   This trend was ``worrying'' because it had caused ``political
hesitancy'' in forging common policies, especially in foreign
policy and security, he said.
	   Portugal is one of the 11 founder members of the euro, the new
European single currency which goes into effect Jan. 1.
	   ``The new currency .. will help to create a set of basic
conditions allowing Europe's political leaders _ if they are up to
it _ to build a serious European project,'' Guterres was quoted as
saying.
	   He said he would like to see common political institutions
governing the EU which would allow the bloc ``to play the world
role that corresponds to its economic weight.''

China's import checks raise surplus, trade tensions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH CHERIN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ New financial controls imposed by China
on its trading companies have cut the flow of imports and
threatened to worsen tensions with its major trading partners.
	   Imports have fallen so sharply that even though exports barely
grew in 1998 because of the Asian economic crisis, China's trade
surplus rose 11 percent to dlrs 45 billion, according to official
figures released Wednesday.
	   The new rules, imposed in July to protect Chinese foreign
currency reserves, make it harder for companies to get import
financing and licenses.
	   China's currency, the yuan, doesn't trade internationally, and
companies are allowed to buy foreign currency only for approved
imports. Dozens of people have been prosecuted in recent months for
using fake import papers to obtain millions of dollars in foreign
currency.
	   Chinese officials defend the new rules as a way to stop
smuggling and illegal currency trading.
	   ``The new controls will slow imports in the short term, but in
the long term they will restore the market,'' Jia Jun, an official
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, told Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   The restrictions threaten to fuel complaints by trading partners
already angered at Chinese quotas and high tariffs that block most
imports of cars and consumer goods.
	   U.S. officials have warned that the trade deficit with China _
projected at dlrs 60 billion in 1998 and dlrs 70 billion in 1999 _
was politically untenable.
	   ``These steps are definitely protectionist actions that will
cause a reaction here,'' U.S. Secretary of Commerce Richard Daley
warned at a news conference in Washington on Dec. 18.
	   For all but the biggest Chinese firms, banks have begun
demanding 100 percent payment in advance for letters of credit _
the standard guarantee for trade finance. Last year, they would
accept just 30 percent in advance, with real estate pledged as
collateral for the rest.
	   Chinese trading companies complain that even with financing,
they often cannot get import licenses. The government has banned
the former widespread practice of borrowing licenses from large
state trading companies.
	   Beijing says it is taking steps to speed up trade approvals with
a new computerized network that also is intended to catch forged
documents. The system is to take effect Friday, according to state
media.
	   And for the first time, a handful of private companies have been
allowed to apply for trading licenses in a significant step away
from the state-dominated trading system.
	   But trade officials say approval is moving slowly because of the
complexity of the application process.
	   Analysts say the biggest impact will be not on small consumer
goods such as television sets, but on bulk commodities such as
metals, crude oil, fertilizer and sugar. China wants to protect its
own commodity producers from falling world prices, they say.

At least two dead after immigrant boat sinks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with at least 10 people missing,
Yugoslav rescued, CLARIFIES one body not recovered. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ At least two people drowned and another 10
were reported missing Thursday when a wooden boat carrying illegal
immigrants sank in the Aegean, rescue officials said.
	   Nearby ships and port authority vessels managed to rescue two
Greeks, one Yugoslav and 21 Pakistani, Indian and Iraqi men who had
been on board the 17-meter (56-foot), Italian-flagged Mustang, the
merchant ministry said.
	   The boat began taking on water and sank off the island of
Nissiros, about 320 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Athens,
authorities said.
	   A St. Vincent-flagged ship, Geline Metz, recovered one body,
while another person drowned during a rescue attempt by the
Greek-flagged tourist boat Chrisoula, the ministry said.
	   The nationalities of the dead were not immediately clear, and
the second body was not recovered.
	   A helicopter and coast guard vessels searched for another 10
people reported missing. Authorities believe the Mustang had set
sail from Turkey with 33 immigrants and a three-member crew.
	   One Iraqi survivor said he saw at least five people drown, but
his account could not be independently confirmed, the ministry
said.
	   The Mustang sank at around 5:30 a.m. (0330 GMT) seven miles west
of Nissiros, located near the Turkish coast, the ministry added.
	   The people rescued were to be taken to the nearby island of Kos,
the ministry said.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants, mostly Iraqi Kurds,
attempt each year to cross from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek
islands. Many are arrested and deported, but others apply for
asylum in Greece and are taken to refugee camps while their
applications are processed.
	   Hundreds find work clandestinely in Greece or move on to Italy
to make their way to other European countries.

Creator of Barbarella dies at 68
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Jean-Claude Forest, who created the sultry sci-fi
comic strip character Barbarella and designed sets for the '60s
cult movie version starring Jane Fonda, has died, his publisher
said Thursday. He was 68.
	   ``Barbarella'' went on to inspire fashion designers, the '80s
pop group Duran Duran, who chose their name from a character in the
film, and a string of comic strip heroines leading up to today's
cyber-babe Lara Croft.
	   Forest died of a respiratory illness at a hospital outside Paris
on Wednesday morning. Funeral arrangements were pending, said Helen
Werle, spokeswoman for Editions Dargaud.
	   It was in April 1962 that Forest, after successes with the
youthful adventure comic strips ``Bicot,'' created the seductive
41st century adventuress ``to amuse myself.''
	   She first appeared that year in the gentleman's ``V Magazine''
as a futuristic barbarian, seducing androids on the planet Lythion.
	   The series, published in other languages, was censored in
France, barred from advertising or sale to minors until the early
1970s.
	   Barbarella ``was a step forward'' in the business, testing the
limits of French censorship, Guy Vidal, director of comic strips at
Dargaud, said in a telephone interview. ``There have been those who
helped unlock censorship. Forest was one of them.''
	   It wasn't until producer Dino de Laurentiis bought the film
rights to Barbarella that Barbarella gained world star status, and
helping propel Jane Fonda to silver screen fame.
	   Directed by Roger Vadim, it was released in June 1968, barely a
month after the May '68 social upheaval in France that in part
reflected the revolt against traditional French morality.
	   Forest designed most of the sets for the Franco-Italian
production, shot in Rome.
	   Film critic Leonard Maltin has described ``Barbarella'' as ``a
midnight movie favorite ... not especially funny, but watchable,
with Fonda's striptease during opening credits the principal reason
for its cult status.''
	   Fonda's shiny, form-fitting space-age outfits stirred the
imaginations of designers. Barbarella-style get-ups, created by
French fashion badboy Jean-Paul Gaultier, accented last year's film
``The Fifth Element,'' with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich.
	   Born Sept. 11, 1930, Forest sketched his first comic strip as a
19-year-old student at art school, titled ``La Fleche noire,'' or
``The Black Arrow.''
	   He began his career with ``Le vaisseau hante,'' or ``The Haunted
Ship,'' published by Elan. In 1950, he became illustrator for such
publications as ``Le livre de poche,'' ``Voila,'' ``Fiction'' and
``Les nouvelles litteraires.''
	   Forest's last Barbarella episode was published in 1981.
	   After years of censorship, the French government rehabilitated
Forest as one of its own, taking him on to represent the country's
comic strip artists abroad beginning in 1976.
	   Forest was honored in 1984 with the Grand Prize of Angouleme,
site of an annual comic strip festival. He received the 1986 prize
from another comic strip festival in Sierre, Switzerland, for his
lifetime work.
	   Forest is survived by his wife Petra, a sculptor who lives in
Paris, and a son, Julien, 28.

Lawmakers seek speedy passage of Orthodox conversions bill

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Angered by a landmark court ruling undercutting
the status of Orthodox rabbis, religious lawmakers said Thursday
they would rush a bill through parliament granting the Orthodox
establishment the sole right to perform conversions to Judaism.
	   On Wednesday, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that all
Conservative and Reform converts to Judaism must be recognized as
Jews in Israel. The ruling broke new ground by validating
conversion by non-Orthodox movements in Israel as well as abroad.
Earlier Israeli court rulings had recognized only the validity of
non-Orthodox conversions performed abroad.
	   The Reform and Conservative movements are more liberal streams
of Judaism and have been fighting for recognition in Israel where
Orthodox rabbis still control religious affairs.
	   Orthodox religious leader were outraged by the court ruling.
	   ``If the court wants to declare a war with us, we will answer
with war,'' legislator Shlomo Ben-Izry from the religious Shas
Party told Israel TV's Channel Two.
	   Legislator Hanan Porat said that in response to the court
ruling, he would accelerate passage of a bill encoding the Orthodox
monopoly on conversions into law. Porat is a member of the National
Religious Party and chairman of the Law Committee.
	   Porat said his committee would hear the legislation Monday. It
was not immediately clear whether the bill would have a majority in
the 120-member parliament. The Knesset winter session ends in
March, two months before new elections.
	   Candidates for prime minister would likely try to avoid
alienating religious lawmakers so close to an election because
their support is considered important for future coalition
building.
	   In addition to the planned legislation, the Interior Ministry
said it would appeal the court ruling to the Supreme Court.
	   In his ruling Wednesday, Jerusalem District Court Judge Vardi
Zyler said that 22 Reform and one Conservative convert must be
listed in the Israeli population registry as Jews. Of the 23
converts, 13 were converted in Israel and the others abroad.
	   Reform Jewish leader Rabbi Uri Regev warned Orthodox Jewish
politicians not to try to overturn the ruling with legislation.
	   Regev, who called the ruling ``revolutionary,'' said that Jews
belonging to the Reform and Conservative movement in the United
States _ the largest Jewish community in the world, and where those
two movements predominate _ would regard a challenge as a
``personal insult'' and might stop backing Israel.
	   He said attempts by Orthodox parties to force their version of
Judaism on all of Israel are seen by American Jews as ``slapping
Reform and Conservative Judaism in the face, questioning their
integrity, questioning their Jewish identity.''
	   American Jews have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars
to Israel and are instrumental in promoting Israel's interests
before the American government.
	   In recent years, as the Orthodox Jews gain more power in Israel,
there have been signs of alienation. American Jews have been
earmarking a larger portion of their contributions for their own
communities instead of Israel.
	   Israel's Orthodox Jewish establishment rejects the Reform and
Conservative movements because they do not follow the strict
religious laws and interpretations that govern the lives of the
Orthodox.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   ``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the
history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. ``It's the beginning of a new
era.''
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations huddled at European Union
headquarters to agree to the rates at which their currencies are
absorbed into euro. They were expected to approve proposals from
the EU's executive Commission that would set the euro at 1.95583
German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386
Spanish pesetas.
	   After solemn speeches and champagne, schoolchildren will release
thousands of blue balloons bearing the ``e'' symbol which may soon
become as familiar as the dollar sign.

Russia's inflation hits 84 percent for 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW grafs 8-11 with Primakov comments. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian inflation, which appeared under control
until a financial crisis hit last summer, reached 84 percent for
all of 1998, the government said Thursday.
	   With Russia still mired in crisis, many private economists
expect the rate for 1999 to be as high, if not higher.
	   In preparing the 1999 federal budget, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's government has forecast inflation at 30 percent, but
many analysts regard this as overly optimistic.
	   Russia suffered from hyperinflation for several years after it
moved to a market economy in 1992, but the government seemed to be
taming inflation in recent years.
	   The rate was 11 percent in 1997 and the government was expecting
single-digit inflation for 1998 until the financial crisis struck
in August.
	   Since then, the Russian currency has lost much of its value, the
government has effectively defaulted on some of its debts and the
economy has been shrinking.
	   The economy contracted about 5 percent in 1998 and Russia
remained trapped in one of the worst depressions ever experienced
by an industrialized nation.
	   Primakov warned government bureaucrats Thursday that their
salaries would not be increased until the incomes of the country's
poorest citizens began rising.
	   ``I don't think ... it would be correct to raise salaries for
ourselves without raising the salaries of the poorest citizens,''
Primakov said.
	   ``We cannot turn Russia into an economically prosperous country
in just a few months, but it's our duty to do as much as
possible,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   An estimated 42 million Russians, nearly one-third of the entire
population, is living below the official poverty line, the
government said recently.
	   Meanwhile, a Russian court has declared bankrupt what was one of
the country's largest banks, clearing the way for the first
liquidation of a major bank since the August crisis.
	   The Moscow Arbitration Court ruled this week that Tokobank was
bankrupt and that its assets should be distributed among creditors,
The Moscow Times reported.
	   The bank was once among the 20 largest in Russia, but now has
debts of 7.5 billion rubles (dlrs 363 million) and assets of just
3.4 billion rubles (dlrs 165 million), the newspaper reported.
	   Russia has some 1,500 banks, but many have been hard hit by the
financial crisis and have either closed or are providing only
limited services.
	   Government officials have said that perhaps only half of the
country's banks will survive the crisis. The government's efforts
to restructure and revive the banking system have moved slowly.

ASEAN, European Union sign memorandum on economic cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and the European Union, on Thursday signed a memorandum of
understanding on a regional economic cooperation program.
	   Under the deal, the EU will contribute dlrs 6.12 million over
five years to a program designed to promote cooperation on product
standards, said the Jakarta-based ASEAN Secretariat.
	   ASEAN is a nine-member grouping that includes Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei, Laos,
Vietnam and Myanmar.
	   ``The signing of the (memorandum) reflects the ASEAN's strong
interest in continuing its cooperation with the EU in the field of
standards, quality and conformity assessment initiated almost a
decade ago,'' said a release from the secretariat.
	   It said the program will strengthen economic cooperation between
the two regional groupings and assist ASEAN in its efforts to
liberalize its economy.
	   It added that the cooperation will also promote international
trade through compatible standards and conformity assessment
procedures. Training provided under the program will help develop a
pool of ASEAN specialists on standards and conformity assessment,
it said.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador closed the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv on Thursday after receiving ``credible''
threats, an embassy spokesman said. Israeli police posted extra
security at the Mediterranean beachfront building.
	   The spokesman, Larry Schwartz, said the closure was in line with
``actions the U.S. government has taken in recent weeks in light of
the heightened general threats in the region.''
	   U.S. diplomatic missions around the world have been on
heightened alert since the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in which 224 people were killed.
	   In the Middle East, there has been growing resentment against
the United States following the U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan
and Afghanistan _ in retaliation for the embassy bombings _ and the
U.S. air strikes against Iraq earlier this month.
	   Schwartz said a ``direct and credible'' threat against the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv was received Wednesday evening and that in
response, U.S. Ambassador Ned Walker ordered employees not to
report to work on Thursday.
	   He would not elaborate on the nature of the threat, but denied a
radio report that Walker's life had been threatened.
	   Israel radio quoted police officials as saying that an anonymous
caller told an embassy security agent on Wednesday night that the
embassy would be blown up by a bomb on Thursday.
	   Schwartz said the embassy was not searched. On Thursday, Israeli
and U.S. security officials peeked into windows of cars in the
embassy parking lot, but did not conduct thorough searches.
	   Several Israeli border policemen were posted at the entrance to
the embassy. A sign at the door informed visitors that the embassy
was closed, but did not give an explanation.
	   ``They just told me that they would be closed until after the
New Year's holiday and that the embassy would be open Monday,''
said Shahar Yaron, a 25-year-old Tel Aviv resident who was trying
to obtain a U.S. tourist visa.
	   Schwartz said he did not know how long the embassy would be
closed.
	   The U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa have been blamed on
suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire. Bin
Laden, who is based in Afghanistan, denies the charge, but says he
supported the attacks.
	   By contrast, Islamic militants in the Palestinians areas,
particularly the Hamas group, have been careful not to utter
threats against the United States. Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin
has said his struggle is against Israel, not America.

Seven candidates compete for World Cup 2006
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from England &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany, England, Brazil, South
Africa, Morocco, Egypt and Ghana are the official candidates to
host the 2006 World Cup finals.
	   The seven countries all notified FIFA in advance of the Thursday
night deadline of their intent to stage soccer's four-yearly
showcase. They now have until the end of July to submit their full
bid documents.
	   FIFA's 24-member executive committee will decide in March 2000.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter has repeatedly said the soccer
authority has a responsibility to stage the tournament in Africa,
which has never hosted the finals.
	   Morocco lost out to France for the staging of the 1998 finals.
	   Despite its high crime rate, South Africa is widely considered
the front-runner. It hosted the 1995 rugby union World Cup, the
1996 African Nations Cup and the 1998 athletics World Cup.
	   South African officials maintain they can keep crime under
control and say their infrastructure is developed enough to cope
with the demands of the tournament.
	   ``Certainly emotionally there is some support for South Africa
because their continent has never had it before,'' conceded
England's bid chief Alec McGivan on Thursday.
	   ``That is something we have to overcome.''
	   ``The question is when will an African candidate be ready to
take on what is a huge logistical exercise?'' he queried.
	   The case of both Germany and England has been weakened by the
fact that they are from the same continent. The 2002 finals are
being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA insists that
co-hosting will be a one-time exception.
	   Underlining the increasing European rivalry, McGivan said in a
radio interview that Germans were envious at the amount of support
given by the British government to England's bid.
	   He told BBC Radio 5 Live that he didn't think the bribery
scandal rocking British soccer would be ``an issue at all'' in
FIFA's choice of site.
	   Hoping to boost its standing in the eyes of FIFA, European
Champions Germany recently agreed to take part in next summer's
Confederation Cup, after World Cup winners France pulled out for
scheduling reasons.

Lawmakers seek speedy passage of Orthodox conversions bill

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Angered by a landmark court ruling undercutting
the status of Orthodox rabbis, religious lawmakers said Thursday

Milosevic's ally vows to defend Kosovo from NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported attack, edits.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Despite a conciliatory New Year's message
from the president of Yugoslavia, his government allies vowed
Thursday to defend Kosovo with ``all means'' and fight against NATO
if it intervenes in the troubled Serbian province.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday predicted a
political solution for the Kosovo conflict would come next year.
	   Milosevic, in a year-end message read on state television, said
he expected 1999 to lead to a ``multi-ethnic Kosovo, based on the
principles of equality for all.''
	   But ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said
Serbia is taking continued NATO threats of intervention in Kosovo
very seriously, and ``we are ready to defend it.''
	   He blasted NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who this week
said NATO won't tolerate violence in Kosovo and was ready to
intervene.
	   ``Warnings of Javier Solana remind me of one-time threats by
Adolf Hitler,'' Seselj told reporters. ``NATO is an aggressive
military force threatening the whole mankind.''
	   In his year-end address, Milosevic said no ethnic group would be
favored in Kosovo. ``Not the Serbs, but not the Albanians either.''
	   But he again ruled out independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, saying any efforts
to secede would ``come up against the will of the people'' of
Yugoslavia. Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, which
also consists of Montenegro.
	   In an interview with state-run Serbian Television, Milosevic's
foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, said, ``We are obliged to use
all means to oppose the rush of terrorism and separatism'' in
Kosovo.
	   Jovanovic's and Seslelj's comments heightened concerns that the
October truce between Serbian security forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's secession _ which was mediated by
American diplomats _ could collapse altogether.
	   Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo
claimed at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
	   Indicating that tensions were still simmering, the state news
agency Tanjug reported that a Serbian police patrol was attacked
northwest of Pristina late Wednesday by ethnic Albanian rebels.
There were no reported casualties.
	   Serb officials accuse the guerrillas, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, of triggering the clashes by attacking police and army units.
Jovanovic on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the KLA a
terrorist organization and crack down on their support network
abroad.
	   The KLA asserts they are only responding to attacks on them.
	   A Serb crackdown against the KLA earlier this year claimed more
than 1,000 lives and left about 300,000 people homeless. Milosevic
ended the attacks after NATO threatened airstrikes.

Russia's inflation hits 84 percent for 1998
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS two grafs with Russia's hard currency reserves at dlrs
12.3 billion. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian inflation, which appeared under control
until a financial crisis hit last summer, reached 84 percent for
all of 1998, the government said Thursday.
	   With Russia still mired in crisis, many private economists
expect the rate for 1999 to be as high, if not higher.
	   In preparing the 1999 federal budget, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's government has forecast inflation at 30 percent, but
many analysts regard this as overly optimistic.
	   Russia suffered from hyperinflation for several years after it
moved to a market economy in 1992, but the government seemed to be
taming inflation in recent years.
	   The rate was 11 percent in 1997 and the government was expecting
single-digit inflation for 1998 until the financial crisis struck
in August.
	   Since then, the Russian currency has lost much of its value, the
government has effectively defaulted on some of its debts and the
economy has been shrinking.
	   The economy contracted about 5 percent in 1998 and Russia
remained trapped in one of the worst depressions ever experienced
by an industrialized nation.
	   Primakov warned government bureaucrats Thursday that their
salaries would not be increased until the incomes of the country's
poorest citizens began rising.
	   ``I don't think ... it would be correct to raise salaries for
ourselves without raising the salaries of the poorest citizens,''
Primakov said.
	   ``We cannot turn Russia into an economically prosperous country
in just a few months, but it's our duty to do as much as
possible,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   An estimated 42 million Russians, nearly one-third of the entire
population, is living below the official poverty line, the
government said recently.
	   Meanwhile, a Russian court has declared bankrupt what was one of
the country's largest banks, clearing the way for the first
liquidation of a major bank since the August crisis.
	   The Moscow Arbitration Court ruled this week that Tokobank was
bankrupt and that its assets should be distributed among creditors,
The Moscow Times reported.
	   The bank was once among the 20 largest in Russia, but now has
debts of 7.5 billion rubles (dlrs 363 million) and assets of just
3.4 billion rubles (dlrs 165 million), the newspaper reported.
	   Russia has some 1,500 banks, but many have been hard hit by the
financial crisis and have either closed or are providing only
limited services.
	   In another development, the Central Bank said Russia's hard
currency reserves stood at dlrs 12.3 billion as of Dec. 25.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said in a television
interview Wednesday the reserves had dipped to dlrs 11 billion. But
he was apparently referring to outdated figures, a Central Bank
spokesman said Thursday.

Russia ships uranium to France for research reactors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia delivered an unspecified amount of
highly-enriched uranium to France that will be burned in two
research reactors, a news report said Thursday.
	   The shipment was the first of many uranium deliveries called for
under a 1996 technological cooperation agreement signed between
France and Russia.
	   The uranium will be used in two government research reactors,
including one in Grenoble, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing Russia's Nuclear Energy Ministry.
	   The report did not say how much uranium was delivered, or how
much France paid for it.
	   The agreement is part of an effort by the West to encourage
Russia to safely dispose of its old nuclear materials. The West
wants to keep the uranium away from states that might be trying to
develop nuclear weapons programs.
	   With the delivery, Russia will be able to raise revenues and
defray Soviet-era debts to France for energy sector equipment.

Egyptian cleric criticizes Saddam; pro-Iraq demonstration in
</HEADLINE>
Jordan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reflecting divided Arab opinions, a leading
Egyptian cleric harshly criticized Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
while Jordanian demonstrators urged lifting U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   Sheik Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, head of Sunni Islam's leading
center of religious study, Al-Azhar, accused Saddam of using his
power for ``evil and betrayal.''
	   The remark, printed Thursday in the pro-government daily
Al-Ahram, comes amid a trading of insults in the Egyptian and Iraqi
press after Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak criticized Saddam
earlier this week.
	   ``A leader like Saddam Hussein, who used his forces for evil and
betrayal in an arrogant way, should not be sweet-talked or appeased
by anyone,'' Tantawi was quoted as saying.
	   Al-Ahram said he spoke Wednesday to the Kuwaiti-Egyptian
Friendship Association. It was Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait the
divided the Arab world into pro- and anti-Iraq sides and set off
the Gulf War.
	   Tantawi also was quoted as expressing sorrow for the plight of
the Iraqi people whom he said ``have suffered and were distressed
because of the wars and injustices that afflicted them.''
	   In the Jordanian capital Amman, meanwhile, about 200 people
demonstrated near the U.S. Embassy after being prevented from
reaching the embassy itself by some 600 anti-riot police.
	   ``We want to announce that we do not want to see any American
here,'' the crowd chanted, protesting the U.S. and British
airstrikes on Iraq in mid-December.
	   The demonstrators demanded an immediate halt to U.N. Security
sanctions on Iraq _ imposed after the invasion of Kuwait _ and
shouted support for Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident blamed for
bombing attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa last August.
	   ``We are trying to express our views against the massacre of the
Iraqi people and, as you see, we are forbidden from doing so,''
said opposition figure Toujan Faisal, pointing at police blocking
the road to the embassy.
	   Jordanian officials had said earlier they would ban the protest
since Iraqi officials had planned to attend. But police made no
move to stop the protest, only kept it away from the embassy. The
crowd dispersed peacefully in under an hour.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   ``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the
history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. ``It's the beginning of a new
era.''
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations huddled at European Union
headquarters to adopt the rates at which their currencies are
absorbed into euro. They agreed the euro will be worth 1.95583
German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386
Spanish pesetas.
	   After the ministers' solemn speeches, schoolchildren released
thousands of blue balloons bearing the ``e'' symbol which may soon
become as familiar as the dollar sign.

Economy Minister: Euro referendum might come earlier than 2001
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark could hold a plebiscite to
join the European Union's common currency system within two years,
which is earlier than now expected, Economy Minister Marianne
Jelved said Thursday.
	   ``I have a feeling that it will go much faster than we think and
that we will hold a referendum far earlier than 2001,'' Jelved was
quoted as saying by the Aktuelt newspaper.
	   Social Democratic Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has hinted
Denmark likely won't put the question to a referendum until at
least 2001.
	   Jelved, of the small social-liberal Radical Party, made the
comment in the wake of recent opinion polls indicating a growing
number of Danes believe their country should join the 11 EU
countries which are launching the euro on Jan. 1
	   Denmark is one of four EU countries staying out of the monetary
union for the time being. After voters in 1992 rejected the
Maastricht treaty that established the system, Denmark won opt-out
clauses which eventually were approved by Danish voters. It would
take another national referendum for Denmark to adopt the new
currency.
	   Danish voters traditionally have been lukewarm supporters of the
EU. Although many politicians support the unified currency, they
have been wary about bringing the issue to voters again.
	   A Gallup poll in Thursday's edition of the Berlingske Tidende
daily showed 48 percent of surveyed Danes favored the single
currency, while 42 percent were opposed. The remaining 10 percent
were undecided. The survey was conducted Dec. 27-30 and based on
1,020 interviews. No margin of error was given.
	   Earlier this week, another polling institute said 54 percent
favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that.
	   In June 1994, 59 percent of surveyed Danes rejected the single
currency while 33 percent favored it.

Milosevic's ally vows to defend Kosovo from NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported attack, edits.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite a conciliatory New Year's
message from the president of Yugoslavia, his government allies
vowed Thursday to defend Kosovo with ``all means'' and fight
against NATO if it intervenes in the troubled Serbian province.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday predicted a
political solution for the Kosovo conflict would come next year.
	   Milosevic, in a year-end message read on state television, said
he expected 1999 to lead to a ``multi-ethnic Kosovo, based on the
principles of equality for all.''
	   But ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said
Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, is taking continued
NATO threats of intervention in Kosovo very seriously, and ``we are
ready to defend it.''
	   He blasted NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who this week
said NATO won't tolerate violence in Kosovo and was ready to
intervene.
	   ``Warnings of Javier Solana remind me of one-time threats by
Adolf Hitler,'' Seselj told reporters. ``NATO is an aggressive
military force threatening the whole mankind.''
	   In his year-end address, Milosevic said no ethnic group would be
favored in Kosovo. ``Not the Serbs, but not the Albanians either.''
	   He again ruled out independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, saying any efforts
to secede would ``come up against the will of the people'' of
Yugoslavia.
	   In an interview with state-run Serbian Television, Milosevic's
foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, said, ``We are obliged to use
all means to oppose the rush of terrorism and separatism'' in
Kosovo.
	   Jovanovic's and Seslelj's comments heightened concerns that the
October truce between Serbian security forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas fighting for Kosovo's secession could collapse
altogether.
	   Four days of fierce fighting last week in northern Kosovo
claimed at least 15 lives and sent thousands fleeing.
	   Indicating that tensions were still simmering, the state news
agency Tanjug reported that a Serbian police patrol was attacked
northwest of Pristina late Wednesday by ethnic Albanian rebels.
There were no reported casualties.
	   Serb officials accuse the guerrillas, the Kosovo Liberation
Army, of triggering the clashes by attacking police and army units.
Jovanovic on Tuesday urged the United Nations to declare the KLA a
terrorist organization and crack down on their support network
abroad.
	   The KLA asserts they are only responding to attacks on them.
	   A Serb crackdown against the earlier this year claimed more than
1,000 lives and left about 300,000 people homeless. Milosevic ended
the attacks after NATO threatened airstrikes.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on
Thursday assured citizens of the recession-hit Southeast Asian
nation that his government will work hard in the new year to fight
corruption and promote reform.
	   ``We will continue with efforts to create a clean, respectable
and capable government which is free from corruption, collusion and
nepotism,'' Habibie said in a year-end speech.
	   He also expressed hope for an improvement in areas such as human
rights.
	   Habibie came to power in May after his one-time mentor,
ex-President Suharto, resigned amid widespread protests against his
32-year authoritarian rule.
	   In a speech broadcasted nationwide by all radio and television
stations, the new Indonesian president reiterated a pledge to bring
about widescale political and economic reform.
	   Habibie said a Parliamentary election scheduled for June 7 would
usher in a new era of democratic rule.
	   ``There is no intention from the government to maintain
political status-quo because all will be decided by the democracy
mechanism in accordance with the principles of people's sovereignty
adopted by the 1945 constitution.''
	   He called on Indonesians to remain optimistic about their
country's prospects in 1999 despite recent economic and social
turmoil.

Cup hero Talbot aims to be giantkiller

	   LONDON (AP) _ Rushden and Diamonds don't make jewelry.
	   Yet, if the non-league club manages to beat mighty Leeds United
in the FA Cup on Saturday, English soccer will have found some new
gems.
	   Such is the magic of the 127-year-old, knock-out competition,
that Rushden has the chance to upset one of the strongest teams in
the land at its 6,500-capacity stadium at the little town of
Irthlingborough in central England.
	   With 64 teams left in the competition, some of the 20
powerhouses of the Premier League do battle with the minnows in the
third round this weekend.
	   And while Manchester United and Middlesbrough meet in front of
55,000 fans at Old Trafford in a high-powered all Premier League
confrontation on Sunday, there will be just as much passion at Nene
Park. That's where Leeds, fifth in the top flight, visits Brian
Talbot's Rushden and Diamonds of the Vauxhall Conference.
	   Brian Talbot. Remember him?
	   A former England international, he made FA Cup history by
becoming the first man this century to play for two different
winning teams in successive years with Ipswich in 1978 and Arsenal
in '79.
	   Now he coaches Rushden and Diamonds and stresses that his main
task is to get the team promoted into the main Football League.
	   ``But this game with Leeds is a lovely distraction,'' said
Talbot, who played alongside Leeds manager David O'Leary in
Arsenal's 1979 FA Cup winning lineup. ``It doesn't get much more
enjoyable or exciting than this.''
	   Other highlights of the third round are two intriguing matchups
of the Premier League and Division Two.
	   Defending champion Arsenal has a tricky away game at high-riding
Preston on Monday. Kevin Keegan's Fulham, riding high atop division
two, visits one of his former clubs, Southampton, on Saturday.
	   Tottenham hosts division one Watford, now run by former England
manager Graham Taylor, and Terry Venables' Crystal Palace goes to
Ruud Gullit's Newcastle.
	   Aston Villa, top of the Premier League, hosts Hull City, which
is last in division three and likely to stay there.
	   In another meeting of Premier League teams, Blackburn, unbeaten
in five games under new manager Brian Kidd, hosts Charlton, which
has lost its last seven.
	   Like Leeds, some of the big names have to travel to grounds they
haven't visited for a while.
	   Chelsea, second in the Premier League and also the European Cup
Winners Cup holder, should have too much firepower for division two
Oldham. Liverpool should easily advance past Port Vale of division
one despite having to go to Vale Park.
	   Derby County goes to struggling division two Plymouth and
Everton visits Bristol City of division one while the remaining
Premier League clubs have home games.
	   Nottingham Forest welcomes Portsmouth, Sheffield Wednesday
receives another division one club, Norwich, and Leicester hosts a
Birmingham team which has scored 11 goals in its last two league
games on the road.
	   Manchester City, a Premier League club three seasons ago and now
playing division two soccer for the first time in its history, has
a tough game at Wimbledon.
	   Coventry hosts division two Macclesfield, and West Ham welcomes
division three Swansea.
	   In Scotland, Glasgow rivals Rangers and Celtic meet for the
third time this season, this time at Ibrox on Sunday.
	   Rangers hold a six-point lead over second-place Kilmarnock, with
defending titlist Celtic 10 points behind in third.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union
becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   ``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the
history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. ``It's the beginning of a new
era.''
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations huddled at European Union
headquarters to adopt the rates at which their currencies are
absorbed into euro. They agreed the euro will be worth 1.95583
German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386
Spanish pesetas.
	   After the ministers' solemn speeches, schoolchildren released
thousands of blue balloons bearing the ``e'' symbol which may soon
become as familiar as the dollar sign.

Chinese President calls for Taiwan talks, more aid for Asia in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday urged
the international community to help prevent a global recession in
1999 by increasing aid to Asian economies battered by a regionwide
crisis.
	   In a New Year's Eve address, the Chinese leader also issued an
appeal to Taiwan for negotiations with Beijing.
	   Jiang, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and red tie, was upbeat
in summing up 1998, saying China victoriously battled devastating
floods and achieved high economic growth despite the financial
turmoil affecting other Asian nations.
	   ``The Chinese people are marching to the future with increased
confidence,'' Jiang said.
	   Absent from the address, carried on nationwide television and
radio, were the strident remarks against democracy campaigners
which punctuated other speeches Jiang has given in the past two
weeks.
	   In those speeches, which coincided with a sharp crackdown on
dissidents, Jiang vowed to crush any attempt to unseat the ruling
Communist Party and said China would never copy Western-style
democracy.
	   But Jiang did express ``deep concern'' in his address about the
``spread and increasing severity'' of the Asian economic crisis.
	   ``The international community should strengthen cooperation to
overcome the affects of this economic crisis and prevent a global
economic recession,'' he said.
	   He called for reform and improvements of the global financial
system and said the international community ``should
enthusiastically help countries badly affected by this crisis out
of their difficulties.''
	   Unlike many other Asian countries, China has not devalued its
currency, the yuan, amid the regional financial crisis. Despite the
harm that did to Chinese exports, the government said Wednesday
that the economy grew by 7.8 percent in 1998, helped by massive
public spending.
	   ``In a situation where a few countries' economies went down a
lot, China's economy was able to grow at quite a fast rate,'' Jiang
noted in his address.
	   He also had words of praise for Hong Kong, saying the territory
that China got back from Britain in 1997 had also managed to remain
stable and prosperous. He predicted that the former colony's future
remained bright.
	   Jiang said China would work to ensure that the return of
Portuguese-ruled Macau to Chinese rule next December also would be
smooth.
	   In the next breath, Jiang addressed another major territorial
issue which confronts the Chinese leadership: Taiwan.
	   ``Taiwan has been Chinese soil since ancient times,'' he said,
adding that Beijing's determination to see the island reunited
peacefully with the mainland remains ``firm and unshakeable.''
	   ``We sincerely hope that Taiwan authorities will comply with the
wishes of the people, squarely face reality and have dialogue and
negotiations with us,'' he said.
	   Taiwan's Nationalists have ruled the island separately from the
mainland since they fled there in 1949 after losing a civil war to
the Chinese Communists.
	   In foreign policy, Jiang said China strengthened its relations
with its neighbors in 1998 and ``achieved new progress'' in
relations with the United States, Japan, Europe and Russia.
	   Turning to domestic issues, Jiang promised stepped up measures
in 1999 to boost domestic demand, increase exports, and overcome
the affects of the Asian economic crisis. He also promised more
help to poor areas of China and to the millions of workers laid off
from moribund state enterprises.

German finance minister raises question of rate cuts again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lafontaine compares euro bloc with United States,
grafs 11-12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _Returning to a pet theme, German Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine again hinted he favors further interest
rate cuts by the European Central Bank on Thursday, just hours
before the launch of the euro.
	   In an article published in Germany's business daily
Handelsblatt, Lafontaine said interest rate cuts in early December
in the 11 countries joining the euro were ``a right step.''
	   The coordinated cuts on Dec. 3 lowered the ECB's key interest
rate to 3 percent.
	   ``With a stability-oriented financial and wage policy, the ECB
has more room for a monetary policy that supports growth and
employment,'' Lafontaine wrote. ``With price stability achieved,
this room exists.''
	   Since taking office in October, Lafontaine has stirred
controversy with repeated calls for lower rates to help Europe's
governments fight chronically high unemployment and flagging
growth.
	   Lower interest rates can spur an economy by making it cheaper to
borrow money.
	   His outspoken stance has been seen as a threat to the fledgling
ECB's independence, but Lafontaine strongly endorsed the bank's
independence in the article.
	   The ECB ``is politically independent and not subject to
directives. No one in Europe will or is allowed to question this,''
he wrote.
	   But Lafontaine also called for more transparency in the setting
of European monetary policy.
	   ``We must fully use the possibilities for transparency and
openness in monetary policy that are provided for in the EU
treaty,'' Lafontaine wrote.
	   In a separate statement to mark the official fixing of the euro
rates by finance ministers in Brussels Thursday, Lafontaine
declared Europe had begun a new era, with a currency bloc that
rivalled that of the United States.
	   ``A currency area is being established that is comparable to
that of the United States in size and economic strength,'' he said,
adding Europe should use its new clout to tackle unemployment and
foster growth.
	   The euro must aide European political integration, Germany's
central bank president, Hans Tietmeyer, reiterated in a separate
article in Handelsblatt.
	   ``The euro must facilitate the political integration of
Europe,'' Tietmeyer said, noting that the currency union means
countries take on common risks, which binds them together
politically.
	   He noted that political coordination doesn't mean the
``centralization'' of politics, rather a ``clear definition of
responsibilities.''
	   ``There will certainly be enough room for independent national
political decisions in the future,'' Tietmeyer said.

Bosnian Serb president names new premier-designate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In an effort to end a
political deadlock, the Bosnian Serb president Thursday named a
moderate as the new premier-designate, after a previous hardline
candidate failed to win parliamentary approval.
	   Brane Miljus is a member of the Party of Independent Social
Democrats, a pro-Western party run by current Bosnian Serb Premier
Milorad Dodik. The decision to select Miljus is likely to be
welcomed by international officials in Bosnia, who have sought to
maintain a moderate government in the Serb-controlled half of
Bosnia.
	   Miljus' appointment still must be approved by parliament. No
date for the vote has been set.
	   The announcement by President Nikola Poplasen followed months of
political dispute between Bosnian Serb moderates and hard-liners
over the premier's post. Neither of the two bitterly opposed camps
gained a majority in parliament following September general
elections.
	   Poplasen, a hard-liner, first named Dragan Kalinic premier, but
Kalinic failed to win parliamentary approval. Kalinic is a close
aide to Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb wartime leader indicted
by the international war crimes tribunal.
	   Moderates insisted that Dodik remain premier, which the
hard-liners refused. Miljus's selection is seen as a compromise.
	   The hardline Serb Democratic Party, formerly run by Karadzic,
has announced its support of Miljus. The moderate coalition, headed
by Dodik and former Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, has yet
to comment on the selection.
	   International officials have threatened to cut financial aid to
Bosnian Serbs if a hard-liner becomes premier.
	   Miljus, from the disputed town of Brcko, pledged in a statement
Thursday to maintain close ties with the international community
and honor the US-brokered Dayton peace agreements for Bosnia,
signed in 1995.
	   The peace accords, which ended more than three years of
fighting, divided Bosnia roughly in two, with Serbs controlling one
half and the Muslim-Croat controlling the other. The country has
joint central institutions.

	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ When the shooting started, Margaret
Whitehouse dropped to her knees to try to help a fellow hostage who
was wounded.
	   One of the Islamic militants who had taken her and 15 other
foreign tourists captive tried to use her as a shield, but she
resisted, kneeling beside Australian hostage Andrew Colin Thirsk,
who later died.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg,'' Laurence Whitehouse
said of his wife. ``I tried to move her, but another kidnapper
clung on to me and kept the machine gun dug into my neck. Then I
saw a bullet hit Margaret in the head. She was dead the instant it
hit her. She never stood a chance.
	   ``They wouldn't let me go to her and she just lay there,
bleeding in the dirt,'' he told Britain's Press Association.
	   Whitehouse and the other survivors of the bloody rescue
operation, which left four of the hostages dead, were trying to
cope with the tragedy Thursday, collecting luggage scattered in the
abduction and recovering at an Aden hotel.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' a tearful Whitehouse, a 54-year-old
schoolteacher from Hampshire, England, said in the hotel elevator
as a porter carried his and his wife's luggage to his room.
	   Another freed hostage, David Holmes of Britain, was visibly
tense.
	   ``No passports, no cameras, no money, nothing,'' he said in the
hotel lobby, complaining that the recovered luggage was missing
some items the kidnappers stole before they retreated under army
fire.
	   In the capital San`a, Yemen defended itself Thursday against
accusations that its troops opened fire on the kidnappers first,
setting off the gun battle the led to the deaths.
	   Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab said the kidnappers,
during the negotiations, gave authorities one hour to meet their
demands and then threatened to start killing the hostages.
	   He said troops were alerted that the killing had begun by a
Yemeni driver who was held with the hostages but escaped.
	   ``They threatened to kill the hostages if their demands were not
met within one hour. They said they would decapitate them,'' he
said in a new conference.
	   He said the group to which the kidnappers belonged, Islamic
Jihad, was planning to bomb the British Consulate in Aden, a camp
of American military experts, Aden International Airport, the
offices of the United Nations, churches and hotels.
	   ``The troops heard gunfire and intervened swiftly to save the
hostages and in 35 minutes, the area was secured,'' he told
reporters.
	   Some of the former hostages have disputed the Yemeni
government's claim that security forces opened fire after the
kidnappers had already started killing the hostages.
	   Yemeni officials said their forces killed three of the
kidnappers and captured three others.
	   They said the kidnappers had seized the hostages to demand the
release of two Islamic Jihad leaders and to protest the recent U.S.
and British airstrikes on Iraq. The leaders had been seized in a
crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   In Aden's Al-Jamhuriya Hospital, the bodies of the four slain
hostages were examined by a U.S. Embassy doctor Wednesday night.
They were being prepared to be transported out of the country.
	   Yemeni security officers arrived at the hotel Thursday to
interview the former hostages before they were to leave Aden for
the capital, San`a, later in the day. The survivors were expected
to fly home Friday.
	   Two wounded hostages _ an American woman, who was not
identified, with a wound to the pelvis, and a British woman who was
shot in the shoulder _ remained in the Aden hospital. Hospital
officials and British diplomats said the two did not want to be
interviewed.
	   British diplomat David Pearce said Wednesday that the wounded
Briton, Claire Marston, is ``in a very bad way.'' She was told that
her husband, Peter Rowe, was among those killed.
	   The British Foreign Office has confirmed three Britons were
slain _ Ruth Williamson, 34, Mrs. Whitehouse, and Rowe, a
60-year-old math lecturer from Durham University. The fourth person
killed was Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   One of the survivors, 55-year-old Eric Firkins of Croydon,
England, said Wednesday that the abductors, armed with assault
rifles and grenade launchers, were leading the hostages to a
mountain hideout. ``Then we heard the gunfire,'' he said.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said another hostage, Brian
Smith, a 52-year-old postal worker from Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest, with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   The former hostages said they were forced to stand with their
hands in the air to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered
back, two of them were shot dead by their captors as revenge, they
said.
	   Smith and Firkins were interviewed at the hotel in Aden, about a
three-hour drive from the town of Mawdiyah where the hostages were
held after being seized Monday.
	   Firkins, a chemistry professor, said the kidnappers divided the
hostages _ 12 Britons, two Americans and two Australians _ into
groups of 11 and five. He and Smith were in the larger group and
didn't know how the others came under attack.
	   Holmes, among the group of five hostages, also said the hostages
were used as human shields by the kidnappers.
	   ``We were standing in front of the army during the battle,'' he
said today.
	   He said kidnappers retreating under army fire tried to execute
hostages, but ``we tackled them.'' He could not tell how the two
hostages in his group were killed.
	   ``How can a gun differentiate?'' he asked.
	   This was the first time Islamic militants had abducted
foreigners, and the Yemeni government said militants had ``purely
political motives'' and called them ``terrorists.''
	   Tribesmen have kidnapped scores of foreigners in the past to win
economic concessions from the government, but have usually freed
them safely. Four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7
were set free unharmed on Wednesday.
	   Germany Embassy officials said the freed hostages arrived in
San`a early today and were sleeping at the embassy. They were
scheduled to depart for Germany on Friday, said the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

Deputy prime minister pushes for early ratification of START II
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A senior Cabinet member called on the Russian
parliament Thursday to quickly ratify the START II arms reduction
treaty with the United States.
	   ``START II is no less advantageous to Russia than it is to the
United States,'' First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said
through his spokesman.
	   He called on the Communist-dominated parliament's lower house,
the State Duma, to consider ratification of the treaty in late
January or early February, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russia and the United States signed START II in 1993, and the
U.S. Senate approved it in 1996. The Duma has delayed ratification,
claiming the treaty will damage Russia's security.
	   Some members of parliament insist that Russia should maintain
its current nuclear arsenal despite its huge cost, which is well
beyond the means of the cash-strapped government.
	   Lawmakers appeared ready to approve the treaty earlier this
month, but again put off ratification to protest U.S. and British
air strikes against Iraq.
	   On Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin pledged in a telephone
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton to push for START II
ratification.
	   Russia's top military brass has also supported the treaty,
saying that by 2007 _ the START II deadline for halving Russian and
U.S. arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each _ Russia's aging heavy
missiles will have to be decommissioned anyway.
	   Maslyukov said ratification of START II would clear the way for
START III, which would further cut U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals to 2,000-2,500 warheads each.

Egyptian cleric criticizes Saddam; pro-Iraq demonstration in
</HEADLINE>
Jordan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Reflecting divided Arab opinions, a leading
Egyptian cleric harshly criticized Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
while Jordanian demonstrators urged lifting U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   Sheik Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, head of Sunni Islam's leading
center of religious study, Al-Azhar, accused Saddam of using his
power for ``evil and betrayal.''
	   The remark, printed Thursday in the pro-government daily
Al-Ahram, comes amid a trading of insults in the Egyptian and Iraqi
press after Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak criticized Saddam
earlier this week.
	   ``A leader like Saddam Hussein, who used his forces for evil and
betrayal in an arrogant way, should not be sweet-talked or appeased
by anyone,'' Tantawi was quoted as saying.
	   Al-Ahram said he spoke Wednesday to the Kuwaiti-Egyptian
Friendship Association. It was Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait the
divided the Arab world into pro- and anti-Iraq sides and set off
the Gulf War.
	   Tantawi also was quoted as expressing sorrow for the plight of
the Iraqi people whom he said ``have suffered and were distressed
because of the wars and injustices that afflicted them.''
	   In the Jordanian capital Amman, meanwhile, about 200 people
demonstrated near the U.S. Embassy after being prevented from
reaching the embassy itself by some 600 anti-riot police.
	   ``We want to announce that we do not want to see any American
here,'' the crowd chanted, protesting the U.S. and British
airstrikes on Iraq in mid-December.
	   The demonstrators demanded an immediate halt to U.N. Security
Council sanctions on Iraq _ imposed after the invasion of Kuwait _
and shouted support for Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident blamed
for bombing attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa last August.
	   ``We are trying to express our views against the massacre of the
Iraqi people and, as you see, we are forbidden from doing so,''
said opposition figure Toujan Faisal, pointing at police blocking
the road to the embassy.
	   Jordanian officials had said earlier they would ban the protest
since Iraqi officials had planned to attend. But police made no
move to stop the protest, only keeping it away from the embassy.
The crowd dispersed peacefully in under an hour.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Nearly 3,000 Hutus have fled to Uganda
from rebel-held eastern Congo in the past two weeks, U.N. officials
said Thursday.
	   The refugees fled Congo through the Ugandan town of Kisoro, 480
kilometers (220 miles) west of the capital, Kampala, said Nino
Timoko, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   The uprooted Hutus were being transported to a refugee camp in
Hoima, 140 km (53 miles) west of Kampala.
	   A rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese
soldiers and opposition politicians has taken over nearly all of
eastern Congo since launching their bid Aug. 2 to oust Congolese
President Laurent Kabila.
	   Timoko did not describe the circumstances that forced the Hutus
to flee, citing only ``general insecurity in their villages.''
	   An independent Ugandan newspaper, the Monitor, reported Thursday
that the refugees had fled the eastern towns of Rushuru and Goma,
the insurgents' headquarters.
	   It was not immediately known whether those arriving Uganda were
indigenous Congolese or remnants of the hundreds of thousands of
Rwandan Hutus who fled to the former Zaire in 1994 to escape
reprisals after extremist Hutus carried out the genocide of at
least 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the Tutsi-backed rebel
force that helped bring him to power last year have been accused of
targeting Rwandan Hutus to avenge the massacres.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Two South Africans on Friday
are to embark on a yearlong bicycle tour of the world to raise
money for AIDS projects that benefit children and a hospital HIV
clinic.
	   Stephen Bonaconsa, 28, and Travis Gale, 17, plan to depart from
Bedfordview, a suburb of Johannesburg, on Friday and return to
Durban on Dec. 31, 1999 for millennium celebrations.
	   The beneficiaries will be McCord Hospital and the Lily of the
Valley Children's Home that take care of abandoned HIV-positive
babies. Both organizations are located in rural KwaZulu-Natal
Province.
	   The first leg of the trip takes the pair to Cape Town, then to
Perth, Australia, by air.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ At the birth of the euro, Greece is
outside looking in.
	   Plagued by loss-making state companies and stubborn inflation,
Greece is the only member of the 15-nation bloc that wanted to be
part of the single currency but couldn't meet the fiscal standards.
Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted out for now.
	   But Premier Costas Simitis has made qualification by 2001 the
cornerstone of his socialist government's policy.
	   ``I want to repeat the government's pledge for the drachma's
cooperation in the euro zone,'' Greece's Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou said in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday during a meeting
to set parity rates with the euro.
	   Greece must meet all criteria by the end of 1999 if it is to
qualify by Jan. 1, 2001. Officials fear staying out would make the
country an economic backwater in the EU.
	   ``Participation in the euro zone will be the culmination of a
long and painful effort by the Greek people for the creation of
conditions of development, prosperity and social justice,''
Papantoniou said.
	   The Greek economy has improved dramatically over the past few
years.
	   The 1999 budget seeks to reduce the general deficit to 1.9
percent of gross domestic product from an expected 2.2 percent at
the end of this year _ well below the qualification mark of 3
percent.
	   But the Greek financial newspaper Imerisia recently quoted the
rating agency Moody's as saying Greece could fail to qualify
because of delays in important changes such as selling off state
industries, reforming labor laws and rolling back government
economic controls.
	   Greek Finance Undersecretary Nikos Christodoulakis described the
Moody's report as too cautious and didn't take into account the
declining trend in government debt.
	   Inflation also remains a major challenge. The government has
reduced prices on some consumer goods and has attempted to restrict
wage increases in an attempt to cut inflation, which stood at 4.2
percent in November.
	   EU single currency criteria set an inflation ceiling based on
the top performing countries, expected to be about 2.5 percent next
year.
	   The government's unwavering focus on austerity and reforms have
led to serious backlashes from labor groups and others _ accustomed
to the patronage and worker-friendly policies of previous Socialist
administrations.
	   Unions have fought back with strikes and anti-government rallies
that at times have crippled transportation and commerce around
Greece. Walkouts were so frequent at the state carrier Olympic
Airways earlier this year that it led Greece's foreign minister to
quip that ``no logical person'' would travel on it.
	   Opposition officials warn that joining the euro shouldn't be an
aim in itself.
	   Entering economic and monetary union ``could have very important
advantages for Greece,'' the daily Exousia quoted former
conservative government economic advisor Giorgos Alogoskoufis as
saying.
	   ``But if until then necessary, serious structural reforms have
not taken place, such as the modernization of public utilities,
extensive privatizations, the opening of markets to competition,
the country will not be able to reap the benefits,'' he added.

New governors appointed in Polish government reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In a sweeping move, Polish Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek appointed 14 new provincial governors on Thursday as
part of an administrative reform which brings the country closer to
European Union standards.
	   With effect Friday, the appointments aim at doing away with
aspects of the communist-era administration and shifting power from
the central government to local government.
	   ``You are an elite corps of engineers of a new state,'' Buzek
told the new governors.
	   In negotiations which ended Thursday morning, the ruling
center-right Solidarity and Freedom Union coalition government
approved 14 candidacies for 16 governors' posts. Buzek also
appointed two caretaker governors, to be replaced when the
coalition partners find appropriate candidates.
	   As part of the reform, the number of provinces in the country
dropped from 49 to 16, while hundreds of regional, city and town
councils were created to take over some decision-making powers on
issues such as education, roads, housing, water, environmental
protection and other services.
	   The new system creates democratic structures at the grassroots
level of government in line with standards of the European Union,
which Poland hopes to join early next century.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union became
reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably locked their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   ``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the
history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. ``It's the beginning of a new
era.''
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations huddled at European Union
headquarters to adopt the rates at which their currencies are
absorbed into euro. They agreed the euro will be worth 1.95583
German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386
Spanish pesetas.
	   ``Today's meeting is a milestone in European history,'' said
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi. ``A project once seen as
Utopian has become reality.''
	   After the ministers' solemn speeches and champagne toast,
schoolchildren released thousands of blue balloons bearing the
``e'' symbol which may soon become as familiar as the dollar sign.
	   The euro will formally come into existence at midnight on New
Year's Eve. It will be worth about dlrs 1.17, 132.8 Japanese yen
and 70 British pence.
	   As the euro-balloons floated into the gray skies above Brussels,
employees at banks, stock exchanges and other financial
institutions around Europe started a race-against-time to adapt
computer systems and convert countless financial holdings _ from
Dutch government bonds, to Italian shares and Finnish bank accounts
_ into euros before markets reopen Monday after the long holiday
weekend.
	   ``It is a major logistical effort. We have catering facilities.
We have booked hundreds of hotel rooms. We have hired mini buses,''
said Vendeline Von Bredow, euro project manager at Merrill Lynch.
	   After Thursday, the old currencies will no longer be traded in
foreign exchange markets around the world. Stocks and bonds will be
quoted in euros. The euro will increasingly be used for bank
transactions, business deals and public finances.
	   The European Central Bank will set a common interest rate of 3
percent for all 11 nations. For the first time in decades the U.S.
dollar will have a rival as the world's reference currency.
	   Euro cash will only be issued to replace the old coins and
banknotes in early 2002. Until then, the euro will only be used for
non-cash transactions.
	   Consumers will see prices marked in euros making it easier to
shop across frontiers and they'll be able to buy in euros using
checks or credit cards. But they'll still have to change money for
cross-border cash purchases.
	   Citizens will start to see euro figures alongside national
currencies on pay checks, phone bills and bank statements. On
Wednesday, winners of the French and Irish national lotteries will
have their prizes announced in euros.
	   French Riviera flower sellers, Belgian supermarkets and trendy
Viennese cafes where among businesses who jumped the gun and began
posting euro prices before the official launch.
	   In the Eurotempo store selling souvenirs in the shadow of the
EU's Brussels headquarters, there was a brisk trade in pocket
calculators programed to convert to and from euros.
	   ``It's a real success, people have been buying up dozens at a
time to offer as gifts,'' said sales assistant Isabel Fernandez.
The store's shelves also contained neckties and alarm clocks
adorned with the euro symbol, and chocolate euro coins.
	   Plans to forge a common European currency date back to the
1960s, but only after then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and late
French President Francois Mitterrand threw their weight behind the
project in the late 1980s did Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU,
take flight.
	   Supporters say euro-zone's 290 million people will give European
companies a huge, secure home market like that of their American
rivals. Exchange-rate costs and currency fluctuations within the
euro zone will disappear.
	   Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg will join the
euro, hoping their combined economic weight will give Europe a
greater voice in world affairs.
	   ``Europe should now play the role on the international stage to
which it's economic weight entitles it,'' said Dutch Finance
Minister Gerrit Zalm.
	   For some, the price to pay was too great.
	   Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of the euro because of
public anxiety that dropping the national currency means giving up
too much independence. Greece failed to meet economic conditions
for joining but hopes to be in by 2001, and Danish Finance Minister
Marianne Jelved said her country would hold a referendum on joining
before then.

French film industry sinking, yearend figures show
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French are going to the movies more than ever.
But they're choosing Hollywood blockbusters over the intimate,
human dramas in their native tongue, a French newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   According to the daily Le Figaro, attendances for French films
in 1998 were the worst for a decade, partly because of the
overwhelming success of ``Titanic,'' and also because a host of
French movies flopped.
	   ``Why French cinema is sinking,'' headlined the paper, with a
picture of a scene from ``Titanic.''
	   The newspaper quoted figures from the National Cinematogapahic
Center showing that French movies accounted for less than 30
percent of the 170 million national attendance figures.
	   James Cameron's ``Titanic'' alone grabbed 13 percent of viewers,
while Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' and Robert
Redford's ``The Horse Whisperer'' were word-of-mouth box-office
successes, the paper said.
	   Despite the huge success of three French comedies, ``Le Diner
des Cons,'' (The Dinner of Idiots) ``Les Couloirs du Temps'' (The
Halls of Time) and ``Taxi,'' the French cinema has ``run out of
steam,'' Le Figaro wrote.
	   The comedies attracted a total of 23 million viewers, the paper
said.
	   Industry officials blamed the disaster on the nation's economic
woes, not the quality of French movies.
	   They have high hopes for a feature-length version of the famed
comic book character ``Asterix,'' starring Gerard Depardieu in
France's most expensive production ever, to be released in
February.

	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ When the shooting started, Margaret
Whitehouse dropped to her knees to try to help a fellow hostage who
was wounded.
	   One of the Islamic militants who had taken her and 15 other
foreign tourists captive tried to use her as a shield, but she
resisted, kneeling beside Australian hostage Andrew Colin Thirsk,
who later died.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg,'' Laurence Whitehouse
said of his wife. ``I tried to move her, but another kidnapper
clung on to me and kept the machine gun dug into my neck. Then I
saw a bullet hit Margaret in the head. She was dead the instant it
hit her. She never stood a chance.
	   ``They wouldn't let me go to her and she just lay there,
bleeding in the dirt,'' he told Britain's Press Association.
	   Whitehouse and the other survivors of the bloody rescue
operation, which left four of the hostages dead, were trying to
cope with the tragedy Thursday, collecting luggage scattered in the
abduction and recovering at an Aden hotel.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' a tearful Whitehouse, a 54-year-old
schoolteacher from Hampshire, England, said in the hotel elevator
as a porter carried his and his wife's luggage to his room.
	   Another freed hostage, David Holmes of Britain, was visibly
tense.
	   ``No passports, no cameras, no money, nothing,'' he said in the
hotel lobby, complaining that the recovered luggage was missing
some items the kidnappers stole before they retreated under army
fire.
	   In the capital San`a, Yemen defended itself Thursday against
accusations that its troops opened fire on the kidnappers first,
setting off the gun battle the led to the deaths.
	   Yemeni officials said their forces killed three of the
kidnappers and captured three others. They said the kidnappers
belonged to Islamic Jihad, a group of 200 in south Yemen.
	   The kidnappers had seized the hostages to demand the release of
two of their jailed leaders and to protest the recent U.S. and
British airstrikes on Iraq, officials said.
	   Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab said the kidnappers,
during the negotiations, gave authorities one hour to meet their
demands and then threatened to start killing the hostages.
	   He said troops were alerted that the killing had begun by a
Yemeni driver who was held with the hostages but escaped.
	   ``They threatened to kill the hostages if their demands were not
met within one hour. They said they would decapitate them,'' he
said in a new conference.
	   He said the group to which the kidnappers belonged was planning
to bomb the British Consulate in Aden, a camp of American military
experts, Aden International Airport, the offices of the United
Nations, churches and hotels.
	   ``The troops heard gunfire and intervened swiftly to save the
hostages and in 35 minutes, the area was secured,'' he told
reporters.
	   Some of the former hostages have disputed the Yemeni
government's claim that security forces opened fire after the
kidnappers had already started killing the hostages.
	   In Aden's Al-Jamhuriya Hospital, the bodies of the four slain
hostages were examined by a U.S. Embassy doctor Wednesday night.
They were being prepared to be transported out of the country.
	   Yemeni security officers arrived at the hotel Thursday to
interview the former hostages before they were to leave Aden for
the capital, San`a, later in the day. The survivors were expected
to fly home Friday.
	   Two wounded hostages _ an unidentified American woman and Claire
Marston of Britain _ remained in the Aden hospital. Hospital
officials and British diplomats said the two did not want to be
interviewed.
	   Britain confirmed that three of its nationals were slain _ Ruth
Williamson, 34, Mrs. Whitehouse, and Rowe, a 60-year-old math
lecturer from Durham University. The fourth person killed was
Thirsk, 35, of Sydney.
	   One survivors, 55-year-old Eric Firkins of Croydon, England,
said Wednesday that the abductors, armed with assault rifles and
grenade launchers, were leading the hostages in two groups to a
mountain hideout. Yemeni soldiers approached. ``Then we heard the
gunfire,'' he said.
	   When the shooting began in earnest, the kidnappers forced their
captives to stand in front with their hands in the air, Firkins and
other hostages said.
	   As the kidnappers fled amid the shooting, they shot dead two
hostages in revenge, they said.
	   This was the first time Islamic militants in Yemen had abducted
foreigners.
	   Tribesmen have kidnapped scores of foreigners in the past to win
economic concessions from the government, but have usually freed
them safely. Four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7
were freed unharmed on Wednesday.
	   Germany Embassy officials said the freed hostages arrived in
San`a early Thursday and were sleeping at the embassy. They were
scheduled to depart for Germany on Friday, said the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ There will be no letup in Baghdad's
defiance of Western-patrolled ``no-fly'' zones in northern and
southern Iraq, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in remarks
published Thursday.
	   ``The battle against the aggression and aggressors has not
stopped. It will continue,'' Aziz said in a front-page commentary
in Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath Party.
	   Aziz also criticized the decision by the Arab League to put off
a meeting of foreign ministers.
	   They had been scheduled to meet this week on the mid-December
airstrikes by the United States and Britain against Iraq. But the
session was put off until Jan. 24, after the Muslim fasting month
of Ramadan, at the request of Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia.
	   Aziz accused Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid of
yielding to pressure from Saudi Arabia, terming it ``outrageous.''
	   ``The decision of the secretary-general lacks legitimacy ... it
also lacks fairness,'' Aziz added.
	   Iraq had hoped for Arab League backing for its demand to lift
U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors
declare Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.S.-British airstrikes came after the inspectors reported
Iraq was refusing to cooperate in the search for prohibited
weapons.
	   The no-fly zones were set up to protect Kurds in Iraq's north
and Shiite Muslims in the south who rose up against President
Saddam Hussein's government after the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's
forces quickly put down the revolts.
	   Aziz's comments came a day after the latest incident over the
no-fly zones, which came in the southern zone.
	   The Pentagon said that American jets launched missiles at an
Iraqi anti-aircraft battery after it fired on British patrol
planes.
	   Iraq said one farmer was killed and two other civilians were
wounded. It made no mention of military casualties.
	   Two days earlier, U.S. jets fired on an Iraqi post in the
northern no-fly zone. Iraq said that four soldiers were killed and
seven wounded.
	   Aziz also accused Abdel-Meguid of acting against the wishes of
the Arabs, who he said resented their leaders' muted reaction to
the bombing of Iraq. It was a reference to anti-American
demonstrations around the Arab world during the airstrikes.
	   He said Iraq's resistance to the United States and Britain would
trigger ``further interest and wrath from the Arab masses'' and
garner support for Iraq's campaign to get punishing U.N. trade
sanctions removed.
	   The newspapers also published more defiant remarks by Gen. Ali
Hassan al-Majid, commander of the southern region.
	   ``We shall continue (efforts) to liberate the skies of Iraq from
devils like (U.S. President) Clinton ... who is aided by some evil
Arabs, among them the rulers of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,'' the
official Al-Iraq newspaper quoted al-Majid as saying in telegram to
Saddam.

	   GRANADA, Spain (AP) _ With a 5-kilometer (3-mile) slosh around a
muddy army base, 90 cars, 163 motorcycles and 51 trucks roared the
21st Dakar Rally into life Thursday and began the annual gruelling
18-day trek.
	   The prologue set the order for Friday's first stage, a
520-kilometer leg from Granada southwest to the coastal town of
Algeciras.
	   Once the participants have crossed the narrow stretch of the
Mediterranean Sea separating Spain from North Africa, they are set
to begin their odyssey through Morocco, Mauritania, Mali and
Burkino Faso, before reaching Dakar, Senegal after 16 stages on
Jan. 17.
	   In the automobile category, defending champion Jean-Pierre
Fontenay and his Mitsubishi team start off as favorites.
	   The race looks more open for the motorcycles, particularly since
Frenchman Stephane Peterhansel, who won the title a record six
times, will be driving a car this year.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's transport minister, Nasser Lawzi,
said Thursday that the country plans to set up a new railway
system.
	   Lawzi said that a feasibility study for the Light Rail System
has been completed. He said it will link the capital Amman with
Zarka, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the north and Sweileh, 20
kilometers (15 miles) to the west.
	   He estimated the cost of the project at 50 million dinars (dlrs
70 million) and said it should be ready for operation early in the
year 2003.
	   If it proves popular, it could reduce road traffic by about 30
percent, he said.
	   Thirty international companies have expressed interest in
participating in the project, he said. A construction contract is
to be awarded in August 1999, Lawzi said.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 1,582.7 points at the end of the trading week, down 3.83
percent from last week, the National Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   According to the company's weekly report, portfolio managers did
not move to support end-of-year closings, as was expected.
	   Instead, it said, they decided to ``close the page on this year
with its definite losses and start the coming one with low prices
that would help achieve better profits in 1999.''
	   Some 196.95 million shares were traded in the last week of the
year, down 38.11 percent from the week before, the report said. The
value of these shares dropped 22.25 percent, to 44.08 million
dinars (dlrs 145.96 million).
	   Of the market's 78 listed companies, 68 were traded, with 14
closing higher, 50 closing lower and the rest unchanged.
	   Trading on the Kuwait Stock Exchange is restricted to Kuwaitis
and nationals of the other Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Trading levels slipped on the Baghdad Stock
Exchange following U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   But the four-day bombing campaign, which ended Dec. 19, and the
subsequent skirmishes over the ``no-fly'' zones have had little
impact on the value of the Iraqi dinar, which has stayed at about
1,850 to the dollar.
	   The market bulletin released Thursday the number of shares
traded in the three business days ending Wednesday fell more than
50 percent to 13.7 million. The value of these shares was 178.6
million Iraqi dinars (dlrs 96,540), a decline of 47 percent from
the previous week.
	   Trading is to resume Jan. 2.
 &UR; ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover rose on the Amman
stock exchange this week, a market report said Thursday.
	   Brokers attributed the rises to year-end trading and to a
sell-off from the country's second largest bank.
	   The Housing Bank sold its stake Tuesday in the Jordan Cement
Factories Company to investors from Morocco, netting ten million
dinars (dlrs 14 million).
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said that the 60-company General Share Prices
index nudged up 2.16 percent to 170.13 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks increased 2.58 percent, industrial
firms 0.82 percent, services sector 2.69 percent, and insurance
sector 1.03 percent.
	   Turnover soared 362 percent to 23.1 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 32.5 million), the report said.
	   It said stocks of 105 firms were traded during the week.

Aziz: Resistance to operations in `no-fly' zones continues

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ There will be no letup in Baghdad's
defiance of Western-patrolled ``no-fly'' zones in northern and
southern Iraq, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said in remarks
published Thursday.
	   ``The battle against the aggression and aggressors has not
stopped. It will continue,'' Aziz said in a front-page commentary
in Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath Party.
	   Aziz also criticized the decision by the Arab League to put off
a meeting of foreign ministers.
	   They had been scheduled to meet this week on the mid-December
airstrikes by the United States and Britain against Iraq. But the
session was put off until Jan. 24, after the Muslim fasting month
of Ramadan, at the request of Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia.
	   Aziz accused Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid of
yielding to pressure from Saudi Arabia, terming it ``outrageous.''
	   ``The decision of the secretary-general lacks legitimacy ... it
also lacks fairness,'' Aziz added.
	   Iraq had hoped for Arab League backing for its demand to lift
U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors
declare Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.S.-British airstrikes came after the inspectors reported
Iraq was refusing to cooperate in the search for prohibited
weapons.
	   The no-fly zones were set up to protect Kurds in Iraq's north
and Shiite Muslims in the south who rose up against President
Saddam Hussein's government after the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's
forces quickly put down the revolts.
	   Aziz's comments came a day after the latest incident over the
no-fly zones, which came in the southern zone.
	   The Pentagon said that American jets launched missiles at an
Iraqi anti-aircraft battery after it fired on British patrol
planes.
	   Iraq said one farmer was killed and two other civilians were
wounded. It made no mention of military casualties.
	   Two days earlier, U.S. jets fired on an Iraqi post in the
northern no-fly zone. Iraq said that four soldiers were killed and
seven wounded.
	   Aziz also accused Abdel-Meguid of acting against the wishes of
the Arabs, who he said resented their leaders' muted reaction to
the bombing of Iraq. It was a reference to anti-American
demonstrations around the Arab world during the airstrikes.
	   He said Iraq's resistance to the United States and Britain would
trigger ``further interest and wrath from the Arab masses'' and
garner support for Iraq's campaign to get punishing U.N. trade
sanctions removed.
	   The newspapers also published more defiant remarks by Gen. Ali
Hassan al-Majid, commander of the southern region.
	   ``We shall continue (efforts) to liberate the skies of Iraq from
devils like (U.S. President) Clinton ... who is aided by some evil
Arabs, among them the rulers of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,'' the
official Al-Iraq newspaper quoted al-Majid as saying in telegram to
Saddam.

Rightwing party deplores Euro-euphoria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - While Austria joined other Europeans in
hailing the advent of the euro, the country's fast-growing
rightwing party Thursday said it would wait to see whether the
common currency actually brings stability and economic growth.
	   Peter Westenthaler, secretary-general of the Freedom Party,
criticized the ``Euro-euphoria'' of Austria's other parties, which
joined those across Europe in hailing the birth of the new
currency.
	   Westenthaler dismissed statements hailing the advent of the new
currency as simply ``reveling in exuberance for the euro.''
	   ``We will just be celebrating the New Year,'' he said.
	   Austria is among the 11 European nations which joined in
creating the common currency, which binding some of the world's
wealthiest nations in an economic giant.
	   ``The euro becomes the strong arm of the strongest economic
region of the world and through a coordinated economic policy, the
strong center of a common policy for growth and employment,''
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said. ``Today is an historic day
for Europe.''
	   The Freedom Party, led by Joerg Haider, has emerged in recent
years as Austria's third largest party, coming within a few
percentage points of overtaking the conservative People's Party as
the second strongest political force here behind the Socialists.
	   But the Freedom Party, which has campaigned on nationalist and
anti-foreign platforms, suffered a setback last year in trying to
muster opposition to the euro.

Caligiuri will return to Galaxy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Former U.S. national team defender
Paul Caligiuri will return to the Los Angeles Galaxy for the 1999
season, after being waived by the Major League Soccer team Oct. 31
for salary-cap reasons, the league has announced.
	   The 34-year old was waived by the Galaxy as it was finalizing
its roster in preparation for the Nov. 2 waiver draft.
	   He signed a new contract with the league earlier this month with
MLS. Under the MLS' ``single-entity'' structure, all players sign
contracts with the league, with the marquee players assigned to
teams and most of the rest distributed by draft or trade.
	   Terms of Caligiuri's contract were not disclosed, but a source
within in the league who asked not to be identified said it was for
a lower amount than the original three-year contract Caligiuri
signed with the league in 1996.
	   The 34-year old Caligiuri played 18 matches for the Galaxy
during an injury-plagued 1998 season, starting 14. Foot and ankle
injuries forced him to miss 11 of Los Angeles' first 15 matches,
while a strained groin kept him out of one match in August and two
in September. Caligiuri returned to start in all four of the
Galaxy's playoff matches.
	   Caligiuri was selected by the Columbus Crew in the first round
of the 1996 supplmental draft but sued the league claiming he was
promised assignment to the Galaxy. An arbitrator ruled in his
favor, forcing the league to transfer him to Los Angeles before the
1997 season.

Milosevic's ally vows to defend Kosovo from NATO

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb leaders warned Thursday they
would use ``all means'' necessary to stamp out rebellion in Kosovo
after government media reported another attack by ethnic Albanians
on police in the troubled province.
	   ``We are obliged to use all means to oppose the rush of
terrorism and separatism'' in Kosovo, Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic said in an interview with Serbian television.
	   Those sentiments were echoed by Serbia's extreme nationalist
vice premier, Vojislav Seselj. He also warned that the government
was prepared to stand up against threats by NATO to intervene
militarily in the Kosovo conflict if fighting erupts on a major
scale.
	   Seselj denounced warnings by NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana, who said this week that the Western alliance would not
tolerate violence in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main
republic Serbia.
	   ``Warnings of Javier Solana remind me of one-time threats by
Adolf Hitler,'' Seselj told reporters. He said, ``NATO is an
aggressive military force threatening the whole mankind.''
	   Those warnings were issued after the government's Tanjug news
agency reported that a Serbian police patrol was attacked northwest
of Pristina late Wednesday by ethnic Albanian rebels. There were no
reported casualties.
	   Kosovo has been generally quiet since four days of fighting,
which erupted Christmas Eve near the northern Kosovo town of
Podujevo. At least 15 people were killed before international peace
verifiers managed to negotiate an end to the fighting.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left
homeless during seven months of fighting between government forces
and the Kosovo Liberation Army. Widespread fighting was brought to
an end under an agreement signed Oct. 12 between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   Tensions, however, remain high, stoking fears that the two sides
may be gearing up for a new round of bloodshed, possibly in the
spring.
	   In his New Year's message, Milosevic predicted a political
solution for the Kosovo conflict would come next year, including a
``multi-ethnic Kosovo, based on the principles of equality for
all.''
	   But he again ruled out independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, saying any efforts
to secede would ``come up against the will of the people'' of
Yugoslavia.
	   Wide differences between the ethnic Albanians and the Serbs on
the future of the province have hampered American-led diplomatic
efforts to resolve the conflict.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's dream of monetary union became
reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably locked their
currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant
whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the
shores of the Mediterranean.
	   The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in
international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in
the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.
	   ``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the
history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio. ``It's the beginning of a new
era.''
	   On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance
ministers from the 11 nations huddled at European Union
headquarters to adopt the rates at which their currencies are
absorbed into euro. They agreed the euro will be worth 1.95583
German marks, 6.55957 French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386
Spanish pesetas.
	   ``A project once seen as Utopian has become reality,'' said
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi.
	   After the ministers' solemn speeches and champagne toast,
schoolchildren released thousands of blue balloons bearing the
``e'' symbol which may soon become as familiar as the dollar sign.
	   The euro will formally come into existence at midnight on New
Year's Eve. It will be worth about dlrs 1.17, 132.8 Japanese yen
and 70 British pence.
	   As the euro-balloons floated into the gray skies above Brussels,
employees at banks, stock exchanges and other financial
institutions around Europe started a race-against-time to adapt
computer systems and convert countless financial holdings _ from
Dutch government bonds, to Italian shares and Finnish bank accounts
_ into euros before markets reopen Monday after the long holiday
weekend.
	   ``It is a major logistical effort. We have catering facilities.
We have booked hundreds of hotel rooms. We have hired mini buses,''
said Vendeline Von Bredow, euro project manager at Merrill Lynch.
	   After Thursday, the old currencies will no longer be traded in
foreign exchange markets around the world. Stocks and bonds will be
quoted in euros. The euro will increasingly be used for bank
transactions, business deals and public finances.
	   The European Central Bank will set a common interest rate of 3
percent for all 11 nations. For the first time in decades the U.S.
dollar will have a rival as the world's reference currency.
	   Euro cash will only be issued to replace the old coins and
banknotes in early 2002. Until then, the euro will only be used for
non-cash transactions.
	   Consumers will see prices marked in euros making it easier to
shop across frontiers and they'll be able to buy in euros using
checks or credit cards. But they'll still have to change money for
cross-border cash purchases.
	   Citizens will start to see euro figures alongside national
currencies on pay checks, phone bills and bank statements. On
Wednesday, winners of the French and Irish national lotteries will
have their prizes announced in euros.
	   French Riviera flower sellers, Belgian supermarkets and trendy
Viennese cafes where among businesses who jumped the gun and began
posting euro prices before the official launch.
	   In the Eurotempo store selling souvenirs in the shadow of the
EU's Brussels headquarters, there was a brisk trade in pocket
calculators programed to convert to and from euros.
	   ``It's a real success, people have been buying up dozens at a
time to offer as gifts,'' said sales assistant Isabel Fernandez.
The store's shelves also contained neckties and alarm clocks
adorned with the euro symbol, and chocolate euro coins.
	   Plans to forge a common European currency date back to the
1960s, but only after then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and late
French President Francois Mitterrand threw their weight behind the
project in the late 1980s did Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU,
take flight.
	   Supporters say euro-zone's 290 million people will give European
companies a huge, secure home market like that of their American
rivals. Exchange-rate costs and currency fluctuations within the
euro zone will disappear.
	   Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg will join the
euro, hoping their combined economic weight will give Europe a
greater voice in world affairs.
	   ``Europe should now play the role on the international stage to
which it's economic weight entitles it,'' said Dutch Finance
Minister Gerrit Zalm.
	   For some, the price to pay was too great.
	   Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of the euro because of
public anxiety that dropping the national currency means giving up
too much independence. Greece failed to meet economic conditions
for joining but hopes to be in by 2001, and Danish Finance Minister
Marianne Jelved said her country would hold a referendum on joining
before then.

Turkish Cypriots reject calls for reduction of Turkish military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Thursday rejected calls for Turkey to reduce its military presence
on Cyprus now that the Greek Cypriots have decided not to deploy
missiles.
	   Germany, which assumes the presidency of the European Union
Friday, urged Turkey to decrease troop presence in the north of the
divided island a day after Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
called off plans to install Russian-made antiaircraft missiles.
Turkey had threatened military action to prevent their deployment.
	   ``The cancellation of the missiles has avoided a crisis,''
Turkey's Anatolia news agency quoted Denktash as saying. ``But, it
cannot be made into a bargaining issue for the reduction of Turkish
soldiers.''
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops
following a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
Some 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the northern breakaway
state, which is recognized only by Ankara.
	   Germany said a reduction of military presence by Turkey would
help build trust on Cyprus.
	   Clerides has said he would negotiate with Russian officials to
put the missiles instead on the Greek island of Crete instead, but
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem warned Wednesday that Turkey
might use force to block that proposal if it deemed them a security
threat.

Winter storms in Portugal cut off roads, close airport and ports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Snowstorms swept across areas of
northern Portugal on Thursday while high winds and driving rain
caused the closure of Faro international airport on the southern
coast.
	   Nine ports on the Atlantic coast were closed after waves reached
five meters (16.5 feet) high.
	   At Faro airport, four flights to Britain were canceled and three
incoming flights were diverted to the capital Lisbon and to
Seville, in neighboring Spain, when winds gusted at over 100
kilometers per hour (60 mph).
	   Officials said the winter storms could also disrupt air traffic
at Lisbon international airport.
	   Snowfall in the northeast cut off roads leading up to the Serra
da Estrela, Portugal's sole ski resort some 250 kilometers (155
miles) away from Lisbon, and a popular vacation destination.

Greek officials brace for rough ride in euro quest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-The Euro &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ At the birth of the euro, Greece is
outside looking in.
	   Plagued by loss-making state companies and stubborn inflation,
Greece is the only member of the 15-nation bloc that wanted to be
part of the single currency but couldn't meet the fiscal standards.
Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted out for now.
	   But Premier Costas Simitis has made qualification by 2001 the
cornerstone of his socialist government's policy.
	   ``I want to repeat the government's pledge for the drachma's
cooperation in the euro zone,'' Greece's Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou said in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday during a meeting
to set parity rates with the euro.
	   Greece must meet all criteria by the end of 1999 if it is to
qualify by Jan. 1, 2001. Officials fear staying out would make the
country an economic backwater in the EU.
	   ``Participation in the euro zone will be the culmination of a
long and painful effort by the Greek people for the creation of
conditions of development, prosperity and social justice,''
Papantoniou said.
	   The Greek economy has improved dramatically over the past few
years.
	   The 1999 budget seeks to reduce the general deficit to 1.9
percent of gross domestic product from an expected 2.2 percent at
the end of this year _ well below the qualification mark of 3
percent.
	   But the Greek financial newspaper Imerisia recently quoted the
rating agency Moody's as saying Greece could fail to qualify
because of delays in important changes such as selling off state
industries, reforming labor laws and rolling back government
economic controls.
	   Greek Finance Undersecretary Nikos Christodoulakis described the
Moody's report as too cautious and didn't take into account the
declining trend in government debt.
	   Inflation also remains a major challenge. The government has
reduced prices on some consumer goods and has attempted to restrict
wage increases in an attempt to cut inflation, which stood at 4.2
percent in November.
	   EU single currency criteria set an inflation ceiling based on
the top performing countries, expected to be about 2.5 percent next
year.
	   The government's unwavering focus on austerity and reforms have
led to serious backlashes from labor groups and others _ accustomed
to the patronage and worker-friendly policies of previous Socialist
administrations.
	   Unions have fought back with strikes and anti-government rallies
that at times have crippled transportation and commerce around
Greece. Walkouts were so frequent at the state carrier Olympic
Airways earlier this year that it led Greece's foreign minister to
quip that ``no logical person'' would travel on it.
	   Opposition officials warn that joining the euro shouldn't be an
aim in itself.
	   Entering economic and monetary union ``could have very important
advantages for Greece,'' the daily Exousia quoted former
conservative government economic advisor Giorgos Alogoskoufis as
saying.
	   ``But if until then necessary, serious structural reforms have
not taken place, such as the modernization of public utilities,
extensive privatizations, the opening of markets to competition,
the country will not be able to reap the benefits,'' he added.

 &UR; Single currency reaches beyond the founding eleven nations &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Eleven of the European Union's 15
members soldered their moneys into a single currency Thursday, but
that act of monetary union also had consequences for such diverse
places as Monaco, the Vatican and the islands of St. Pierre and
Miquelon off the coast of Canada.
	   The Vatican and the Republic of San Marino are microstates
located wholly within Italy and use the Italian lira as their
currency.
	   Monaco is a tiny principality on France's Mediterranean coast.
St. Pierre and Miquelon, minuscule islands off Newfoundland, are
part of France's far-flung territories, as is the Indian Ocean
island of Mayotte. All use the French franc as their currency.
	   Italy and France have adopted the euro, as the European Union's
new single currency is known. That leaves these various tiny
places, all non-members of the EU, without a money of their own
unless they make special arrangements to adopt the euro.
	   EU finance ministers, who fixed the exchange rates between the
euro and the national currencies of the 11 as the final step before
creating the new currency at midnight, said the tiny countries and
territories could use the single European currency under certain
conditions.
	   The ministers ruled that San Marino, the Vatican and Monaco will
be entitled to use the euro as their official currency, but they
will not be allowed to issue any banknotes or coins unless they
agreed to conditions imposed by the EU.
	   Euro notes and coins, which will be put into circulation in
2002, will feature bridges, windows and doorways in various
European styles. Euros stamped with a likeness of the pope, for
example, would be certain to arouse strong opposition among some
segments of the European population.
	   Italy was designated to begin negotiations with San Marino and
the Vatican over their use and eventual issuance of euro currency.
France was tapped to negotiate an agreement with Monaco.
	   ``Vatican City will have the right to continue issuing collector
coins and the Republic of San Marino to continue using gold coins
denominated in scudi,'' the ministers said.
	   Those three also will be required to adopt EU rules on currency
and to ``cooperate closely with the community with regard to
measures against counterfeiting of euro banknotes and coins.''
	   With regard to the two French territories, the ministers decided
that the euro would be their currency two and that France would
continue to grant legal status to their banknotes and coins.
	   France will be required to pass national legislation putting
these monetary arrangements into law.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) - The Bulgarian National Bank announced
Thursday its national currency, the lev, will be fixed at 1,955.83
to the euro.
	   Under the currency board system established in July 1997, the
domestic money supply is backed by foreign currency reserves. Since
its launch, the domestic money supply has been backed by German
marks at a rate of 1,000 to the mark.
	   With the launch of the euro on New Year's Day, the lev will
formally be backed by euros.
	   The currency board was established to help reduce inflation by
preventing the central bank from lending to the government or local
banks. Inflation is expected to fall below 9 percent in 1998, down
from 573 percent in 1997.
	   The government has said it will keep the currency board in place
until the country is in a position to adopt the euro as its own
currency. The government doesn't expect to be in a position to
begin membership negotiations with the European Union until 2001.
	   EU membership is a prerequisite for adopting the euro as a
national currency.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi expressed hope
on Thursday that the world's second-largest economy would meet a
modest government growth target next year as he reiterated a pledge
to engineer a more convincing recovery by 2000.
	   Japan has slipped into its deepest recession in decades and
unemployment has hit a postwar high. The government estimates the
economy will shrink 2.2 percent in fiscal 1998, which ends in
March.
	   Obuchi said the new fiscal year which begins in April would be
better, but stopped short of promising a full-fledged economic
recovery.
	   ``We are making every effort to achieve our target of 0.5
percent growth,'' Obuchi said in a New Year's press conference.
	   The government's official target of 0.5 percent economic growth
for fiscal 1999 is its lowest forecast since World War II.
	   The prime minister was more optimistic about 2000.
	   ``Through the efforts of our people and the policies of the
government, we will definitely see success, I am certain we will
see clearly positive growth next year,'' he said.
	   He called on Japanese people to have more faith in government
efforts to revive the ailing economy.
	   ``There is no doubt that Japan's economy will recover. I think
what is needed is for the Japanese people to have confidence in our
country _ confidence in Japan,'' he said.
	   To try to hasten recovery, Japan's Cabinet last week unveiled a
draft budget for 1999 that will double the size of the annual
deficit as it pays for efforts to kickstart the nation's moribund
economy.
	   Obuchi said bad-loan problems at the nation's banks remained
Japan's biggest problem as the new year begins, but said recent
steps to inject public funds into ailing banks would soon begin to
fix the troubles.

No. 1 Mallorca faces bottom Extremadura and pressure steams around
</HEADLINE>
crisis-ridden Barcelona &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Four points clear atop the table, euphoric
Mallorca travels to meet straggling Extremadura Sunday in the
Spanish soccer league, while FC Barcelona and Real Madrid look to
restore tarnished reputations.
	   With 15 rounds played, Mallorca owes its 29 points to an almost
impenetrable defense that has let in only six goals and permitted
maximum profit from the 16 the team has scored.
	   Meanwhile, last-placed Extremadura _ with just 12 points from
three wins, three draws and nine losses _ is under pressure to
prove it deserves first division status.
	   But while few expect great things from Extremadura, followers of
the country's soccer powerhouses FC Barcelona and Real Madrid are
demanding dramatic comebacks from disappointing starts to the
season.
	   Languishing at No. 9 in the table, Barcelona has won only one of
its last five league matches and is submerged in a major crisis
with Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal hanging onto his job despite his
unpopularity with the fans.
	   ``No one understands why, with so many great players, we are
losing matches,'' said Barcelona's Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert
Thursday in sports daily El Mundo Deportivo.
	   ``We must beat Alaves to start the year on a good footing,''
said defender Sergi Barjuan in the paper, referring to Sunday's
league match at home to the lowly division newcomer.
	   But despite Sergi's assurances that ``little by little things
are getting back to normal,'' the atmosphere clearly remains tense.
	   Earlier this week club chairman Josep Nunez blamed the players
for the season's disappointments, that included a humiliatingly
early exit from the European Champions League.
	   This charge was publicly refuted with scarcely veiled bitterness
by Brazilian star striker Rivaldo.
	   Meanwhile, the other perennial Spanish superteam Real Madrid
also plays Sunday, at home to second-to-last placed Tenerife.
	   Although Madrid is still gunning to win its eighth European
Champions League title, the club has failed to sparkle in the
domestic league and currently lies seven points behind the leader
at No.8.
	   Madrid's Dutch coach Guus Hiddink will remember that his German
predecessor German Juup Heynckes was sacked at the end of last
season for finishing at a disappointing No. 4. This despite having
lead the team to a record seventh European Champions title.
	   In other matches Sunday, No.2 Celta welcomes No. 5 Oviedo in the
round's most evenly matched game.
	   Meanwhile, fourth placed Deportivo La Coruna travels to No. 11
Zaragoza, N. 6 Atletico plays away against lower-half Racing de
Santander and Athletic Bilbao in seventh place hosts No.15
Valladolid.
	   The draw also provides two lower-half battles pitting Villarreal
against Betis, and Expanyol against Salamanca while Saturday's only
match sees third-place Valencia host third-from bottom Salamanca.

Bosnian Serb president names new premier-designate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Miljus' party rejecting his candidacy,
saying he must return mandate
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In an effort to end a
political deadlock, the Bosnian Serb president Thursday named a
moderate as the new premier-designate, after a previous hardline
candidate failed to win parliamentary approval.
	   But only hours after the candidacy of Brane Miljus was
announced, his own Party of Independent Social-Democrats rejected
the selection, saying the president made the decision without
consulting party leaders.
	   Miljus had accepted the selection by President Nikola Poplasen,
who named him in an apparent effort to find a compromise after
months of political dispute between Bosnian Serb moderates and
hard-liners over the premier's post.
	   The Social-Democrats are run by current pro-Western Premier
Milorad Dodik and are part of a wider coalition of moderate
parties. In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, the party
said Miljus must turn down the mandate or face unspecified
consequences.
	   But the selection of Miljus might be welcomed by international
officials, who have sought to maintain a moderate government in the
Serb-controlled half of the country. There was no immediate
reaction from international officials in Bosnia.
	   Miljus' appointment still must be approved by parliament. No
date for the vote has been set and it was not clear whether Miljus
could win. Neither of the two bitterly opposed camps gained a
majority in parliament following September general elections.
	   Poplasen, a hard-liner, first named Dragan Kalinic as premier,
but Kalinic failed to win parliamentary approval. Kalinic is a
close aide of Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb wartime leader
indicted by the international war crimes tribunal.
	   Moderates insisted that Dodik remain premier, which the
hard-liners refused. Miljus' selection is seen as a compromise, but
the reaction by Social-Democrats indicated it was not the result of
an agreement between the two sides.
	   The hardline Serb Democratic Party, formerly run by Karadzic,
has announced its support of Miljus.
	   International officials have threatened to cut financial aid to
Bosnian Serbs if a hard-liner becomes premier.
	   Miljus pledged in a statement Thursday to maintain close ties
with the international community and honor the US-brokered Dayton
peace agreements for Bosnia, signed in 1995.
	   The peace accords, which ended more than three years of
fighting, divided Bosnia roughly in two, with Serbs controlling one
half and the Muslim-Croat controlling the other. The country has
joint central institutions.

Yeltsin toasts the new year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Taking a day off from politics, President Boris
Yeltsin on Thursday called on Russians to meet 1999 with optimism
and pride in their country.
	   The president's taped New Year's Eve message, which is broadcast
across the nation just before midnight, was first shown in Russia's
Far East _ nine time zones ahead of Moscow.
	   ``What can I say: The year was difficult for the country, for
many of you, and for me, too. But New Year's Eve is always about
new hopes, new dreams, new plans,'' Yeltsin said, according to a
transcript released by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin voiced hopes for the most defenseless members of
society, ``so that our children will be happy and those who need
attention and care so much now should feel it.'' And he expressed
hope that Russians would always feel the ``dignity and greatness''
of their country.
	   He noted that the new millennium was just around the corner.
	   ``What kind of country enters it depends on each of us _ on our
talent and industriousness, our persistence and will, unity and
togetherness,'' Yeltsin said.
	   ``Yes, we're very different, but together, we're Russia.''

Documents show Australia considered building A-bombs in 1968
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia, which has become one of
the world's most vocal opponents of nuclear weapons proliferation,
considered building up to 30 atomic bombs a year as recently as
1968, according to government documents declassified on Friday.
	   The Cabinet papers, released by Australia's National Archives,
show the government of Prime Minister John Gorton continued to
flirt with the nuclear option even just prior to the long-awaited
United Nations debate on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
	   The Cabinet deliberations show the government supported the
principle of the treaty in halting worldwide proliferation of
nuclear weapons as long as it did not close off Australian options
to build a bomb at some stage.
	   A submission from the Defense Department, considered by Cabinet
on March 26, 1968 raises the prospect that Australia could have
placed itself squarely at odds with the United States, which
co-sponsored the treaty with the Soviet Union.
	   Refusal to sign would have raised the prospect of American
pressure and sanctions halting supply of defense equipment.
	   ``The former may not be so important. The latter could affect
our ability to develop and maintain an effective delivery system,''
it said.
	   At that time Australian had no means of delivering nuclear
weapons. But one was on the way, the new U.S. F-111 bombers ordered
in 1963 but delayed because of technical problems.
	   Australia's Defense Department said refusal to sign the treaty
would be interpreted as an intent to develop nuclear weapons no
matter what declarations of peaceful purposes were made.
	   It concluded that refusal to sign really was not a viable
option.
	   But annexes and attachments to the defense submission show the
nuclear weapon option remained very much alive.
	   A document prepared by the Department of Supply and the
Australian Atomic Energy Commission assessed what a nuclear weapons
program could involve.
	   ``For a capital outlay of 100 million dollars Australia could
equip itself with the capability to produce annually sufficient
plutonium for 30 nominal 20 kiloton weapons at a cost of 13 million
dollars per year,'' it said.
	   It put total bomb development costs at some dlrs 144 million,
but without consideration of a delivery system.
	   The Cabinet made no mention of the bomb option. But it was
skeptical about whether the non-proliferation treaty would really
work as nuclear powers France and China had declared they would not
sign.
	   Following consultations with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
Australia was left with no doubts that Washington regarded the
treaty as vitally important.
	   When it came to a decision in the U.N., Australia voted in favor
of the treaty. Officials had queried whether it would even attract
the 40 signatures needed to become reality.

2,000 villagers held `hostage' in rebel retreat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with witness accounts by civilians from Linzola. Edits
to conform, adds byline. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ The Ninja militia group
battling the Republic of Congo's government has retreated into two
villages near the capital where civilians were being held hostage,
witnesses said Thursday.
	   About 2,000 villagers, including women and children, were being
forced to stay in their homes in Djoumouna and Linzola, between 15
and 30 kilometers (10 to 20 miles) south of the capital of
Brazzaville, a senior military officer said on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``We have the means and the equipment necessary to dislodge the
militia, but we don't want to risk the chance of a civilian
massacre,'' the military official said. ``The rebels know that and
they are holding the civilians hostage.''
	   Among the hostages were eight stewards from the multi-national
passenger airline Air Afrique who had taken refuge in Linzola
during fighting last week in Brazzaville, witnesses said. There was
no immediate confirmation of the reports and Ninja leaders were
unavailable for comment.
	   A group of Linzola residents who sneaked away during the night
told journalists that at least 13 people, including 10 foreigners _
three of whom are Lebanese businessmen _ had been killed. Their
identities were unknown.
	   The witnesses also gave accounts of Ninja militiamen torturing
their captives and said around 80 civilians were known to have
escaped to Brazzaville.
	   There has been no fighting between the two groups since last
weekend, when the government says it drove many of the Ninjas into
hiding in mountains and jungle southwest of the capital.
	   Hostilities flared in early December between the Ninjas, linked
to ex-Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, and President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso's personal Cobra militia.
	   Human rights and aid groups say the fighting has prompted tens
of thousands of civilians to flee their homes from Brazzaville and
towns in the southwest.
	   Unarmed residents have been killed, women raped and homes
destroyed since fighting broke out.
	   The hostilities are a reversal of a civil war last year that
ravaged Brazzaville and resulted in up to 10,000 deaths when
Sassou-Nguesso captured the presidency from Pascal Lissouba, a
sometime ally of Kolelas.
	   Sassou-Nguesso, the Republic of Congo's longtime Marxist
dictator who is now advocating capitalist reform, was ousted in the
country's first multiparty elections in 1992.

Seven candidates compete for World Cup 2006
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from SAfrica &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Germany, England, Brazil, South
Africa, Morocco, Egypt and Ghana are the official candidates to
host the 2006 World Cup finals.
	   The seven countries all notified FIFA in advance of the Thursday
night deadline of their intent to stage soccer's four-yearly
showcase. They now have until the end of July to submit their full
bid documents.
	   FIFA's 24-member executive committee will decide in March 2000.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter has repeatedly said the soccer
authority has a responsibility to stage the tournament in Africa,
which has never hosted the finals.
	   Morocco lost out to France for the staging of the 1998 finals.
	   Despite its high crime rate, South Africa is widely considered
the front-runner. It hosted the 1995 rugby union World Cup, the
1996 African Nations Cup and the 1998 athletics World Cup.
	   South African officials maintain they can keep crime under
control and say their infrastructure is developed enough to cope
with the demands of the tournament.
	   ``We are confident that we have a formidable case, said Danny
Jordaan, chief executive of South Africa's bid committee. ``It is
recognized by many of the international guests that come to our
country that we will be there in the end,'' he told BBC Radio 5
Live.
	   ``Our view is being shared by many people inside FIFA _ that it
is Africa's turn ... and that we do have the infrastructure, and
the capacity to add a new and refreshing dimension to the World
Cup.''
	   The case of both Germany and England has been weakened by the
fact that they are from the same continent. The 2002 finals are
being split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA insists that
co-hosting will be a one-time exception.
	   ``Certainly emotionally there is some support for South Africa
because their continent has never had it before,'' conceded
England's bid chief Alec McGivan.
	   ``That is something we have to overcome.''
	   ``The question is when will an African candidate be ready to
take on what is a huge logistical exercise?'' he queried in a BBC
radio interview.
	   Underlining the increasing European rivalry, McGivan said in a
radio interview that Germans were envious at the amount of support
given by the British government to England's bid.
	   He said he didn't think the bribery scandal rocking British
soccer would be ``an issue at all'' in FIFA's choice of site.
	   Hoping to boost its standing in the eyes of FIFA, European
Champions Germany recently agreed to take part in next summer's
Confederation Cup, after World Cup winners France pulled out for
scheduling reasons.

Hindu-Christian peace meetings held on New Year's Eve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Christian missionaries and Hindu social
workers held peace meetings on New Year's Eve in villages in a
western state where mobs damaged one dozen churches and at least
one Hindu temple in religious violence over the past week.
	   ``Our theme was that we need peace immediately,'' said Rev. T.
Gaikwad in a telephone interview Thursday from Ahwa, a village in
the state of Gujarat, where the first clash occurred Christmas Day.
	   ``There should be peace throughout'' the region, he said.
	   Gaikwad said he sent representatives to three villages in a
hilly and remote part of Gujarat where clashes took place.
	   Men, women and children of the villages met in an open farm
field with Christian missionaries and representatives of two
militant Hindu parties blamed for some of the attacks, he said.
Details of the meetings were not immediately available because of
poor communications in the area.
	   Late Wednesday, five people were injured in fresh clashes in
Charsod village, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) northeast of
Bombay, police said. Some 50 militant Hindus burned down a
mud-and-thatch building serving as church in the village, police
said. Details were not immediately available.
	   The recent attacks began Christmas Day with scuffles between
Hindus and Christians. In subsequent days, mobs armed with iron
rods, bicycle chains and axes broke into makeshift churches and
prayer halls. The World Hindu Council, which goes by the Hindi
language initials VHP, alleged that at least one Hindu temple and
several Hindu villagers had been attacked by Christians in recent
days.
	   Prayer meetings originally scheduled for New Year's Day in the
villages had been canceled, following tension.
	   On Thursday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee again condemned
the attacks and said he has asked the Gujarat government to take
stern action against those responsible for the incidents.
	   Christian organizations welcomed Vajpayee's comments.
	   India's nearly 1 billion population is mostly Hindu, and
Christians account for less than 2 percent of the figure.
	   For more than 100 years, Hindus and Christians across India have
lived in harmony. But in recent weeks, two small right-wing Hindu
groups that share an ideology with Vajpayee's governing party have
targeted churches, saying Christian missionaries have stepped up
conversion of poor, often illiterate villagers to their faith with
promises of jobs or money.
	   Christian missionaries admit conversations do take place, but
they deny that people are coerced, or given money or other
inducements.
	   The missionaries mostly work in remote, often inhospitable areas
where corrupt or inefficient government officials fail to carry out
development work such as building hospitals, schools or irrigation
canals. Christian groups are also known for the top quality schools
they run in urban centers.

IOC vows to overcome corruption scandals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The IOC declared Thursday it was
``strong enough'' to overcome the worst corruption crisis in modern
Olympic history.
	   In its year-end news letter, the IOC addressed the allegations
of bribery and extortion involving the bidding and selection
process for Olympic host cities.
	   ``Since its foundation in 1894, the International Olympic
Committee has been faced with problems of every nature, and it has
always succeeded in overcoming them by taking the right
decisions,'' the statement said.
	   ``This will remain true in the future. The Olympic movement is
strong enough to take up the challenge.''
	   The IOC, facing the worst ethics scandal in its 104-year
history, is conducting a high-level investigation into allegations
of bribery during Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   Salt Lake officials have acknowledged that 13 people, including
six relatives of IOC members, received nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarship payments during the bid.
	   IOC members also were given thousands of dollars worth of guns
and skis, and some received free medical treatments, including
plastic surgery.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has promised to oust any
members found guilty of corruption.
	   The IOC inquiry is one of four investigations into the Salt Lake
scandal. Also investigating are the Justice Department, the U.S.
Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake organizing committee's ethics
board.
	   In addition to the Salt Lake case, the IOC has been stung by
allegations from one of its own top officials _ executive board
member Marc Hodler _ that corruption is commonplace in Olympic bid
campaigns.

British prime minister, family spend quiet holiday in Seychelles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his family are spending their second quiet New Year's Eve in a
row on a small island called La Digue in the middle of the Indian
Ocean.
	   ``It is good to see Mr. Blair and his family returning to
Seychelles for all the right reasons _ to enjoy a holiday in a
relaxing atmosphere where well-known people are able to be left
alone to enjoy their holidays in peace and quiet,'' government
spokesman Gilbert Pool said Friday.
	   Blair is one of a growing number of politicians and celebrities
who have chosen the 92-island archipelago as a place to relax out
of sight of the media.
	   For the second year running, Blair, his wife Cherie and their
three children are staying at L'Union Self-Catering Bungalows
located on a working coconut plantation on La Digue.
	   The holiday home of Seychelles President France-Albert Rene is
nearby.
	   Pool said the government has no plans to host or encourage any
large-scale end-of-century celebrations in Seychelles next New
Year's Eve.

Former England star joins third division club
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARTLEPOOL, England (AP) _ Former England international Peter
Beardsley joined third division Hartlepool United on Thursday.
	   The 37-year-old striker is likely to go straight into the squad
for Saturday's league clash with Cambridge United at Victoria Park.
	   Bearsdley is reuinted with Pool boss Mick Tait, who played with
him at Carlisle almost 20 years ago.
	   The former Newcastle, Liverpool and Everton player has not
started a game for several weeks after being released by Kevin
Keegan's Fulham.
	   ``It's a while since I actually started a game, but hopefully,
once I've got two or three under my belt, I'll be OK,'' he said.
``I was lucky enough to play with the boss at Carlisle and he
really looked after me then and took me under his wing.
	   ``This is a way to try to help repay him. When I saw Mick on
Sunday, he told me he was 41 when he packed in, and I'm only 38
next month, so I've got a few years to go yet.''
	   Pool has slipped to 21st place in the league after a disastrous
run of five successive defeats.
	   While Beardsley has played at the world's most famous venues in
some of the game's biggest matches, he has no qualms about running
out at Victoria Park in front of around 2,000 spectators.
	   ``About four or five weeks ago, I played in front of about 100
for the reserves, so that won't worry me,'' he said. `You don't
think about it, you just think about playing your game.''

Asian nations kick off New Year's celebrations with fireworks,
</HEADLINE>
revelry

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ People throughout Asia welcomed the Year of the
Rabbit with with displays of fireworks, official speeches and late
night pilgrimages to sacred shrines and temples.
	   Millions of Australians bid farewell to 1998 late Thursday by
watching a U.S. dlrs 1.2 million fireworks extravaganza which
bathed the harborside Sydney Opera House in pulses of green, red
and blue light.
	   Sydney celebrates every major holiday and event with fireworks,
but New Year's Eve is a pyrotechnic orgy, and this year's barrage
was a dress rehearsal for upcoming sky shows to mark next year's
welcome for the year 2000, and the summer Olympic Games in
September 2000.
	   More than a million people saw Sydney's night sky light up in
person, and many of the city's other 2.5 million viewed live TV
coverage of the annual festival.
	   Crowds cried ``Ooooh'' and ``Aaaaah!'' as combinations of
fireworks, some formations bigger than most downtown buildings, lit
the sultry southern summer night sky under low clouds.
	   In central Tokyo, crowds thronged Zojoji temple just before
midnight, waiting for a Buddhist monk to strike the temple bell 108
times to dispel the evils of the past year and usher in good luck
for the new year.
	   Much of the rest of Tokyo was eerily empty Thursday night,
deserted by urbanites returning to hometowns in the countryside for
the New Year's celebrations, the most important event on the
Japanese calendar.
	   In much of Asia, 1999 is the Year of the Rabbit, and Tokyo's
department stores were well stocked with calendars, cards and
knickknacks bearing rabbit images.
	   Shoppers packed Japanese supermarket aisles before many closed
for the three-day holiday, to snap up red snappers, special
``year-crossing'' noodles, rice cakes and the sweet black beans
that are customary fare on New Year's day.
	   In a more modern tradition, families around Japan gathered in
front of their TVs to watch one of the most popular programs of the
year, a nationally-broadcast singing contest featuring the
country's top entertainers in dazzling costumes.
	   In Thailand, many Bangkok residents gathered for parties in
skyscrapers to enjoy the views of fireworks displays. The newest
attraction this year was Baiyoke tower, the city's tallest
building. A sold out dinner party for 750 baht (dlrs 20) a ticket
was held on the top floor _ one of the few parts of the 77-story
structure open due to a deep economic slump.
	   For many Chinese, New Year's Eve is not nearly as important an
occasion as the Lunar New Year on Feb. 16 when hundreds of millions
of people head home for family reunions.
	   Still, television and radio audiences were treated to a rare
live prime time address by China's president Jiang Zemin, who was
upbeat in summing up 1998 and urged his people to be confident
about the future.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie also delivered a nationwide
broadcast to cheer citizens struggling amid the Southeast Asian
country's worst economic downturn in decades.
	   In the Philippines, rebels joined a government effort to bring
down the number of people hurt during New Year's revelry by
ordering their forces not to fire guns to celebrate the start of
1999 _ an often deadly local tradition.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada has urged soldiers,
policemen and civilians to refrain from firing weapons too.
	   Dozens of Filipinos have been killed or injured by stray bullets
in recent New Year's celebrations.

National debt rises to 91.2 percent of the GDP in latest fiscal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's national debt rose to 91.2
of the gross domestic product in the latest fiscal year, compared
to 90.2 percent the previous year, the nation's central bank
reported Thursday.
	   In the period from July 1997 to June 1998, external debt rose
dlrs 1.9 billion to dlrs 29.7 billion, or 49.5 percent of the GDP.
	   The central bank suggested government should reduce the debt by
selling property and using privatization proceeds of the state-run
units. Also, direct foreign investment should be encouraged to
reduce dependence on foreign debt, the report said.
	   World economic powers sanctioned Pakistan in May after the
nation held nuclear tests. As sanctions ate away at the nation's
reserves, Pakistan scrambled to raise money from global donor
agencies to avoid defaulting on its obligations of external debt,
worth dlrs 32 billion at present.
	   The gross domestic product grew 5.4 percent, up from a meager
1.3 percent in the previous year. Solid growth in the agricultural
and industrial sectors helped boost the measure.
	   Inflation fell to 7.8 percent in the 1997-98 period, from 11.8
the previous year. The nation's foreign exchange reserves declined
by about dlrs 423 million.
	   The bank said poor revenue collection also increased
difficulties for the economy.
	   ``A narrow tax base, inefficient tax collection system, tax
evasion ... were all responsible for the inadequate revenue
performance,'' the report said.
	   On the expenditure side, Pakistan trimmed its development budget
to 3.2 percent of the GDP in 1997-98 from 3.4 percent the previous
year, while the defense budget fell to 4.9 percent from 5.1
percent.
	   The interest payment on debt increased to 6.9 percent of the GDP
compared to last year's 6.4 percent, the report said.

SAfrican lawyer takes sabbatical to hawk millennium bells
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Graeme Fraser, 43, put his law
practice into mothballs, packed his five children and wife in the
car and on Thursday was to kick off a potentially lucrative
millennium project.
	   At midnight, the family planned to launch a yearlong journey
with a set of four bells through nearly 300 small towns and
villages in South Africa.
	   Fraser said the project _ that also involves runners from local
athletic clubs and schools _ offered a welcome break from 16 years
practicing entertainment and corporate law.
	   ``It was a once in a lifetime opportunity,'' Fraser said in a
telephone interview.
	   With the backing of South African film producer Anant Singh,
Fraser also plans to sell 2,000 replicas of the bells. One third of
the sale price _ 750 rand (dlrs 125) a piece _ will benefit the
Sunshine Center Association, a charity organization for mentally
handicapped children.
	   If all the bells are sold, Fraser would have 1 million rand
(dlrs 166,000) to cover expenses and compensate for loss of income,
he said.
	   But Fraser said money was hardly his motive.
	   ``In the smaller towns of South Africa, outside the main
centers, there won't be much opportunity for people to be actively
involved in a millennium-related activity,'' Fraser said. ``The
whole concept of the bell is to involve as many people in South
Africa in the millennium as we can.''
	   At midnight Thursday, the Fraser family will run with the bells
from a cross in Mossel Bay on the southern coast marking the place
where Bartolomeu Dias, the Portuguese explorer, landed in 1487.
	   They'll deliver the bells to the Mossel Bay Museum, where the
local tourism board will hold a special send off on New Years Day
for the project, Fraser said.
	   ``We expect to be welcomed by the ringing of bells at every
stop,'' Fraser said. ``Bells have always been associated with happy
and joyous occasions. Most small towns in South Africa have bells
at schools or churches.''
	   The first leg will be a 50 kilometer (31 mile) jog by Mossel
Bay's local athletic club to the coastal city of George.
	   The final leg next December will be on South Africa's luxury
Blue Train from Johannesburg to Cape Town.
	   Fraser has started a promotions company called SA2000 that he
hopes will manage other millennium projects.
	   ``For 10 years, I've been thinking about this millennium
project,'' Fraser said.
	   His children, however, will return to school after the southern
hemisphere's summer holiday ends in mid January, he said.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With only hours to spare, Mexico's Congress
finally approved the 1999 budget Thursday, narrowly saving the
nation from a constitutional crisis.
	   The months-old deadlock between the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party and four opposition groups was broken late
Wednesday when the opposition-led House of Deputies approved the
package's tax bill by a 349-131 vote.
	   The Senate, controlled by the ruling party, approved the bill
early today and, hours later, the Deputies approved the package's
spending bill. That bill does not need Senate approval.
	   The budget was a compromise between the ruling party, known as
the PRI, and the conservative National Action Party. The leftist
Democratic Revolution Party, the second-largest bloc in the House
of Deputies, voted against the tax bill along with the tiny Labor
and Green parties.
	   After 69 years, the PRI lost its House majority in mid-term
elections last year. The deadline for approving the budget was Dec.
31, but the constitution does not specify what would have happened
if it had not been approved.

Serbian menus: All you can eat, plus Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade pizza restaurant is
offering a unique menu: All you can eat, plus the anti-impotence
drug Viagra. All for dlrs 50.
	   The owner, Miroslav Gajic, is more than happy with the sale.
``Viagra is a better invention than electricity,'' he was quoted as
saying in Thursday's independent daily Blic.
	   He said he sells ``between five and 30 such menus a day,'' and
that couples who eat them come back for more ``smiling.''
	   Gajic reportedly said the ``magic pill'' is a ``revolutionary
product which should be given a Nobel prize'' because it ``rises
from the dead.''
	   ``No wonder it was invented by weakling Americans,'' he said,
reflecting the belief of macho Serb males that they are the best in
sex.
	   Gajic said that his restaurant, named ``Grazia,'' is already
known as the ``Viagra Club.''
	   Viagra has been sold on the black market in Serbia and will be
available legally in pharmacies as of January.

Fewer journalists killed in 1998, says press watchdog
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fewer journalists were killed in 1998 than in
recent years, a French press watchdog said Thursday. But it warned
that journalists investigating corruption were in danger in many
countries.
	   In 1998, 19 journalists were killed worldwide, the report by
Reporters without Borders said. It said 487 others were arrested
and that 697 were physically abused or threatened.
	   The drop in the number of deaths was attributed in part to a
drop in fatalities for reporters covering the former Yugoslavia,
Chechnya and Algeria.
	   The group said reporters investigating corruption by public
officials had been killed in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
the Philippines, Russia and Thailand.
	   Since 1994, 103 journalists _ including 48 in Rwanda and 18 in
Algeria _ have been killed.
	   Some 93 journalists were currently in jail as a result of their
work, compared to 90 last year, the report said, highlighting cases
in Ethiopia, China, Syria, Burma. It also said torture was
commonplace in Turkish prisons.
	   Reporters Without Borders said the independent press was facing
increasing difficulties in Pakistan and Congo.
	   However, the report praised Indonesia, where it said no
reporters had been jailed since the fall of President Suharto, and
Nigeria, where it said the number of jailed reporters had fallen
from 13 to two since the death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha in
June.

Prince Naseem too young for national honor?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Naseem Hamed, Britain's brash world
featherweight champion, has ruffled some feathers by being chosen
for a prestigious national honor.
	   Hamed, the undefeated WBO champ, was awarded the MBE (Member of
the Order of the British Empire) in the New Year's Honors List
announced Thursday.
	   Former British heavyweight Henry Cooper, one of Britain's most
loved sports figures, said it was premature to give the award to
Hamed.
	   ``The kid is 24 and has won a couple of minor versions of world
titles,'' Cooper said. ``I think they should have left it a couple
of years.''
	   Cooper has criticized Hamed for his cocky attitude, including
his comments before the 1997 bout against American fighter Tom
``Boom Boom'' Johnson.
	   ``He told Tom Johnson he would send him to the graveyard and
that crossed the line of decent behavior,'' Cooper said. ``Who
would want to talk like that? Naz has said some things that the
Boxing Board should have punished him for, but they didn't. Now
he's got the MBE.''
	   The Guardian newspaper on Thursday described Hamed as ``boxing's
most talented but least charming ambassador.''
	   Hamed, 31-0, with 28 knockouts, suggested that Cooper may be
jealous of all the money he is making.
	   ``That's Henry's opinion and he stands alone with it,'' he said.
``I think I deserve this award as much as any other sportsman who
has been good for their country.
	   ``Henry can keep banging on until the cows come home about my
attitude outside the ring. I haven't got a problem with my
attitude.
	   ``I think what he's looking at is the stuff that I do inside the
ring and the big sums of money that I'm getting paid, which Henry
probably never got.''
	   Hamed's former trainer Brendan Ingle, who split with the fighter
last month, also received an MBE.
	   Receiving a knighthood was Frank Williams, who has guided the
Williams Formula One auto racing team to nine manufacturers titles.
	   England soccer star Stuart Pearce, who missed a penalty during a
World Cup shootout in 1990 but made up for it by scoring in another
in '98, gets the MBE. Now in his 16th season, 36-year-old Pearce is
playing for Newcastle.
	   Denise Lewis, who won the European and Commonwealth heptathlon
gold medals during 1998, is awarded the MBE while Craig Reedie,
chairman of the British Olympics Association, receives a CBE
(Commander of the Order of British Empire).
	   Long serving cricketer Angus Fraser has been awarded the MBE for
being England's best fast bowler of his generation. Fraser was one
of the stars of England's series victory over South Africa and was
on the team that unexpectedly triumphed on Tuesday in the fourth
test against Australia at Melbourne.

Seven candidates compete for World Cup 2006
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in lead that federations bidding. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ With many conceding the early lead to
South Africa, the soccer federations of Germany, England, Brazil,
Morocco, Egypt and Ghana also officially have notified FIFA of
their intent to bid for the right to stage the 2006 World Cup
finals.
	   The seven countries formally informed FIFA in advance of
Thursday night's deadline. They have until July 31 to submit their
full bid documents.
	   FIFA's 24-member Executive Committee will decide the host in
March 2000.
	   FIFA President Sepp Blatter repeatedly has said there is a
responsibility to stage the tournament in Africa, which has never
hosted the finals.
	   Morocco lost to France for the 1998 finals and the United States
in 1994.
	   Despite its high crime rate, South Africa is widely considered
the front-runner. It hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup, the 1996
African Nations Cup and the athletics World Cup this year.
	   South African officials maintain they can keep crime under
control and say their infrastructure is developed enough to cope
with the demands of the tournament.
	   ``We are confident that we have a formidable case, said Danny
Jordaan, chief executive of South Africa's bid committee. ``It is
recognized by many of the international guests that come to our
country that we will be there in the end,'' he told the BBC's Radio
5 Live.
	   ``Our view is being shared by many people inside FIFA _ that it
is Africa's turn ... and that we do have the infrastructure, and
the capacity to add a new and refreshing dimension to the World
Cup.''
	   The case for either Germany or England is weakened by the fact
that they are from the same continent. The 2002 finals are being
split between Japan and South Korea _ but FIFA insists that
co-hosting will be a one-time exception.
	   ``Certainly, emotionally, there is some support for South Africa
because their continent has never had it before,'' conceded
England's bid chief Alec McGivan. ``That is something we have to
overcome.
	   ``The question is when will an African candidate be ready to
take on what is a huge logistical exercise?''
	   Underlining the increasing European rivalry, McGivan said in a
radio interview that Germans were envious at the amount of support
given by the British government to England's bid.
	   He said he didn't think the bribery scandal rocking British
soccer would be ``an issue at all'' in FIFA's choice of site.
	   Hoping to boost its standing in the eyes of FIFA, reigning
European champion Germany agreed earlier this month to be the
contintent's representative in next summer's Confederation Cup. It
replaces World Cup champion France, which withdrew for scheduling
reasons.

Khmer Rouge leaders begin grand tour of country they destroyed
</HEADLINE>

opposition leader &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Under government protection, two
former Khmer Rouge leaders started a luxurious tour Thursday of the
country they helped destroy in blood and terror in the 1970s, and
complained the media were ruining their New Year holiday.
	   Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, members of the inner circle of the
late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, returned to mainstream society
this week after decades at jungle guerrilla bases and sealed a
defection deal with Prime Minister Hun Sen.
	   Ordinary Cambodians showed no sign of taking to the streets to
settle scores with their bloodstained former rulers, but VIP
treatment accorded them by the government fed growing, vocal anger
among human-rights and democracy groups.
	   ``It is a contempt for human life and a mockery of the memory
those million victims of Khmer Rouge atrocities,'' the Khmer
Institute for Democracy said in a statement.
	   Opposition leader Sam Rainsy praised King Norodom Sihanouk for
refusing to grant royal amnesty to the men, saying his move would
help ``end the culture of impunity that makes Cambodia a country of
`thieves, gangsters and assassins.'''
	   Hun Sen has assured the pair that he will not prosecute them for
crimes against humanity, saying the pardon would bring peace to the
country. But the Khmer Rouge civil war is already extinct. Many
Cambodians see the deal as pointless and want the pair tried for
genocide.
	   The pair have told a news conference that they were ``very
sorry'' but refused to take personal responsibility and invited
survivors to ``let bygones be bygones.''
	   For once fanatically rabid Maoist revolutionaries, they appeared
to revel in a bourgeois vacation.
	   After basking in VIP treatment in Phnom Penh for two days, they
traveled in luxury cars to the seaside resort of Sihanoukville,
first leg of a tour that will take them to the ancient Angkor
temples and their home provinces.
	   Along the roads are memorials stacked with bones and skulls of
thousands of their victims, irrigation ditches dug by hand under
the murderous eye of Khmer Rouge overseers and fields strewn with
mines from years of civil war.
	   They checked in at Sihanoukville's best hotel and took rooms
with a view of the Gulf of Thailand. Reporters staked out the hotel
and the pair kept to their rooms with the shades drawn, eating a
room-service lunch of crab and fish.
	   Long Norin, a spokesman, complained that the presence of
journalists was marring their stay and that as long as the press
remained, ``They will not leave their rooms.''
	   Khieu Samphan, 67, his hair dyed black during months on the run
in an attempt at disguise as Khmer Rouge territory fell under
government control, finally appeared with Nuon Chea to take a tour
with local officials.
	   ``Excuse me please, I would like to rest a little bit,'' Khieu
Samphan said. ``I have already said what needed to be said.''
	   A receptionist said the hotel was glad for their business.
Tourism had dried up after a shipment of toxic waste from a Taiwan
plastics factory was discovered in Sihanoukville a few weeks ago.
	   The deal the two men are receiving from Hun Sen has shaken hopes
that leaders of the bloody Khmer Rouge rule will ever face justice.
	   Dimming hopes for prosecution now seem to rest with the United
Nations, which can pass resolutions to try the Khmer Rouge leaders
overseas through an as-yet-uncreated international tribunal.
	   The United Nations recently sent experts to assess evidence
against senior Khmer Rouge members and offer recommendations for a
tribunal, either overseas or in Cambodia.
	   Thomas Hammarberg, the top U.N. human rights officer for
Cambodia, said the defections did not change the plans and that the
recomendations would soon be presented to the government.
	   Hammarberg expressed hope for a ``constructive discussion.
Considering the scale and the brutality of the Khmer Rouge crimes,
genuine healing in Cambodia will be extremely difficult without a
justice process.''
	   Denying Hun Sen a measure of legitimacy, King Norodom Sihanouk
has refused to provide amnesty because of ``undeniable discontent''
among a majority of Cambodians. Sihanouk said the international
community had ``the perfect right'' to judge the men.
	   No matter what the United Nations does, Hun Sen's cooperation
would be needed to arrest them.
	   The Khmer Rouge won a civil war in 1975 and forced the
population to toil in agricultural collectives. One Cambodian in
five died of overwork, starvation, disease and executions.
	   They were overthrown in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion, but
fought a long guerrilla war.

Bosnian Serb president names new premier-designate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from former President Biljana Plavsic,
Socialists
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In an effort to end a
political deadlock, the Bosnian Serb president Thursday named a
moderate as the new premier-designate, after a previous hardline
candidate failed to win parliamentary approval.
	   But only hours after the candidacy of Brane Miljus was
announced, his own Party of Independent Social-Democrats rejected
the selection, saying the president made the decision without
consulting party leaders.
	   Miljus had accepted the selection by President Nikola Poplasen,
who named him in an apparent effort to find a compromise after
months of political dispute between Bosnian Serb moderates and
hard-liners over the premier's post.
	   The Social-Democrats are run by current pro-Western Premier
Milorad Dodik and are part of a wider coalition of moderate
parties. In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, the party
said Miljus must turn down the mandate or face unspecified
consequences.
	   But the selection of the 47-year-old Miljus, a native of
Sarajevo, might be welcomed by international officials, who have
sought to maintain a moderate government in the Serb-controlled
half of the country. There was no immediate reaction from
international officials in Bosnia.
	   Miljus' appointment still must be approved by parliament. No
date for the vote has been set and it was not clear whether Miljus
could win. Neither of the two bitterly opposed camps gained a
majority in parliament following September general elections.
	   Poplasen, a hard-liner, first named Dragan Kalinic as premier,
but Kalinic failed to win parliamentary approval. Kalinic is a
close aide of Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb wartime leader
indicted by the international war crimes tribunal.
	   Moderates insisted that Dodik remain premier, which the
hard-liners refused. Miljus' selection is seen as a compromise, but
the reaction by Social-Democrats indicated it was not the result of
an agreement between the two sides.
	   Former President Biljana Plavsic, a moderate, told the SRNA news
agency she was ``shocked'' by Miljus' candidacy. She claimed his
selection was masterminded by Serbia, where President Slobodan
Milosevic remains in power after fomenting the Bosnian war.
	   The Socialist Party, the Bosnian Serb branch of Milosevic's
Socialists, cautiously welcomed Miljus' candidacy. While Poplasen's
decision was a surprise, it was ``a step ahead,'' the party said in
a statement.
	   The hardline Serb Democratic Party, formerly run by Karadzic,
has announced its support of Miljus.
	   International officials have threatened to cut financial aid to
Bosnian Serbs if a hard-liner becomes premier.
	   Miljus pledged in a statement Thursday to maintain close ties
with the international community and honor the US-brokered Dayton
peace agreements for Bosnia, signed in 1995.
	   The peace accords, which ended more than three years of
fighting, divided Bosnia roughly in two, with Serbs controlling one
half and the Muslim-Croat controlling the other. The country has
joint central institutions.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia's top paramilitary leader is
alive, a politician close to the feared rightist militias said
Thursday, following unconfirmed reports that the militia chief had
been killed in an attack by leftist rebels.
	   Carlos Castano survived the attack this week on his tightly
guarded mountain hideout in northern Cordoba state, said Max
Alberto Morales, a longtime intermediary between the militias and
the government.
	   ``It's been confirmed that he's alive...that he's still in the
area and that he hasn't spoken for security reasons,'' Morales told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
	   Morales said his information came from sources ``very close'' to
Castano, who is wanted by prosecutors in death squad killings of
human rights activists and leftist politicians.
	   Castano, 34, heads the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia,
an umbrella grouping of the militias originally formed by drug
traffickers and landowers to combat guerrilla extortion and
kidnappings.
	   In a radio interview earlier in the week, Morales said Castano
had ``disappeared'' and had not been heard from for 24 hours. The
comments sparked rampant speculation that Castano was killed by the
rebels during the attack on his base, known as Nudo del Paramillo.
	   In two days of cruel fighting in the area beginning Monday, at
least three men were beheaded, their mutilated bodies shown in
gruesome television reports.
	   The army and local officials charge the guerrillas massacred
dozens of civilians, accusing them of supporting the paramilitary
groups. The burned and disemembered bodies of 14 victims, including
three young girls, have been found.

U.N. begins evacuating staff from besieged Angolan city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from UNITA official in grafs 9-12. TRIMS
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations has started evacuating
its staff from Huambo, Angola's second-largest city, after a rebel
artillery barrage that killed at least eight people and wounded at
least 20 civilians.
	   A diplomat, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity,
declined to say how many U.N. staff were in the central highland
city where fighting between the army and UNITA rebels has escalated
in recent days.
	   The International Red Cross said 20 wounded civilians were
admitted to the Huambo hospital after Wednesday's hour-long
bombardment by UNITA's long-range artillery.
	   A private radio station, Luanda Antena Comercial, said 12 people
died in the barrage. Another private station, Radio Eclesia, said
eight people were killed.
	   Before the civil war resumed on Dec. 4, Huambo had a population
of about 300,000, but tens of thousands of refugees fleeing
fighting in the countryside have converged on the city in recent
weeks and reportedly are living in makeshift conditions.
	   Huambo lies about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda. Fighting also has focused on the nearby city of
Kuito.
	   A U.N.-chartered cargo plane crashed near Huambo on Saturday
with eight U.N. peacekeepers and six others on board. The cause of
the crash, as the plane passed over the war zone, is not known.
	   The United Nations Observer Mission, in Angola to oversee
implementation of the country's collapsed 1994 peace accord, still
has not received guarantees of safe passage from the warring
factions to send a rescue team to the crash site, U.N. spokesman
Hamadoun Toure said.
	   UNITA Secretary-general Paulo Lukamba Gato said he had received
no request from the United Nations to allow the deployment of a
rescue team.
	   ``There's a low-intensity war all over the country and a
high-intensity war around Huambo and Kuito. But there'll be a
crescendo in the next few days,'' Gato said in a telephone
interview from Bailundo, UNITA's central highland base. He declined
to elaborate.
	   Gato complained that the U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, had
failed in his task of bringing the two sides together because he
had not held direct talks with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi for
months.
	   ``The United Nations can't even stop the government's war
machine. But we'll do that, that's our problem,'' Gato said.
	   With the resumption of the civil war, the United Nations is
faced with the decision of whether to pull out some 1,000 troops in
its observer mission when its mandate expires on Jan. 15.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations. The
fighting renewed when government troops tried to take the
strongholds by force and were beaten back.
	   Earlier this week, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
ruled out talks with UNITA on ending the fighting, and said Savimbi
was a liar for faking compliance with the 1994 peace pact.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

Iranian hard-liners clash with mourners of slain dissident

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Some two thousand Iranians protesting the
murders of a dissident and his wife clashed with hard-line
militants in the capital Thursday.
	   Riot police broke up the fracas outside the Fakhr Mosque in
central Tehran, arresting a number of protesters.
	   The police did not explain why no militants were detained.
	   The protesters had attended a two-hour service in the mosque to
mark the 40th day after the death of Dariush Foruhar and his wife,
who were found stabbed to death in their Tehran home on Nov. 22.
	   Foruhar, 70, was the leader of the Iran Nation Party, a small
opposition group that is tolerated by the government. He was a
member of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan immediately
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
	   Emerging from the mosque, the mourners began chanting
pro-democracy slogans such as ``Freedom, security _ that is the
slogan of the nation'' and ``Death to autocracy.''
	   Despite the presence of some 200 riot-police, who had cordoned
off the mosque, dozens of militants charged the protesters and
fist-fights broke out.
	   No one was seriously injured in the 20 minutes it took for the
police to restore order.
	   Hard-line militants have attacked a number of leading moderates
and pro-democracy activists this year. They are believed to enjoy
the backing of powerful conservatives in the ruling hierarchy.
	   In addition to the Foruhars, three dissidents have died in
mysterious circumstances over the past two months. They were all
critical of the government's hard-line clergymen who are trying to
stymie the social and political reforms of President Mohammad
Khatami.
	   Two more political activists remain missing.
	   Khatami and the judiciary have set up committees to investigate
the deaths.
	   The presidential committee submitted an interim report Thursday,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   The agency said the report showed ``desirable progress,'' but
that Khatami had called for ``an accelerated pace of
investigation.''
	   Police say they have arrested several suspects, but have not
provided details.
	   Meanwhile, members of a second small opposition party, the Iran
Freedom Movement, handed in a letter to Khatami's office on
Thursday urging the president to make public the results of the
investigations so far.

Montenegrin leader warns Milosevic not to pressure the republic

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Montenegro's reformist leader
warned Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday not to try to impose his rule
in the republic by force, saying the Yugoslav president would ``end
up the loser.''
	   President Milo Djukanovic, whose republic forms Yugoslavia
together with much bigger Serbia, is an opponent of Milosevic,
currently the president of the joint federation. A clash between
the two over a number of issues has led to political tension.
	   There are fears Milosevic could try to strengthen his grip over
Montenegro by installing his proteges in power there. Djukanovic
last year won an election against a Milosevic aide, but the
Yugoslav president refused to recognize the victory.
	   Further fueling the tensions, Milosevic named his Montenegrin
aide Momir Bulatovic premier of Yugoslavia, ignoring the legitimate
leadership of Montenegro. He recently replaced army and state
security chiefs who had good ties with Djukanovic.
	   Bulatovic and his followers held violent protests in the capital
Podgorica last January when dozens of people were injured in
clashes with the police. Another rally is planned for this January.
	   Djukanovic said ``attempts to discipline Montenegro by force, or
put it back under the unchallenged, autocratic rule of one man are
unimaginable.''
	   The Montenegrin leader, who enjoys American support, accused
Milosevic of ``inciting conflicts,'' but added the Serb strongman
``would end up the loser in case he clashes with Montenegro.''
	   Milosevic, who became president of Serbia in 1990, is considered
chiefly responsible for the breakup of former Yugoslavia which led
to the Croatian and Bosnian wars. The Montenegrin leadership fears
a similar scenario there.
	   But Djukanovic said ``I believe that ... we have protected
Montenegro more than effectively against a new destruction by
Milosevic.''
	   Analysts believe the political crisis could lead to a breakup of
what remains of Yugoslavia. Djukanovic warned that Montenegro would
ignore decisions by the federal government it considers
illegitimate.

	   BANGALORE, India (AP) _ Police clamped an overnight curfew
Thursday in a city in southwestern India following Hindu-Muslim
clashes that killed five people and were sparked by an incident in
which Muslim men teased a Hindu woman.
	   At least 50 people were injured since violence broke out Tuesday
night in Suratkal, a coastal town in Karnataka state, police said.
	   Tension spread Thursday night to the nearby city of Mangalore
and state police chief T. Srinivasulu imposed a curfew there until
dawn.
	   Since Tuesday, mobs have attacked Hindus and Muslims in their
houses. Three Muslims and one Hindu have been stabbed to death in
the fighting. Police fired bullets on Wednesday to disperse
rioters, killing one Hindu protester in Suratkal.

Convicted kidnappers in Brazil end hunger strike after 46 days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Eight supporters of a leftist rebellion
who were convicted in a 1989 kidnapping ended a 46-day hunger
strike Thursday and accepted a government proposal expected to
result in their early release, their spokesman said.
	   ``The hunger strike is over,'' said Breno Altman, president of
the Committee to Free Political Prisoners.
	   Doctors at Sao Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas, where the
prisoners were being fed intravenously, said it will take at least
five days for them to recover.
	   Five Chileans, two Argentines and one Brazilian started their
hunger strike Nov. 16 to force the government to release them.
	   They have been in prison nine years for the 1989 kidnapping of
Abilio Diniz, owner of Brazil's largest supermarket chain. Police
freed him six days later, unharmed, after tracing the kidnappers
with the help of a van-rental receipt found at the kidnapping site.
	   At their trial, the 10 members of the kidnapping ring claimed
they were political prisoners because they planned to donate the
dlrs 30 million ransom they had demanded to El Salvador's leftist
guerrillas.
	   Two Canadians also convicted in the kidnapping, David Lamont and
Christine Spencer, were transferred to a Vancouver prison on Nov.
20 under a prisoner-transfer treaty.
	   Earlier this week, the government decided it could transfer
other inmates to their home countries in anticipation of pending
approval of similar treaties in those countries. It said the
Brazilian would eventually be given parole or placed in a
work-release program.
	   On Wednesday Altman said the government's decision was a ``a
major victory, because the foreign prisoners would be sent home
where they would probably be quickly paroled _ a right Brazilian
courts have always denied them.''
	   However, the kidnappers initially refused to end their fast
because the government failed to offer any concrete guarantees for
an early release of the Brazilian.
	   Altman said on Thursday that the prisoners changed their mind
after they received assurances that the Brazilian would be
transferred to his home state of Ceara, in northeastern Brazil
``where judges are more lenient.''
	   A recent Sao Paulo court ruling had paved the way for parole or
work-release as early as February by reducing the prisoners'
sentences to between 15 and 18 years from 26 to 28 years.
	   But Judge Otavio Augusto Machado do Barros insisted he would not
grant early release because ``they have failed all their
psychological evaluations and have shown no remorse for their
crime.''
	   The hunger strikers are: Ulisses Gallardo, Maria Marchi Badilla,
Pedro Lembach, Sergio Urtubia and Hector Ramon Tapia of Chile;
Humberto and Horacio Paz of Argentina; and Brazilian Raimundo
Freire.

Extremadura appears to present little problem to league leaders

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Already on top of the Primera Division, and
with last-placed Extremadura immediately ahead, Mallorca looks be
starting the New Year as well as it ended the last one.
	   With a 2-1-1 record since taking over the league lead on Nov.
21, Mallorca has extended its advantage atop the table to four
points. Having to travel to 3-3-9 Extremadura on Sunday hardly
seems more than a bump in the road to team that has allowed only
six goals in 15 games.
	   Making only its second appearance in the first division in its
history, Extremadura is looking to prove it can avoid its showing
of 1996-97, when it debuted in the Primera only to finish 19th and
immediately fall back into the lower rank.
	   It has been outscored nearly 3-1 (24-9) and has won only three
of its 15 matches.
	   Despite being more successful, the performance of perennial
powers Barcelona and Real Madrid has been much more disappointing.
	   Languishing in ninth, Barcelona has won only one of its last
five league matches and is emersed in a major crisis with Dutch
coach Louis Van Gaal clinging to his job on a week-to-week basis
despite his unpopularity with the fans.
	   ``No one understands why, with so many great players, we are
losing matches,'' Barcelona's Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert said
Thursday in sports daily El Mundo Deportivo.
	   ``We must beat Alaves to start the year on a good footing,''
defender Sergi Barjuan said, referring to Sunday's home match.
	   But despite Sergi's assurances that ``little by little things
are getting back to normal,'' the atmosphere clearly remains tense.
	   Earlier this week, club chairman Josep Nunez blamed the players
for the season's disappointments, including a humiliatingly early
exit from the European Champions League.
	   Meanwhile, Real Madrid also plays Sunday, at home to
next-to-last placed Tenerife.
	   Although Madrid is still in the running for its eighth European
Champions Cup title, the club has failed to sparkle in the domestic
league and is mired in eighth, seven points behind Mallorca.
	   Dutch coach Guus Hiddink probably rests uneasily, knowing that
his German predecessor, Juup Heynckes, was dismised after last
season for finishing at a disappointing fourth despite having won a
record seventh European Champions Cup title.
	   In other matches Sunday, second-placed Celta welcomes Oviedo in
the round's most evenly matched game.
	   Meanwhile, Deportivo La Coruna travels to Zaragoza, Atletico
plays away against lower-half Racing Santander and Athletic Bilbao
hosts Valladolid.
	   The week's round also provides two lower-half battles pitting
Villarreal against Betis, and Espanyol against Salamanca while
Saturday's only match sees Valencia host third-from bottom
Salamanca.

Russia's inflation hits 84 percent for 1998

 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government pinned a number Thursday to the
weakening ruble, announcing that its value had dropped almost 70
percent over the last four months in relation to the U.S. dollar.
	   And it announced that annual inflation, which appeared under
control until the financial crisis hit in August, reached 84.4
percent in 1998.
	   Russia is caught in the worst economic slide since the Soviet
collapse seven years ago, sparked by the Asian financial crisis,
falling world prices for oil _ Russia's biggest export earner _ and
successive governments' chronic inability to finance expenditures.
	   In 1998, the country's gross domestic product shrank 5 percent
and industrial production by 5.5 percent, the Economy Ministry said
Thursday, according to the Interfax news agency. Foreign trade
declined by 13.6 percent in the first 11 months of the year, and
exports to countries outside the former Soviet Union dropped 17.6
percent from last year, reaching dlrs 57.7 billion, the ministry
said.
	   Imports dropped by a quarter in 1998, the State Customs
Committee estimated.
	   After the government of Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko devalued
the ruble in August, its value dropped from about 6 to the U.S.
dollar to more than 20 to the dollar _ almost a 70 percent drop,
the Economy Ministry said.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned government workers that
their salaries would not be increased until the incomes of the
country's poorest citizens began rising.
	   ``I don't think ... it would be correct to raise salaries for
ourselves without raising the salaries of the poorest citizens,''
Primakov said.
	   ``We cannot turn Russia into an economically prosperous country
in just a few months, but it's our duty to do as much as
possible,'' he was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   Nearly one-third of Russia's 150 million people are living below
the official poverty line, the government said recently.
	   Meanwhile, a Russian court has declared bankrupt what was one of
the country's largest banks, clearing the way for the first
liquidation of a major bank since the crisis broke in August.
	   The Moscow Arbitration Court ruled this week that Tokobank was
bankrupt and that its assets should be distributed among creditors,
The Moscow Times reported.
	   The bank was once among the 20 largest in Russia, but now has
debts of 7.5 billion rubles (dlrs 363 million) and assets of just
3.4 billion rubles (dlrs 165 million), the newspaper reported.
	   Many of Russia's approximately 1,500 banks have been hard hit by
the financial crisis and have either closed or are providing only
limited services.
	   In another development, the Central Bank said Russia's hard
currency reserves stood at dlrs 12.3 billion as of Dec. 25.

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Showers will continue to move rapidly across Puerto Rico during
the early afternoon hours, but very dry air behind these showers
will ensure mostly sunny skies and ideal conditions for outdoor
activities over the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico for most of
the afternoon.
	   Marine conditions over our coastal waters have improved
considerably as the winds and seas continue to diminish.

Slovak official seeks talks on NATO integration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's new government is
interested in opening talks with NATO that will ultimately lead to
alliance membership for the Central European nation, the foreign
minister said Thursday.
	   Eduard Kukan acknowledged to journalists that NATO is unlikely
to invite new countries to begin accession talks at the April
summit at which the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland gain
membership.
	   But the foreign minister said he hopes for such talks in the
nearest future, the Czech news agency CTK reported.
	   Slovakia's chances of joining both NATO and the European Union
improved significantly when September parliamentary elections
resulted in a pro-Western government ousting that of authoritarian
Vladimir Meciar.
	   However, Defense Minister Pavol Kanis admitted that the new
government has yet to stabilize the country's internal political
situation _ a condition of NATO entry _ CTK reported.
	   He said that despite a lack of financial resources, the Slovak
army has kept high standards, and plans a reorganization next year.

French media group protests Serb action against Albanian daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French media watchdog group on Friday urged
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to use his influence so that
an Albanian-language daily in Kosovo can resume publication.
	   Bujku, the oldest Albanian-language daily in Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, was informed Wednesday by a state-run printing house
that it would no longer put out the paper.
	   In a letter sent to Milosevic Wednesday, Reporters without
Borders said it was ``concerned by the failure of Bujku to
appear.''
	   The group urged Milosevic to use his influence to ensure that
the newspaper would be able to be published again.
	   A terse directive telling employees of the Panorama print works,
which is owned by the state, not to print Bujku was posted
Wednesday in the plant.
	   Bujku is one of the three largest dailies in Kosovo, a province
of Serbia that is inhabited mainly by Albanians.
	   Albanian guerrillas seeking independence and government forces
are locked in a bloody fight for control of the province.
	   The Serbian government, after cracking down earlier this year on
Serbian-language papers, has moved to suppress Albanian-language
papers because of their backing for independence.
	   Bujku is the first Kosovo Albanian newspaper targeted.
	   The state-run plant actually stopped printing the daily two
weeks ago, claiming it was in arrears for printing costs. It has
not appeared on newsstands since then.
	   Other Albanian-language papers still publishing have said they
would defy government pressure on them.
	   A copy of the letter from Reporters without Borders was also
sent to other high-ranking Serb officials, as well as other
international media watchdog groups.

Ukraine's parliament approves 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Meeting in the last hours of 1998,
Ukraine's parliament on Thursday squeezed out a narrow majority for
approval of the next year's budget.
	   After nearly 20 attempts were stymied by the Communist-led
opposition, the 450-seat Verkhovna Rada voted 226-2 to approve the
budget. The rest of the deputies refused to cast votes.
	   The budget provides for revenues of 23.89 billion hryvna (dlrs
6.8 billion) and a deficit of 1.24 billion hryvna (dlrs 354
million), or 1 percent of gross domestic product.
	   About half of the deficit, or 630 million hryvna (dlrs 180
million), is to be covered by foreign loans, while the remaining
610 million hryvna (dlrs 174 million) will be drawn from internal
sources, such as printing new government bonds.
	   Communists and their supporters, who occupy more than one-third
of seats in Ukraine's legislature, repeatedly refused to approve
the budget, demanding that the government allocate more funds for
payment of overdue wages and pensions.
	   Some of them changed their stance only after the Cabinet agreed
to allocate part of the funds earmarked for payment of 1999 debt
obligations to finance education and health care.
	   Thursday's debate followed several clashes between the
government and leftist lawmakers in previous weeks, with the two
sides insisting on sharply different budget targets and failing to
reach a compromise each time.
	   However, Cabinet officials pleaded with the lawmakers not to
raise the proposed revenue target, citing chronically poor revenue
collection and forecasts that Ukraine's economy would shrink 1
percent next year.
	   The government raised only 63 percent of planned annual revenues
in the first 11 months of 1998, while its debt in back wages and
pensions has grown steadily to reach more than 3 billion hryvna
(dlrs 875 million), according to official statistics.
	   Ukraine's government has consistently failed to implement
economic reforms since the country gained independence in 1991,
bringing on a protracted economic decline and growing foreign and
domestic debts.
	   The 1999 budget envisages nearly a fifth of projected revenues
for debt payments, and the Cabinet has long insisted on making the
budget deficit as low as possible, citing scarce opportunities to
draw more loans to cover it.
	   Ukraine needs a well-balanced and low-deficit budget to present
to the International Monetary Fund so that it can resume payments
on a suspended dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   Many analysts say that without foreign aid, the former Soviet
republic would hardly be able to meet its 1999 debt obligations
since the government cannot raise the required money from domestic
sources.

SAfrican cricket team's racial make-up again sparks criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Outspoken Sports Minister
Steve Tshwete met with cricket's top official for an hour Thursday,
after repeating past denunciations that that the national team
doesn't have enough nonwhites.
	   Ali Bacher, managing director of the United Cricket Board, said
in a telephone interview that he met with Tshwete at Fort Beaufort,
150 kilometers (90 miles) north east of Port Elizabeth in the
Eastern Cape Province.
	   But he refused to give details, saying he will release a
statement at 0700GMT on Friday.
	   Tshwete could not be reached for comment.
	   Bacher stood firm on Wednesday after both Tshwete and National
Sports Council president Mluleki George castigated the cricket
board for choosing a team with only three players of color, a daily
newspaper in Johannesburg, Business Day, reported Thursday.
	   The team was announced after South Africa won the decisive third
Test of its five test series against West Indies on Tuesday. It
includes as nonwhites Paul Adams, Herschelle Gibbs and Ashwell
Prince.
	   ``Once I have spoken to (Tshwete), I am sure he will feel
happier about the direction we are taking,'' Bacher was quoted as
saying in Business Day. ``The minister has been very good to
cricket over the years and I want to reassure him that we have no
intention of letting him down in terms of our transformation.''
	   Earlier this month, the governing African National Congress
threw its weight behind charges that racism was keeping nonwhites
off national sports teams, and promised legislation to rectify the
problem.
	   The ANC charged that both cricket and rugby teams were not
trying hard enough to promote talented players of other races.
	   The attack followed similar pronouncements by the National
Sports Council and Tshwete, who has announced the creation of a
special commission to explore integration efforts.

Ronaldo: `I'll be world's best player again in 1999'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Putting the worst of 1998 behind him,
Brazilian striker Ronaldo says he is looking to regain his standing
as the world's best player in 1999.
	   Ronaldo, speaking to an Italian newspaper from Brazil, said he
was regaining his form and fitness and expects to play an integral
role in the rest of the season for Inter Milan.
	   ``I've been training like mad ... even more than I do in Italy.
My knees are responding better and better to the exercise,'' he
said in an interview Thursday in La Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   Ronaldo thanked Inter for the extra two days' holiday it allowed
him in Rio de Janeiro.
	   ``It's been fundamentally important for my work, my physical
well-being and my mind,'' he said. ``Inter will not regret its
decision. I'll do everything to make sure it won't regret it.''
	   Ronaldo, who has played sparingly this season due to recurring
tendinitis in his knees, said his immediate aim is to get back to
``feeling 100 percent and therefore playing 100 percent ... without
feeling the least pain.''
	   Already, he said, he's succeeding in ``doing more and with less
pain.''
	   Ronaldo felt plenty of pain in 1998 _ and so did his fans, who
never got a clear explanation of the reason for his mysteriously
poor performance in Brazil's 3-0 loss to France in the World Cup
final.
	   Ronaldo allegedly suffered convulsions before the match and was
left off the initial lineup sheet. He went on to play, but made
little impact, a surprising performance from a player twice voted
best in the world by FIFA.
	   The shame of that is eased by his upcoming recognition as the
best overall player of France '98, an honor to be handed out Feb. 1
in Barcelona.
	   ``It has made me forget how the World Cup ended,'' Ronaldo told
the Italian newspaper. ``Fortunately, it's just a bad memory now.''
	   He spoke optimistically of the year ahead with Inter, even
though the Milan team is currently behind Fiorentina in the Italian
league standings.
	   ``We have lots of time to win the championship,'' he said.
	   Speaking of teammate Roberto Baggio, Ronaldo said, ``We've not
played much together but now we'll be together to give our fans a
good time. It's what people want, and what we want too.''

Aziz: Iraq's ``battle against aggression' to continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Aziz did not specifically mention the no-fly
zones, FIXES quote in last graf &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ There will be no letup in Baghdad's
``battle against aggression,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said in remarks published Thursday.
	   Aziz's comments came a day after the latest clash between U.S.
warplanes and Iraqi air-defense units in the no-fly zones over
Iraq.
	   ``The battle against the aggression and aggressors has not
stopped. It will continue,'' Aziz said in a front-page commentary
in Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath Party. He did
not specifically mention the no-fly zones.
	   Aziz also criticized the decision by the Arab League to put off
a meeting of foreign ministers.
	   They had been scheduled to meet this week on the mid-December
airstrikes by the United States and Britain against Iraq. But the
session was put off until Jan. 24, after the Muslim fasting month
of Ramadan, at the request of Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia.
	   Aziz accused Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid of
yielding to pressure from Saudi Arabia, terming it ``outrageous.''
	   ``The decision of the secretary-general lacks legitimacy ... it
also lacks fairness,'' Aziz added.
	   Iraq had hoped for Arab League backing for its demand to lift
U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors
declare Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.S.-British airstrikes came after the inspectors reported
Iraq was refusing to cooperate in the search for prohibited
weapons.
	   The no-fly zones were set up to protect Kurds in Iraq's north
and Shiite Muslims in the south who rose up against President
Saddam Hussein's government after the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's
forces quickly put down the revolts.
	   The Pentagon said that in the latest clash U.S. jets launched
missiles at an Iraqi anti-aircraft battery after it fired on
British patrol planes.
	   Iraq said one farmer was killed and two other civilians were
wounded. It made no mention of military casualties.
	   Two days earlier, U.S. jets fired on an Iraqi post in the
northern no-fly zone. Iraq said that four soldiers were killed and
seven wounded.
	   Aziz also accused Abdel-Meguid of acting against the wishes of
the Arabs, who he said resented their leaders' muted reaction to
the bombing of Iraq. It was a reference to anti-American
demonstrations around the Arab world during the airstrikes.
	   He said Iraq's resistance to the United States and Britain would
trigger ``further interest and wrath from the Arab masses'' and
garner support for Iraq's campaign to get punishing U.N. trade
sanctions removed.
	   The newspapers also published more defiant remarks by Gen. Ali
Hassan al-Majid, commander of the southern region.
	   ``We shall continue (efforts) to liberate the skies of Iraq from
devils who are supported by the biggest adulterer in the world ...
who is aided by some evil Arabs, among them the rulers of Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia,'' the official Al-Iraq newspaper quoted al-Majid
as saying in a telegram to Saddam.

Brazil's Cardoso assumes second term amid vastly lower
</HEADLINE>
expectations &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ This time around, the presidential
Rolls Royce is staying in the garage. And forget about champagne,
the inauguration will be toasted with locally-grown sparkling wine
and contraband whiskey seized by customs officials.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso prepares to be sworn in to a
second term in office Friday, but for many here the expectations
are as stripped down as the commemorations.
	   ``The difference in sentiment between the first term and the
second term are enormous,'' said Antonio Delfim Neto, a congressman
and former finance minister, ``In 1995 everything was certainty and
hope ... the beginning of the second term is sadder: everything is
uncertainty.''
	   On the eve of his 1995 inauguration, Cardoso enjoyed approval
ratings of around 70 percent, almost entirely on the strength of
the economic plan he devised as finance minister under
then-President Itamar Franco.
	   Introduced in July 1994, the plan dropped inflation, then
hovering around 50 percent a month, to a single digit almost
overnight.
	   Suddenly one US dollar bought only 82 centavos of a real _ the
local currency _ and for many Brazilians, beaten down by years of
triple digit inflation, it was a heady time.
	   With new hard currency in their wallets, Brazilians traveled
abroad in record numbers and consumption of electronics and other
goods grew so quickly there were concerns the economy was
overheating.
	   It was in this climate that Cardoso was overwhelming elected in
Oct. 1995 and fittingly all the stops were pulled out for his first
inauguration with some 6,000 people attending the 3 million real
(dlrs 2.5 million) gala.
	   The economic plan received high marks from most economists, but
many warned that it would at best provide a window of opportunity
in which to address deep-seated structural problems.
	   Cardoso's government proposed constitutional amendments to
change the tax system, the pension system and civil service
payrolls and shore-up the country's burgeoning deficit.
	   But aside from a constitutional amendment that allowed the
president and governors to stand for reelection, something
prohibited under the country's 1988 Constitution, the other reforms
languished in Congress.
	   For a while, that wasn't a problem.
	   Trade and public sector deficits continue to grow, but foreign
money was flooding into Brazil faster than ever and the country's
reserves swelled from around dlrs 40 billion to above dlrs 70
billion during Cardoso's first three and a half years in office.
	   The volume on Brazilian stock exchanges more than doubled and
leading stock funds boasted returns of over 200 percent a year.
	   But when financial instability rocked Asia and then Russia last
August, the same foreign investment that had swelled the country's
foreign reserves left even faster than it came in.
	   With a dlrs 41.5 International Monetary Fund-led bailout
package, Brazil may have avoided becoming the latest domino to fall
in the financial crisis afflicting Asia and Russia, but the outcome
of all the fiscal belt-tightening needed to qualify for that aid
will almost certainly spell recession in 1999.
	   Although Cardoso soundly defeated his opponent, leftist Worker's
Party candidate Luiz Lula Inacio da Silva, in the first round of
last year's October election, his approval rating has sunk by some
17 percentage points in the months since then to around 35 percent.
	   According to a recent poll by the Datafolha organization, 48
percent of those questioned now expect inflation to rise over the
coming months and 66 percent are worried about losing their jobs.
	   The poll which interviewed 11,851 people had a margin of error
of plus or minus two percentage points.
	   Not surprisingly, Friday's inauguration dinner will be a
scaled-down affair.
	   Only 114 people are expected to attend the dinner following
Friday's inauguration which is expected to cost 60,000 reals (dlrs
50,000), or a mere 2 percent of what the first one cost.
	   Whether Cardoso will be able to steer Brazil _ and an unruly
Congress _ away from these uncertain shores is anybody's guess, but
regardless of what Brazilians think of the job he's doing they're
sticking by their captain.
	   ``He got us into this mess, so we'll just have to hope he can
get us out,'' said Luis Fernando Duarte de Morares, an agricultural
engineer.

A reluctance to commit could hurt Israel's charmer

	   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) _ Voters in this rocket-plagued
border town wanted answers Thursday from Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the
man who would be prime minister. Instead, they got dollops of his
famous charm.
	   It wasn't enough for Kiryat Shemona residents _ or, according to
a new poll showing plummeting ratings for the just-retired military
chief-of-staff, an electorate that is already wearying in a
personality-driven campaign in its early days.
	   In the market place of Kiryat Shemona, a town hit hard last week
by Lebanese guerrilla rockets, Lipkin-Shahak frustrated vendors
with his vague answers to questions about his policies on Lebanon.
	   ``What will do you do for Kiryat Shemona?'' asked shopper Linda
Attal. ``Whatever I can,'' replied Lipkin-Shahak.
	   Moshe Dadon, a vegetables vendor, told Lipkin-Shahak that the
killing of Israel soldiers in Lebanon must stop. ``That's right,''
the candidate replied.
	   Such non-commital answers frustrated Motti Avizada.
	   ``Shahak _ that's all we hear,'' Avizada said. ``We don't know
what he stands for. He himself doesn't know what he stands for.''
	   After Lipkin-Shahak spoke at Tel Hai teachers training college,
a student joked to his friends: ``Besides nothing, he didn't say
anything.''
	   A poll published the same day Lipkin-Shahak made his first
campaign stop toward May elections indicated that he is losing the
luster he maintained until last week, when he shed his uniform.
	   The Maariv/Gallup poll showed Lipkin-Shahak would win 17 percent
of the vote in a first round of voting _ not enough to get into a
run-off phase. The poll, of 562 voting-age Israelis, had a margin
of error of 4.5 percent.
	   Until last week, Shahak scored in the 30s _ often outdoing his
principal rivals, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor party
leader Ehud Barak.
	   Shahak had a period of grace because as a soldier he was
prohibited from expressing opinions. Out of uniform, Israelis
expect clear-cut policies on the security issues that grip the
country.
	   Netanyahu has made it clear that he will only grudgingly concede
land to the Arabs; Barak says he is ready to stand by Israeli
commitments to do so. Lipkin-Shahak has yet to commit either way, a
lack of identification he hopes will help him.
	   ``I'm accused of being a neophyte in politics,'' he told
reporters. ``I don't consider this an insult if it is in contrast
to political sharks,'' an allusion to the mudslinging that has
marked this campaign.
	   But some see his broad-based approach as opportunism.
	   Daniel Doron, a political commentator writing in The Jerusalem
Post, chided him for not being ``embarrassed at trying to piece
together a party with candidates whose positions are known to be
worlds apart.''
	   Doron noted that Lipkin-Shahak's tour as chief-of-staff was
marked by military failures in Lebanon _ a record his rivals are
sure to exploit as the May 17 vote nears.
	   Lipkin-Shahak, sporting a windbreaker, exhibited much of the
charm that earned him a following during his tenure as
chief-of-staff. He cocked his head attentively toward questioners
and always marked his reply with a broad smile.
	   It worked for some. ``I think he's a very talented man and
well-suited to politics,'' said Michal Saadia, a shopper. She
added, ``He's gorgeous.''
	   Others, Lipkin-Shahak left anxious.
	   ``I want to hear this guy talk more, I don't know what he
believes in,'' said Assaf Rashba, a Tel Hai student, as he sat down
to hear Lipkin-Shahak speak. .
	   ``I still don't know what he believes,'' Rashba said, leaving
the hall. ``I'm quite disappointed.''

Aziz: Iraq's ``battle against aggression' to continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Aziz did not specifically mention the no-fly
zones, FIXES quote in last graf &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ There will be no letup in Baghdad's
``battle against aggression,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said in remarks published Thursday.
	   Aziz's comments came a day after the latest clash between U.S.
warplanes and Iraqi air-defense units in the no-fly zones over
Iraq.
	   ``The battle against the aggression and aggressors has not
stopped. It will continue,'' Aziz said in a front-page commentary
in Al-Thawra, which is published by the ruling Baath Party. He did
not specifically mention the no-fly zones.
	   Aziz also criticized the decision by the Arab League to put off
a meeting of foreign ministers.
	   They had been scheduled to meet this week on the mid-December
airstrikes by the United States and Britain against Iraq. But the
session was put off until Jan. 24, after the Muslim fasting month
of Ramadan, at the request of Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia.
	   Aziz accused Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid of
yielding to pressure from Saudi Arabia, terming it ``outrageous.''
	   ``The decision of the secretary-general lacks legitimacy ... it
also lacks fairness,'' Aziz added.
	   Iraq had hoped for Arab League backing for its demand to lift
U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. arms inspectors
declare Iraq free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.S.-British airstrikes came after the inspectors reported
Iraq was refusing to cooperate in the search for prohibited
weapons.
	   The no-fly zones were set up to protect Kurds in Iraq's north
and Shiite Muslims in the south who rose up against President
Saddam Hussein's government after the 1991 Gulf War. Saddam's
forces quickly put down the revolts.
	   The Pentagon said that in the latest clash U.S. jets launched
missiles at an Iraqi anti-aircraft battery after it fired on
British patrol planes.
	   Iraq said one farmer was killed and two other civilians were
wounded. It made no mention of military casualties.
	   Two days earlier, U.S. jets fired on an Iraqi post in the
northern no-fly zone. Iraq said that four soldiers were killed and
seven wounded.
	   Aziz also accused Abdel-Meguid of acting against the wishes of
the Arabs, who he said resented their leaders' muted reaction to
the bombing of Iraq. It was a reference to anti-American
demonstrations around the Arab world during the airstrikes.
	   He said Iraq's resistance to the United States and Britain would
trigger ``further interest and wrath from the Arab masses'' and
garner support for Iraq's campaign to get punishing U.N. trade
sanctions removed.
	   The newspapers also published more defiant remarks by Gen. Ali
Hassan al-Majid, commander of the southern region.
	   ``We shall continue (efforts) to liberate the skies of Iraq from
devils who are supported by the biggest adulterer in the world ...
who is aided by some evil Arabs, among them the rulers of Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia,'' the official Al-Iraq newspaper quoted al-Majid
as saying in a telegram to Saddam.

Spurs guard Vinny Del Negro looks headed to Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ San Antonio Spurs guard Vinny Del Negro is
close to signing a deal with Fortitudo Bologna of the Italian
basketball league, team officials say.
	   Del Negro, who has dual American-Italian nationality and played
previously in Italy in the early '90s, is expected to arrive in
Bologna on Sunday to complete the move.
	   Under the proposed contract, Del Negro could return to the NBA
if the lockout ends.
	   The deadline for registering players for Euro League play is
Monday. Del Negro would be eligible to play against CSKA Moscow
next Thursday.
	   The Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport said the deal
being worked out with Del Negro's agent, Jack Marin, has an escape
clause allowing the player to return to the NBA if the owners and
players end their labor dispute.
	   Under the terms of the proposed contract, Del Negro is required
to stay with the Italian club for a minimum of 30-40 days, a period
encompassing about 10 games.
	   The NBA lockout has been in effect for almost six months, and
the first three months of the season have already been scrapped.
	   Commissioner David Stern says he'll recommend the entire season
be canceled if there's no agreement with players by next Thursday.
	   ``Even if he leaves, Vinny will have played for us for
practically free,'' Fortitudo administrator Massimo Gambini said.
``The contract, apart from the clauses, runs to June 1999 and has
an option for next season. If Del Negro wants to stay, we are ready
to keep him for the future.''
	   Del Negro won an Italian league championship with Benetton
Treviso in 1992.
	   He was one of the Spurs' main outside shooting threats last
season. The Spurs advanced to the Western Conference semifinals
before losing to Utah 4-1.
	   Del Negro would join some other NBA players who have already
signed with European teams.
	   Center Arvydas Sabonis of the Portland Trail Blazers has joined
Lithuania's Zalgiras Vilnius, and Vlade Divac, who played with the
Charlotte Hornets last season, is with Red Star Belgrade. Those two
teams will meet in a Euro League game in Belgrade on Jan. 7.
	   In addition, Spanish club Real Madrid is hoping to sign Rik
Smits of the Indiana Pacers and Zyrdrunas Ilgauskus of the
Cleveland Cavaliers.

	   PARIS (AP) _ About 100 homeless people helped themselves without
paying to gourmet food Thursday in the upscale Galeries Lafayette
department store in Paris.
	   The homeless protesters stocked up and then left the store
pushing about 20 grocery carts full of goodies.
	   Galeries Lafayette management proposed that the protesters take
what they needed to provide a New Year's feast for about 100 people
after the group entered the store.
	   The protesters loaded up on champagne, wine, chocolate, pizza,
smoked salmon and baby formula before taking their carts into the
subway.
	   France's unemployment rate is currently 11.5 percent, and
jobless people frequently stage protests, especially at the end of
the year before the Christmas and New Year holidays.

Mandela sends last New Year's message as SAfrican president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: EMBARGOED for use until 1800GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In his last New Year's message
before leaving office, President Nelson Mandela on Thursday
challenged South Africans to continue working together to solve the
problems of poverty and corruption that are the legacy of decades
of apartheid.
	   Mandela, 80, will step down after national elections in 1999,
when Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is expected to succeed him. The
ruling party, African National Congress, is supported by most black
voters.
	   ``The New Year will bring many changes,'' Mandela said in the
four-minute broadcast message. ``They will depend on our working
together to realize our dream.''
	   He also sounded a warning that the elections _ the country's
second democratic vote since 1994 _ should not divide the country.
	   ``However robust the coming election campaign, we must emerge
still more united,'' he said.
	   The message was prerecorded. Mandela is on holiday in Mozambique
with his new wife, Graca Machel, who is Mozambican.
	   A date has not yet been set for the election, expected to be
held between May and July 1999.
	   The task started by Mandela, to redress the imbalances created
by more than four decades of apartheid, will fall to Mbeki.
	   Mbeki, 56, spent more than 30 years in exile, leaving South
Africa before his father, Govan Mbeki, was jailed for life with
Mandela in 1964.
	   Last weekend Mandela and Govan Mbeki were guests of honour at a
gathering at the Mbeki village of Ngcingwane in the Eastern Cape
for a traditional cleansing ceremony by his MaZizi clan to prepare
the younger Mbeki to lead the country.
	   More academic and less relaxed than Mandela, Mbeki is expected
to work towards an ``African Renaissance'' _ an effort to encourage
the continent to move away from war, poverty and dictatorship and
towards democracy and development.
	   Leaders of other political parties painted bleak pictures for
the New Year.
	   The leader of the conservative white Freedom Front, General
Constand Viljoen, slammed the ANc for being obsessed with power and
unable to curb crime and unemployment.
	   The liberal Democratic Party urged South Africans to vote in the
election and to vote on the basis of the track records of the
various parties.
	   The National Party which created apartheid and ruled South
Africa for more than 40 years urged citizens to unite against crime
and poverty and to vote to ensure effective multi-party democracy.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with president's messages to foreign presidents in new
final graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Taking a day off from politics, President Boris
Yeltsin on Thursday called on Russians to meet 1999 with optimism
and pride in their country.
	   The president's taped New Year's Eve message, which is broadcast
across the nation just before midnight, was first shown in Russia's
Far East _ nine time zones ahead of Moscow.
	   ``What can I say: The year was difficult for the country, for
many of you, and for me, too. But New Year's Eve is always about
new hopes, new dreams, new plans,'' Yeltsin said, according to a
transcript released by the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin voiced hopes for the most defenseless members of
society, ``so that our children will be happy and those who need
attention and care so much now should feel it.'' And he expressed
hope that Russians would always feel the ``dignity and greatness''
of their country.
	   He noted that the new millennium was just around the corner.
	   ``What kind of country enters it depends on each of us _ on our
talent and industriousness, our persistence and will, unity and
togetherness,'' Yeltsin said.
	   ``Yes, we're very different, but together, we're Russia.''
	   Yeltsin also sent New Year's greetings to his foreign
counterparts, including the presidents of Russia's partners in the
Commonwealth of Independent States and the leaders of France,
Germany, Japan, Italy, Britain and the United States, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported, citing the presidential press service.

France prints its first euro stamp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France printed its first postage stamp denominated
in euros on Friday several minutes after the official exchange rate
between the new single currency and the franc was announced.
	   The new stamp, worth 3 francs or .46 euros, still has the
picture of Marianne, the symbol of the French republic, on the
front.
	   But on the red background, the ``e'' that symbolizes the euro is
also present in white on the new stamp with the euro value. The
value in French francs is now printed in blue.
	   The new stamps were to be delivered Thursday evening to France's
main post offices. The stamp will be on sale New Year's day at the
Postal Museum in Paris.
	   The rest of the country will have to wait until Saturday when
the post office reopens after the New Year's holiday to purchase
their first stamps in euros.
	   During 1999, the French post office plans to stop making stamps
denominated only in francs and introduce stamps with both the franc
and the euro value.
	   In the year 2002, when the franc disappears altogether, stamps
will be denominated only in euros.

Fighting near capital reported in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Loyalist forces exchanged
artillery fire with rebel fighters just outside of Sierra Leone's
capital on Thursday, amid reports the insurgents were advancing on
the city from the east.
	   Diplomats and Defense Ministry officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity said heavy shelling rocked the hills south of Freetown
near the Hastings military airfield.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, but thousands of
civilians in the area fled to Freetown, about 20 kilometers (12
miles) to the north.
	   Rebel fighters from the Revolutionary United Front infiltrated
the hills in recent weeks and have been warning of an imminent
attack on the city itself.
	   Troops assigned to a West African defense force known as ECOMOG
have been shelling the hills in an effort to drive the rebels back.
	   The shelling comes as RUF rebels continued to push toward
Freetown from the east, where on Wednesday they overran the town of
Lunsar, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the capital.
	   The rebels have been making swift advances in recent days,
recapturing ground lost to ECOMOG since February, when they were
driven from Freetown after the ouster of Sierra Leone's military
junta.
	   The Nigerian-led West African force have been withdrawing from
their positions in the countryside to consolidate their defensive
positions around Freetown, an ECOMOG official told The Associated
Press on condition he not be named.
	   ECOMOG troops were hailed as heroes in February when they drove
the rebels and the junta from power. The coalition defense force
successfully battled the rebels away from the city and helped
restore the country's elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   Kabbah was deposed in a military coup in May 1997, but returned
to power in March of this year.
	   The rebel, waging an intermittent guerrilla war in the
countryside for the past seven years have been accused a widespread
atrocities. Countless villagers have been maimed, tortured or
murdered by the rebels, relief workers and missionaries say.
	   The rebels have demanded Kabbah resign and are calling for
mediation with the government through the Organization of African
Unity.

Three people killed, seven wounded in new violence in Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Three people were killed and seven others wounded
in new violence in Algeria, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   According to the Liberte daily, two adolescents were killed and
three others wounded Wednesday at a fake road block set up by an
armed group near Blida, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of
Algiers.
	   The victims had been shot and were found in a bus that had been
stopped by an explosion from a homemade bomb, the newspaper
reported.
	   In another violent incident, an armed group attacked a bus
Monday evening near Boumerdes, a town about 50 kilometers (31
miles) east of Algiers, the Le Matin newspaper reported. One person
was killed and four others were wounded, the daily said.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the start of
Algeria's insurgency, triggered by an army decision to cancel
elections the Islamic Salvation Front was set to win in 1992.

Euro seen boosting unity as well as, economy

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's leaders proclaimed a new era
Thursday as 11 nations, including the continent's biggest economic
powers, merged currencies to create the euro, a shared money they
say will boost business, underpin unity and strengthen their role
in world affairs.
	   ``If the postwar era ended nine years ago with the fall of the
Berlin Wall, then our future begins on Jan. 1, 1999,'' German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wrote in the Handelsblatt business
daily.
	   At the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, after years of
preparation, the euro becomes the common currency of Germany,
France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal,
Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg.
	   The event was hailed as a historic turning point, creating a
powerful new force in the world economy and fulfilling the post-war
dreams of union among nations whose divisions twice this century
dragged the planet into it's bloodiest wars.
	   ``Europe is finishing the century by sending a message of
peace,'' said Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi. ``The
conflicts that have so often gripped our continent are a thing of
the past.''
	   Finance ministers from the 11 nations gathered at European Union
headquarters in Brussels to fix the parities at which their
currencies were irreversibly locked to form the euro.
	   The new currency is worth worth 1.95583 German marks, 6.55957
French francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386 Spanish pesetas. When
markets open after the long holiday weekend, the euro is expected
to start trading at about dlrs 1.17, 133 Japanese yen and 70
British pence.
	   The ministers celebrated by popping corks shaped like the euro's
``e'' symbol from nine-liter (18.9-pint) champagne bottles, then
schoolchildren launched 3,000 blue balloons into the gray skies
above Brussels.
	   Although euro notes and coins won't be issued to replace Irish
pounds, Portuguese escudos, Austrian schillings and the rest until
2002, the new currency will immediately come into use for non-cash
transactions ranging from government bond issues to simple credit
card purchases.
	   Thousands of financial sector workers were set to spend the New
Year's break adapting computer systems and trading floors to the
new currency and converting stocks, bonds and bank accounts into
euros.
	   From Thursday, francs, marks and the rest will no longer be
traded in foreign exchange markets. Equities and bonds will be
quoted in euros. Bank transfers and business deals will
increasingly be in the new money.
	   Participating nations say that all that will give a boost to
business by creating a seamless market of 292 million citizens were
companies can operate without exchange costs or currency jitters.
	   Representing 20 percent of world economic output and 18 percent
of world trade, the euro-zone will be a powerful player in the
world economy. For the first time in decades, the U.S. dollar will
have a rival as the currency of choice for world trade and
government reserves.
	   ``The euro becomes the strong arm of the strongest economic
region of the world,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said in
Vienna.
	   Euroland governments stressed the currency was about more than
just economics.
	   ``From Lisbon to Helsinki, from Paris to Vienna, the euro is a
remarkable symbol of our common identity,'' said French Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn. ``Tomorrow I won't be any less
French ... but we will all be a little more European.''
	   Although citizens will only fill their purses and pocketbooks
with euros in three years, they'll start to become familiar with
the new currency immediately. Euro figures will appear alongside
national currencies on pay checks, phone bills and bank statements.
	   The latest EU polls published in September showed 66 percent of
citizens in the euro-zone supporting the common currency.
	   ``This is a good moment, the future is with the euro,'' said
schoolteacher Blandine Barnier in the French city of Lyon, adding
that her 10-year-old pupils already know what to expect. ``The
children are really aware of the euro, they travel a lot around
Europe and know what it's about.''
	   From Jan. 1, consumers will see prices marked in euros making it
easier to shop across frontiers, and they'll be able to buy in
euros using checks or credit cards. But they'll still have to
change money for cross-border cash purchases.
	   Ministers stressed that the currency union needed to be backed
up quickly with progress to secure still greater European
cooperation in other fields such as foreign affairs and defense.
	   Such talk of closer political integration, will fuel
euro-skeptic opinion in those countries that have stayed out of the
monetary union through fears of loosing national independence.
	   ``Britain must stay clear of this great fiasco,'' said Teddy
Taylor, a veteran lawmaker with Britain's opposition Conservative
Party.
	   Britain's Labor government has said it will try to persuade
voters to back joining the euro, probably early next decade.
Denmark's Finance Minister Marianne Jelved went a step further
Thursday, saying her country will likely hold a referendum on
joining before 2001.
	   Her Greek counterpart repeated his government's determination to
to join by Jan. 1, 2001.
	   ``Participation in the euro area will be the crowning of many
years of effort by the Greek people,'' said Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan government has offered the
United Nations its full cooperation in trying to reach the site of
a downed U.N.-chartered plane to determine the fate of the 14
people on board, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   The government announced its decision Thursday after repeated
appeals from the United Nations following last Saturday's crash
near the central highland city of Huambo, according to spokesman
Hamadoun Toure.
	   He declined to give further details.
	   Toure said there was no response yet from the UNITA rebel group,
engaged in fighting with the government's army in that area since
early this month.
	   UNITA Secretary-general Paulo Lukamba Gato said he had received
no request from the United Nations to allow the deployment of a
rescue team.
	   The rescue attempt and the renewed fighting were expected to be
discussed at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council
Thursday in New York.
	   The cause of the crash, which occurred as the C-130 transport
plane passed over a war zone, was not known.
	   Huambo lies about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda. Fighting also has focused on the nearby city of
Kuito.
	   ``There's a low-intensity war all over the country and a
high-intensity war around Huambo and Kuito. But there'll be a
crescendo in the next few days,'' Gato said in a telephone
interview from Bailundo, UNITA's central highland base. He declined
to elaborate.
	   The United Nations has started evacuating its staff from Huambo,
Angola's second-largest city, after a rebel artillery barrage that
killed at least eight people and wounded at least 20 civilians.
	   A diplomat, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity,
declined to say how many U.N. staff were in the central highland
city where fighting between the army and UNITA rebels has escalated
in recent days.
	   The International Red Cross said 20 wounded civilians were
admitted to the Huambo hospital after Wednesday's hour-long
bombardment by UNITA's long-range artillery.
	   A private radio station, Luanda Antena Comercial, said 12 people
died in the barrage. Another private station, Radio Eclesia, said
eight people were killed.
	   With the resumption of the civil war, the United Nations is
faced with the decision of whether to pull out some 1,000 troops in
its observer mission when its mandate expires on Feb. 26.
	   Gato complained that the U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, had
failed in his task of bringing the two sides together because he
had not held direct talks with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi for
months.
	   ``The United Nations can't even stop the government's war
machine. But we'll do that, that's our problem,'' Gato said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield control of areas under its control and
maintained a hidden army, according to the United Nations. The
fighting renewed when government troops tried to take the
strongholds by force and were beaten back.
	   Earlier this week, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
ruled out talks with UNITA on ending the fighting, and said Savimbi
was a liar for faking compliance with the 1994 peace pact.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

Arsenal manager rips Charlton player over red card
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has accused Charlton
midfielder Neil Redfearn of cheating to get Gunners' midfielder
Patrick Vieira sent off in a Premier League game last Monday.
	   Vieira received a red card at The Valley after Redfearn fell
down clutching his face after an apparent elbow by the Arsenal
midfielder.
	   Wenger said Thursday he is convinced after viewing replays that
Vieira only elbowed his opponent in the chest and that Redfearn
should be punished for play-acting and committing the initial foul,
a tackle from behind.
	   ``My thought is that Patrick didn't deserve to be sent off and
that Neil Redfearn cheated the referee,'' Wenger said. ``Usually I
think Redfearn is an honest type but on that occasion maybe
Charlton wanted so much to win the game that he was ready for
everything to get him sent off. I don't think his behavior was
fair.''
	   Wenger admitted that Vieira should have been shown the yellow
card for using his elbow to ``push back'' Redfearn, even though he
insists that the combative Frenchman is targeted by officials due
to his reputation.
	   ``If one of them should have had the red card, it is Redfearn,''
the French manager said. ``If the conclusion from that incident is
that Patrick has the red card and Redfearn the yellow, I don't see
the justice.
	   ``The first foul was from Redfearn and it was a very bad one as
it was from the back. The second thing is that he went down without
being touched.
	   ``This happened because it is Patrick but he's an honest player.
He's said he didn't want to hurt him, he just reacted to push the
arm away and he doesn't know what to do any more in a game.''
	   It was Vieira's fourth red card since joining Arsenal. He
received an automatic three-match ban for the offense.
	   Arsenal has asked referee Uriah Rennie to review the red card,
but Wenger said, ``He just seems not to care and thinks that he's
right.''
	   Redfearn insisted Thursday that his conscience was clear and
that he was not play-acting to get Vieira sent off during
Charlton's 1-0 defeat.
	   ``I didn't want Patrick to be sent off,'' he said. ``I would
never want to do that to a fellow professional. I think he's a
fantastic player and I'm disappointed how it's turned out.
	   ``I went down but I actually got straight back up, I didn't want
the lad to get sent off, no way. I actually got booked and I don't
know what for.''
	   Wenger condemned the growing number of incidents of diving and
feigning injury in the Premiership.
	   ``It's growing in England,'' he said. ``It's not huge compared
to other countries but it's becoming bigger and bigger, and there's
already more cases in the Premier League than in Division One.
	   ``Maybe some foreign players have brought more diving into the
country but some English players have picked it up very quickly.
	   ``I don't like it, whether it's an English player or a foreign
player. I like people who put their foot in and are aggressive on
the field but who don't behave like cheats.''

Fighting near capital reported in Sierra Leone

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Loyalist forces exchanged
artillery fire with rebel fighters near Sierra Leone's capital on
Thursday, amid reports the insurgents were advancing on the city
from the east.
	   Diplomats and Defense Ministry officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity said heavy shelling rocked the hills south of Freetown
near the Hastings military airfield.
	   An senior commander with the West African defense force known as
ECOMOG said the coalition force had driven the rebels back from
their positions in the hills.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties, but thousands of
civilians in the area fled to Freetown, about 20 kilometers (12
miles) to the north.
	   Rebel fighters from the Revolutionary United Front infiltrated
the hills in recent weeks and have been warning of an imminent
attack on the city itself.
	   The shelling comes as RUF rebels continued to push toward
Freetown from the east, where on Wednesday they reportedly overran
the town of Lunsar, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the
capital.
	   The ECOMOG commander denied Lunsar was under rebel control, but
said insurgent forces were in the area. The capital has been cut
off from large portions of Sierra Leone's east and north, where
rebel ambushes have made travel on the roads very hazardous.
	   The RUF has been making swift advances in recent days,
recapturing ground lost to ECOMOG since February, when they were
driven from Freetown after the ouster of Sierra Leone's military
junta.
	   The Nigerian-led West African force have been withdrawing from
positions in the countryside to consolidate defensive positions
around Freetown, a second ECOMOG official told The Associated Press
on condition he not be named.
	   ECOMOG troops were hailed as heroes in 10 months ago when they
drove the rebels and the junta from power. The coalition defense
force successfully battled the rebels away from the city and helped
restore the country's elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   Kabbah was deposed in a military coup in May 1997, but returned
to power in March of this year.
	   The rebel, waging an intermittent guerrilla war in the
countryside for the past seven years have been accused a widespread
atrocities. Countless villagers have been maimed, tortured or
murdered by the rebels, relief workers and missionaries say.
	   The rebels have demanded Kabbah resign and are calling for
mediation with the government through the Organization of African
Unity.

Status of U.S. goalkeeper uncertain with Leicester
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEICESTER, England (AP) _ U.S. goalkeeper Kasey Keller's future
at Premier League club Leicester remains uncertain heading into the
new year.
	   Keller has declined to sign a new contract offered by manager
Martin O'Neill earlier this season.
	   With his current contract expiring at the end of the season,
Keller is free to talk to other clubs starting Jan. 1. He is
eligible to leave Leicester on a free transfer next summer.
	   ``It is true that from tomorrow I can technically look around
for a new club _ but I am not actively looking for a move,'' Keller
said Thursday. ``As far as I am concerned I am playing here, with
Leicester City, at present and we will have to see what happens.
	   ``I am expecting to still have talks with the manager about a
new contract here and that's how things stand at the moment.''
	   O'Neill said he had not been contacted by any club about Keller.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's leaders proclaimed a new era
Thursday as 11 nations, including the continent's biggest economic
powers, merged currencies to create the euro, a shared money they
say will boost business, underpin unity and strengthen their role
in world affairs.
	   ``If the postwar era ended nine years ago with the fall of the
Berlin Wall, then our future begins on Jan. 1, 1999,'' German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wrote in the Handelsblatt business
daily.
	   At the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, after years of
preparation, the euro becomes the common currency of Germany,
France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal,
Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg.
	   The event was hailed as a historic turning point, creating a
powerful new force in the world economy and fulfilling the postwar
dreams of union among nations whose divisions twice this century
dragged the planet into its bloodiest wars.
	   ``Europe is finishing the century by sending a message of
peace,'' said Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi. ``The
conflicts that have so often gripped our continent are a thing of
the past.''
	   Finance ministers from the 11 nations gathered Thursday at
European Union headquarters in Brussels to fix exchange rates,
locking their currencies together to form the euro.
	   The new currency is worth 1.95583 German marks, 6.55957 French
francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386 Spanish pesetas. When markets
open after the long holiday weekend, the euro is expected to start
trading at about dlrs 1.17, 133 Japanese yen and 70 British pence.
	   The ministers celebrated by popping corks shaped like the euro's
``e'' symbol from nine-liter (18.9-pint) champagne bottles, then
schoolchildren launched 3,000 blue balloons into the gray skies
above Brussels.
	   Although euro notes and coins won't be issued to replace Irish
pounds, Portuguese escudos, Austrian schillings and the rest until
2002, the new currency will immediately come into use for non-cash
transactions ranging from government bond issues to simple credit
card purchases.
	   Thousands of financial sector workers were set to spend the New
Year's break adapting computer systems and trading floors to the
new currency and converting stocks, bonds and bank accounts into
euros.
	   From Thursday, francs, marks and the rest will no longer be
traded in foreign exchange markets. Equities and bonds will be
quoted in euros. Bank transfers and business deals will
increasingly be in the new money.
	   Participating nations say that all that will give a boost to
business by creating a seamless market of 292 million citizens were
companies can operate without exchange costs or currency jitters.
	   Representing 20 percent of world economic output and 18 percent
of world trade, the euro-zone will be a powerful player in the
world economy. For the first time in decades, the U.S. dollar will
have a rival as the currency of choice for world trade and
government reserves.
	   ``The euro becomes the strong arm of the strongest economic
region of the world,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said in
Vienna.
	   Euroland governments stressed the currency was about more than
just economics.
	   ``From Lisbon to Helsinki, from Paris to Vienna, the euro is a
remarkable symbol of our common identity,'' said French Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn. ``Tomorrow I won't be any less
French ... but we will all be a little more European.''
	   Although citizens will only fill their purses and pocketbooks
with euros in three years, they'll start to become familiar with
the new currency immediately. Euro figures will appear alongside
national currencies on pay checks, phone bills and bank statements.
	   The latest EU polls published in September showed 66 percent of
citizens in the euro-zone supporting the common currency.
	   ``This is a good moment, the future is with the euro,'' said
schoolteacher Blandine Barnier in the French city of Lyon, adding
that her 10-year-old pupils already know what to expect. ``The
children are really aware of the euro, they travel a lot around
Europe and know what it's about.''
	   From Jan. 1, consumers will see prices marked in euros making it
easier to shop across frontiers, and they'll be able to buy in
euros using checks or credit cards. But they'll still have to
change money for cross-border cash purchases.
	   Ministers stressed that the currency union needed to be backed
up quickly with progress to secure still greater European
cooperation in other fields such as foreign affairs and defense.
	   Such talk of closer political integration has kept euro-skeptics
wary, especially in the European countries that cited a loss of
sovereignty as a reason for staying out of the currency union for
now, such as Britain.
	   ``Britain must stay clear of this great fiasco,'' said Teddy
Taylor, a veteran lawmaker with Britain's opposition Conservative
Party.
	   Britain's Labor government has said it will try to persuade
voters to back joining the euro, probably early next decade.
Denmark's Finance Minister Marianne Jelved went a step further
Thursday, saying her country will likely hold a referendum on
joining before 2001.
	   Her counterpart in Greece, the only EU country failing to meet
financial requirements to join, repeated his government's
determination to join by Jan. 1, 2001.
	   ``Participation in the euro area will be the crowning of many
years of effort by the Greek people,'' said Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou.

Storm knocks down wall in Seville, killing four
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Part of a building facade crumbled during
a storm Thursday, killing four people waiting at a bus stop, police
said.
	   Winds gusting at up to 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph) sent
chunks of wall tumbling from a disused building that used to house
a market, police said.
	   The debris crushed a bus stop shelter, killing four people and
injuring at least one, Seville police said.
	   The storm was part of a New Year's Eve weather system whipping
up strong winds and torrential rain in much of Spain.
	   Elsewhere in Seville and the surrounding province, the storm
knocked down trees and triggered electrical blackouts, officials
said

 &UR; EDS: DELETES INCORRECT reference to Marianne &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France printed its first postage stamp denominated
in euros on Thursday several minutes after the official exchange
rate between the new single currency and the franc was announced.
	   The new stamp, worth 3 francs or .46 euros, has a red background
with the ``e'' that symbolizes the euro present in white along with
the euro value. The value in French francs is printed in blue.
	   The new stamps were to be delivered Thursday evening to France's
main post offices. The stamp will be on sale New Year's day at the
Postal Museum in Paris.
	   The rest of the country will have to wait until Saturday when
the post office reopens after the New Year's holiday to purchase
their first stamps in euros.
	   During 1999, the French post office plans to stop making stamps
denominated only in francs and introduce stamps with both the franc
and the euro value.
	   In the year 2002, when the franc disappears altogether, stamps
will be denominated only in euros.

United Nations convenes emergency session on Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council called an emergency
meeting Thursday to demand the Angolan government and particularly
UNITA rebels let a U.N. team reach the site of a downed
U.N.-chartered plane.
	   The council was debating a draft resolution which condemns
inaction on both sides in trying to determine the fate of the 14
people on board the C-130 cargo plane, which crashed Saturday over
the central highlands of the southwestern African nation.
	   After repeated appeals, the Angolan government on Thursday
offered the United Nations full cooperation in trying to reach the
crash site, which is in contested territory, according to U.N.
spokesman Hamadoun Toure, in the Angolan capital, Luanda.
	   A draft resolution, which could be adopted as early as Thursday
afternoon, makes a vague threat of taking further action by Jan.
11, but doesn't provide explicitly for any military intervention.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, however, warned that the
1,000-member U.N. Observer Mission in Angola could be withdrawn by
February if fighting doesn't stop.
	   The meeting came as the United Nations began evacuating staff
from Huambo, Angola's second-largest city, after a rebel artillery
barrage that killed at least eight people and wounded at least 20
civilians. The plane went down near Huambo, 300 miles (500
kilometers) southeast of Luanda.
	   The United Nations mediated Angola's 1994 peace accord, which
ended a two-decade civil war. Since 1997, U.N. observers have been
overseeing its implementation.
	   The draft resolution asks both sides to ``clarify the
circumstances of this tragedy and to permit the prompt dispatch of
a United Nations search and rescue mission.''
	   It demands in particular that UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
immediately give the U.N. team safety guarantees to search the
site.
	   And it expresses its concern at the increase in such incidents
since fighting in the onetime Cold War battle zone resumed.
	   The council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for the return
to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield areas under its control and maintained a
hidden army, according to the United Nations. The fighting resumed
when government troops tried to take the strongholds by force and
were beaten back.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan government has offered the
United Nations its full cooperation in trying to reach the site of
a downed U.N.-chartered plane to determine the fate of the 14
people on board, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   The government announced its decision Thursday after repeated
appeals from the United Nations following last Saturday's crash
near the central highland city of Huambo, according to spokesman
Hamadoun Toure.
	   He declined to give further details.
	   Toure said there was no response yet from the UNITA rebel group,
engaged in fighting with the government's army in that area since
early this month.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said he had received
no request from the United Nations to allow the deployment of a
rescue team.
	   The rescue attempt and the renewed fighting were expected to be
discussed at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council
Thursday in New York.
	   The cause of the crash, which occurred as the C-130 transport
plane passed over a war zone, was not known.
	   Huambo lies about 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the
capital, Luanda. Fighting also has focused on the nearby city of
Kuito.
	   ``There's a low-intensity war all over the country and a
high-intensity war around Huambo and Kuito. But there'll be a
crescendo in the next few days,'' Gato said in a telephone
interview from Bailundo, UNITA's central highland base. He declined
to elaborate.
	   The United Nations has started evacuating its staff from Huambo,
Angola's second-largest city, after a rebel artillery barrage that
killed at least eight people and wounded at least 20 civilians.
	   A diplomat, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity,
declined to say how many U.N. staff were in the central highland
city where fighting between the army and UNITA rebels has escalated
in recent days.
	   The International Red Cross said 20 wounded civilians were
admitted to the Huambo hospital after Wednesday's hour-long
bombardment by UNITA's long-range artillery.
	   A private radio station, Luanda Antena Comercial, said 12 people
died in the barrage. Another private station, Radio Eclesia, said
eight people were killed.
	   With the resumption of the civil war, the United Nations is
faced with the decision of whether to pull out some 1,000 troops in
its observer mission when its mandate expires on Feb. 26.
	   Gato complained that the U.N. envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, had
failed in his task of bringing the two sides together because he
had not held direct talks with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi for
months.
	   ``The United Nations can't even stop the government's war
machine. But we'll do that, that's our problem,'' Gato said.
	   The U.N. Security Council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym
for the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for
the return to war.
	   UNITA refused to cede the areas it controlled and maintained a
hidden army, according to the United Nations. The fighting renewed
when government troops tried to take the strongholds by force and
were beaten back.
	   Earlier this week, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
ruled out talks with UNITA on ending the fighting, and said Savimbi
was a liar for faking compliance with the 1994 peace pact.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Rescue teams interrupted a search for
possible survivors late Thursday after a boat carrying illegal
immigrants sank in the eastern Aegean Sea, authorities said.
	   At least two people drowned and 10 others were reported missing
when the wooden vessel took on water and sank in rough seas, the
merchant marine ministry said.
	   Ships in the area and port authority vessels rescued two Greek
sailors, one Yugoslav and 21 men from Pakistan, India, Rwanda and
Iraq who had been on board the 17-meter (56-foot) Italian-flagged
Mustang.
	   The search, aided by a helicopter, will resume early Friday.
	   News reports said the two Greek sailors and the Yugoslav man had
been arrested to face charges of migrant smuggling. Survivors told
local media they had each agreed to pay dlrs 1,500 to be
transported from the Turkish coast to Greece.
	   The identity and nationality of the two victims were not known.
Survivors where hospitalized on the nearby island of Kos, all in
good condition.
	   A distress signal was issued from the boat at around 5:30 a.m.
(0330 GMT) before it sank off the island of Nissiros, near the
Turkish coast and about 320 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of
Athens, authorities said.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants, mostly Iraqi Kurds,
attempt each year to cross from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek
islands. Many are arrested and deported, but others apply for
asylum in Greece and are taken to refugee camps while their
applications are processed.
	   Hundreds find work clandestinely in Greece or move on to Italy
to make their way to other European countries.

represent a new political structure.

	   Giornale del Popolo, Lugano, Switzerland, on Clinton
impeachment:
	   The long-term consequences of the crisis in the U.S. presidency
and the final phase of the euro's introduction will probably be the
most important elements of world news in 1999.
	   John Kennedy, to give an illustrious example, was no less
unfaithful to his wife and no less given to amorous adventures than
Bill Clinton.
	   However, this disorder in his private life had no effect
whatsoever on his political career. ...
	   Clinton, in contrast, risks spending the last year of his
presidency fighting his impeachment, brought about by a legal
ambush launched by his Republican enemies. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Mirror, London, on rescue attempt in Yemen:
	   Why did it end so tragically? In the bloody wake of the Yemeni
kidnapping catastrophe, that is the question crying out for an
answer. The region has been plagued by kidnappings but they have
invariably been resolved peacefully. The authorities in the past
acted with tact, and the kidnappers appeared almost moderate in
their demands. Sometimes they called for nothing more outrageous
than better schools and hospitals. Early yesterday, Britain's
ambassador in the Yemen said he expected the hostages to be
well-treated. So what went so terribly wrong? Was outside pressure
put on the authorities to take swift action? ... Was this a
courageous rescue attempt that averted greater loss of life, or a
terrible and avoidable blunder? For the moment the families of the
victims will be too stunned to ask such questions. But sooner
rather than later they will be asked. Then they must be answered.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Express, London, on rescue attempt in Yemen:
	   Neither the British nor the Yemeni governments come out of
yesterday's tragedy in the Middle East well. The Foreign Office
seemed to be in the dark about the events which led to the killing
of the tourists and left it up to the tour company which arranged
their visit to contact the relatives of those held hostage. As
events went horribly wrong, officials were unable to shed any light
on what had happened.
	   For their part, the Yemenis gave muddled accounts. ... The
families of those murdered deserve at the very least a clear
account of what happened. It would be better if it came from the
Yemeni or British government rather than, belatedly, the released
hostages.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Telegraph, London, on the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race:
	   The news from Australia for British sportsmen encompassed the
extremes of triumph and tragedy yesterday. In Melbourne, the
England (cricket) team snatched a glorious Test victory from what
had seemed certain defeat. In Tasmania, meanwhile, the death toll
in the Sydney-Hobart yacht race was officially declared to have
reached six, including one Briton, the Olympic sailor Glyn Charles.
	   That the race turned into a tragedy should not be allowed to
obscure the bravery both of those who took part and those who
mounted one of the most extensive and professional air-sea rescue
operations ever when the storm struck. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Guardian, London, on Iraq:
	   The bombing of Iraq has shattered more than anti-aircraft
batteries, Republican Guards barracks, and tank repair shops. It
has shattered the established policies of the U.S. and of Iraq.
America's policy of containment through inspection lies in ruins.
Iraq's policy of breaking out of sanctions through cooperation and
concealment is a thing of the past. Its demands have grown to the
point where it seems about to repudiate the legitimacy of any
constraints on its behavior at all. Its decision to fire on U.S.
and British planes patrolling the no-fly zones shows Baghdad in a
confrontation which can only undermine its diplomatic objectives.
...
	    &UR; ___
	   Frankfurter Rundschau, Frankfurt, Germany, on Iraq:
	   No goal, nothing. At least not a political one, and still
continuously new targets are sighted in on. The war in the Gulf
continues as a military skirmish. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein
makes good on his threats not to stick any longer to rules laid on
by the United Nations or the (NATO) alliance. ... He anticipates
that (the sanctions) will never be lifted _ at least not as long as
he sits at the lever of power, if the United States has its way.
... Politically strengthened through operation ``Desert Fox,''
which was supposed to punish him, he no longer recognizes the
no-flight zones in north and south Iraq and sees the flight patrols
as acts of espionage. And the United States? They let themselves
become so upset by him that they immediately hit back _ just as
Saddam wanted. Now he can again advertise for himself, not only in
his own country, but also amongst the neighbors, who watch the U.S.
action in Iraq with astonishment and recognize no political policy,
but only blind revenge.

	   Algemeen Dagblad, Rotterdam, Netherlands, on Cambodia:
	   It is unacceptable that the Cambodian mass murderers Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea can enjoy their old age without punishment.
These associates of the bloodthirsty Pol Pot, who masterminded the
killings of almost 2 million Cambodians in the 1970s, must not be
allowed to escape with their empty apology. ... The Cambodian
premier Hun Sen actually embraced these representatives of one of
the most gruesome regimes in history and promised them amnesty. ...
The international community must not accept Hun Sen's indulgence of
these villains. The government in Phnom Penh, which cannot survive
without foreign aid, must be pressed to punish Pol Pot's cronies
for their insane crimes.
	    &UR; ___
	   South China Morning Post, Hong Kong, on Khmer Rouge defection:
	   With the defection of its two remaining political leaders, Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea, the Khmer Rouge is dead. The question now,
for both Cambodia and the world community, is whether to let it
rest in peace or to exhume its old crimes before an international
tribunal. Should a group of old men be allowed to live out their
days in peace for the sake of national reconciliation, or be tried
for genocide and crimes against humanity? ...
	   National reconciliation may not be possible without putting a
few Khmer Rouge leaders on trial. Too many Cambodians suffered at
their hands to allow them to get away scot free. But the trials
must be conducted with a certain humility, and with the recognition
that this is the victor's justice, in which not all those
responsible will ever come to trial.
	    &UR; ____
	   Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo, on missile defense scheme:
	   The government has formally decided to launch Japan-U.S. joint
research and development on the theater missile defense (TMD)
scheme.
	   The introduction of the TMD system, which is meant to shoot down
an enemy's ballistic missiles after being launched, for example,
from ships equipped with the AEGIS air-defense system, should be
considered for the country to establish an airtight defense system.
	   In light of the uncertain security situation in areas
surrounding our nation, including the Korean Peninsula, Japan needs
to quickly proceed with the TMD system. ...
	   The launching of the joint Japan-U.S. technological research
itself indicates clearly both at home and abroad the strong will of
Japan and the United States in stopping the development and
proliferation of missiles. And the system itself should deter the
development and possession of missiles by other countries.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Nacion, Buenos Aires, on U.S. armed forces pay:
	   Bidding to avert the loss of its most talented U.S. servicemen,
the Pentagon has sent the ... government a proposal to raise wages
of officers, junior officers and enlisted personnel. The proposed
increase is on the order of 9.9 percent. If the proposal were to be
adopted, it would represent the greatest increase since president
Ronald Reagan decided in 1982 to raise salaries 14.3 percent for
officers and junior officers, and 17 percent for enlisted
personnel. The intention ... is to make careers in the armed forces
attractive to the most qualified in the population and allow
selectivity in recruiting. ... Argentine society, which still has
not resolved key questions in relation with its armed forces,
should take note of the decision making at the Pentagon ... as one
more point of reference on the road to restructuring its military
institutions.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Bangkok Post, Bangkok, Thailand, on the death of Islamic
extremist:
	   Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani has been the most wanted man in the
Philippines for more than four years. He and his followers have
killed, injured or disrupted the lives of thousands of fellow
Filipinos since Janjalani returned to the Philippines from the
Middle East about nine years ago. He died in what appeared to be a
routine police patrol in the southern Philippines.
	   Janjalani led Abu Sayyaf _ Bearer of The Sword. ... It has
surely received aid from Libya and has had direct relations with
members of the Osama bin Laden group based in Afghanistan. Abu
Sayyaf also is believed by the Philippines military to have
provided aid to Ramzi Yousef, the Pakistani who planned to kill the
Pope and blow up 12 U.S. civilian airliners in one day from his
Manila base.
	   President (Jose) Estrada came to office in May with a promise to
coordinate closely with southern Filipinos. He has shown sympathy
for their demands for more home rule, although he has so far
implemented few of his election promises, such as more scholarships
for Muslim youths.
	   The death of Janjalani is a new opportunity for the government.
Mr. Estrada and his administration should move quickly as deeply
into the southern areas as possible. The government is fortunate to
have a recent record of accommodation with Muslim community leaders
with which to appeal to the southerners. Janjalani's death provides
a window of time to start to marginalize the violent Abu Sayyaf and
blunt its appeal to disillusioned people.

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Iraq:
	   In the initial days of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in the summer
of 1990, the Iraqi president made his troop withdrawal from the
oil-rich emirate contingent on Israel's withdrawal from the
occupied Arab territories. In those days the linkage was very
popular and reasonable to many in the Arab world.
	   Today, as we come to the end of 1998, in the Arab mind this
linkage is still relevant.
	   And today while the U.S. and Britain insist that the sanctions
on Iraq will not be lifted before all of Baghdad's weapons of mass
destruction are eliminated, the Arabs counter by demanding that all
WMDs in the region be removed, an illusion to Israel's massive
arsenal.
	   No matter how justified and politically correct the Arab region
demands are, the United States and its strategic ally in the
region, Israel, are not about to agree with Arab arguments because
the United States is the sole superpower and Israel is the sole
regional power and because the Arabs are divided and weak.
	   While we agree that the new World Order is unjust and unfair, we
think that such brutal order cannot be positively influenced by
defiance. Great powers like China, France and Russia do not agree
with the way the U.S. runs world affairs. They know very well that
if they challenge it, they will lose. That is why they engage U.S.
hegemony in a constructive manner. the least we should do is learn
from them.

	   The Business Times, Singapore, on Indonesia:
	   As 1988 comes to a close, Indonesia stands on the brink of a
complete collapse in its social order and a meltdown of its
political institutions as rioting and looting continue to wreak
havoc across the archipelago. ...
	   The armed forces _ once the only institution capable of
maintaining law and order _ seem paralyzed. ...
	   What began as an economic crisis 18 months ago has developed
into the most serious challenge to the country's social and
political fabric since the 1960s, akin to the chaotic months before
the downfall of the country's founding president Sukarno. ...
	   Restoring social order is not only crucial for Indonesia but
also for the rest of the region because, if the country falls
apart, it will have a lasting impact on the political and economic
stability of Southeast Asia. If President (B.J.) Habibie is not
able to put his house in order, international investors will remain
wary about committing large projects to the region for fear of the
political and social turmoil spilling over into neighboring
countries.

	   Albuquerque Journal, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Olympic
bribery:
	   It is an unlikely venue for a bribery scandal: Salt Lake City
Olympic organizers are alleged to have used bribery and the
services of influence-peddlers to land the 2002 Winter Games.
	   The International Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee have launched inquiries into reports that a scholarship
fund run by the Utah bid committee had benefited IOC members and
their relatives, and that expensive gifts ... were part of the
consideration. The stakes went up with the announcement that a
federal criminal investigation had also been launched. ...
	   The stakes are high, for the main stock in trade of the Olympics
is its image as the embodiment of clean, fair athletic competition
among the nations of the world. That image is the drawing card for
the corporate sponsorships and public viewing interest that
generate the money to run the Olympic organization. ...
	   The various investigations should be conducted with the
intention that anything suggesting criminal activity be followed to
its logical conclusion. Only a thorough and credible investigation
taken to a credible end result and shared exhaustively with the
public can mitigate the damage these allegations will do to the
future of the Olympic Games.

	   The Dominion Post, Morgantown, West Virginia, on the space
program:
	   In space, no one can hear you scream; on Earth, Congress should.
	   OK, we'll accept that John Glenn's shuttle mission provided a
few feel-good moments about the status of our nation's space
program. ...
	   Ironically, the very next shuttle mission showed that the folks
who run the National Aeronautics and Space Administration still
have too many of this nation's space projects farther out into
orbit than John Glenn ever will go.
	   Take, for example, the latest shuttle mission, in which a crew
of American astronauts aboard the shuttle Endeavour linked up with
the first module of a Soviet vessel and installed another module
that eventually is designed to serve as an orbiting space station.
...
	   So far, Russia's inability to meet deadlines and finance its own
obligations to the space station have cost American taxpayers more
than dlrs 2 billion.
	   And there's more trouble on the horizon. The latest Russian
budget under debate in the parliament allocates dlrs 143 million
for space research. While that's not a paltry amount, it's not
nearly enough to meet the dlrs 270 million cost for the next
Russian obligation to the space station. ...
	   When the 106th Congress debates the next NASA budget, it should
resist the urge to bail the Russians out by sticking U.S. taxpayers
with Russia's failure to meet its obligations.
	   If that kills the space station project, so be it.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach, Florida, on the Middle
East:
	   Benjamin Netanyahu tried to please all sides in Israel. Not
surprisingly, he ended up pleasing none of them.
	   After two years of trying to carry out the Oslo peace agreement
while presiding over a government dependent on parties completely
opposed to the agreement, the Israeli prime minister gave up ...
and agreed to new elections.
	   His decision to attempt the impossible cost valuable time,
damaged relations with the Palestinians and the United States and
rewarded the terrorist who killed Mr. Netanyahu's courageous
predecessor. ...
	   Like Republicans in Congress, who can't govern because a
narrow-minded minority holds the balance of power, Mr. Netanyahu
didn't succeed because he regularly worried about appeasing
ultra-Orthodox members of the Knesset who provided his one-vote
majority.
	   Polls indicate that 70 percent of Israelis favor trading lands
for peace. Mr. Netanyahu said he could deliver a deal the country
could trust. No prime minister can do that if he tries to please
everyone.
	    &UR; ___
	   Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, on U.S. policy on Iraq:
	   President Clinton must do something his predecessors never
could. He must develop a meaningful, consistent, long-term policy
for dealing with that nation.
	   It's inadequate, and possibly unrealistic, to define the United
States' aim as ousting Saddam Hussein. The publicly stated policy
of toppling Saddam faces practical obstacles.
	   The most obvious is that it hurts our negotiating power. Saddam
has no reason to comply with U.N. sanctions or U.S. requests if
we're seeking to overthrow him no matter what he does.
	   Furthermore, Saddam appears to be solidly entrenched. The Iraqi
opposition is divided, weak and little match for Saddam's
willingness to use brutal force and paranoia to hold his regime
together and eradicate his foes. ...
	   With these realities in mind, the United States must put more
emphasis on developing a long-term plan for dealing with Saddam,
with Iraq and with the Middle East. ...

	   LONDON (AP) _ Europe geared up Thursday night for a
high-spirited welcome to the last year of the second millennium, as
partygoers took to the streets of their capital cities.
	   In Scotland, where New Year's is called Hogmanay and is
raucously celebrated, Edinburgh laid on pop concerts, a bagpipe
player and fireworks.
	   ``It is going to be really, really busy. Everything is sold out,
and everybody is going to party, whatever the weather,'' said Liz
Smith, from the city's New Year's organizing committee.
	   More than 6,000 cheerleaders and bandsmen have flown in from the
United States for London's New Year's Day parade on Friday.
	   Cardiff, Wales, organized a three-day Celtic event reviving the
tradition of giving gifts at New Year's. The event includes a
funfair, a lantern procession, live bands and a fireworks display.
	   In Vienna on Thursday, 2,600 runners turned out for the city's
annual 5.4 kilometer (3.3 mile) run along the city's
``ringstrasse,'' the street that encircles the heart of the city.
	   In taped messages, some of the world's political leaders urged
their peoples to end sectarian strike, and to have hope in the
future.
	   In his last New Year's message before leaving office, President
Nelson Mandela on Thursday challenged South Africans to continue
working together to solve the problems of poverty and corruption,
legacies of the apartheid decades.
	   ``The New Year will bring many changes,'' Mandela said in the
four-minute broadcast message. ``They will depend on our working
together to realize our dream.''
	   In a message broadcast across nine time zones, Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin called on Russians to meet 1999 with
optimism and pride in their country.
	   ``What can I say: The year was difficult for the country, for
many of you, and for me, too. But New Year's Eve is always about
new hopes, new dreams, new plans,'' Yeltsin said, according to a
transcript released by the Interfax news agency.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern spoke of the Good
Friday peace agreement in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   ``The fantastic support of people .. for an agreed Ireland of
dialogue, mutual respect and common endeavor is the surest
guarantee yet that we will succeed in making this an island of
peace and prosperity for all - especially for our children,'' Ahern
said.
	   A continent away and hours earlier, Asians welcomed the Year of
the Rabbit with displays of fireworks, official speeches and late
night pilgrimages to sacred shrines and temples.
	   Millions of Australians bid farewell to 1998 by watching a U.S.
dlrs 1.2 million fireworks extravaganza that bathed the harborside
Sydney Opera House in pulses of green, red and blue light.
	   Sydney celebrates every major holiday and event with fireworks,
but New Year's Eve is a pyrotechnic orgy, and this year's barrage
was a dress rehearsal for upcoming sky shows to mark next year's
welcome for the year 2000, and the summer Olympic Games in
September 2000.
	   In central Tokyo, crowds thronged Zojoji temple just before
midnight, waiting for a Buddhist monk to strike the temple bell 108
times to dispel the evils of the past year and usher in good luck
for the new year.
	   In much of Asia, 1999 is the Year of the Rabbit, and Tokyo's
department stores were well stocked with calendars, cards and
knickknacks bearing rabbit images.
	   For many Chinese, New Year's Eve is not nearly as important an
occasion as the Lunar New Year on Feb. 16 when hundreds of millions
of people head home for family reunions.
	   Still, television and radio audiences heard a rare live prime
time address by China's President Jiang Zemin, who was upbeat in
summing up 1998 and urged his people to be confident about the
future.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Rescue teams interrupted a search for
possible survivors late Thursday after a boat carrying illegal
immigrants sank in the eastern Aegean Sea, authorities said.
	   At least two people drowned and 10 others were reported missing
when the wooden vessel took on water and sank in rough seas, the
merchant marine ministry said.
	   Ships in the area and port authority vessels rescued two Greek
sailors, one Yugoslav and 21 men from Pakistan, India, Rwanda and
Iraq who had been on board the 17-meter (56-foot) Italian-flagged
Mustang.
	   The search, aided by a helicopter, will resume early Friday.
	   News reports said the two Greek sailors and the Yugoslav man had
been arrested to face charges of migrant smuggling. Survivors told
local media they had each agreed to pay dlrs 1,500 to be
transported from the Turkish coast to Greece.
	   The identity and nationality of the two victims were not known.
Survivors where hospitalized on the nearby island of Kos, all in
good condition.
	   A distress signal was issued from the boat at around 5:30 a.m.
(0330 GMT) before it sank off the island of Nissiros, near the
Turkish coast and about 320 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of
Athens, authorities said.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants, mostly Iraqi Kurds,
attempt each year to cross from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek
islands. Many are arrested and deported, but others apply for
asylum in Greece and are taken to refugee camps while their
applications are processed.
	   Hundreds find work clandestinely in Greece or move on to Italy
to make their way to other European countries.

Chiapas officials investigate guards in prison breaks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with guards being questioned, CORRECTS that 17 sted 16
inmates escaped &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Twelve prison guards
were being questioned Thursday by state authorities investigating
three separate prison breaks in southern Chiapas state.
	   Of the 17 inmates who escaped Wednesday in the towns of
Simojovel, Playas de Catazaja and Ocosingo, 12 remained at large.
All the fleeing inmates were serving time for homicide and other
major felonies.
	   State Attorney General Eduardo Montoya blamed negligence or
possible complicity by guards in the three prisons.
	   The first break occurred early Wednesday when two inmates
serving time for murder fled the jail in Simojovel, in the northern
part of the state.
	   Montoya said the guards there told investigators 10 armed men
wearing ski masks, like those used by Zapatista National Liberation
Army rebels, freed the two prisoners. Montoya said he doubted the
account, but the daily Reforma reported that witnesses confirmed
seeing the masked men.
	   Officials have assigned an additional 100 police officers to
each of the state's 23 prisons, fearing further violence on Jan. 1,
the fifth anniversary of the Zapatista uprising.
	   The Zapatista National Liberation Army began a brief uprising
Jan. 1, 1994, demanding more democracy and better conditions for
the state's poverty-ridden indigenous population. Peace
negotiations have been stalled since 1996.
	   Also Wednesday, nine convicts escaped during a prison mutiny in
Playas de Catazaja. The prisoners rioted to protest the lack of
drinking water. Guards opened fire and captured five of the
inmates, four of whom were wounded.
	   At about the same time, five inmates walked out of the prison in
Ososingo, a town in the jungle in the southern part of the state,
without anyone doing anything to stop them, he said.

Pope: New Year a countdown to Christianity's 2000 Jubilee

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Pope John Paul II was counting down to 2000 _ not
1999 _ on his New Year's Eve, reminding Rome and the Roman Catholic
Church they had one year left to get ready for Christianity's
millennium jubilee.
	   John Paul delivered his year-end hymn of thanksgiving in Rome's
sumptuous rococo Church of St. Ignatius, looking ahead to what the
visiting millions would find in their jubilee-year pilgrimages
here.
	   ``In a year's time, we will already be in the holy year and
numerous pilgrims will be starting to arrive from every corner of
the Earth,'' he said.
	   ``I wish from my heart that they will be welcomed by a church
alive and rich in religious fervor; a church generous and sensible
toward the needs of mankind, especially the poor and those in
need.''
	   As is traditional, John Paul's listeners for the year-end
vespers service were a black-tie-and-fur crowd made up of many of
the church and civic leaders of Rome, including Mayor Francesco
Rutelli.
	   Much of their city is now shrouded in scaffolding and road-work
barriers in preparation for the 20 million or more pilgrims
expected for the jubilee year.
	   Speaking to _ and for _ them, John Paul said, ``I make a pledge
that our city will make its jubilee appointment fundamentally
renovated in all dimensions of spiritual and social life.''
	   John Paul is to inaugurate the jubilee on Christmas Eve 1999 and
close it on Epiphany, Jan. 6, 2000.
	   Although more stooped by the day, the 78-year-old pontiff seemed
to have no problems during Thursday's more than hourlong service.
Crowds greeted him outside, yelling out ``Happy New Year!'' and
``Best Wishes!'' to the pope, who stopped to press the hands of a
few.
	   The service followed days of rest after Christmas services. John
Paul's holiday schedule continues Friday with a New Year's
appearance at St. Peter's Basilica.

Single currency reaches beyond the founding eleven nations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-The Euro &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A switch to the ``euro'' affects a
handful of places _ including Monaco, the Vatican and a pair of
tiny islands off the coast of Canada _ that deal in currencies
eventually to be replaced.
	   The Vatican and the Republic of San Marino are microstates
located wholly within Italy and use the Italian lira as their
currency.
	   Monaco, a tiny principality on France's Mediterranean coast,
uses the franc. So do the French territories of St. Pierre and
Miquelon, home to about 7,000 people off Newfoundland, and Mayotte
in the Indian Ocean.
	   Italy and France have adopted the euro, as the European Union's
new single currency is known. That left these various places, none
of them members of the European Union, in an uncertain situation.
	   EU finance ministers have decided they can use the single
European currency under certain conditions.
	   San Marino, the Vatican and Monaco will be entitled to use the
euro as their official currency. However, they must agree to adopt
EU currency rules and cooperate closely on measures to curb
counterfeiting.
	   With regard to the French territories off Newfoundland and the
coast of Madagascar, the ministers decided they will adopt the euro
and that France will continue to grant legal status to their
banknotes and coins. France will be required to pass national
legislation putting these monetary arrangements into law.

Chirac salutes euro in New Year's address
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Europe's new currency has opened a new era that
offers France a chance for a better standard of living, President
Jacques Chirac told his nation in a New Year's address Thursday.
	   ``Europe already has a long history. And it has a long road
ahead. More and more, it will be our everyday life,'' Chirac said.
``The euro will change Europe and above all people's mentalities.''
	   Chirac's New Year's address was broadcast on French television
on Thursday night following the announcement earlier in Brussels of
the rate that fixed the franc and 10 other currencies to the euro.
	   The euro becomes reality at midnight, uniting the currencies of
the 11 participating countries. It will be used for cashless
transactions until 2002 when it will replace national currencies.
	   ``For us French, it's a chance,'' said Chirac, speaking of the
new currency. ``The euro will give us more choice in our purchases,
lower prices and new markets, new possibilities of investment and
therefore jobs. It will bring us more stability in an uncertain
world.''
	   Chirac, who was once one of France's most prominent
euroskeptics, has now become a firm backer of the new currency that
could one day rival the dollar.
	   ``It will bring us more stability in an uncertain world. More
force in the face of great economic poles that are developing on
the planet,'' Chirac said.
	   To take advantage of the new opportunities offered by the euro,
Chirac called on his countrymen to be more innovative, told them
that taxes would have to be lowered, and focus on high technology.
	   ``That is how we should construct our future. It's a great
ambition, a reasonable ambition and it's mine.''

Slovakia's Jevtic wins women's race

 &UR; EDS: WILL be UPDATED with men's race scheduled for 1900 GMT start. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Olivera Jevtic of Slovakia beat
two-time and defending champion Martha Tenorio of Ecuador by 20
seconds Thursday and bested a field of about 1,000 to win the
women's division of the annual St. Silvester.
	   Jevtic took the lead for good with 3 kilometers to go and slowly
consolidated her lead to the finish.
	   The 21-year-old European completed the 15-kilometer (9.3-mile)
course through the wide avenues and tiny streets of Sao Paulo in 51
minutes, 35 seconds for a top prize of dlrs 10,000.
	   Tenorio followed in second with Kenya's Jane Wanjiku Ngotho
third, 67 seconds further behind.
	   Erika Alejandro de la Fuente of Chile was fourth in 53:33, 23
seconds ahead of Brazil's Cleuza Maria Irineu.
	   Shortly after the race, a panting and heavily perspiring Jevtic
grinned broadly and threw kisses to the crowd,
	   ``I am very pleased and I expect to come back next year,''
Jevtic said.
	   Brazil's Marizete de Paula Rezende shot ahead when the race
began under partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 38 degrees
Celsius (100 Fahrenheit).
	   The relatively unknown Resende staying out front for the first 2
kilometers, but then was overtaken by a group including Jevtic,
Tenorio and Ngotho.
	   For several kilometers, the trio ran together and quickly placed
more than 40 meters between themselves and their nearest rivals.
	   By the 10th kilometer, it became clear that one of the three
would win.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Europe geared up Thursday night for a
high-spirited welcome to the last year of the second millennium, as
partygoers took to the streets of their capital cities.
	   In Scotland, where New Year's is called Hogmanay and is
raucously celebrated, Edinburgh laid on pop concerts, a bagpipe
player and fireworks.
	   ``It is going to be really, really busy. Everything is sold out,
and everybody is going to party, whatever the weather,'' said Liz
Smith, from the city's New Year's organizing committee.
	   More than 6,000 cheerleaders and bandsmen have flown in from the
United States for London's New Year's Day parade on Friday.
	   Cardiff, Wales, organized a three-day Celtic event reviving the
tradition of giving gifts at New Year's. The event includes a
funfair, a lantern procession, live bands and a fireworks display.
	   Berlin organized an open air party at the Brandenburg Gate, with
about 100 singers and performers, followed by a fireworks show at
midnight.
	   Things were a little quieter in Frankfurt, headquarters of the
new European Central Bank that will set monetary policy from the
stroke of midnight for the 11 nations sharing a single currency.
Lights shone from the windows of bank skyscrapers as employees
worked to refigure computer records, but firecrackers popped and
fizzed in the streets.
	   In taped messages, some of the world's political leaders urged
their peoples to end sectarian strike, and to have hope in the
future.
	   In his last New Year's message before leaving office, President
Nelson Mandela on Thursday challenged South Africans to continue
working together to solve the problems of poverty and corruption,
legacies of the apartheid decades.
	   ``The New Year will bring many changes,'' Mandela said in the
four-minute broadcast message. ``They will depend on our working
together to realize our dream.''
	   In a message broadcast across nine time zones, Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin called on Russians to meet 1999 with
optimism and pride in their country.
	   ``What can I say: The year was difficult for the country, for
many of you, and for me, too. But New Year's Eve is always about
new hopes, new dreams, new plans,'' Yeltsin said, according to a
transcript released by the Interfax news agency.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern spoke of the Good
Friday peace agreement in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   ``The fantastic support of people .. for an agreed Ireland of
dialogue, mutual respect and common endeavor is the surest
guarantee yet that we will succeed in making this an island of
peace and prosperity for all - especially for our children,'' Ahern
said.
	   A continent away and hours earlier, Asians welcomed the Year of
the Rabbit with displays of fireworks, official speeches and late
night pilgrimages to sacred shrines and temples.
	   Millions of Australians bid farewell to 1998 by watching a U.S.
dlrs 1.2 million fireworks extravaganza that bathed the harborside
Sydney Opera House in pulses of green, red and blue light.
	   Sydney celebrates every major holiday and event with fireworks,
but New Year's Eve is a pyrotechnic orgy, and this year's barrage
was a dress rehearsal for upcoming sky shows to mark next year's
welcome for the year 2000, and the summer Olympic Games in
September 2000.
	   In central Tokyo, crowds thronged Zojoji temple just before
midnight, waiting for a Buddhist monk to strike the temple bell 108
times to dispel the evils of the past year and usher in good luck
for the new year.
	   In much of Asia, 1999 is the Year of the Rabbit, and Tokyo's
department stores were well stocked with calendars, cards and
knickknacks bearing rabbit images.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Outspoken Sports Minister
Steve Tshwete met with the South African cricket federation's top
official for an hour Thursday, after repeating past denunciations
that the national team doesn't have enough non-whites.
	   Ali Bacher, managing director of the United Cricket Board, said
in a telephone interview that he met with Tshwete at Fort Beaufort,
150 kilometers (90 miles) north east of Port Elizabeth in the
Eastern Cape Province.
	   But he refused to give details, saying he will release a
statement Friday.
	   Tshwete could not be reached for comment.
	   Bacher stood firm on Wednesday after both Tshwete and National
Sports Council president Mluleki George castigated the board for
choosing a team with only three players of color, a daily newspaper
in Johannesburg, Business Day, reported Thursday.
	   The team was announced after South Africa won the third of its
five test matches against West Indies on Tuesday and clinched the
series. It includes as non-whites Paul Adams, Herschelle Gibbs and
Ashwell Prince.
	   ``Once I have spoken to (Tshwete), I am sure he will feel
happier about the direction we are taking,'' Bacher was quoted as
saying in Business Day. ``The minister has been very good to
cricket over the years and I want to reassure him that we have no
intention of letting him down in terms of our transformation.''
	   Earlier this month, the governing African National Congress
threw its weight behind charges that racism was keeping non-whites
off national sports teams, and promised legislation to rectify the
problem.
	   The ANC charged that both the cricket and rugby federations were
not trying hard enough to promote talented players of other races.
	   The attack followed similar pronouncements by the National
Sports Council and Tshwete, who has announced the creation of a
special commission to explore integration efforts.

Hasty blame in friendly fire incident angers Israelis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hours after a recruit was killed by friendly
fire, senior Israeli army officers announced their conclusion: his
immediate commander was to blame.
	   For an army that once prided itself on extended soul-searching
each time one of its troops fell, the haste was astonishing for
some _ but not surprising, given reports of the erosion of military
values after 16 years in Lebanon.
	   ``We have gone from being a small but clever army to a small but
stupid army,'' First Sgt. Ohad Zach's mother, Naomi, said in
remarks widely repeated in the media on Thursday.
	   On Wednesday afternoon, less than 18 hours after the incident,
Brig. Gen. Effi Eitam called a press conference.
	   Using diagrams, he explained that the rear section of an ambush
force opened fire on the forward section. And then he concluded:
``The main reason for this chain of professional mistakes was the
(squad) commander.''
	   Other soldiers in the unit, shocked at what they saw as Eitam's
unseemly hastiness, asked their relatives to tell the media that
the problem ran much deeper. Soldiers are barred from addressing
the media directly.
	   Efraim Nisim _ whose son, Guy, lost an eye _ said that soldiers
in the unit blamed the system more than they did the commander,
2nd. Lt. Assaf Lapid.
	   Nisim said that the recruits had warned Lapid's superiors in the
past that he had made navigational errors _ but they had failed to
heed their warnings.
	   ``I heard from my son and his friends that they didn't trust
Lapid, that they passed it on,'' he told Channel Two.
	   Ohad Zach's sister, Adva, said he had told her of similar
concerns that had been tossed aside. When she confronted the
brigade commander on Wednesday, she said, he offered her more of
the same, saying such incidents were not uncommon in the army.
	   She told Channel Two she found his demeanor frightening.
	   ``He was so sure of himself,'' she said. ``One must not let
yourself arrive at that level of self confidence. I see in this a
problem, perhaps one of erosion'' of military values.
	   Israeli doves have long charged that the occupation of south
Lebanon _ meant to contain guerrilla attacks on Israel's northern
borders _ has led to a series of failures that have crippled morale
and set up a hierarchy of blame.
	   ``Eitam blamed the company commander before he even
investigated,'' columnist Ofer Shelah wrote in Thursday's Maariv, .
``He just tossed him to the wolves: that's the backing the army
gives its commanders.''
	   Israel's security Cabinet was discussing Lebanon policy Thursday
night, a meeting planned long before the incident. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said the friendly fire incident was
not representative.
	   ``One soldier killed by friendly fire, if that was indeed the
case, doesn't indicate anything except that in one incident it was
a case of negligence,'' David Bar-Illan said Wednesday.
	   Second Lt. Lapid _ who Zach wounded in the hand in the incident
_ was willing to take responsibility, his father Herut said. But
Lapid wanted accountability higher up.
	   ``Our forces fired at each other, our children fired at each
other, and someone, in order to cover his rear end, would put Assaf
in jail,'' Herut Lapid told Channel One.
	   The incident was especially painful for the elder Lapid _ a hero
to many Israelis for his often successful efforts to get Israelis
and Jews out of prisons throughout the world. He was instrumental
in reducing the caning sentence handed to American teenager Michael
Fay in 1994.
	   Lapid's motto is the Talmudic injunction, ``All Israel must
guarantee one another,'' a value he learned a generation ago in an
Israeli army once famous for its officer's motto: ``Follow Me.''
	   After Wednesday's incident, he told Maariv, ``I'm in shock that
the army would place this disaster on my son's soldiers.''

Venezuelan inflation lowest in 12 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's inflation rate in 1998 was
about 30 percent, the lowest in 12 years but still one of the
highest in Latin America.
	   The December consumer price index rose 29.9 percent from
December 1997, the Central Bank reported Thursday. That was the
lowest since 1986's inflation rate of 12.7, according to
calculations by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Annual inflation was 37.6 percent in 1997 and 103.2 percent in
1996.
	   This year's relatively low inflation came at the cost of an
economic tailspin. After failing to control inflation earlier in
the year, the Central Bank sharply increased interest rates and put
the breaks on the economy.
	   According to preliminary figures, gross domestic product will
contract 0.7 percent this year versus 5.9 percent growth in 1997.
	   Venezuela's oil-based economy has been hit hard this year by
falling world petroleum prices and uncertainty surrounding this
month's election of former coup leader Hugo Chavez as president. He
takes office on Feb. 2.

Israel's first female fighter pilot gets her wings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANA BUDEIRI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HATZERIM, Israel (AP) _ Israel's first woman fighter pilot got
her wings Thursday, to the cheers of a crowd that had leapt to its
feet in congratulations.
	   Second Lt. Sari, 21, a native of the well-appointed Tel Aviv
suburb of Raanana, will fly F-16 planes and operate sophisticated
airborne weapons systems, army officials said. It is army policy
not to release the last names of combat pilots.
	   ``Today, Sari begins a historic and very important road for the
women of Israel,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said at the
courtyard of the air force museum where the pilots' graduation
ceremony was held.
	   While 18 year old Israeli women are routinely drafted for 21
months of military service, they do not serve as fighters. Sari is
the first woman to serve in a combat position, following a Supreme
Court decision last year ordering the air force to reverse the ban
on women in its pilot course.
	   As a military band played, air force commander Eitan Ben-Eliyahu
pinned symbolic wings on the graduating pilots. Sari, dressed in a
uniform of light blue shirt and dark blue trousers, stood
considerably shorter than her male colleagues. Her light brown hair
was tied back in a single braid.
	   ``We receive you with great happiness and love and we hope that
you will be an integral part of the air force for many years to
come,'' Ben-Eliyahu said in a personal congratulations message to
Sari. At the mention of her name, the crowd cheered and clapped.
	   After the graduation ceremony, the pilots broke out of their
rows and threw their caps in the air. Five planes put on an air
show overhead.
	   Sari will spend the next few months learning to use laser-guided
and other weapons while flying F-16's. Army officials said it was
routine for graduating pilots to train for an additional month or
two before engaging in active combat.
	   She would be the first woman in the history of the state of
Israel to do so.
	   Women and men fought side-by-side both in guerrilla battles
before and during the 1948 war for statehood but were banned from
combat positions once the Israeli state was established.
	   ``You need to give credit to those same wonderful women who were
already flying in the (pre-state) air force in the 1930's,'' said
Yael Rom, who was a reserve pilot and instructor in the air force
until the 1950's.
	   She also credited Sari for overcoming sexism _ repeating a
phrase often attributed to Israeli President Ezer Weizman, in the
days when he was an air force commander: ``The good men to flying,
and the good women to the flyers.''
	   Weizman has said he disagrees with the Supreme Court's decision
allowing women to be fighter pilots.
	   Earlier this week, an air force commander reportedly said it was
``not natural'' for women to be fighter pilots.
	   On Thursday, Mordechai said that he supports women flying in the
air force but that Israeli society needs to decide if women should
serve behind enemy lines.

Flash floods wreak havoc on northern Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After months of drought, rain flooded northern
Israel Thursday, destroying property and forcing thousands of
residents to evacuate.
	   Israel television said 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell on
the Carmel region throughout the day.
	   In the southern Israeli town of Ashkelon, 59 foreign workers
from Korea and Romania were stranded on a pier after huge waves
struck their houseboat away from the pier, Israel's army radio
said. While no one was injured, the workers were to stay on the
pier until dawn after darkness and harsh weather conditions
suspended rescue efforts.
	   By nightfall, the rain has mostly stopped and residents were
starting to return to their homes.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Paul Tergat of Kenya won his third St.
Silvester road race on Thursday, beating a field of about 11,000 to
claim the 74th annual year-end event.
	   Earlier, Olivera Jevtic of Slovakia beat two-time and defending
champion Martha Tenorio of Ecuador by 20 seconds to win the women's
division.
	   Jevtic took the lead for good with 3 kilometers to go and slowly
consolidated her lead to the finish.
	   The 21-year-old European completed the 15-kilometer (9.3-mile)
course through the wide avenues and tiny streets of Sao Paulo in 51
minutes, 35 seconds for a top prize of dlrs 10,000.
	   Tenorio followed in second with Kenya's Jane Wanjiku Ngotho
third, 67 seconds further behind.
	   Erika Alejandro Olivera de la Fuente of Chile was fourth in
53:33, 23 seconds ahead of Brazil's Cleuza Maria Irineu.
	   Shortly after the race, a panting and heavily perspiring Jevtic
grinned broadly and threw kisses to the crowd,
	   ``I am very pleased and I expect to come back next year,''
Jevtic said.
	   Brazil's Marizete de Paula Rezende shot ahead when the race
began under partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 38 degrees
Celsius (100 Fahrenheit).
	   The relatively unknown Resende staying out front for the first 2
kilometers, but then was overtaken by a group including Jevtic,
Tenorio and Ngotho.
	   For several kilometers, the trio ran together and quickly placed
more than 40 meters between themselves and their nearest rivals.
	   By the 10th kilometer, it became clear that one of the three
would win.

Israel's first female fighter pilot gets her wings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANA BUDEIRI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HATZERIM, Israel (AP) _ Israel's first woman fighter pilot got
her wings Thursday, to the cheers of a crowd that had leapt to its
feet in congratulations.
	   Second Lt. Sari, 21, a native of the well-appointed Tel Aviv
suburb of Raanana, will fly F-16 planes and operate sophisticated
airborne weapons systems, army officials said. It is army policy
not to release the last names of combat pilots.
	   ``Today, Sari begins a historic and very important road for the
women of Israel,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said at the
courtyard of the air force museum where the pilots' graduation
ceremony was held.
	   While 18 year old Israeli women are routinely drafted for 21
months of military service, they do not serve as fighters. Sari is
the first woman to serve in a combat position, following a Supreme
Court decision last year ordering the air force to reverse a ban on
women in its pilot course.
	   As a military band played, air force commander Eitan Ben-Eliyahu
pinned symbolic wings on the graduating pilots. Sari, dressed in a
uniform of light blue shirt and dark blue trousers, stood
considerably shorter than her male colleagues. Her light brown hair
was tied back in a single braid.
	   ``We receive you with great happiness and love and we hope that
you will be an integral part of the air force for many years to
come,'' Ben-Eliyahu said in a personal congratulations message to
Sari. At the mention of her name, the crowd cheered and clapped.
	   After the graduation ceremony, the pilots broke out of their
rows and threw their caps in the air. Five planes put on an air
show overhead.
	   Sari will spend the next few months learning to use laser-guided
and other weapons while flying F-16s. Army officials said it was
routine for graduating pilots to train for an additional month or
two before being allowed to engage in active combat.
	   Sari is the first woman in the history of the state of Israel to
be certified for combat duty. However, men and women fought
side-by-side both in guerrilla battles before and during the 1948
war for statehood before being banned from combat positions once
the Israeli state was established.
	   ``You need to give credit to those same wonderful women who were
already flying in the (pre-state) air force in the 1930's,'' said
Yael Rom, who was a reserve pilot and instructor in the air force
until the 1950's.
	   She also credited Sari for overcoming sexism _ repeating a
phrase often attributed to Israeli President Ezer Weizman, in the
days when he was an air force commander: ``The good men to flying,
and the good women to the flyers.''
	   Weizman has said he disagrees with the Supreme Court's decision
allowing women to be fighter pilots.
	   Earlier this week, an air force commander reportedly said it was
``not natural'' for women to be fighter pilots.
	   On Thursday, Mordechai said that he supports women flying in the
air force but that Israeli society needs to decide if women should
serve behind enemy lines.

Palestinian minister says he hopes state will come through talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat quote, 3rd graf

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A top Palestinian official said Thursday that
he expected a Palestinian state to be formed in 1999, but that he
hoped it would be as a result of negotiations with Israel.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has made contradictory
statements in recent months about whether he would unilaterally
declare a state on May 4, the deadline for reaching a permanent
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
	   On Thursday, Arafat called upon supporters to ``continue until
we achieve a Palestinian state with its capital in holy
Jerusalem.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to walk
away from the peace talks and annex parts of the West Bank if
Arafat goes ahead with a unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   Israeli elections are scheduled for May 17, and it is believed
that a Palestinian declaration of statehood on May 4 would give a
boost to Netanyahu over his dovish challengers.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath suggested Thursday
that the Palestinians might be willing to hold off for a while on
declaring a state.
	   ``The sovereign state of Palestine will be declared in 1999, I
have no doubt,'' Shaath told Israel army radio.
	   ``But I still say that our preference is that we will finish
together the permanent status negotiations,'' he added.
	   Shaath said he did not want the declaration of a Palestinian
state to become the source of problems between the two people.
	   The Haaretz newspaper reported Thursday that Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak asked Arafat during recent talks to delay a
declaration of a state so as not to interfere in the Israeli
elections.

Hasty blame in friendly fire incident angers Israelis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hours after a recruit was killed by friendly
fire, senior Israeli army officers announced their conclusion: his
immediate commander was to blame.
	   For an army that once prided itself on extended soul-searching
each time one of its troops fell, the haste was astonishing for
some _ but not surprising, given reports of the erosion of military
values after 16 years in Lebanon.
	   ``We have gone from being a small but clever army to a small but
stupid army,'' First Sgt. Ohad Zach's mother, Naomi, said in
remarks widely repeated in the media on Thursday.
	   On Wednesday afternoon, less than 18 hours after the incident,
Brig. Gen. Effi Eitam called a press conference.
	   Using diagrams, he explained that the rear section of an ambush
force opened fire on the forward section. And then he concluded:
``The main reason for this chain of professional mistakes was the
(squad) commander.''
	   Other soldiers in the unit, shocked at what they saw as Eitam's
unseemly hastiness, asked their relatives to tell the media that
the problem ran much deeper. Soldiers are barred from addressing
the media directly.
	   Efraim Nisim _ whose son, Guy, lost an eye _ said that soldiers
in the unit blamed the system more than they did the commander,
2nd. Lt. Assaf Lapid.
	   Nisim said that the recruits had warned Lapid's superiors in the
past that he had made navigational errors _ but they had failed to
heed their warnings.
	   ``I heard from my son and his friends that they didn't trust
Lapid, that they passed it on,'' he told Channel Two.
	   Ohad Zach's sister, Adva, said he had told her of similar
concerns that had been tossed aside. When she confronted the
brigade commander on Wednesday, she said, he offered her more of
the same, saying such incidents were not uncommon in the army.
	   She told Channel Two she found his demeanor frightening.
	   ``He was so sure of himself,'' she said. ``One must not let
yourself arrive at that level of self confidence. I see in this a
problem, perhaps one of erosion'' of military values.
	   Israeli doves have long charged that the occupation of south
Lebanon _ meant to contain guerrilla attacks on Israel's northern
borders _ has led to a series of failures that have crippled morale
and set up a hierarchy of blame.
	   ``Eitam blamed the company commander before he even
investigated,'' columnist Ofer Shelah wrote in Thursday's Maariv, .
``He just tossed him to the wolves: that's the backing the army
gives its commanders.''
	   Israel's security Cabinet was discussing Lebanon policy Thursday
night, a meeting planned long before the incident. Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said the friendly fire incident was
not representative.
	   ``One soldier killed by friendly fire, if that was indeed the
case, doesn't indicate anything except that in one incident it was
a case of negligence,'' David Bar-Illan said Wednesday.
	   Second Lt. Lapid _ who Zach wounded in the hand in the incident
_ was willing to take responsibility, his father Herut said. But
Lapid wanted accountability higher up.
	   ``Our forces fired at each other, our children fired at each
other, and someone, in order to cover his rear end, would put Assaf
in jail,'' Herut Lapid told Channel One.
	   The incident was especially painful for the elder Lapid _ a hero
to many Israelis for his often successful efforts to get Israelis
and Jews out of prisons throughout the world. He was instrumental
in reducing the caning sentence handed to American teenager Michael
Fay in 1994.
	   Lapid's motto is the Talmudic injunction, ``All Israel must
guarantee one another,'' a value he learned a generation ago in an
Israeli army once famous for its officer's motto: ``Follow Me.''
	   After Wednesday's incident, he told Maariv, ``I'm in shock that
the army would place this disaster on my son's soldiers.''

Brazil's Cardoso assumes second term amid vastly lower
</HEADLINE>
expectations &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word 'billion' in 16th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ This time around, the presidential
Rolls Royce is staying in the garage. And forget about champagne,
the inauguration will be toasted with locally-grown sparkling wine
and contraband whiskey seized by customs officials.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso prepares to be sworn in to a
second term in office Friday, but for many here the expectations
are as stripped down as the commemorations.
	   ``The difference in sentiment between the first term and the
second term are enormous,'' said Antonio Delfim Neto, a congressman
and former finance minister, ``In 1995 everything was certainty and
hope ... the beginning of the second term is sadder: everything is
uncertainty.''
	   On the eve of his 1995 inauguration, Cardoso enjoyed approval
ratings of around 70 percent, almost entirely on the strength of
the economic plan he devised as finance minister under
then-President Itamar Franco.
	   Introduced in July 1994, the plan dropped inflation, then
hovering around 50 percent a month, to a single digit almost
overnight.
	   Suddenly one US dollar bought only 82 centavos of a real _ the
local currency _ and for many Brazilians, beaten down by years of
triple digit inflation, it was a heady time.
	   With new hard currency in their wallets, Brazilians traveled
abroad in record numbers and consumption of electronics and other
goods grew so quickly there were concerns the economy was
overheating.
	   It was in this climate that Cardoso was overwhelming elected in
Oct. 1995 and fittingly all the stops were pulled out for his first
inauguration with some 6,000 people attending the 3 million real
(dlrs 2.5 million) gala.
	   The economic plan received high marks from most economists, but
many warned that it would at best provide a window of opportunity
in which to address deep-seated structural problems.
	   Cardoso's government proposed constitutional amendments to
change the tax system, the pension system and civil service
payrolls and shore-up the country's burgeoning deficit.
	   But aside from a constitutional amendment that allowed the
president and governors to stand for reelection, something
prohibited under the country's 1988 Constitution, the other reforms
languished in Congress.
	   For a while, that wasn't a problem.
	   Trade and public sector deficits continue to grow, but foreign
money was flooding into Brazil faster than ever and the country's
reserves swelled from around dlrs 40 billion to above dlrs 70
billion during Cardoso's first three and a half years in office.
	   The volume on Brazilian stock exchanges more than doubled and
leading stock funds boasted returns of over 200 percent a year.
	   But when financial instability rocked Asia and then Russia last
August, the same foreign investment that had swelled the country's
foreign reserves left even faster than it came in.
	   With a dlrs 41.5 billion International Monetary Fund-led bailout
package, Brazil may have avoided becoming the latest domino to fall
in the financial crisis afflicting Asia and Russia, but the outcome
of all the fiscal belt-tightening needed to qualify for that aid
will almost certainly spell recession in 1999.

	   SAN`A, Yemen _ The luggage carried by a porter into the elevator
of an Aden hotel was enough to remind Laurence Whitehouse of the
tragedy that had suddenly overturned his life.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' the tearful British teacher said, pointing
to a bag. His wife Margaret was one of four hostages who died as
Yemeni troops tried to rescue 16 Western hostages _ 12 Britons, two
Americans and two Australians _ from Islamic militant kidnappers.
	   Whitehouse and nine other former hostages who survived the drama
without wounds tried to put their lives together Thursday.
	   They collected their belongings, and those of dead loved ones,
in the hotel lobby. Then they flew from southern Yemen to San`a,
the capital in the north, where they were to spend a night before
flying out of the country Friday for Europe.
	   The bodies of the slain hostages were due to be flown to Britain
on Friday. The dead were identified as Ruth Williamson, 34, Peter
Rowe, a 60-year-old lecturer at the University of Durham, and
Margaret Whitehouse _ all Britons _ and Australian Andrew Thirsk,
35, from Sydney.
	   Two wounded hostages, an unidentified American woman with a
pelvis wound and Claire Marston, Rowe's wife who was shot in the
shoulder, remained in hospital in Aden Thursday night.
	   Before leaving Aden, each hostage was interviewed by Yemeni
security officials for their account of the killings.
	   Some former hostages already have disputed the government's
statement that the security forces intervened after the kidnappers
began killing their captives.
	   Eric Firkins of Croydon, England, says the kidnappers were
leading the hostages to a mountain hideout when they heard gunfire.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said another former hostage,
Brian Smith of Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest, with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   The former hostages said they were forced to stand with their
hands in the air to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered
back, the kidnappers shot two of them in revenge.
	   Whitehouse recalled how his wife Margaret dropped to her knees
to try to help the wounded Australian Andrew Thirsk.
	   He said a militant tried to use her as a shield. But she
resisted, continuing to kneel beside Thirsk.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg,'' Whitehouse said. ``I
tried to move her, but another kidnapper clung on to me and kept
the machine gun dug into my neck. Then I saw a bullet hit Margaret
in the head. She was dead the instant it hit her. She never stood a
chance.
	   ``They wouldn't let me go to her and she just lay there,
bleeding in the dirt,'' Whitehouse said.
	   Before the shooting began, the kidnappers had moved the hostages
in two groups. Freed hostages from neither group have accused the
militants of killing people before the firing started.
	   However, Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab insisted at a
news conference in San`a Thursday that it was the kidnappers'
killing of the hostages that forced the security forces to
intervene.
	   Arab said the kidnappers had given government negotiators one
hour to meet their demands and then threatened to start killing the
hostages.
	   Troops heard that the killing had begun from a Yemeni driver who
was held with the hostages but escaped, he said.
	   ``The troops heard gunfire and intervened swiftly to save the
hostages,'' he said.
	   Arab also said the group to which the kidnappers belonged,
Islamic Jihad, was planning to bomb the British Consulate in Aden,
a camp of American military experts, Aden International Airport,
the offices of the United Nations, churches and hotels.
	   Yemeni officials have said the kidnappers had demanded the
release of two Islamic Jihad leaders and had said they were
retaliating for the recent U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq. The
leaders had been seized in a crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   Tribesmen have kidnapped scores of foreigners in the past to win
economic concessions from the government, but they have usually
freed them safely.
	   This was the first time foreigners had been abducted by Islamic
militants.
	   Four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set
free unharmed on Wednesday. Germany diplomats said the former
hostages arrived in San`a early Thursday and were scheduled to fly
home on Friday.

Tergat wins 74th annual St. Silvester

 &UR; EDS: TOPS with men's race details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Paul Tergat of Kenya took advantage of
an injured and absent Ronaldo da Costa, grabbing the lead midway
and easily winning his third St. Silvester on Thursday.
	   The 29-year old Tergat moved to the front after a pair of little
known Brazilians set the early pace and completed the 15 kilometers
(9.3 miles) in 44 minutes, 47 seconds for a top prize of 10,000
reals (dlrs 8,350).
	   Earlier, Olivera Jevtic of Slovakia beat two-time and defending
champion Martha Tenorio of Ecuador by 20 seconds to win the women's
division.
	   With Brazil's da Costa, who earlier this year set the world
marathon record, out due to a sprained ankle, Tergat _ who had won
the traditional year-end race in 1995 and 1996 _ coasted to a
18-second victory over South Africa's Henkrick Ramaala, who
finished second.
	   Kenya's Elijah Kiptarebi Lagat was third in the international
field of 12,000, finishing three seconds behind Ramaala in 45:08.
	   Silvio Guerra of Ecuador was fourth 45:17, 12 seconds ahead of a
third Kenyan, John Gwako. Defending champion Emerson Iser Bem of
Brazil was sixth in 45:37.
	   Shortly after the start, little known Brazilian Ailton Senna
moved out front and stayed there for 5 kilometers until he dropped
out visibly exhausted.
	   Countryman Manoel de Jesus Teixiera took his place in front for
several minutes before Tergat, Ramaalla and Lagat easily overtook
him.
	   The three shared the lead for about 5 kilometers, when Tergat
pulled ahead and held the lead to the finish.
	   Thousands of spectators lined the course of skyscraper-lined
avenues and through narrow, twisting streets of downtown Sao Paulo.
Some broke through police lines to run alongside the athletes but
were quickly chased away by police on motorcycles.
	   In the women's race, Jevtic took the lead for good with 3
kilometers to go and slowly consolidated her lead to the finish.
	   The 21-year-old European completed the race in 51 minutes, 35
seconds, with Tenorio followed by Kenya's Jane Wanjiku Ngotho, 67
seconds behind the winner.
	   Erika Alejandro Olivera de la Fuente of Chile was fourth in
53:33, 23 seconds ahead of Brazil's Cleuza Maria Irineu.
	   Shortly after the race, a panting and heavily perspiring Jevtic
grinned broadly and threw kisses to the crowd,
	   ``I am very pleased and I expect to come back next year,''
Jevtic said.
	   Brazil's Marizete de Paula Rezende shot ahead when the race
began under partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 38 degrees
Celsius (100 Fahrenheit).
	   The relatively unknown Resende staying out front for the first 2
kilometers, but then was overtaken by a group including Jevtic,
Tenorio and Ngotho.
	   For several kilometers, the trio ran together and quickly placed
more than 40 meters between themselves and their nearest rivals.
	   By the 10th kilometer, it became clear that one of the three
would win.
	   The race is named after St. Silvester, the Roman Catholic saint
whose feast day is celebrated Dec.31. It was first run in 1924 and
was the brainchild of Casper Libero, founder of the Gazeta
Esportiva newspaper - the event's main sponsor.

Libya closes down foreign airline offices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya ordered Thursday all foreign airlines
to close their offices in the country, Egypt's official news agency
reported.
	   The government said the closure would last until the United
States and Britain accepted that the World Court should settle the
dispute arising from the indictment of two Libyans charged with
blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in
1988, killing 270 people, the Middle East News Agency reported from
the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
	   The Hague-based International Court of Justice, known as the
World Court, had ruled in February that it has the authority to
settle the dispute. The United Sates and Britain rejected any
intervention by the court, but later offered to try the two
suspects in The Netherlands before a panel of Scottish judges.
	   Airlines have been forbidden to fly to Libya since 1992 under
U.N. sanctions designed to force Tripoli to hand over the two
suspects.
	   However, foreign airline offices in Tripoli sell tickets for
travelers leaving Libya by road who plan to take flights from
neighboring countries.
	   Libya initially accepted in principle the U.S.-British offer of
a trial in The Netherlands, but has subsequently insisted that, if
convicted, the suspects should serve their sentences in Libya. The
Western plan is for the sentences to be served in Britain.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Pope, NY celebrations, edits  &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Partygoers took to the streets in Europe's
capitals Thursday night to welcome the last year of the second
millennium, Asia greeted 1999 with fireworks and temple bells.
	   Pope John Paul II reminded Roman Catholics to prepare for
Christianity's millennium jubilee only a year away. And in many
countries, leaders spoke to their countrymen and women of hope for
a better future.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, where New Year's is called Hogmany, the
biggest celebration of the year, bands played in the park,
fireworks filled the sky over Edinburgh castle with colored lights,
and a former post office building became a massive warehouse party.
	   Cardiff, the Welsh capital started a three-day Celtic
celebration, reviving the tradition of giving gifts at New Year's,
and throwing in a funfair, a lantern procession, live bands and
fireworks.
	   In London, music thumped out of brightly lighted pubs, and
revelers headed for Trafalgar Square. Police have been trying to
discourage the traditional gathering of thousands at the square,
because of the potential for injuries in such large, boisterous
crowds, but still the most ebullient gather there.
	   At Times Square, New York's own traditional gathering place, the
city went big, bright and brash, with a 16-foot-tall roving Father
Time puppet, 15,000-balloon release and a spotlight said to be
visible from Mars.
	   An open air party at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate offered about 100
entertainers and a midnight fireworks show.
	   Things were a little quieter in Frankfurt, headquarters of the
new European Central Bank, which will set monetary policy from the
stroke of midnight for 11 nations sharing a single currency. Late
into the eveningm, lights shone from the windows of bank
skyscrapers as employees worked to refigure computer records, but
firecrackers popped and fizzed in the streets.
	   In taped messages, some of the world's political leaders urged
their peoples to end sectarian strike, and to have hope in the
future.
	   In his last New Year's message before leaving office, President
Nelson Mandela on Thursday challenged South Africans to continue
working together to solve the problems of poverty and corruption,
legacies of the apartheid decades.
	   ``The New Year will bring many changes,'' Mandela said in the
four-minute broadcast message. ``They will depend on our working
together to realize our dream.''
	   In a message broadcast across nine time zones, Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin called on Russians to meet 1999 with
optimism and pride in their country.
	   ``What can I say: The year was difficult for the country, for
many of you, and for me, too. But New Year's Eve is always about
new hopes, new dreams, new plans,'' Yeltsin said, according to a
transcript released by the Interfax news agency.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern spoke of the Good
Friday peace agreement in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   ``The fantastic support of people .. for an agreed Ireland of
dialogue, mutual respect and common endeavor is the surest
guarantee yet that we will succeed in making this an island of
peace and prosperity for all - especially for our children,'' Ahern
said.
	   A continent away, and hours earlier, much of Asia welcomed the
Year of the Rabbit.
	   In central Tokyo, crowds thronged Zojoji temple just before
midnight, waiting for a Buddhist monk to strike the temple bell 108
times to dispel the evils of the past year and usher in good luck
for the new year.
	   Tokyo's department stores were well stocked with calendars,
cards and knickknacks bearing rabbit images.
	   Millions of Australians bid farewell to 1998 by watching a U.S.
dlrs 1.2 million fireworks extravaganza that bathed the harborside
Sydney Opera House in pulses of green, red and blue light.

U.S. approves long-awaited new type of painkiller for arthritis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government approved the first in a
long-awaited new type of painkiller for millions of arthritis
sufferers Thursday, but cautioned that its stomach-safe benefits
may have been overhyped.
	   Celebrex is the first in a new class of painkillers called
``cox-2 inhibitors'' that promise to cause fewer stomach-plaguing
side effects than many of today's pain relievers. Wall Street
analysts have trumpeted the drug as potentially the next
blockbuster seller.
	   But the Food and Drug Administration dealt manufacturer G.D.
Searle a blow Thursday: While it approved the sale of Celebrex as a
good option to relieve arthritis pain, the FDA declared there is
not proof that the new drug ultimately is easier on patients'
stomachs than older competitors.
	   ``The final answer is not in on the major question here: Is this
safer?'' said FDA drug chief Dr. Murray Lumpkin.
	   ``I'm disappointed at the FDA's stand on this,'' said Dr. Joseph
Markenson of Cornell Medical College, who helped Searle test
Celebrex and said the emerging data indicates it will cause fewer
ulcers than competing drugs.
	   With the FDA's warning, how many arthritis patients will try
Celebrex _ and should they switch from older painkillers to the new
drug?
	   Arthritis patients with current stomach problems might consider
Celebrex, Georgetown University rheumatologist Dr. Stephen Ray
Mitchell said. But for those doing OK on older medicines, ``I would
absolutely not change them right now'' to Celebrex, he said.
	   Searle said Celebrex would be available by prescription within
six weeks.
	   Millions of people now depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen
and a host of other pills called ``non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs,'' or NSAIDs. They are used by the 19 million sufferers of
arthritis in the United States. They're also used to relieve
everyday aches, recovery from surgery and myriad other pains.
	   But NSAIDs can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other
gastrointestinal side effects, especially in long-term users.
NSAIDs are blamed for causing 107,000 Americans to be hospitalized
every year, and for killing 16,500.
	   In 1990, scientists discovered the reason. NSAIDs target an
enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase that is responsible for much
inflammation accompanying pain. But it turned out there are two
types of this enzyme. Cox-2 was behind the inflammation, while
cox-1 actually protects the stomach lining. Unfortunately, NSAIDs
hit both.
	   The theory was that if scientists could develop a more specific
drug that targeted just cox-2, it would alleviate pain and
inflammation but not hurt the stomach. Half a dozen companies began
racing to develop a better NSAID.
	   The FDA on Thursday decided Searle's Celebrex, known chemically
as celecoxib, could help relieve arthritis pain about as well as
prescription-strength NSAIDs.
	   Is Celebrex safer? Searle gave 4,700 patients endoscopies _
snaking a tube into their stomachs to see if ulcers were forming
even before patients experienced symptoms. Patients taking Celebrex
showed fewer of these mini-ulcers than patients taking
prescription-strength ibuprofen or naproxen.
	   However, mini-ulcers often heal on their own, so the big
question is whether long-time Celebrex users ultimately suffer
fewer painful ulcers and other serious side effects, the FDA said.
	   Patients who try Celebrex should promptly report any
gastrointestinal side effects to their doctors, the FDA said.

disputes. The image of sports in 1998. Even the biggest event _ the
World Cup _ was not immune from controversy. From the red card
scare before the World Cup to Ronaldo's mysterious illness before
the final, soccer had to deal all sorts of non-game distractions
like nearly every other sport.

	   SAN`A, Yemen _ The luggage carried by a porter into the elevator
of an Aden hotel was enough to remind Laurence Whitehouse of the
tragedy that had suddenly overturned his life.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' the tearful British teacher said, pointing
to a bag. His wife Margaret was one of four hostages who died as
Yemeni troops tried to rescue 16 Western hostages _ 12 Britons, two
Americans and two Australians _ from Islamic militant kidnappers.
	   Whitehouse and nine other former hostages who survived the drama
without wounds tried to put their lives together Thursday.
	   They collected their belongings, and those of dead loved ones,
in the hotel lobby. Then they flew from southern Yemen to San`a,
the capital in the north, where they were to spend a night before
flying out of the country Friday for Europe.
	   The bodies of the slain hostages were due to be flown to Britain
on Friday. The dead were identified as Ruth Williamson, 34, Peter
Rowe, a 60-year-old lecturer at the University of Durham, and
Margaret Whitehouse _ all Britons _ and Australian Andrew Thirsk,
35, from Sydney.
	   Two wounded hostages, an unidentified American woman with a
pelvis wound and Claire Marston, Rowe's wife who was shot in the
shoulder, remained in the hospital in Aden Thursday night.
	   Before leaving Aden, each hostage was interviewed by Yemeni
security officials for their account of the killings.
	   Some former hostages already have disputed the government's
statement that the security forces intervened after the kidnappers
began killing their captives.
	   Eric Firkins of Croydon, England, says the kidnappers were
leading the hostages to a mountain hideout when they heard gunfire.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said another former hostage,
Brian Smith of Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest, with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   The former hostages said they were forced to stand with their
hands in the air to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered
back, the kidnappers shot two of them in revenge.
	   Whitehouse recalled how his wife Margaret dropped to her knees
to try to help the wounded Australian Andrew Thirsk.
	   He said a militant tried to use her as a shield. But she
resisted, continuing to kneel beside Thirsk.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg,'' Whitehouse said. ``I
tried to move her, but another kidnapper clung on to me and kept
the machine gun dug into my neck. Then I saw a bullet hit Margaret
in the head. She was dead the instant it hit her. She never stood a
chance.
	   ``They wouldn't let me go to her and she just lay there,
bleeding in the dirt,'' Whitehouse said.
	   Before the shooting began, the kidnappers had moved the hostages
in two groups. Freed hostages from neither group have accused the
militants of killing people before the firing started.
	   However, Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab insisted at a
news conference in San`a Thursday that it was the kidnappers'
killing of the hostages that forced the security forces to
intervene.
	   Arab said the kidnappers had given government negotiators one
hour to meet their demands and then threatened to start killing the
hostages.
	   Troops heard that the killing had begun from a Yemeni driver who
was held with the hostages but escaped, he said.
	   ``The troops heard gunfire and intervened swiftly to save the
hostages,'' he said.
	   Arab also said the group to which the kidnappers belonged,
Islamic Jihad, was planning to bomb the British Consulate in Aden,
a camp of American military experts, Aden International Airport,
the offices of the United Nations, churches and hotels.
	   Yemeni officials have said the kidnappers had demanded the
release of two Islamic Jihad leaders and had said they were
retaliating for the recent U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq. The
leaders had been seized in a crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   Tribesmen have kidnapped scores of foreigners in the past to win
economic concessions from the government, but they have usually
freed them safely.
	   This was the first time foreigners had been abducted by Islamic
militants.
	   Four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set
free unharmed on Wednesday. Germany diplomats said the former
hostages arrived in San`a early Thursday and were scheduled to fly
home on Friday.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's opposition parties ended the ruling
Insitutional Revolutionary Party's 68-year majority in Congress in
the 1997 elections. But for the second straight year, a split over
the budget has allowed the governing party, known as the PRI, to
push through most of its own proposal.
	   PRI legislators voted with lawmakers from the center-right
National Action Party to approve a dlrs 103 billion budget, with
new taxes and spending cuts intended to offset a dlrs 2.86 billion
shortfall caused by falling oil prices.
	   National Action, known as PAN, forced President Ernesto
Zedillo's party to give up plans for a 15 percent telephone usage
tax _ which would have been on top of an existing 15 percent tax.
	   But by voting with the PRI _ not only on the budgets, but also
on a dlrs 67 billion bank bailout proposal in December _ the PAN
may find it harder to attack the governing party as it campaigns
for seven governorships in 1999 and the presidency in 2000.
	   ``It's awfully hard to keep your cutting edge as the party of
protest and be responsible (on budget issues) at the same time,''
said Delal Baer, a researcher at the Washington-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
	   The other major party, the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party, was left powerless. It didn't participate in budget
negotiations and could do little but watch it get passed over its
objections. The Democratic Revolution had rejected the basic tenets
of both the budget _ which it claimed would soak already
impoverished taxpayers _ and the bank bailout, which it called
illegal.
	   The PAN's failure to establish itself as a clear alternative to
the PRI may have been partly responsible for its poor showing in
1998 state elections, in which it won only one of 10 races.
	   On Wednesday, PAN president Felipe Calderon announced he would
not seek re-election. Although he cited ``personal reasons,'' he
said in his resignation letter that ``the party needs an effort
toward renovation and new impulses from its leaders.''
	   For many PAN members, that means a return to the party's image
as a strong opposition, anti-corruption voice.
	   The PAN-PRI alliance has also made some members of the governing
party uncomfortable, and some have attacked the government's
market-oriented policies.
	   ``The PRI has origins in the left, not the right, that's why we
should make alliances with the left to meet social needs,'' said
Genaro Morales, spokesman for Critical Current.

Tergat wins 74th annual St. Silvester

race details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Paul Tergat of Kenya took advantage of
an injured and absent Ronaldo da Costa, grabbing the lead midway
and easily winning his third St. Silvester on Thursday.
	   The 29-year old Tergat moved to the front after a pair of little
known Brazilians set the early pace and completed the 15 kilometers
(9.3 miles) in 44 minutes, 47 seconds for a top prize of 10,000
reals (dlrs 8,350).
	   Earlier, Olivera Jevtic of Slovakia beat two-time and defending
champion Martha Tenorio of Ecuador by 20 seconds to win the women's
division.
	   With Brazil's da Costa, who earlier this year set the world
marathon record, out due to a sprained ankle, Tergat _ who had won
the traditional year-end race in 1995 and 1996 _ coasted to a
18-second victory over South Africa's Henkrick Ramaala, who
finished second.
	   Kenya's Elijah Kiptarebi Lagat was third in the international
field of 12,000, finishing three seconds behind Ramaala in 45:08.
	   Silvio Guerra of Ecuador was fourth 45:17, 12 seconds ahead of a
third Kenyan, John Gwako. Defending champion Emerson Iser Bem of
Brazil was sixth in 45:37.
	   Shortly after the start, little known Brazilian Ailton Senna
moved out front and stayed there for 5 kilometers until he dropped
out visibly exhausted.
	   Countryman Manoel de Jesus Teixiera took his place in front for
several minutes before Tergat, Ramaalla and Lagat easily overtook
him.
	   The three shared the lead for about 5 kilometers, when Tergat
pulled ahead and held the lead to the finish.
	   Thousands of spectators lined the course of skyscraper-lined
avenues and through narrow, twisting streets of downtown Sao Paulo.
Some broke through police lines to run alongside the athletes but
were quickly chased away by police on motorcycles.
	   In the women's race, Jevtic took the lead for good with 3
kilometers to go and slowly consolidated her lead to the finish.
	   The 21-year-old European completed the race in 51 minutes, 35
seconds, with Tenorio followed by Kenya's Jane Wanjiku Ngotho, 67
seconds behind the winner.
	   Erika Alejandro Olivera de la Fuente of Chile was fourth in
53:33, 23 seconds ahead of Brazil's Cleuza Maria Irineu.
	   Shortly after the race, a panting and heavily perspiring Jevtic
grinned broadly and threw kisses to the crowd,
	   ``I am very pleased and I expect to come back next year,''
Jevtic said.
	   Brazil's Marizete de Paula Rezende shot ahead when the race
began under partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 38 degrees
Celsius (100 Fahrenheit).
	   The relatively unknown Resende staying out front for the first 2
kilometers, but then was overtaken by a group including Jevtic,
Tenorio and Ngotho.
	   For several kilometers, the trio ran together and quickly placed
more than 40 meters between themselves and their nearest rivals.
	   By the 10th kilometer, it became clear that one of the three
would win.
	   The race is named after St. Silvester, the Roman Catholic saint
whose feast day is celebrated Dec.31. It was first run in 1924 and
was the brainchild of Casper Libero, founder of the Gazeta
Esportiva newspaper - the event's main sponsor.

Five Vikings highlight All-Pro team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Five players for the Minnesota Vikings _ Randy,
Randle, two Randalls and a perfect placekicker _ were selected for
The Associated Press' NFL All-Pro team released Thursday.
	   Wide receiver Randy Moss, the first rookie on the team since
Jerome Bettis in 1993, was joined by quarterback Randall
Cunningham, guard Randall McDaniel, defensive tackle John Randle
and kicker Gary Anderson.
	   Moss, who made one of the biggest impacts of any rookie in
league history, was one vote short of being a unanimous choice.
Only Denver running back Terrell Davis received votes from all 47
members of a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters.
	   ``I just go out there and try to do my job,'' said Moss, who
averaged 19 yards per reception for 69 catches and had a
league-high 17 TDs.
	   Cunningham led the NFL with a 106.0 passer rating, completing
60.9 percent of his passes for 3,704 yards and 34 touchdowns. A
backup at the start of the season, he replaced injured Brad Johnson
and guided the Vikings to a league-record 556 points.
	   The Vikings' 15-1 record was the best in the NFL this season.
	   ``You look around this locker room and see all the guys I get to
play with, they're the ones who really allowed us to achieve those
goals,'' Cunningham said.
	   McDaniel, the most dominant guard in the game, made the All-Pro
squad for the seventh time. He was joined at guard by Tennessee's
Bruce Matthews, 37, who made his 16th season one of his best.
Matthews has been an All-Pro five times, twice as a center.
	   Randle was a dynamo on Minnesota's defense, playing both tackle
and end. He is the kind of defender around whom game plans are
built.
	   ``It's a good honor,'' Randle said. ``Not the greatest one,
though. The Super Bowl is the greatest honor.''
	   Anderson had the first perfect year for an NFL kicker, hitting
all 35 field goals and all 59 extra points for a league mark of 164
points.
	   Three Green Bay Packers were selected: defensive end Reggie
White, safety LeRoy Butler and receiver Antonio Freeman.
	   Teams that had two players selected included Denver (Davis and
tight end Shannon Sharpe); Dallas (cornerback Deion Sanders and
tackle Larry Allen); San Diego (inside linebacker Junior Seau and
safety Rodney Harrison); and Tennessee (Matthews and punter Craig
Hentrich, who led the league with a 47.2 gross average and 39.2
net).
	   Also chosen on offense were Jacksonville tackle Tony Boselli,
Buffalo guard Ruben Brown and Pittsburgh center Dermontti Dawson,
who made it for the fifth consecutive year.
	   Joining White and Randle on the defensive line were the Giants'
Michael Strahan and Oakland's Darrell Russell.
	   At linebacker were Seattle's Chad Brown and the Jets' Mo Lewis
on the outside, with Miami's Zach Thomas and Seau inside.
	   Sanders and Ty Law of New England were the cornerbacks, with
Harrison and Butler at safety.
	   Fourteen AFC players and 13 from the NFC made the team.
Repeaters from last year were Sharpe, Boselli, Allen (at guard in
'97), Dawson, Davis, Alstott, Strahan, Randle, Sanders and Butler.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Partygoers took to the streets in Europe's
capitals Thursday night to welcome the last year of the second
millennium, Asia greeted 1999 with fireworks and temple bells.
	   Pope John Paul II reminded Roman Catholics to prepare for
Christianity's millennium jubilee only a year away. And in many
countries, leaders spoke to their countrymen and women of hope for
a better future.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, where New Year's is called Hogmany, the
biggest celebration of the year, bands played in the park,
fireworks filled the sky over Edinburgh castle with colored lights,
and a former post office building became a massive warehouse party.
	   In London, music thumped out of brightly lighted pubs, and
revelers headed for Trafalgar Square. Police have been trying to
discourage the traditional gathering of thousands at the square,
because of the potential for injuries in such large, boisterous
crowds, but still the most ebullient gather there.
	   At Times Square, New York's own traditional gathering place, the
city went big, bright and brash, with a 16-foot-tall roving Father
Time puppet, 15,000-balloon release and a spotlight said to be
visible from Mars.
	   An open air party at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate offered about 100
entertainers and a midnight fireworks show.
	   Things were a little quieter in Frankfurt, headquarters of the
new European Central Bank, which will set monetary policy from the
stroke of midnight for 11 nations sharing a single currency. Late
into the eveningm, lights shone from the windows of bank
skyscrapers as employees worked to refigure computer records, but
firecrackers popped and fizzed in the streets.
	   In most Arab countries, New Year celebrations were subdued this
year because the event coincided with the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan _ a period when governments close nightclubs and impose
strict rules on serving alcohol.
	   There were no street decorations or lighting in the major cities
and restaurants and hotels could not lay on special festivities.
	   But many Arabs invited friends and relatives to private parties
in their homes.
	   In Cairo, the big hotels adorned the faces of their buildings
with lights strung in the shape of a Ramadan lantern. Pleasure
boats decked with gaudy lights cruised the Nile, their speakers
blaring out Arab songs, but this had more to do with Thursday's
being the end of the week than with New Year's.
	   In Iran, where the New Year is celebrated about March 21,
President Mohammad Khatami sent a traditional greeting to the
Christian world.
	   Khatami said people everywhere should interpret the teachings of
Jesus Christ ``with emphasis on compassion for fellow human beings,
respecting others, dialogue with the opposition, tolerance and
detente towards others,'' the official Islamic News Agency
reported.
	   ``I hope the year 1999, which is a link between the two
millenniums, will be a year filled with blessings, peace,
cordiality and love among men,'' the president said, according to a
British Broadcasting Corp. translation received in Cairo.
	   In taped messages, other world leaders urged their peoples to
end sectarian strike, and to have hope in the future.
	   In his last New Year's message before leaving office, President
Nelson Mandela on Thursday challenged South Africans to continue
working together to solve the problems of poverty and corruption,
legacies of the apartheid decades.
	   ``The New Year will bring many changes,'' Mandela said in the
broadcast message. ``They will depend on our working together to
realize our dream.''
	   Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called on Russians to meet 1999
with optimism and pride in their country.
	   ``What can I say: The year was difficult for the country, for
many of you, and for me, too. But New Year's Eve is always about
new hopes, new dreams, new plans,'' Yeltsin said, according to a
transcript released by the Interfax news agency.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern spoke of the Good
Friday peace agreement in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   ``The fantastic support of people .. for an agreed Ireland of
dialogue, mutual respect and common endeavor is the surest
guarantee yet that we will succeed in making this an island of
peace and prosperity for all - especially for our children,'' Ahern
said.

Libya closes down foreign airline offices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya ordered on Thursday all foreign
airlines to close their offices in the country, Egypt's official
news agency reported.
	   The government said the closure would last until the United
States and Britain recognized the World Court's jurisdiction in
settling a dispute over the indictment of two Libyans charged with
blowing up a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, the
Middle East News Agency reported from the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
	   The Hague-based International Court of Justice, known as the
World Court, had ruled in February that it has the authority to
settle the dispute. The United Sates and Britain rejected any
intervention by the court, but later offered to try the two
suspects in The Netherlands before a panel of Scottish judges.
	   Airlines have been forbidden to fly to Libya since 1992 under
U.N. sanctions designed to force Tripoli to hand over the two
suspects in the bombing, which killed 270 people.
	   However, foreign airline offices in Tripoli sell tickets for
travelers leaving Libya by road who plan to take flights from
neighboring countries.
	   Libya initially accepted in principle the U.S.-British offer of
a trial in The Netherlands, but has subsequently insisted that, if
convicted, the suspects should serve their sentences in Libya. The
Western plan is for the sentences to be served in Britain.

Lots of bear sightings in 1998, and many bullish returns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRUCE MEYERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Was it a bear market?
	   Let the historians decide. No matter how they choose to describe
what happened in the stock market in 1998, there seems to be a bull
galloping its way into 1999.
	   Then again, since the majority of today's investors have never
been through a real bear market, 1998 had to have been a sobering
experience, regardless of its huge autumn rebound.
	   For one thing, the latest and greatest escape by Wall Street's
famously stubborn bovine was hardly an equal-opportunity affair.
The average stock fell 45 percent, more than twice as far as the
Dow Jones industrial average.
	   ``This year wasn't without its casualties and it wasn't without
a lot of unpleasant memories of cascading portfolios,'' said Ned
Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston.
	   The most telling statistics of 1998 may not be another year of
double-digit gains by Wall Street's favorite market measures, but
the data on the flow of money to and from mutual funds investing in
stocks.
	   In a rare display of dismay, investors withdrew more money than
they deposited as the market dove in August, the first month of
negative fund flows since 1990.
	   ``The guy on the street isn't feeling nirvana with the market
hitting new highs because most portfolios trailed'' the rebound,
said Riley. The typical stock fund, he noted, has done only about
half as well in 1998 as the Standard and Poor's 500, which was up
26 percent for the year.
	   If disappointing returns didn't make investors rethink their
undying devotion to stocks, there was always the volatility. On 16
occasions, the sharp price swings left the Dow more than 200 points
higher or lower in a single day.
	   And if the Asian currency crisis of 1997 left any doubt about
the meaning of global economics, 1998 was the year the Asian crisis
went Russian, Latin American and, well, global.
	   Instead of merely hurting profits for multinational American
companies, the instability overseas was threatening to push the
entire U.S. economy into recession.
	   Meanwhile, having taken such a beating on foreign markets,
lenders stopped lending _ a matter so serious that the
slow-and-stately Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times to
get the wheels of business spinning again.
	   ``There's been more to worry about this year than at any time in
my career,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First
Albany Corp. ``We have never faced a financial crisis of this
magnitude.''
	   After romping to record highs during the first half of 1998, the
Dow peaked on July 17 as the global crisis flared up again. In just
six weeks, the measure of 30 major companies fell 19.3 percent.
	   Since the classic definition of a bear is a drop of 20 percent,
some observers termed the downturn a near-miss and declared Wall
Street's eight-year-old bull alive and well.
	   But the calculation of 19.3 percent is based on end-of-day
figures. The Dow tumbled 512 points on Aug. 31 to 7,539.07, the
lowest close of 1998, but actually slid even farther the next day
before reversing course at 7,400 _ a drop of 21 percent from the
July peak.
	   ``Every criteria for a bear market was fulfilled. These people
who say it wasn't a bear because the Dow fell 19.3 percent instead
of 20 percent? That's nuts,'' said Ralph Bloch, chief market
analyst at Raymond James and Associates of St. Petersburg, Florida,
also rejecting arguments that a bear market needs to last longer or
accompany a recession.
	   Either way, the debate over whether the Dow escaped the bear's
clutch in 1998 misses the point: There's no question that most
garden-variety stocks endured a mauling that would satisfy just
about any definition of a bear market.
	   While the Dow pulled back after reaching a new high of 9,374.27
on Nov. 23, it ended the year at 9,181.43, still up 16 percent for
1998 _ a fourth straight year of double-digit gains.
	   Even better, the S-and-P 500 posted a more-than-20-percent gain
for the fourth year in a row, as was the Nasdaq composite index
with a gain of 39 percent.
	   But the Russell 2000 index of small companies headed for its
first losing year since 1994.
	   ``The gap between the haves and the have-nots was a lot wider
than I can recall in tracking the market over the last 30 years,''
said BankBoston's Riley.
	   In reality, then, there were two different markets in 1998.
	   ``I would certainly call it a bear-market sized correction, and
for everything else but the large-cap market, I would call it a
bear,'' said Robert Streed, senior investment adviser at Northern
Trust in Chicago. ``A couple of years from now, we'll have to look
back and see if this wasn't the first shot across bow to end the
bull market. You never know until after the fact.''

Israel will attack Lebanon if hit by Katyusha rockets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will strike targets within Lebanon if
Katyusha rockets are fired into northern Israel, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday.
	   ``Israel sees the Lebanese government as directly responsible
for what happens in southern Lebanon and demands that it stops all
activity against Israel,'' Netanyahu said in the statement released
after a late-night Security Cabinet meeting to discuss escalating
tensions along the Lebanese border.
	   The statement also said that Israel would try to avoid harming
civilians.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. For the most part, Israel has responded to
Katyusha attacks by striking positions inside and just beyond the
security zone.
	   Thursday's announcement suggested that Israel would widen the
scope of the conflict to include targets well beyond the security
zone, as several ministers demanded prior to the Cabinet meeting.
	   The Security Cabinet apparently rejected the proposal,
reportedly presented by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, to withdraw
unilaterally from Lebanon, saying in the statement that Israel
would continue to protect security zone residents family members of
those serving in the Israeli-backed Lebanese militia.
	   Last week, Hezbollah guerrillas fired dozens of rockets into
northern Israel, injuring 16 people and causing a pregnant woman to
go into premature labor and lose the twins she was carrying.
	   The attack was in retaliation for an Israeli air raid that
killed seven Lebanese civilians. Israel said the civilian
casualties were accidental.
	   Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government and its Syrian
allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000 soldiers out of its
occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

Suspects held for trial for murder of U.S. journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Two Mexican suspects accused of killing
American reporter Philip True were ordered held for trial Thursday,
officials said.
	   Juan Chivarras de la Cruz, 28, and Miguel Hernandez de la Cruz,
24, have been charged with homicide and robbery, the Jalisco state
attorney general's office said.
	   True, 50, Mexico City correspondent for the San Antonio
Express-News, disappeared while hiking alone through a remote
region of the Sierra Madre in western Mexico, where he was pursuing
a story on the Huichol Indian culture. His body was found Dec. 16
in a shallow grave in west-central Jalisco state.
	   The suspects, both Huichol Indians, have confessed to the
killing.
	   Authorities said the suspects had told them they killed True
because he was trying to take their photographs without permission.
But in a court appearance and in interviews with reporters, the two
said Hernandez killed True after the reporter had kicked Hernandez
and forced his way into his house.
	   The state human rights commission is looking into the suspects'
claims that they had been tortured and that they were held for
several days before being presented before a judge. Under Mexican
law, suspects must appear before a judge within 48 hours of their
arrest.

United Nations convenes emergency session on Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with resolution being adopted, Brazil
trying unsuccessfully to go softer on government based on offer of
cooperation. No Pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council called an emergency
meeting Thursday to demand the Angolan government and particularly
UNITA rebels let a U.N. team reach the site of a downed
U.N.-chartered plane.
	   The council adopted a resolution condemning inaction on both
sides in trying to determine the fate of the 14 people on board the
C-130 cargo plane, which crashed Saturday over the central
highlands of the former Portuguese colony.
	   After repeated appeals, the Angolan government on Thursday
offered the United Nations full cooperation in trying to reach the
crash site, which is in contested territory, according to a letter
received by the council.
	   The Portuguese-drafted resolution makes a vague threat of taking
further action by Jan. 11 if such cooperation isn't forthcoming
from both sides, but doesn't provide explicitly for any military
intervention.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, however, has warned that the
1,000-member U.N. Observer Mission in Angola could be withdrawn by
February if fighting in the southwestern African nation doesn't
stop.
	   The meeting came as the United Nations began evacuating staff
from Huambo, Angola's second-largest city, after a rebel artillery
barrage that killed at least eight people and wounded at least 20
civilians. The plane went down near Huambo, 300 miles (500
kilometers) southeast of Luanda.
	   The United Nations mediated Angola's 1994 peace accord, which
ended a two-decade civil war. Since 1997, U.N. observers have been
overseeing its implementation.
	   The resolution asks both UNITA and the government to ``clarify
the circumstances of this tragedy and to permit the prompt dispatch
of a United Nations search and rescue mission.''
	   It demands in particular that UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
immediately give the U.N. team safety guarantees to search the
site.
	   And it expresses its concern at the increase in such incidents
since fighting in the onetime Cold War battle zone resumed.
	   Based on Angola's offer of cooperation, council member Brazil _
another former Portuguese colony _ urged the resolution come down
harder on UNITA rather than the government, but was unsuccessful,
council diplomats said.
	   Other council members noted that while the government had
offered its willingness to help, it hadn't actually carried out
what would normally be considered the most routine of
investigations into a plane crash on its territory.
	   The council has blamed UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, for the return
to war.
	   UNITA refused to yield areas under its control and maintained a
hidden army, according to the United Nations. The fighting resumed
when government troops tried to take the strongholds by force and
were beaten back.
	   The country has been ravaged by conflict since gaining
independence from Portugal in 1975. A 1991 peace deal collapsed the
following year when UNITA rejected its defeat in the country's
first democratic elections.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The Angolan government has offered the
United Nations its full cooperation in trying to reach the site of
a downed U.N.-chartered plane to determine the fate of the 14
people on board, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
	   The government announced its decision Thursday after repeated
appeals from the United Nations following last Saturday's crash
near the central highland city of Huambo, according to spokesman
Hamadoun Toure.
	   He declined to give further details.
	   Toure said there was no response yet from the UNITA rebel group,
engaged in fighting with the government's army in that area since
early this month.
	   The offer of help came hours before the Security Council held an
emergency meeting in New York in which it passed a resolution
condemning inaction by both the Angolan government and the UNITA
rebel group in reaching the crash victims.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said he had received
no request from the United Nations to allow the deployment of a
rescue team.

Arafat renews vow for statehood, calls upon Israelis to make peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; PRECEDE Jerusalem
 &UR; RECASTS with Arafat calling for Israeli people to work for peace,
renewing statehood promise
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Thursday called upon the Israeli people to work together for peace
and renewed his pledge to build a Palestinian state.
	   ``I call upon every member of every Israeli family ... let's
work together for peace,'' Arafat said in a statement released by
Wafah, the Palestinian news agency, in honor of the 34th
anniversary of his Fatah movement.
	   At a rally in Gaza Thursday, Arafat also called upon supporters
not to give up ``until we achieve a Palestinian state with its
capital in holy Jerusalem.''
	   He did not say when such a state would be established.
	   Arafat has made contradictory statements in recent months about
whether he would unilaterally declare a state on May 4, the
deadline for reaching a permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to walk
away from the peace talks and annex parts of the West Bank if
Arafat goes ahead with a unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   Israeli elections are scheduled for May 17, and it is believed
that a Palestinian declaration of statehood on May 4 would give a
boost to Netanyahu over his dovish challengers.
	   Thursday's statement was apparently designed to reach above the
heads of Israeli leaders and reassure the Israeli voting public.
	   ``We started a revolution 34 years ago in order to achieve a
free life for Palestinians,'' the statement said. ``We paid a heavy
price in these 34 years, and now our people are ready ... to live
under the umbrella of peace.''
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath suggested earlier
Thursday that the Palestinians might be willing to hold off for a
while on declaring a state.
	   ``The sovereign state of Palestine will be declared in 1999, I
have no doubt,'' Shaath told Israel army radio.
	   ``But I still say that our preference is that we will finish
together the permanent status negotiations,'' he added, saying that
he did not want the declaration of a Palestinian state to become
the source of problems between the two people.
	   The Haaretz newspaper reported Thursday that Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak asked Arafat during recent talks to delay a
declaration of a state so as not to interfere in the Israeli
elections.

No. 10 Tulane 41, Brigham Young 27
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERESA M. WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Maybe No. 10 Tulane will get some
respect now.
	   Michael Jordan returned an interception 79 yards for a touchdown
and Shaun King threw for two TDs and ran for one as Tulane beat
Brigham Young 41-27 Thursday afternoon in the Liberty Bowl,
clinching the Green Wave's best season ever at 12-0.
	   Tulane came in as one of only two undefeated teams in Division
I-A, with Tennessee (12-0). But the Green Wave, with its Conference
USA schedule, wasn't part of the Bowl Championship Series.
	   So the Green Wave had something to prove, and got the chance
against Brigham Young (9-5), making its 22nd bowl appearance in 28
years.
	   King shredded a defense that ranked fifth nationally, going
23-of-38 for 276 yards and rushing 16 times for 109 yards as Tulane
went one better than an 11-1 record in 1931.
	   It was the Green Wave's first bowl victory since the 1970
Liberty Bowl, improving the school's bowl record to 3-6.
	   New coach Chris Scelfo wound up a winner in his coaching debut
in place of Tommy Bowden, who left a month ago for Clemson. Before
Bowden's arrival in 1997, the Green Wave had won only 11 games in
five years and hadn't had a winning record in 16 years. Tulane
completed its miraculous turnaround without him.

Can a wild-card game participant equal Denver's 1997 feat?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Arizona Cardinals are in a playoff game for
the first time in 16 years.
	   Dallas, Green Bay and San Francisco are back as usual, and so
are New England and Miami.
	   Four-year-old Jacksonville is in for the third time and
Buffalo's back with Doug Flutie.
	   But can any of those teams in this weekend's wild-card games
make it to the Super Bowl?
	   Only with a lot of luck.
	   Give Green Bay, which opens in San Francisco, the best shot,
largely because it's getting back some of the injured players that
made this such an up-and-down season. Also, most of the current
Packers have been through the playoff grind many times before. San
Francisco and Dallas have the experience, but too many holes to
likely advance beyond the second round.
	   So the four teams with byes _ Minnesota, Denver, the New York
Jets and Atlanta _ have the best shot at being in Pro Player
Stadium on Jan. 31.
	   The wild-card round starts Saturday with Buffalo at Miami,
followed by Arizona at Dallas. On Sunday, New England is at
Jacksonville, followed by Green Bay at San Francisco.
	   Next weekend, the home teams will be Atlanta, Denver, the Jets
and Minnesota in that order.
	   Minnesota and Denver, the top seeds, will play the lower of the
winning seeds, while the Falcons and Jets, each No. 2, will play
the higher seeds.
	   In the NFC, Dallas is seeded third, San Francisco fourth, Green
Bay fifth and Arizona six.
	   In the AFC, Jacksonville is three, Miami four, Buffalo five and
Miami six.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Green Bay (11-5) at San Francisco (12-4) &QC; 
	   This was the NFC championship game last season, but both teams
have slipped badly despite their records. Neither would consider
the season a success unless they get at least as far as the NFC
title game and probably to the Super Bowl.
	   The Packers won 36-22 in Green Bay on Nov. 1, giving them five
straight wins over the 49ers, three in the playoffs. This week,
they welcomed back Robert Brooks, Vonnie Holliday, Mark Chmura and
Craig Newsome from injuries of varying degrees.
 &UR; Buffalo (10-6) at Miami (10-6) &QC; 
	   Doug Flutie vs. Dan Marino in the city that made Dougie famous,
site of the ``Hail Mary'' in 1984 that beat the University of Miami
for Boston College.
	   Flutie didn't play in the first Bills-Dolphins game, a 13-7
Miami win. But he helped rally Buffalo to a 30-24 win at home.
	   Miami was 7-1 at home and allowed only 82 points there. But this
game might have turned when defensive end Jason Taylor, one of the
most important players in Jimmy Johnson's defense, broke his
collarbone in Atlanta last Sunday.
	   Because the Super Bowl is in Miami, this has been a target year
for the Dolphins, although their chances now look marginal.
 &UR; Arizona (9-7) at Dallas (10-6) &QC; 
	   Will the Cardinals, who won seven games by three points or less,
just be happy to be here, or are they anxious to erase another blot
on the franchise's escutcheon _ 51 years without a playoff win?
	   The Cardinals could have a shot because of another Sanders,
Deion, who will probably rest his injured toe again.
	   This could be high scoring. The Cowboys, who have beaten Arizona
nine straight times at Texas Stadium and 16 of 17 times overall,
won both regular-season games, 38-10 at home and 35-28 on the road.
 &UR; New England (9-7) at Jacksonville (11-5) &QC; 
	   Which quarterbacks show up? Scott Zolak for New England against
Jonathan Quinn or Mark Brunell. The decision won't be made until
late, but it's already clear that Drew Bledsoe (broken finger)
won't play for the Patriots and Brunell (high ankle sprain) will
try.
	   It that happens, it's a big edge for the Jaguars, who looked
good beating a listless Pittsburgh team 21-3 in a meaningless game
Monday night.
	   If Quinn starts, the Pats have a decent shot, because Zolak is
by far the more experienced and poised.

Israel will attack Lebanon if hit by Katyusha rockets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will strike targets within Lebanon if
rockets are fired into northern Israel, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday.
	   ``Israel sees the Lebanese government as directly responsible
for what happens in southern Lebanon and demands that it stops all
activity against Israel,'' Netanyahu said in the statement released
after a late-night Security Cabinet meeting to discuss escalating
tensions along the Lebanese border.
	   The statement also said that Israel would try to avoid harming
civilians.
	   Israel and Hezbollah have been engaged in a guerrilla war in
Lebanon since 1985. For the most part, Israel has responded to
Katyusha rocket attacks by striking positions inside and just
beyond its self-described security zone.
	   Thursday's announcement suggested that Israel would widen the
scope of the conflict to include targets well beyond the security
zone, as several ministers demanded prior to the Cabinet meeting.
	   The Security Cabinet apparently rejected the proposal,
reportedly presented by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, to withdraw
unilaterally from Lebanon, saying in the statement that Israel
would continue to protect security zone residents family members of
those serving in the Israeli-backed Lebanese militia.
	   Last week, Hezbollah guerrillas fired dozens of rockets into
northern Israel, injuring 16 people and causing a pregnant woman to
go into premature labor and lose the twins she was carrying.
	   The attack was in retaliation for an Israeli air raid that
killed seven Lebanese civilians. Israel said the civilian
casualties were accidental.
	   Hezbollah, along with the Lebanese government and its Syrian
allies, demands that Israel pull about 2,000 soldiers out of its
occupied zone in southern Lebanon.

	   SAN`A, Yemen _ The luggage carried by a porter into the elevator
of an Aden hotel was enough to remind Laurence Whitehouse of the
tragedy that had suddenly overturned his life.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' the tearful British teacher said, pointing
to a bag. His wife Margaret was one of four hostages who died as
Yemeni troops tried to rescue 16 Western hostages _ 12 Britons, two
Americans and two Australians _ from Islamic militant kidnappers.
	   Whitehouse and nine other former hostages who survived the drama
without wounds tried to put their lives together Thursday.
	   They collected their belongings, and those of dead loved ones,
in the hotel lobby. Then they flew from southern Yemen to San`a,
the capital in the north, where they were to spend a night before
flying out of the country Friday for Europe.
	   The bodies of the slain hostages were due to be flown to Britain
on Friday. The dead were identified as Ruth Williamson, 34, Peter
Rowe, a 60-year-old lecturer at the University of Durham, and
Margaret Whitehouse _ all Britons _ and Australian Andrew Thirsk,
35, from Sydney.
	   Two wounded hostages, an unidentified American woman with a
pelvis wound and Claire Marston, Rowe's wife who was shot in the
shoulder, remained in the hospital in Aden Thursday night.
	   Before leaving Aden, each hostage was interviewed by Yemeni
security officials for their account of the killings.
	   Some former hostages already have disputed the government's
statement that the security forces intervened after the kidnappers
began killing their captives.
	   Eric Firkins of Croydon, England, says the kidnappers were
leading the hostages to a mountain hideout when they heard gunfire.
	   ``The army approached us and the nearer they got, the more tense
the situation in our group became,'' said another former hostage,
Brian Smith of Peterborough, England.
	   He said the shooting then started in earnest, with bullets
whizzing over their heads and shells crashing against surrounding
mountains or exploding in the air.
	   The former hostages said they were forced to stand with their
hands in the air to shield the gunmen. When the hostages staggered
back, the kidnappers shot two of them in revenge.
	   Whitehouse recalled how his wife Margaret dropped to her knees
to try to help the wounded Australian Andrew Thirsk.
	   He said a militant tried to use her as a shield. But she
resisted, continuing to kneel beside Thirsk.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg,'' Whitehouse said. ``I
tried to move her, but another kidnapper clung on to me and kept
the machine gun dug into my neck. Then I saw a bullet hit Margaret
in the head. She was dead the instant it hit her. She never stood a
chance.
	   ``They wouldn't let me go to her and she just lay there,
bleeding in the dirt,'' Whitehouse said.
	   Before the shooting began, the kidnappers had moved the hostages
in two groups. Freed hostages from neither group have accused the
militants of killing people before the firing started.
	   However, Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab insisted at a
news conference in San`a Thursday that it was the kidnappers'
killing of the hostages that forced the security forces to
intervene.
	   Arab said the kidnappers had given government negotiators one
hour to meet their demands and then threatened to start killing the
hostages.
	   Troops heard that the killing had begun from a Yemeni driver who
was held with the hostages but escaped, he said.
	   ``The troops heard gunfire and intervened swiftly to save the
hostages,'' he said.
	   Arab also said the group to which the kidnappers belonged,
Islamic Jihad, was planning to bomb the British Consulate in Aden,
a camp of American military experts, Aden International Airport,
the offices of the United Nations, churches and hotels.
	   Yemeni officials have said the kidnappers had demanded the
release of two Islamic Jihad leaders and had said they were
retaliating for the recent U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq. The
leaders had been seized in a crackdown on Islamic vigilantes.
	   Tribesmen have kidnapped scores of foreigners in the past to win
economic concessions from the government, but they have usually
freed them safely.
	   This was the first time foreigners had been abducted by Islamic
militants.
	   Four Germans kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen on Dec. 7 were set
free unharmed on Wednesday. Germany diplomats said the former
hostages arrived in San`a early Thursday and were scheduled to fly
home on Friday.

Union has final offer but won't give it to league
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The NBA players union refused to give its
``final'' offer to the owners Thursday after a disagreement on
whether it should be delivered by mail, by fax or in person.
	   Commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter spoke
by telephone early in the day, and the league issued a news release
saying the offer would be forwarded to the owners' labor relations
committee.
	   But the momentum broke down in the afternoon when union attorney
Jeffrey Kessler objected to the lack of a face-to-face meeting.
	   ``They refused to meet with us, so we're not giving it to
them,'' Kessler said. ``That's no way to negotiate. We'll sit on
this until Jan. 7 if we have to.
	   ``If they want to find out what's in it, they're going to have
to meet. This is not a game. It's time to bargain in good faith,
and the posturing has to stop,'' Kessler said.
	   Sources close to the union who spoke on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that the proposal includes an absolute
maximum salary for all players. The union previously agreed to
limit the salaries of only those players with less than 10 years'
experience.
	   The union also was ready ask for lower minimum salaries for
veterans and to move off its demand for 57 percent of revenues,
dropping as low as 55 percent, sources said. The owners have
offered between 53 and 54 percent.
	   ``We have already made our final offer, so if theirs doesn't
look a lot like ours then it's not going to be accepted,'' NBA
chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin said.
	   ``We've told them that if they have a final offer then, please,
give it to us. But there's not going to be a meeting until we see
it and the committee evaluates it. For them to say we have to have
a meeting, that's playing games,'' Mishkin said.
	   The lockout will move into its seventh month Friday, with only
one seven days left before the league's Board of Governors meet. If
no agreement is reached by next Friday, Stern and deputy
commissioner Russ Granik have said they will recommend canceling
the season.
	   Three months have already been lost as the sides fight over how
to divide almost dlrs 2 billion in annual revenue.
	   If an agreement is reached before Stern's deadline, a 45- to
50-game schedule likely would begin in early February.
	   The league, union and arbitrator John Feerick participated in a
conference call to discuss the case of three players _ Nick Van
Exel, Marcus Camby and Reggie Slater _ who want to play the rest of
the season in Europe.
	   The three players want unconditional clearance to play overseas,
even if the lockout ends, and want their case resolved by Monday _
the deadline for Euro League teams to submit playoff-eligible
rosters.
	   Feerick, however, told the union it could submit a brief on
behalf of the players by Jan. 15, and the league can submit a
rebuttal by Jan. 29.
	   James Bryant, agent for the three players, did not return a
phone call for comment.
	   Feerick, dean of the Fordham Law School, ruled in a key NBA case
during the summer, deciding that owners didn't have to pay players
with guaranteed contracts during the lockout.
	   Stern and Hunter haven't met since last weekend when the league
made its ``final'' offer in Denver and the union rejected it.
	   If the union's newest proposal is ever presented, Mishkin said
it will be forwarded to the Labor Relations Committee and ``we will
inform the union of the committee's response.''
	   ``We have assured the union that if no further meetings between
the negotiating committees are scheduled prior to Jan. 7, the
union's final proposal will be put before the Board of Governors
when it votes that day.''

Gators, Orangemen say they belong in Orange Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF SHAIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Some critics say No. 18 Syracuse shouldn't be
playing in the Orange Bowl with three losses.
	   Others argue No. 7 Florida shouldn't have received an at-large
invitation when one-loss teams like Arizona and Kansas State were
left out of the Bowl Championship Series.
	   The Orangemen and Gators are offering no apologies.
	   ``They designed this so you have two teams that are very
talented on both sides of the football,'' Syracuse wide receiver
Kevin Johnson said. ``Whoever wins this, they'll probably say they
deserved to be in the BCS.''
	   The Orange Bowl features the worst combined record of the four
major bowls, making it a favorite target of those unhappy with the
new selection process.
	   Syracuse (8-3) was guaranteed a berth by winning the Big East,
the weakest conference in the BCS system. And the Gators (9-2) got
the nod over Kansas State and Arizona because of their ability to
generate ticket sales.
	   No one involved will dispute those appraisals. But as Florida
coach Steve Spurrier points out, life isn't always fair.
	   ``If we were 11-1 and if the bowl game was in Kansas City, I'm
sure Kansas State would get invited,'' Spurrier said. ``Being in
Florida, we have a great advantage to being invited to bowl games
in Florida. I guess it's another reason to come play football in
Florida.''
	   The Gators were closer than most recall to playing for the
national title, losing to both No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida
State.
	   Florida fell to Tennessee 20-17 when a field-goal attempt by
Collins Cooper went wide in overtime. Even so, the Gators still
might have found themselves swept into the Fiesta Bowl if not for
an uncharacteristic meltdown in a 23-12 loss to the Florida State.
The Gators failed to score in the second half, squandering a 12-6
lead.
	   Injuries and inconsistency have kept the Gators from being as
explosive as previous years. Florida's 461.9 yards and 31.7 points
per game still ranked near the top of the Southeastern Conference,
but the lack of a running game hurt deeply.
	   ``We need to mix it up,'' Spurrier said. ``We hope to run it and
we hope to throw it and we need to play some offense if we're going
to have a chance.''
	   Syracuse brings its own brand of fireworks, with quarterback
Donovan McNabb the catalyst. The do-everything senior has thrown
for 2,134 yards and 22 touchdowns this season and rushed for 438
yards and eight TDs, accounting for 54 percent of the Orangemen's
offense.
	   ``If Donovan's hot, we're hot,'' Johnson said. ``If Donovan's
cold, we're cold.''

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Promoter Roger Levitt remained upbeat Thursday
about the prospects for the George Foreman-Larry Holmes fight set
for Jan. 23, although it was unclear whether he had met financial
deadlines.
	   ``The fight is doing fine,'' Levitt said at midday. ``We believe
the fight is 100 percent on. We're doing some financial
machinations with George and Larry. We're confident by the close of
business Monday, we'll be OK.''
	   Foreman is to receive dlrs 10 million and Holmes dlrs 4 million
and both have said they would not take less for the fight. The
status of the bout was clouded when one of its major backers pulled
out last week. Levitt said a replacement backer had been located
this week. So far, Foreman has received dlrs 1 million and Holmes
dlrs 400,000 _ both nonrefundable.
	   The promoter was supposed to file letters of credit assuring the
purses of the two ex-heavyweight champions by the close of business
Thursday.
	   ``We had an extension for the letters of credit until the close
of business Los Angeles time,'' he said. ``We might need another
extension.
	   ``There's been amazing good will by the fighters. Everybody
wants this fight to take place. In my honest opinion, it will. I
believe the fight will happen because they want it to happen.''
	   Levitt was unavailable late Thursday afternoon to say whether he
had the letters of credit in place.

Union agrees to cap all salaries, but offer sits undelivered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New lead to raise reference to upcoming concession on
contracts &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The NBA players union is ready to offer owners
an unprecedented concession _ a limit on the amount of money any
player can earn. The problem Thursday was how to get the offer into
the commissioner's hands.
	   David Stern and union director Billy Hunter spoke by telephone
early in the day, and the National Basketball Association issued a
news release saying the offer would be forwarded to the owners'
labor relations committee.
	   But the momentum broke down in the afternoon when union attorney
Jeffrey Kessler objected to the lack of a face-to-face bargaining
session at which the offer could be presented.
	   ``They refused to meet with us, so we're not giving it to
them,'' Kessler said. ``That's no way to negotiate. We'll sit on
this until Jan. 7 if we have to.
	   ``If they want to find out what's in it, they're going to have
to meet. This is not a game. It's time to bargain in good faith,
and the posturing has to stop,'' Kessler said.
	   Sources close to the union who spoke on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that the proposal includes an absolute
maximum salary for all players. The union previously agreed to
limit the salaries of only those players with less than 10 years'
experience.
	   The owners had been asking for an absolute maximum of dlrs 12.25
million for players with 10 years experience, while the union's
offer was expected to come in somewhere around dlrs 15 million.
	   The union also was ready ask for lower minimum salaries for
veterans and to move off its demand for 57 percent of revenues,
dropping as low as 55 percent, sources said. The owners have
offered between 53 and 54 percent.
	   ``We have already made our final offer, so if theirs doesn't
look a lot like ours then it's not going to be accepted,'' NBA
chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin said.
	   ``We've told them that if they have a final offer then, please,
give it to us. But there's not going to be a meeting until we see
it and the committee evaluates it. For them to say we have to have
a meeting, that's playing games,'' Mishkin said.
	   The lockout will move into its seventh month Friday, with only
one seven days left before the league's Board of Governors meet. If
no agreement is reached by next Friday, Stern and deputy
commissioner Russ Granik have said they will recommend canceling
the season.
	   Three months have already been lost as the sides fight over how
to divide almost dlrs 2 billion in annual revenue.
	   If an agreement is reached before Stern's deadline, a 45- to
50-game schedule likely would begin in early February.
	   The league, union and arbitrator John Feerick participated in a
conference call to discuss the case of three players _ Nick Van
Exel, Marcus Camby and Reggie Slater _ who want to play the rest of
the season in Europe.
	   The three players want unconditional clearance to play overseas,
even if the lockout ends, and want their case resolved by Monday _
the deadline for Euro League teams to submit playoff-eligible
rosters.
	   Feerick, however, told the union it could submit a brief on
behalf of the players by Jan. 15, and the league can submit a
rebuttal by Jan. 29.
	   James Bryant, agent for the three players, did not return a
phone call for comment.
	   Feerick, dean of the Fordham Law School, ruled in a key NBA case
during the summer, deciding that owners didn't have to pay players
with guaranteed contracts during the lockout.
	   Stern and Hunter haven't met since last weekend when the league
made its ``final'' offer in Denver and the union rejected it.
	   If the union's newest proposal is ever presented, Mishkin said
it will be forwarded to the Labor Relations Committee and ``we will
inform the union of the committee's response.''
	   ``We have assured the union that if no further meetings between
the negotiating committees are scheduled prior to Jan. 7, the
union's final proposal will be put before the Board of Governors
when it votes that day.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks slid into the close of 1998,
but the Nasdaq market set another record as investors sought out
better values among smaller-company stocks. The Dow Jones
industrial average dropped 93.21 points _ or by 1 percent _ at
9,181.43, about 200 points below the Nov. 23 record of 9,374.27,
but a still impressive gain of 16.2 percent for the year.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Europe's leaders proclaimed a new era
Thursday as 11 nations, including the continent's biggest economic
powers, merged currencies to create the euro, a shared money they
say will boost business, underpin unity and strengthen their role
in world affairs. ``If the postwar era ended nine years ago with
the fall of the Berlin Wall, then our future begins on Jan. 1,
1999,'' German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wrote in the
Handelsblatt business daily. At the stroke of midnight on New
Year's Eve, after years of preparation, the euro becomes the common
currency of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg. (THE
EURO)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Returning to a pet theme, German Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine hinted he favors further interest rate
cuts by the European Central Bank on Thursday, just hours before
the launch of the euro. In an article published in Germany's
business daily Handelsblatt, Lafontaine said interest rate cuts in
early December in the 11 countries joining the euro were ``a right
step.'' The coordinated cuts on Dec. 3 lowered the ECB's key
interest rate to 3 percent. ``With a stability-oriented financial
and wage policy, the ECB has more room for a monetary policy that
supports growth and employment,'' Lafontaine wrote. Since taking
office in October, Lafontaine has stirred controversy with repeated
calls for lower rates to help Europe's governments fight
chronically high unemployment and flagging growth.
(GERMANY-INTEREST RATES)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government pinned a number Thursday to the
weakening ruble, announcing that its value had dropped almost 70
percent over the last four months in relation to the U.S. dollar.
And it announced that annual inflation, which appeared under
control until the financial crisis hit in August, reached 84.4
percent in 1998. Russia is caught in the worst economic slide since
the Soviet collapse seven years ago, sparked by the Asian financial
crisis, falling world prices for oil _ Russia's biggest export
earner _ and successive governments' chronic inability to finance
expenditures. In 1998, the country's gross domestic product shrank
5 percent and industrial production by 5.5 percent, the Economy
Ministry said Thursday. Foreign trade declined by 13.6 percent in
the first 11 months of the year, and exports to countries outside
the former Soviet Union dropped 17.6 percent from last year,
reaching dlrs 57.7 billion, the ministry said. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Analysts say it's too soon to tell if last
week's unexpectedly big jump in unemployment claims is a sign that
tough times abroad are hitting U.S. companies harder. ``I wouldn't
read too much into it,'' said Mark M. Zandi an economist with
Regional Financial Associates. ``We'll have to see early next year
if these high unemployment claims are maintained.'' The number of
Americans filing for unemployment benefits during the week ending
the day after Christmas rose by 79,000 to a seasonally adjusted
368,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's the biggest
weekly increase since July of 1992. It pushed claims to their
highest level since summer, when a General Motors strike
temporarily boosted unemployment. (US-JOBLESS CLAIMS)
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's inflation rate in 1998 was
about 30 percent, the lowest in 12 years but still one of the
highest in Latin America. The December consumer price index rose
29.9 percent from December 1997, the Central Bank reported
Thursday. That was the lowest since 1986's inflation rate of 12.7,
according to calculations by Dow Jones Newswires. Annual inflation
was 37.6 percent in 1997 and 103.2 percent in 1996. This year's
relatively low inflation came at the cost of an economic tailspin.
After failing to control inflation earlier in the year, the Central
Bank sharply increased interest rates and put the breaks on the
economy. According to preliminary figures, gross domestic product
will contract 0.7 percent this year versus 5.9 percent growth in
1997. (VENEZUELA-INFLATION)

World welcomes 1999 with fireworks and hope

	   LONDON (AP) _ The world offered a high-spirited welcome to the
last year of the second millennium, with fireworks in Scotland,
pilgrimages to shrines and temples in Asia, and the annual descent
of a 500-pound (227-kilo) aluminum ball in New York.
	   Pope John Paul II reminded Roman Catholics to prepare for
Christianity's millennium jubilee only a year away. And in many
countries, leaders spoke to their countrymen and women of hope for
a better future.
	   Fireworks soared above the cheering crowds in Moscow's Red
Square, where lights played on the Kremlin and the famous onion
domes of St. Basil's Cathedral, and Russians and foreign visitors
welcomed 1999 to the accompaniment of popping champagne corks.
	   At Times Square, New York's own traditional gathering place, the
city went big, bright and brash, with a 16-foot-tall roving Father
Time puppet, 15,000-balloon release and a spotlight said to be
visible from Mars. The old New Year's Eve ball is making its last
descent down One Times Square before it is replaced by a successor
next December.
	   Thousands of Parisians thronged the Champs Elysees under trees
decked with white lights.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, where New Year's is called Hogmany, the
biggest celebration of the year, bands played in the park and
fireworks filled the sky over Edinburgh castle with colored lights.
	   In London, tens of thousands of revelers jammed Trafalgar Square
and cheered wildly as Big Ben rang out 1998. Police have been
trying to discourage the traditional gathering of thousands there,
because of the potential for injuries in such large, boisterous
crowds. But thousands of the most ebullient crowded into the square
nonetheless.
	   An open air party at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate offered about 100
entertainers and a midnight fireworks show.
	   Things were a little quieter in Frankfurt, headquarters of the
new European Central Bank, which will set monetary policy from the
stroke of midnight for 11 nations sharing a single currency. Late
into the eveningm, lights shone from the windows of bank
skyscrapers as employees worked to refigure computer records, but
firecrackers popped and fizzed in the streets.
	   In most Arab countries, New Year celebrations were subdued this
year because the event coincided with the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan _ a period when governments close nightclubs and impose
strict rules on serving alcohol.
	   There were no street decorations or lighting in the major cities
and restaurants and hotels could not lay on special festivities.
	   But many Arabs invited friends and relatives to private parties
in their homes.
	   In Cairo, the big hotels adorned the faces of their buildings
with lights strung in the shape of a Ramadan lantern. Pleasure
boats decked with gaudy lights cruised the Nile, their speakers
blaring out Arab songs, but this had more to do with Thursday's
being the end of the week than with New Year's.
	   In Iran, where the New Year is celebrated about March 21,
President Mohammad Khatami sent a traditional greeting to the
Christian world.
	   Khatami said people everywhere should interpret the teachings of
Jesus Christ ``with emphasis on compassion for fellow human beings,
respecting others, dialogue with the opposition, tolerance and
detente towards others,'' the official Islamic News Agency
reported.
	   ``I hope the year 1999, which is a link between the two
millenniums, will be a year filled with blessings, peace,
cordiality and love among men,'' the president said, according to a
British Broadcasting Corp. translation received in Cairo.
	   In taped messages, other world leaders urged their peoples to
end sectarian strike, and to have hope in the future.
	   In his last New Year's message before leaving office, President
Nelson Mandela on Thursday challenged South Africans to continue
working together to solve the problems of poverty and corruption,
legacies of the apartheid decades.
	   ``The New Year will bring many changes,'' Mandela said in the
broadcast message. ``They will depend on our working together to
realize our dream.''
	   Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called on Russians to meet 1999
with optimism and pride in their country.
	   ``What can I say: The year was difficult for the country, for
many of you, and for me, too. But New Year's Eve is always about
new hopes, new dreams, new plans,'' Yeltsin said, according to a
transcript released by the Interfax news agency.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern spoke of the Good
Friday peace agreement in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   ``The fantastic support of people .. for an agreed Ireland of
dialogue, mutual respect and common endeavor is the surest
guarantee yet that we will succeed in making this an island of
peace and prosperity for all - especially for our children,'' Ahern
said.

Arafat renews vow for statehood, calls upon Israelis to make peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to RECAST with Arafat calling for Israeli people to
work for peace, renewing statehood promise &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
called upon the Israeli people to work together for peace and
renewed his pledge to build a Palestinian state.
	   ``I call upon every member of every Israeli family ... let's
work together for peace,'' Arafat said in a statement released
Thursday by Wafah, the Palestinian news agency, in honor of the
34th anniversary of his Fatah movement.
	   At a rally in Gaza Thursday, Arafat also called upon supporters
not to give up ``until we achieve a Palestinian state with its
capital in holy Jerusalem.''
	   He did not say when such a state would be established.
	   Arafat has made contradictory statements in recent months about
whether he would unilaterally declare a state on May 4, the
deadline for reaching a permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to walk
away from the peace talks and annex parts of the West Bank if
Arafat goes ahead with a unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   Israeli elections are scheduled for May 17, and it is believed
that a Palestinian declaration of statehood on May 4 would give a
boost to Netanyahu over his dovish challengers.
	   Thursday's statement was apparently designed to reach above the
heads of Israeli leaders and reassure the Israeli voting public.
	   ``We started a revolution 34 years ago in order to achieve a
free life for Palestinians,'' the statement said. ``We paid a heavy
price in these 34 years, and now our people are ready ... to live
under the umbrella of peace.''
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath suggested earlier
Thursday that the Palestinians might be willing to hold off for a
while on declaring a state.
	   ``The sovereign state of Palestine will be declared in 1999, I
have no doubt,'' Shaath told Israel army radio.
	   ``But I still say that our preference is that we will finish
together the permanent status negotiations,'' he added, saying that
he did not want the declaration of a Palestinian state to become
the source of problems between the two people.
	   The Haaretz newspaper reported Thursday that Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak asked Arafat during recent talks to delay a
declaration of a state so as not to interfere in the Israeli
elections.

	   NEW YORK _ The world offered a high-spirited welcome to the last
year of the second millennium, with fireworks in Scotland,
pilgrimages to shrines and temples in Asia, and the gathering of
hundreds of thousands of revelers in New York for the annual
descent of a 500-pound (227-kilo) aluminum ball. Partygoers took to
the streets in Europe's capitals Thursday night to welcome the last

fireworks and temple bells. Pope John Paul II reminded Roman
Catholics to prepare for Christianity's millennium jubilee only a
year away. And in many countries, leaders spoke to their countrymen
and women of hope for a better future. (NEW YEAR'S WORLD ROUNDUP)
	   LUANDA, Angola _ The Angolan government offered the United
Nations its full cooperation in trying to reach the site of a
downed U.N.-chartered plane to determine the fate of the 14 people
on board. The government announced the decision Thursday after
repeated appeals from the United Nations following last Saturday's
crash near the central highland city of Huambo. The offer of help

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ The coalition of West African troops
protecting Sierra Leone's elected president exchange artillery fire
near the capital with insurgents who have been advancing toward
Freetown in recent days. Diplomats and Defense Ministry officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity say heavy shelling rocked the
hills south of Freetown. A senior commander with the West African
defense force, known as ECOMOG, said troops had driven the rebels
back from their positions in the hills. There were no immediate
reports of casualties, but thousands of civilians in the area fled
to Freetown, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the north. (SIERRA

	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ Two former Khmer Rouge leaders
and their well-dressed wives, children and grandchildren received a
government-arranged pleasure tour of the country they ravaged in
the 1970s, a trip that is expected to take them through the killing
fields of their murderous rule. High-level officials and soldiers
armed with assault rifles escorted the motorcade of
chauffeur-driven Toyota Land Cruisers Thursday to the seaside
resort of Sihanoukville, 110 miles (180 kilometers) southwest of
the capital. The beneficial treatment of Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea is feeding growing anger among human rights and democracy
groups. (CAMBODIA-KHMER ROUGE)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's Congress has approved a budget that
leaves new taxes and spending cuts. It also leaves opposition
parties searching for their identity. Mexico's opposition parties
ended the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's 68-year
majority in Congress in the 1997 elections. But for the second
straight year, the two major opposition parties split over the
budget, allowing the governing party, known as the PRI, to push
through most of its own proposal. PRI legislators voted Thursday
with lawmakers from the center-right National Action Party to
approve a dlrs 103 billion budget, with new taxes and spending cuts
intended to offset a dlrs 2.86 billion shortfall caused by falling
oil prices. (MEXICO-POWERFUL PRI)

	   LONDON (AP) _ The world offered a high-spirited welcome to the
last year of the second millennium, with fireworks in Scotland,
pilgrimages to shrines and temples in Asia, and throngs of revelers
in New York's Times Square
	   Pope John Paul II reminded Roman Catholics to prepare for
Christianity's millennium jubilee only a year away. And in many
countries, leaders spoke to their countrymen and women of hope for
a better future.
	   Fireworks soared above the cheering crowds in Moscow's Red
Square, where lights played on the Kremlin and the famous onion
domes of St. Basil's Cathedral, and Russians and foreign visitors
welcomed 1999 to the accompaniment of popping champagne corks.
	   At Times Square, New York's own traditional gathering place,
crowds waited to see the final midnight descent of the old New
Year's Eve ball down One Times Square. It is replaced next
December.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hollywood is giving Tom Hanks and other stars
a facelift.
	   Tree roots and the rumbling of traffic on Vine Street have
damaged the Walk of Fame stars dedicated to Hanks, Lauren Bacall,
Doris Day, Shirley Temple, Tina Turner, Phyllis Diller and Andy
Garcia.
	   Repairs will begin next week as part of a dlrs 250,000
renovation of the sidewalk, the most popular Hollywood tourist
attraction.
	   ``We owe it to our honorees to keep their terrazzo trophy in
pristine condition,'' Hollywood's honorary mayor, Johnny Grant,
said Thursday.
	   The money for the renovation comes from star dedication
ceremonies and fund-raising events.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Simon Wiesenthal, the world's leading
Nazi hunter, marked his 90th birthday Thursday in his small office,
surrounded by countless books, files and testimonials of Holocaust
victims.
	   Wiesenthal survived 12 concentration camps before U.S. troops
freed him. He has spent his life since then documenting Adolf
Hitler's atrocities and hunting Nazi war criminals
	   He spent Thursday morning at work and planned a quite
celebration later in the day with his wife and daughter.
	   Wiesenthal counts as of his most spectacular successes the 1960
capture of Adolf Eichmann in Argentina. The Nazi henchman was
abducted by Israeli agents and taken to Israel, where he was tried
and executed.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ It wasn't quite the help they were
looking for.
	   A truck full of bread baked in 1988 arrived as humanitarian aid
last week in a village destroyed by floods last year, the CTK news
agency reported Thursday.
	   The German truck, sent to the village of Troubky, 180 miles (290
kilometers) east of Prague, was supposed to contain furniture and
old clothing. Instead, it was loaded with bread normally used by
soldiers in war conditions.
	   ``We couldn't believe our own eyes when we opened the truck,''
Deputy Mayor Radek Brazda said.
	   The bread was eventually used to feed poultry, Brazda said,
although some people tried it and said it ``tasted good.''
	   Troubky was hit hard by massive floods in the summer of 1997.
Nine people died and 330 houses _ almost half the village _ were
swept away.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Graeme Fraser, 43, put his law
practice on hold, packed his five children and wife in the car and
on Thursday was to kick off a potentially lucrative millennium
project. The family was launching a yearlong journey with a set of
four bells through nearly 300 small towns and villages in South
Africa. Fraser said the project _ that also involves runners from
local athletic clubs and schools _ offered a welcome break from 16
years practicing entertainment and corporate law. With the backing
of South African film producer Anant Singh, Fraser also planned to
sell 2,000 replicas of the bells and donate some of the proceeds to
a charity. At midnight Thursday, the Fraser family was to run with
the bells from a cross in Mossel Bay on the southern coast marking
the place where Bartolomeu Dias, the Portuguese explorer, landed in
1487.
	    &UR; ___
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Amy Grant and her husband are
splitting up.
	   The pop star and Christian music artist Gary Chapman announced
Wednesday that they're separating after 16 years of marriage.
	   Grant, 38, began her career in contemporary Christian music in
the late 1970s and crossed over to the pop charts in the 1980s with
hits such as ``The Next Time I Fall,'' a duet with Peter Cetera
that hit No. 1.
	   Ms. Grant and her husband have three children.

Hostages head to Yemen's capital after security interviews

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ It was just a piece of luggage, carried by a
porter into the elevator of an Aden hotel. Still, it unleashed a
torrent of sorrow in former hostage Laurence Whitehouse, who lost
his wife this week in a botched rescue attempt.
	   ``That's my wife's,'' the 54-year-old teacher said tearfully,
pointing to a bag.
	   Margaret Whitehouse was one of four tourists who died Tuesday
when Yemeni troops tried to rescue 16 Westerners _ 12 Britons, two
Americans and two Australians _ held hostage by Islamic militants.
Two other hostages were wounded.
	   Her husband and nine other captives who survived the ordeal
unscathed collected their belongings Thursday _ and in some cases
those of dead loved ones _ in the hotel lobby. Then, they flew from
southern Yemen to San`a, the capital in the north, where they were
to spend a night before flying to Europe on Friday.
	   The bodies of the slain hostages were to be flown to Britain on
Friday. The dead were identified as Britons Ruth Williamson, 34,
Peter Rowe, 60, and Margaret Whitehouse, 52, as well as Andrew
Thirsk, 35, of Sydney, Australia.
	   Two wounded hostages, an unidentified American woman with a
pelvis wound and Claire Marston, Rowe's wife who was shot in the
shoulder, remained hospitalized in Aden.
	   Yemeni security officials interviewed each hostage in Aden. And
Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab insisted once again at a
San`a news conference Thursday that security forces had moved in
for a rescue only after kidnappers had begun killing hostages.
	   In London, four British detectives left for Yemen on Thursday to
assist the government in its inquiry into the hostage-taking,
Scotland Yard police headquarters said.
	   In the past, Yemeni tribesmen have kidnapped scores of
foreigners to win economic concessions from the government, but
they generally have been freed unharmed. This was the first time
foreigners have been abducted by Islamic militants in Yemen.
	   According to Yemeni officials, the kidnappers demanded the
release of two Islamic Jihad leaders and said they were retaliating
for recent U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, four Germans kidnapped Dec. 7 by Yemeni tribesmen
were released unharmed Wednesday and were expected to fly home
Friday.
	   Arab said the kidnappers had given government negotiators just
an hour to release the two jailed leaders before they said they
would start killing hostages. A Yemeni driver who was held with the
hostages but escaped reported that the killings had begun by the
time the commando raid on the kidnappers' hideout was launched, he
said.
	   ``The troops heard gunfire and intervened swiftly to save the
hostages,'' he said.
	   Arab also said the group to which the kidnappers belonged,
Islamic Jihad, was planning to bomb the British Consulate in Aden,
a camp of American military experts, Aden International Airport,
U.N. offices, churches and hotels.
	   Some former hostages have disputed the government's statement
that security forces intervened after kidnappers began killing
captives. They say the kidnappers shot two hostages when they held
back after being ordered to stand as human shields.
	   Whitehouse blamed the kidnappers for the deaths and injuries.
	   ``The blame for this disaster, my wife's death, must lie with
the terrorists,'' he told Associated Press Television News. ``They
took us off a peaceful journey, down a road while we were on
holiday, enjoying the scenery of Yemen and meeting its people. ...
They are to blame.''
	   Whitehouse recalled Thursday how his wife, Margaret, dropped to
her knees to try to help the wounded Thirsk. He said a militant
tried to use her as a shield, but she resisted, continuing to kneel
beside Thirsk.
	   ``Then a bullet caught her in the leg,'' Whitehouse told
Britain's Press Association. ``I tried to move her, but another
kidnapper clung on to me and kept the machine gun dug into my neck.
Then I saw a bullet hit Margaret in the head. ... They wouldn't let
me go to her and she just lay there, bleeding in the dirt.''

Union agrees to cap all salaries, but offer sits undelivered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to RESTORE dropped word 'week' in 11th graf &QL;

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The NBA players union is ready to offer owners
an unprecedented concession _ a limit on the amount of money any
player can earn. The problem Thursday was how to get the offer into
the commissioner's hands.
	   David Stern and union director Billy Hunter spoke by telephone
early in the day, and the National Basketball Association issued a
news release saying the offer would be forwarded to the owners'
labor relations committee.
	   But the momentum broke down in the afternoon when union attorney
Jeffrey Kessler objected to the lack of a face-to-face bargaining
session at which the offer could be presented.
	   ``They refused to meet with us, so we're not giving it to
them,'' Kessler said. ``That's no way to negotiate. We'll sit on
this until Jan. 7 if we have to.
	   ``If they want to find out what's in it, they're going to have
to meet. This is not a game. It's time to bargain in good faith,
and the posturing has to stop,'' Kessler said.
	   Sources close to the union who spoke on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that the proposal includes an absolute
maximum salary for all players. The union previously agreed to
limit the salaries of only those players with less than 10 years'
experience.
	   The owners had been asking for an absolute maximum of dlrs 12.25
million for players with 10 years experience, while the union's
offer was expected to come in somewhere around dlrs 15 million.
	   The union also was ready ask for lower minimum salaries for
veterans and to move off its demand for 57 percent of revenues,
dropping as low as 55 percent, sources said. The owners have
offered between 53 and 54 percent.
	   ``We have already made our final offer, so if theirs doesn't
look a lot like ours then it's not going to be accepted,'' NBA
chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin said.
	   ``We've told them that if they have a final offer then, please,
give it to us. But there's not going to be a meeting until we see
it and the committee evaluates it. For them to say we have to have
a meeting, that's playing games,'' Mishkin said.
	   The lockout will move into its seventh month Friday, with only
one week left before the league's Board of Governors meet. If no
agreement is reached by next Friday, Stern and deputy commissioner
Russ Granik have said they will recommend canceling the season.
	   Three months have already been lost as the sides fight over how
to divide almost dlrs 2 billion in annual revenue.
	   If an agreement is reached before Stern's deadline, a 45- to
50-game schedule likely would begin in early February.
	   The league, union and arbitrator John Feerick participated in a
conference call to discuss the case of three players _ Nick Van
Exel, Marcus Camby and Reggie Slater _ who want to play the rest of
the season in Europe.
	   The three players want unconditional clearance to play overseas,
even if the lockout ends, and want their case resolved by Monday _
the deadline for Euro League teams to submit playoff-eligible
rosters.
	   Feerick, however, told the union it could submit a brief on
behalf of the players by Jan. 15, and the league can submit a
rebuttal by Jan. 29.
	   James Bryant, agent for the three players, did not return a
phone call for comment.
	   Feerick, dean of the Fordham Law School, ruled in a key NBA case
during the summer, deciding that owners didn't have to pay players
with guaranteed contracts during the lockout.
	   Stern and Hunter haven't met since last weekend when the league
made its ``final'' offer in Denver and the union rejected it.
	   If the union's newest proposal is ever presented, Mishkin said
it will be forwarded to the Labor Relations Committee and ``we will
inform the union of the committee's response.''
	   ``We have assured the union that if no further meetings between
the negotiating committees are scheduled prior to Jan. 7, the
union's final proposal will be put before the Board of Governors
when it votes that day.''

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Fires destroyed thousands of
stalls at two markets in El Salvador, killing three children and
leaving 18 people injured.
	   The larger fire destroyed half of the central market of San
Salvador, the capital, affecting more than 10,000 merchants in
2,500 small businesses selling clothing, food and other items.
	   The fire, believed to have been started by a short circuit,
burned for 10 hours Wednesday before firefighters brought it under
control. Losses were estimated at more than dlrs 1.3 million.
	   The other fire destroyed a market and three businesses Wednesday
in Apopa, a city north of the capital. Three children _ ages 3, 7
and 9 _ who were sleeping in a nearby house were killed.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The death toll in an explosion last
week at a sugar processing plant reached 11 on Thursday, when the
sole survivor of the blast died of burns from scalding sugar cane
juice.
	   Marco Antonio Mejia, 42, died of third-degree burns over 95
percent of his body he suffered during the Dec. 26 explosion in a
boiler at the Ingenio San Antonio plant in the northwestern
province of Chinandega.
	   Doctors at a Managua's Roberto Huembes Medical Center were
surprised that Mejia held on as long as he did. ``Only God's will
and Marco Antonio Mejia's supernatural resistance keep him alive,''
Dr. Larry Ubeda told reporters Tuesday.
	   The blast occurred when workers tried to fix a broken pump on
the boiler, and were sprayed with boiling cane juice. The 10 other
victims, all employees of the sugar mill, died within 48 hours of
the blast.
	   Labor Ministry investigators are expected to issue a report on
the accident in early January.

Rescuers seek to recover injured spelunker deep underground
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A rescue team on Friday reached a
cave explorer lying injured with a broken arm and leg some 3 1/2
miles (5.5 km) underground in one of the Southern Hemisphere's
deepest cave systems.
	   It will take two doctors who are joining the rescue more than a
day just to reach the man.
	   Authorities first received word on Thursday, a day after Kieran
McKay slipped from a descent rope and fell 50 feet (15 meters) down
a rock face to the floor below.
	   A doctor and initial rescue team entered the Bulmer cave system
near Murchison, New Zealand, 125 miles (200 km) south of the
capital, Wellington, on Thursday night, New Year's Eve.
	   Police said it could be days before rescuers can bring
experienced spelunker McKay, 30, back to the surface.
	   ``If you measure the distance out and crawl on your hands and
knees for that far under a line of cars, that's what we're up
against,'' said Senior Constable John Haynes, the police spokesman.
	   ``The rescue could take anything between two and four days.''
	   Experienced spelunker from throughout New Zealand were being
rushed to the remote area for the deepest rescue effort made here.
	   McKay was with a team of 11 others mapping an unexplored section
of the Bulmer caves when the fall occurred.
	   The cave system, only discovered in 1985, has been mapped for
more than 25 miles (40km) and is the second-deepest known system in
the Southern Hemisphere with depths up to 2,600 feet (800 meters).
	   The first rescue team reached McKay on Friday, Haynes said.
	   He said McKay was conscious and ``quite chirpy. They're a tough
bunch, these cavers.''
	   Rescue training in the Bulmer caves early in 1998 had been so
difficult the ``patient'' had to get off his stretcher and climb a
140 foot (43-meter) cliff on his own after rescuers decided
carrying him up it was too dangerous.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ For 11 European nations, the New Year
ushered in the era of the euro, a single currency that promises to
link the continent's economic fortunes and bolster hopes for
political unity.
	   Finance ministers from the euro nations popped champagne corks
shaped in the euro's ``e'' symbol Thursday, setting off a frantic
weekend for financial workers who are adapting computer systems and
convert stocks, bonds and bank accounts into euros.
	   At the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve in Brussels, after
years of preparation, the euro became the common currency of
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria,
Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg.
	   Austrian newspapers bannered the euro story on front pages
Friday, with the daily Neue Kronen Zeitung proclaiming ``Welcome to
Euro-Land!''
	   Throughout Europe, the event was hailed as a historic turning
point, creating a powerful new force in the world economy and
fulfilling the post-war dreams of union among nations whose
divisions twice this century dragged the planet into its bloodiest
wars.
	   ``If the postwar era ended nine years ago with the fall of the
Berlin Wall, then our future begins on Jan. 1, 1999,'' German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wrote in the Handelsblatt business
daily.
	   Britain is staying out for the moment, but the Labor government
hopes to convince voters to join as soon as next decade. Denmark
and Greece are also hoping to join within the next few years.
	   The new currency is worth 1.95583 German marks, 6.55957 French
francs, 1936.27 Italian lire, 166.386 Spanish pesetas. When markets
open after the long holiday weekend, the euro is expected to start
trading at about dlrs 1.1665, 133 Japanese yen and 70 British
pence.
	   Although euro notes and coins won't be issued to replace Irish
pounds, Portuguese escudos, Austrian schillings and the rest until
2002, the new currency will immediately come into use for non-cash
transactions ranging from government bond issues to credit card and
check purchases. Euro figures will also appear alongside national
currencies on pay checks, phone bills and bank statements.
	   France printed its first postage stamp denominated in euros on
Thursday. The new stamp is worth 3 francs or .46 euros.
	   From Thursday, francs, marks and the rest will no longer be
traded in foreign exchange markets. Equities and bonds will be
quoted in euros. Bank transfers and business deals will
increasingly be in the new money.
	   Participating nations say all that will give a boost to business
by creating a seamless market of 292 million citizens where
companies can operate without exchange costs or currency jitters.
	   Representing 20 percent of world economic output and 18 percent
of world trade, the euro-zone will be a powerful player in the
world economy. For the first time in decades, the U.S. dollar will
have a rival as the currency of choice for world trade and
government reserves.
	   ``The euro becomes the strong arm of the strongest economic
region of the world,'' Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said in
Vienna.
	   Euroland governments stressed the currency was about more than
just economics.
	   ``From Lisbon to Helsinki, from Paris to Vienna, the euro is a
remarkable symbol of our common identity,'' said French Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
	   ``Europe is finishing the century by sending a message of
peace,'' said Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi. ``The
conflicts that have so often gripped our continent are a thing of
the past.''
	   The latest EU polls published in September showed that 66
percent of citizens in the euro-zone support the common currency.
	   ``This is a good moment, the future is with the euro,'' teacher
Blandine Barnier said in the French city of Lyon. ``The children
are really aware of the euro, they travel a lot around Europe and
know what it's about.''
	   Ministers stressed that the currency union needed to be backed
up quickly with progress to increase European cooperation in fields
such as foreign affairs and defense.
	   Such talk of closer political integration will fuel euro-skeptic
opinion in those countries that have stayed out of the monetary
union through fears of losing national independence.
	   ``Britain must stay clear of this great fiasco,'' said Teddy
Taylor, a veteran lawmaker with Britain's opposition Conservative
Party.
	   Just hours before the euro's launch, German Finance Minister
Oskar Lafontaine applauded the interest rate cuts in early December
by all the countries joining the euro, and repeated his support of
further interest reductions by the European Central Bank.

	   EL PASO, Texas (AP) _ Texas Christian University's comeback
season ended like it started _ with a good day of bowling.
	   The Horned Frogs, who during spring practice used an outing to a
Texas bowling alley to get better acquainted with first-year coach
Dennis Franchione, captured their first bowl victory in 41 years
Thursday with a 28-19 victory over Southern Cal in the Sun Bowl.
	   Tailback Basil Mitchell ran for 185 yards and two touchdowns and
the Horned Frogs held the Trojans (8-5) to a Sun Bowl-record
minus-23 yards to produce another upset in the 1998 bowl lineup.
	   ``It's a big day for us. You couldn't buy what happened for us
today,'' said Franchione, who last December took over a TCU program
that fired Pat Sullivan after a 1-10 season.
	   TCU's option offense and its defense buried the Trojans early,
producing a 28-3 lead early in the third quarter. Forced to the
air, USC struck back with 17 straight points before TCU's defense
killed a Trojans drive and seized momentum.
	   ``We had to get away from the running game because we got behind
so quickly,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``TCU's speed and
agility on defense really surprised us.''
	   TCU, 6-5 during the regular season and no better than a .500
team in the Mountain Division of the Western Athletic Conference,
scored on its first three possessions.
	   ``It doesn't matter what conference you play in,'' said
Mitchell, who ran for 1,100 yards during the season. ``You have to
come out here and play. I knew we could move the ball, but I didn't
know we could do it that way.''
	   The Sun Bowl victory climaxed the Horned Frogs' impressive
turnaround under Franchione, who last year led New Mexico to its
first bowl game in 36 years. He worked the same magic in Fort Worth
and led the Horned Frogs to their first bowl victory since beating
Syracuse 28-27 in the 1957 Cotton Bowl.

Report Drifters lead singer Johnny Moore dies at 64
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Johnny Moore, lead singer of the American pop
group The Drifters in the 1960s, has died in London, news reports
said Friday. He was 64.
	   Moore, whose high tenor voice was heard most famously in ``Under
the Boardwalk,'' had moved to England after the group had a string
of hits in Britain in the mid-1970s, The Daily Telegraph said.
	   He died Wednesday while on his way to a hospital in London, The
Guardian reported. No cause of death was given.
	   The Drifters were formed in 1953 and still tour, but there have
been a number of changes in the composition of the group.
	   John Darrel Moore, born in Selma, Alabama, joined in November
1954, a year after the group was formed around the tenor vocals of
Clyde McPhatter. McPhatter was drafted in 1954 and Moore won a
place in the band.
	   ``Steamboat'' was one of their 1950s hits.
	   In 1958, after growing tension between manager George Treadwell
and the band, Treadwell fired them all and hired another group to
be The Drifters.
	   In 1961, after a stint of military service, Moore was invited to
rejoin The Drifters.
	   At the time, Rudy Lewis was lead singer, and Moore sang with him
on ``Sweets for the Sweet,'' ``Up on The Roof'' and ``On Broaway.''
	   When Lewis died in 1964, Moore became lead singer with ``Under
the Boardwalk,'' the group's last Top Ten hit.
	   When their American success declined in the 1970s, The Drifters
found popularity in Britain. Among their hits from 1973 to 1976
were ``Kissing in the Back Row of the Movies,'' and ``You're More
than a Number in My Little Red Book.''
	   Moore married and settled in Britain. He is survived by his
wife, Jennifer, and three sons.
	   Funeral plans were not announced.

Iraqi families struggling to make ends meet despite sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Two weeks remain before her next rations,
and Ceceel George is struggling to find a way to feed the nine
hungry mouths in her house. Her flour has run out and, in four
days, so will her rice.
	   Food that Iraq has bought under a U.N. program has eased the
hardship of eight years of trade sanctions imposed after Baghdad's
1990 invasion of Kuwait. But Iraqis like the George family say it
does not meet their basic needs.
	   Iraq has not committed itself to renewing the oil-for-food
program, which provides flour, rice, lentils, soap and other
basics. The current phase of the program runs out in mid-May, and
Iraq has argued that the subsistence-level arrangement only delays
the lifting of sanctions.
	   But residents say any end to the U.N. program would send food
prices soaring and further squeeze families. ``We would suffer
more,'' said George's daughter Jenan, a clerk in a government
ministry. ``There would be less cooking oil, less macaroni and less
soap.''
	   The family cut back on luxuries like tomato juice and chocolate
years ago.
	   The importance to Iraq of the oil-for-food program was
highlighted earlier this month, when U.S. and British warplanes and
missiles pounded the country. Despite the bombardment, Iraq never
stopped pumping the oil that is sold to buy food and medicine for
the program.
	   ``It seems that no matter what happens ... the oil is still
going and going strongly,'' said George Somerwill, spokesman for
the U.N. humanitarian program in Baghdad.
	   Diplomats say it is unlikely Iraq would end the program without
an easing of the sanctions.
	   The U.S. and Britain began the airstrikes after U.N. weapons
inspectors said Baghdad had repeatedly blocked their work. U.N.
resolutions say the sanctions cannot be lifted until the inspectors
certify that Baghdad is free of weapons of mass destruction.
	   The airstrikes destroyed a warehouse filled with 2,600 tons of
rice in Tikrit, President Saddam Hussein's hometown, but Somerwill
says there has been no noticeable change in the program's
functioning.
	   The United Nations says Iraq cooperates with its observers, who
check to be sure the government is not tampering with the food
imports. ``Food distribution is extremely smooth,'' Somerwill said.
	   On the 15th of each month, the Georges pick up their rations
from a government-appointed distribution agent in their
neighborhood of Baghdad Jedida. The family pays 100 dinars (five
cents) for each member's ration.
	   ``All of the items are not enough,'' Ceceel George said.
	   The government began its own program of subsidized food in 1990
in response to the sanctions. But the Iraqi rations fell short and
rates of child malnutrition and curable disease began to climb as
sanctions reduced this once-rich land to poverty.
	   In December 1996, the U.N. program began supplementing the
government rations, arresting much of the deterioration in health
care and making life easier for the middle class. However, a
quarter of Iraqi children younger than 5 still are malnourished,
Somerwill said.
	   Urban water remains tainted in many areas and medical supplies
in central and southern Iraq cannot be delivered because of a
shortage of trucks, he added.
	   The latest six-month phase of the U.N. program allows Iraq to
sell dlrs 5.2 billion in oil to buy food, medicine, and
humanitarian goods. A third of that money goes to pay for U.N.
programs in Iraq and to compensate victims of the invasion of
Kuwait.
	   But Iraq's run-down oil industry managed to pump only dlrs 3
billion worth of oil during the last phase. It is expected to come
up short again during the current phase.
	   For Iraqis, that means an expected boost in food rations may not
materialize.
	   Each month, the George family pools its money to try to make
ends meet after rations are exhausted. Ceceel George's five
children together earn about 150,000 dinars (dlrs 80) a month _
when they all have work. Her husband, Emmanuel, an electrician,
retired last year after a stroke.
	   ``If someone gets sick, it's a problem,'' her son, Luwai, said.
He lives with the family in their three-bedroom, cinderblock home
along with his wife and 1-year-old daughter, Carmen.
	   Asked whether the money was adequate, Jenan George said: ``It's
enough to buy food.''
	   But, she pointed out, with chicken costing 1,900 dinars a
kilogram (48 cents a pound) and rice at 350 dinars a kilogram (9
cents a pound), the money goes quickly for a family of nine.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ This time, it was Georgia that finished off a
thrilling Peach Bowl comeback.
	   Quincy Carter accounted for three touchdowns and Olandis Gary
ran for 110 yards and two scores as the No. 19 Bulldogs rallied
from a 21-0 deficit, then held on to beat No. 13 Virginia 35-33
Thursday night.
	   The Cavaliers (9-3) made a thrilling comeback of their own after
Georgia (9-3) went ahead 35-27 on Carter's 1-yard sneak for a
touchdown with 7:01 remaining.
	   Aaron Brooks threw an interception in the end zone with just
over four minutes to go, but Virginia got the ball back and Brooks
broke loose for a 30-yard scoring run with 1:34 to go.
	   On the 2-point attempt, Brooks escaped heavy pressure but his
pass at the goal line for Terrence Wilkins was batted down by Jeff
Harris.
	   The Cavaliers weren't through. Devon Simmons recovered an onside
kick at the Virginia 47 and Jones moved his team into field goal
range with a 26-yard run. Todd Braverman, who earlier had missed a
critical extra point, attempted to win the game with a 48-yard
kick.
	   But it hooked just wide of the upright with 19 seconds to go.
	   In the 1995 Peach Bowl, Georgia bounced back from a 24-6 deficit
against the Cavaliers, tying the game at 27 with just over a minute
remaining. But Petey Allen returned the ensuing kickoff 83 yards
for a touchdown and a 34-27 victory for Virginia.
	   This marked the 15th year in a row the Peach Bowl was decided by
seven points or less.

India wants a winning start to 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Although 1-0 down and beset with
problems, Indian skipper Mohammed Azharuddin is convinced his side
can turn the tables on New Zealand in the third and final cricket
test beginning Saturday.
	   India is tagged as a team that can't win tests outside the
subcontinent, and Azharuddin wants to put that notion to rest at
least by leveling the three-match series with a win.
	   ``This series is reasonably within our hands,'' Azharuddin said
Friday. ``We can't win it, but at least we can square it.''
	   India squandered a great opportunity in the second test and was
eventually beaten by a rejuvenated New Zealand team by four
wickets.
	   ``It is our bowling and fielding. And if we get things together
here I think we can look forward to a promising 1999,'' Azharuddin
added.
	   ``The only way we could do it is by reflecting on the positives
in the last test and play this as a separate one.''
	   Azharuddin is looking for a team performance.
	   ``I think confidence-wise individuals might be a bit low, but I
think mentally everybody realizes that we've got to be together and
we've got to try to win this test match,'' he said.
	   ``I'd like to get the monkey off our back with a win here. A win
outside India is long overdue.''
	   India's main area of concern is the fielding and bowling _ to
support match-winners like medium paceman Javagal Srinath and leg
spinner Anil Kumble.
	   Coach Aunshuman Gaekwad said his fielders had a ``bad one'' in
the second test, dropping as many as seven catches.
	   ``We are not that bad a fielding side,'' said Gaekwad. ``We
normally don't drop that many catches and misfield. It hasn't
happened before and it will not happen in the future.''
	   ``From the time I took over the boys have fielded brilliantly at
times, like any other international sides.''
	   New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming expects India to come back
strongly and said his side will have to play better to carry on
with the good win in Wellington.
	   ``It is a new test and they are a very good side and will come
back strongly,'' said Fleming. ``We will have to play better to
stop them.''
	   Both teams have put off naming the side until a final look at
the relaid strip that sports a fair tinge of green and is expected
to suit the seamers.
	   India will decide between left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi and
Debashish Mohanty while New Zealand will weigh its options between
off spinner Paul Wiseman and left-arm seamer Geoff Allott.
	   Teams:
	   NEW ZEALAND (from): Stephen Fleming (captain), Matthew Bell,
Matthew Horne, Roger Twose, Craig McMillan, Adam Parore, Chris
Cairns, Dion Nash, Daniel Vettori, Simon Doull, Paul Wiseman and
Geoff Allott.
	   INDIA (from): Mohammed Azharuddin (captain), Navjot Sidhu, Ajay
Jadeja, Rahul Dravid, Saurav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Nayan
Mongia, Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Sunil
Joshi, Debashish Mohanty and Harbhajan Singh.
	   Umpire: Doug Cowie (New Zealand) and Rudy Koertzen (South
Africa). TV umpire: Brent Bowden.
	   Match referee: Barry Jarman (Australia).

Gulf's changes reflected in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY332 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The women are draped in exquisite green,
red or purple silk robes, their sleeves and bodices embroidered
with gold. In their braided hair are garlands of flowers.
	   Nearby, men in traditional dishdashas are hard at work _
tinsmiths and tailors, fishermen and pearl divers.
	   In these scenes at the Bahrain National Museum, the costumed
mannequins portray an idealized past when most people in this Gulf
nation made their living from farms or from the sea and typically
ate a diet of dates, rice and fish.
	   Stepping outside into a city of international banks, high-rise
buildings and Western fast-food restaurants, it's startling to see
how much _ and how quickly _ life has changed in Bahrain and other
gulf states.
	   A new world was made by oil, which pumped big money into
Bahrain's economy, and now it is being remade as the oil runs out.
But it's not yet 70 years since Bahrain became the first Arab gulf
state where oil was discovered in commercial quantities.
	   Oil production came later to other Gulf countries _ in the late
1930s in Saudi Arabia, the '40s in Kuwait, and the '60s, '70s and
even '80s in some of the tiny states of the United Arab Emirates.
	   In the region's deserts, the influx of oil money ended the
trading caravans of thousands of camels and the tradition of
``ghazu,'' or tribal raiding. In Bahrain, a small island nation,
the simple seashore life disappeared.
	   Pearling was dying as Bahrain's economic mainstay _ killed by
Japanese cultured pearls _ even before the discovery of oil. Now,
there are precious few pearl divers and builders of dhows, the
wooden sailboats of the gulf.
	   ``People rarely do the kind of things their ancestors did,''
said Essa Amin, president of Bahrain's Historical and
Archaeological Society. ``Someone whose ancestor was a farmer,
fisherman or a pearl merchant is now a businessman, banker, doctor
or an engineer.''
	   The change brought by oil money can be seen everywhere.
	   Until the 1950s, donkeys were used to haul up water from wells;
it now is pumped from desalination plants.
	   Graceful old Bahraini houses had tall wind towers that drew cool
ocean breezes inside. Today, most homes are air-conditioned, and
shoppers go to vast, icy-cool malls instead of the old downtown
souk, or marketplace.
	   The souk still exists _ with its gold, bolts of fabric and
delicious smell of spices _ but now it also offers Cokes,
battery-operated Japanese toy cars and goods from almost
everywhere.
	   Amin notes another change from the days when Bahraini men all
wore dishdashas and women draped themselves in the robe-like
``aba'' on the street.
	   ``These days, most of those Bahraini women who wear abas ...
wear Western outfits like tight-fitting jeans or short skirts
underneath,'' he said.
	   For men, typical dress can be jeans when going out to the
Mexican restaurant or a three-piece suit for work.
	   The business suit signals another new world for Bahrain and the
gulf.
	   As it led the way with oil, Bahrain is ahead in facing the day
when oil runs out. Its reserves are expected to dry up by 2000, and
it has become a leading center for banking and finance.
	   The change is not without its problems for the region.
	   In Kuwait, people are resisting a dismantling of the
cradle-to-grave welfare system financed by oil. In Bahrain, the
government has had to come up with training programs to give its
young people skills for the new business and service economy.
	   At 85, businessman Rashid al-Zayani has a foot in both the old
and new Bahrain.
	   His commercial empire includes banking, a car dealership,
plastics and high-tension cables. He won't reveal his net worth but
recalls his first job in the 1930s paid the equivalent of dlrs 13 a
month, ``a good salary in the old days.''
	   ``People are more educated and earn much better salaries than in
the past,'' he said, sitting in his air-conditioned office.
	   On the wall are photos showing the span of his life. Recent
color shots show him in a tuxedo. In an old, black-and-white
picture, he is starting school at age 4 in traditional robe and
headdress, standing with the Egyptian headmaster who opened the
first modern school in Bahrain, then a British protectorate. The
year was 1917.
	   ``The society is rapidly changing,'' said Amin, the historian.
``But the future looks definitely brighter.''

	   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia (AP) _ Buffeted by 40-knot (75-kph)
winds, the U.S.-Australian team making the latest bid to be the
first to fly around the world in a balloon canceled some equipment
tests Friday.
	   In last minute tests ahead of Saturday's scheduled launch,
engineers planned to bring the spaceship-like crew's capsule out of
its hanger and fit it with solar panels, which will provide power
to run life support and other systems during the flight.
	   But mission control director Dan Pedersen canceled the operation
because of concerns about dust being blown up from the desert
launch zone.
	   ``We don't want the gondola to get blown around,'' said
Pedersen.
	   Strong winds and equipment problems have twice delayed the
launch.
	   At another hanger at mission control _ a collection of tin sheds
near the central Australian town of Alice Springs _ pilot Bob
Martin worked with team members on the harness systems joining the
capsule, which will carry the three crew members, to the huge
balloon and a parachute.
	   Playing a waiting game with the weather, team members were also
considering a ``live-firing'' test of the explosive bolts that are
designed to cut the capsule free of the balloon in an emergency.
	   ``We definitely could have gone this morning,'' said Pedersen, a
former U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot.
	   ``But we can't control the weather.''
	   The team's own forecaster will brief Pedersen and pilots Martin,
Denver real estate magnate Dave Liniger and Australian balloonist
John Wallington later Friday on the latest weather conditions.
	   The team will make a decision then whether to start the more
than 12-hour countdown clock for the new scheduled launch time of 5
a.m. Saturday, Jan. 2 local time (1930 Jan. 1 GMT).
	   Pedersen canceled Thursday's launch after the team decided winds
forecast for New Year's Day were too strong at 900 ft. _ the height
reached by the top of the balloon as it fills with helium.
	   Liniger said he and his copilots are anxious to get off the
ground.
	   ``We want to go,'' Liniger said. ``It's possible that the longer
we wait, the worse the weather will get, and we will end up wasting
millions of dollars and a lot of people's time.''
	   Weather conditions give the Re/Max International team a window
for take off that lasts until mid-January.
	   After that, the high altitude winds now blowing east to west
will shift direction until next December.
	   The team expects to succeed where other around-the-world balloon
attempts have failed by rising to the edge of the atmosphere and
harnessing those winds on a route that almost exactly follows the
Tropic of Capricorn.
	   The pilots will hang below a balloon made of lunch-wrap-thin
polyethylene plastic in a 7-feet-by-8-feet (2.1-meter-by-2.4-meter)
capsule packed with life-support systems, scientific equipment,
food, waste disposal units and cameras and communications gear.
	   When fully inflated, the balloon is 460 feet (138 meters) in
diameter and 700 feet (210 meters) high _ large enough to envelope
the Houston Astrodome or two 747 jet liners nose-to-nose.
	   It will rise 1,000 feet (300 meters) a minute during takeoff
until it reaches the stratosphere and a cruising altitude of about
24 miles (39 kilometers) above sea level.
	   That's higher than any previous manned balloon flight.
	   The pilots will wear Russian-built space suits during parts of
the journey, where the atmosphere outside will be less than 1
percent of that at sea level.

Japanese divorce rate tops France's
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A record number of Japanese married couples called
it quits in 1998, according to a government report that showed
divorce rates here catching up with those in the West.
	   There were an estimated 243,000 divorces in Japan last year,
almost 10 percent more than the year before and the largest number
since officials started keeping records a century ago, the Health
and Welfare Ministry said in a report released Thursday.
	   One couple was divorced about every two minutes, the report
said.
	   Japan's divorce rate rose to 1.94 per every 1,000 people,
pushing it above France's rate of 1.90 and close to Germany's 2.07,
according to the report. The United States still has the highest
divorce rate among major nations with 4.44 per 1,000.
	   The report expressed alarm that Japan's divorce rate had
quadrupled since World War II, bringing it up to the levels of
Western countries.
	   Japanese politicians in the past have viewed the trend with
alarm, calling Japan's traditionally cohesive families the key to
the country's low crime rates and high levels of education.

Japan's central bank investigated for tax evasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo tax authorities have begun quietly
investigating Japan's central bank on suspicion top bank officials
may have evaded paying their income taxes, a newspaper said Friday.
	   Agents from the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau are looking for
evidence Bank of Japan officials neglected to pay taxes on such
perks as company-subsidized mansions and country club memberships,
the Asahi newspaper reported.
	   The bureau wants to determine whether these should have been
declared as income for tax purposes, the paper said.
	   Officials at the bank and tax bureau could not be reached for
comment due to the New Year's holiday.
	   A tax audit of the central bank of a major industrial nation is
unprecedented, the report said. It further tarnishes the bank's
reputation, which was blemished last year by the arrest of an
official on charges of leaking information in exchange for lavish
entertainment.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The world offered a high-spirited welcome to the
last year of the second millennium, with fireworks in Scotland,
pilgrimages to shrines and temples in Asia, and throngs of revelers
in New York's Times Square
	   Pope John Paul II reminded Roman Catholics to prepare for
Christianity's millennium jubilee only a year away. And in many
countries, leaders spoke to their countrymen and women of hope for
a better future.
	   Fireworks soared above the cheering crowds in Moscow's Red
Square, where lights played on the Kremlin and the famous onion
domes of St. Basil's Cathedral, and Russians and foreign visitors
welcomed 1999 to the accompaniment of popping champagne corks.
	   At Times Square, New York's own traditional gathering place,
thousands upon thousands of people _ bundled in layers of clothing,
blankets and thermal wraps _ gathered to ring in the New Year in
20-degree (-6-Celsius) weather that felt more like sub-zero with
the wind chill.
	   A wall of people lined the avenue 30 deep for more than 10
blocks. Spectators will be treated to a 16-foot-(5-meter)-tall
roving Father Time puppet, a 15,000-balloon release and a spotlight
said to be visible from Mars.
	   The New Year's Eve ball, of course, will be the main attraction,
making its last descent down One Times Square before it is replaced
by a Waterford Crystal-made successor next December. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, paralyzed in a fall at the
Goodwill Games, will press the button that starts the drop.
	   Earlier in Paris, thousands of Parisians thronged the Champs
Elysees under trees decked with white lights.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, where New Year's is called Hogmany, the
biggest celebration of the year, bands played in the park and
fireworks filled the sky over Edinburgh castle with colored lights.
	   In London, tens of thousands of revelers jammed Trafalgar Square
and cheered wildly as Big Ben rang out 1998. Police have been
trying to discourage the traditional gathering of thousands there,
because of the potential for injuries in such large, boisterous
crowds. But thousands of the most ebullient crowded into the square
nonetheless.
	   An open air party at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate offered about 100
entertainers and a midnight fireworks show.
	   Things were a little quieter in Frankfurt, headquarters of the
new European Central Bank, which will set monetary policy from the
stroke of midnight for 11 nations sharing a single currency. Late
into the eveningm, lights shone from the windows of bank
skyscrapers as employees worked to refigure computer records, but
firecrackers popped and fizzed in the streets.
	   In most Arab countries, New Year celebrations were subdued this
year because the event coincided with the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan _ a period when governments close nightclubs and impose
strict rules on serving alcohol.
	   There were no street decorations or lighting in the major cities
and restaurants and hotels could not lay on special festivities.
	   But many Arabs invited friends and relatives to private parties
in their homes.
	   In Cairo, the big hotels adorned the faces of their buildings
with lights strung in the shape of a Ramadan lantern. Pleasure
boats decked with gaudy lights cruised the Nile, their speakers
blaring out Arab songs, but this had more to do with Thursday's
being the end of the week than with New Year's.
	   In Iran, where the New Year is celebrated about March 21,
President Mohammad Khatami sent a traditional greeting to the
Christian world.
	   Khatami said people everywhere should interpret the teachings of
Jesus Christ ``with emphasis on compassion for fellow human beings,
respecting others, dialogue with the opposition, tolerance and
detente towards others,'' the official Islamic News Agency
reported.
	   ``I hope the year 1999, which is a link between the two
millenniums, will be a year filled with blessings, peace,
cordiality and love among men,'' the president said, according to a
British Broadcasting Corp. translation received in Cairo.
	   In taped messages, other world leaders urged their peoples to
end sectarian strike, and to have hope in the future.
	   In his last New Year's message before leaving office, President
Nelson Mandela on Thursday challenged South Africans to continue
working together to solve the problems of poverty and corruption,
legacies of the apartheid decades.
	   ``The New Year will bring many changes,'' Mandela said in the
broadcast message. ``They will depend on our working together to
realize our dream.''
	   Russia's President Boris Yeltsin called on Russians to meet 1999
with optimism and pride in their country.
	   ``What can I say: The year was difficult for the country, for
many of you, and for me, too. But New Year's Eve is always about
new hopes, new dreams, new plans,'' Yeltsin said, according to a
transcript released by the Interfax news agency.
	   In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern spoke of the Good
Friday peace agreement in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   ``The fantastic support of people .. for an agreed Ireland of
dialogue, mutual respect and common endeavor is the surest
guarantee yet that we will succeed in making this an island of
peace and prosperity for all - especially for our children,'' Ahern
said.
	   In Singapore, a crowd of more than 20,000 gathered around the
Fountain of Wealth, which shot water jets 30 meters (90 feet) into
the air as lasers flashed a countdown against a nearby skyscraper
at the Suntec City shopping mall and convention center.
	   Some young Singaporeans jumped into the water ``to shower
themselves with wealth,'' government television reported. Singapore
fell into recession as 1998 ended, and many residents exprssed New
year's hopes of ``more money'' in the next year, as well as ''
world peace.''

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Curtis Joseph made 36 saves and Mats Sundin had
two assists as the Toronto Maple Leafs beat Detroit 4-2 Thursday
night, extending the Red Wings' winless streak to seven games.
	   Igor Korolev, Steve Thomas, Fredrik Modin and Derek King scored
goals for the Maple Leafs, who moved a point ahead of idle Buffalo
atop the Northeast Division. Toronto, which won all three of its
games against the Red Wings this season, is 12-5 in its last 17
games.
	   Martin Lapointe and Darren McCarty scored for the Red Wings, who
closed out a 4-7-2 December. The seven-game winless streak is
Detroit's longest since a seven-game losing streak in January
1991.
 &UR; Stars 6, Bruins 1 &QC; 
	   At Dallas, Pat Verbeek scored two goals and Mike Keane got the
tiebreaker early in the second period as the Dallas extended its
unbeaten string to a franchise-record 13 games.
	   Keane snapped a 1-1 tie and Sergei Zubov extended the lead to
3-1 late in the second period to help the Stars extend their
unbeaten run to 10-0-3. The previous club record was a 9-0-3 streak
by the Minnesota North Stars in 1982.
	   Ray Bourque notched his 379th career goal for Boston's only
score. The Bruins are 1-4 in their last five games and haven't won
in Dallas since Feb. 16, 1994.
 &UR; Blackhawks 1, Islanders 0 &QC; 
	   At Chicago, Bob Probert scored his second goal of the season and
Jocelyn Thibault stopped 28 shots for his first shutout with
Chicago.
	   The Islanders, blanked for a second straight game, have lost
three in a row. Chicago's victory was just its second in the last
eight games.
	   Probert chased down a rebound off a shot from newly acquired
Nelson Emerson and his follow from the goal line deflected off
Marcel Cousineau's skate and into the net with 2:40 left in the
second.
 &UR; Canadiens 2, Flames 1 &QC; 
	   At Calgary, Alberta, Montreal defenseman Eric Weinrich scored
